 well know everyone has united 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.930
 I hope you are well 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.199

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.109
 new tutorial so this tutorial knows how 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.170

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.500
 with the live gamer portal 2 servers 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.699
 media 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.040
 so it's very very simple for this 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.010
 manipulation you will need two 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.810
 hdmi cables which is located which is 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.120
 sit there excuse me for the brothel there 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.310
 it's a bit of anything so you 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.730
 have one supplied with xbox one and 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.090
 you should get another one 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:53.260
 so I 'll take the course right this is a 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:58.320
 little shocking i'm sorry so so 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:03.299

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.470
 you are already connected to your usb cable 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:10.870
 to your computer 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:22.410
 here are you going to plug 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:22.410

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.500

 like that I get there never gets to 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.030
 to do quite a bit of a weird thing then 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.540
 so you plugged in out 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.270
 so I plug it in will be out so here 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.750
 once these beggars to high 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:56.490
 you will take the other end and the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.840
 plug on your TV so here I am 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.979
 am going to put kind I have a little bit the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.700
 cables behind up and I'm going to move 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.160
 my tv so there trust me I the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.860
 branch in hdmi finally if I already arrive 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.860
 it's hot gold is the galley 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.550
 I hope you see at least because 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:24.090
 that you do not do it for nothing good we get 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.020
 find right after that so I managed 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.670
 to connect my years I avermedia 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.530
 recalls in on TV once 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.550
 this is done you will take your 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.800
 second hdmi cable 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.560
 that is provided by xbox there is so 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:50.030
 I still read a hdmi cable 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:51.770
 so you plugged in out here ott 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.260
 if you roll next to the socket 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.620
 feeding so that's fine 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.380
 buried yeah I looked if the xbox 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:07.040
 is off volume and so then you 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:12.319
 have plugged your furniture your thing to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.350
 the war in on your live gamer 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.530
 laptop from home around noon then 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.780
 this time it will be a little easier 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.480
 here are you years you check well that 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.670
 you check well that everything is fine 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.830
 depressed and after it's gone 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.140
 so we'll be right back 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.970
 settings and settings me I range 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:39.530
 is a little bit of that because it's 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:41.660
 a bit of a hassle at 2.8 people relay so 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.850
 we will meet for the parameters 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.640
 and settings you tell me it's the same 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.640
 thing so you're going to click on 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.989
 the avermedia software so if you do not 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.730
 have not judgment would put him in the 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.000
 description 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.880
 then we will go to create a profile of 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.630
 configuration you will do 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.740
 as soon as I find crazy profile 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.350
 normally it's fake profiles if 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.870
 you did not do anything pro and we will do 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.480
 all this together so you'll put 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.340
 source are you going to choose the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.440
 game platform already so you go 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.860
 take game consoles in his video 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.300
 you will take hdmi and audio source 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.920
 hdmi too for the microphone you do 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.950
 as you want if you want 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.360
 record with the microphone in b3 files 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.060
 or not that's how you want 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.580
 you choose the sound of the game they 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:43.880
 be not too strong gigota -2 because 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:46.940
 here you shut up then I 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.550
 would take mp4 because sony vegas do not 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.350
 not take tf1 does not detect the sound 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.560
 then for the resolution you chose 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.330
 the highest for 1080p you in 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.170
 betrayed video you but leave you 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.210
 20000 mbps 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:09.830
 then in glass and audios will make you 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:15.710
 from the most the one that is the most 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:19.040
 down the 256 kbps and in framerate so 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.280
 the frames per second the fps of which 30 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.590
 since I have France if you have 60 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.940
 and they too if you are an editor and 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.490
 you like qwikster well-founded and 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.860
 everything is better to fart the 30 the 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.680
 60 excuse me and then 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.569
 that's pretty much everything so after that it's 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.599
 left 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:43.430
 so we do ok products back up 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:46.729
 and normally if I turn on my xbox that's it 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.180
 you heard we're going to wait for a 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.669
 a bit 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.990
 so that's it starts and you can 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.400
 see that it works 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.990
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.699
 will have rained were not reached the 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:02.949
