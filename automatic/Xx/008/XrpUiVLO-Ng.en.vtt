00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.380 
the wheels this is what I want to make
really<00:04:01.620> cool<00:04:01.799> so<00:04:01.980> apparently<00:04:02.640> this<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.359> a

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
really cool so apparently this is a

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.449 
really cool so apparently this is a
sports<00:04:03.810> car<00:04:03.959> because<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.650> has<00:04:04.680> sport<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
sports car because it has sport is the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.729 
sports car because it has sport is the
default<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.569> I<00:04:06.930> don't<00:04:07.170> even<00:04:07.230> know<00:04:07.380> how<00:04:07.500> this<00:04:07.620> is

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
default so I don't even know how this is

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.860 
default so I don't even know how this is
a<00:04:07.769> sports<00:04:08.069> car<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.579> I'm<00:04:09.090> thinking<00:04:09.569> for<00:04:09.720> this

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
a sports car but I'm thinking for this

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.020 
a sports car but I'm thinking for this
car<00:04:10.079> lowrider<00:04:10.739> wheels<00:04:11.069> would<00:04:11.519> go<00:04:11.760> well<00:04:12.000> with

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
car lowrider wheels would go well with

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.030 
car lowrider wheels would go well with
this<00:04:12.690> car<00:04:12.989> um

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040

don't want the tires to be like as
bright<00:05:10.650> as<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.890> car<00:05:11.130> cuz<00:05:11.400> we<00:05:11.520> can<00:05:11.640> do<00:05:11.790> lime

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970
