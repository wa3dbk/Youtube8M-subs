so um this concealer comes in a couple
of<00:01:01.530> colors<00:01:01.710> obviously<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> medium

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470

this<00:01:04.470> will<00:01:04.949> work<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
this will work for I think more like a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.800 
this will work for I think more like a
honey<00:01:06.650> colored<00:01:07.650> skin<00:01:08.100> tone<00:01:08.600> maybe<00:01:09.600> not

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
honey colored skin tone maybe not

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.850 
honey colored skin tone maybe not
necessarily<00:01:09.930> somebody<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.590> an<00:01:10.710> olive

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
necessarily somebody with an olive

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.859 
necessarily somebody with an olive
undertone<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.549> more<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.450> golden<00:01:12.780> undertone

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
undertone I more of a golden undertone

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.139 
undertone I more of a golden undertone
and<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:14.939> for<00:01:15.090> about

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
and I think you can get this for about

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.060 
and I think you can get this for about
twenty<00:01:15.539> dollars<00:01:15.659> at<00:01:16.020> Ulta<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.740> bought<00:01:16.950> this

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.349 
from QVC but it comes from you can buy
it<00:01:19.979> from<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.280> variety<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.729> sources<00:01:20.909> for

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
it from a variety of sources for

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.169 
it from a variety of sources for
probably<00:01:21.749> two<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.640> first<00:01:23.850> thing<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
probably two so the first thing that

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:25.609 
probably two so the first thing that
I've<00:01:24.270> known<00:01:24.420> about<00:01:24.539> this<00:01:24.719> concealer<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.259> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
I've known about this concealer is that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.760 
I've known about this concealer is that
it's<00:01:25.799> really<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:27.149> has<00:01:27.390> almost<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.319> clay

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it's really it has almost like a clay

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.529 
it's really it has almost like a clay
consistency<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.789> it's<00:01:29.939> different<00:01:30.210> from<00:01:30.329> other

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
consistency so it's different from other

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.440 
consistency so it's different from other
concealers<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.289> that<00:01:31.859> it's<00:01:32.069> not<00:01:32.450> necessarily

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
concealers in that it's not necessarily

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.380 
concealers in that it's not necessarily
liquidy<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.469> very<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.219> it's<00:01:35.579> clay<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.119> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
liquidy it's very it's it's clay like so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
liquidy it's very it's it's clay like so
you're<00:01:36.749> gonna<00:01:36.929> get<00:01:37.109> really<00:01:37.499> opaque<00:01:37.979> maximum

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.190 
acne scarring there so I would suggest
that<00:01:58.740> first<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.159> put<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.959> really<00:02:00.959> light

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
that first you put on a really light

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.870 
that first you put on a really light
moisturizer<00:02:01.859> to<00:02:03.740> kind<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.799> balance<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> two

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
moisturizer to kind of balance the two

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.609 
moisturizer to kind of balance the two
consistencies<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.749> because<00:02:06.959> you<00:02:07.109> might<00:02:07.139> find

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
consistencies out because you might find

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.840 
consistencies out because you might find
that<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.950> tend<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.399> little<00:02:08.550> bit<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
that you tend to get a little bit of

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.900 
that you tend to get a little bit of
flakiness<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> tends<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.700> stick<00:02:11.700> to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
flakiness or that it tends to stick to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.240 
flakiness or that it tends to stick to
like<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> dry<00:02:12.300> skin<00:02:12.360> it'll<00:02:12.840> make<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.410> won't

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
like the dry skin it'll make it it won't

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.720 
like the dry skin it'll make it it won't
go<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.520> as<00:02:14.850> smoothly<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.340> I'm<00:02:17.340> going<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.610> just

under-eye concealer is always a great

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.520 
under-eye concealer is always a great
idea<00:03:31.300> so<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.920> will<00:03:33.160> literally<00:03:33.430> need<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
idea so you will literally need the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.350 
idea so you will literally need the
tiniest<00:03:35.980> amount<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.459> concealer<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.090> I

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
tiniest amount of this concealer and I

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.240 
tiniest amount of this concealer and I
and<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.900> for<00:03:38.230> somebody<00:03:38.380> who<00:03:38.590> like<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.010> said

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
and this is for somebody who like I said

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.100 
and this is for somebody who like I said
needs<00:03:39.640> more<00:03:39.910> coverage<00:03:40.090> so<00:03:40.390> if<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.870> can<00:03:41.019> see

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
needs more coverage so if you can see

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.300 
needs more coverage so if you can see
how<00:03:41.260> much<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.560> literally<00:03:41.800> have<00:03:41.890> taken<00:03:42.190> it's

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
how much you literally have taken it's

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.840 
how much you literally have taken it's
nothing<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.930> like<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:45.010> apply<00:03:45.400> my<00:03:45.430> concealer

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
nothing and I like to apply my concealer

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.460 
nothing and I like to apply my concealer
with<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.420> concealer<00:03:46.630> brush<00:03:46.959> because<00:03:47.200> it

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
with the concealer brush because it

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.770 
with the concealer brush because it
gives<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:47.860> can<00:03:48.100> work<00:03:48.670> at<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.630> you're

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
gives it you can work at it and you're

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.880

feather<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.410> said<00:03:50.470> because<00:03:50.739> then

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
feather and like I said because then

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.289 
feather and like I said because then
you're<00:03:50.980> not<00:03:51.040> using<00:03:51.280> your<00:03:51.489> fingertips<00:03:51.790> and

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
you're not using your fingertips and

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.690
