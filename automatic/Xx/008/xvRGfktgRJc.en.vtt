if<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.140> want<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> see<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.590> as<00:00:25.680> specifically

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
if you want to see that as specifically

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.730 
if you want to see that as specifically
but<00:00:27.210> eventually<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.289> does<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.619> makes

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
but eventually what it does is it makes

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.560 
but eventually what it does is it makes
the<00:00:28.980> whole<00:00:29.130> mode<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> lot<00:00:29.730> more<00:00:29.849> fun<00:00:30.090> because

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the whole mode a lot more fun because

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.519 
the whole mode a lot more fun because
when<00:00:30.720> you're<00:00:30.840> at<00:00:30.900> lower<00:00:31.080> overalls

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
when you're at lower overalls

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.650 
when you're at lower overalls
everybody's<00:00:32.489> more<00:00:32.700> viable<00:00:32.969> because<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.510> can

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
everybody's more viable because you can

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
everybody's more viable because you can
find<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> specific<00:00:34.020> place<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.680> them<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.280> not

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
find a specific place for them it's not

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.880 
find a specific place for them it's not
just<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.300> 99<00:00:36.780> god<00:00:37.050> card<00:00:37.380> then<00:00:37.680> it's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
just if it's not a 99 god card then it's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.610 
just if it's not a 99 god card then it's
unusable<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.730> if<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> free<00:00:40.230> card<00:00:40.500> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
unusable it's if the a free card is

do<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> ground-and-pound<00:01:02.340> chemistry<00:01:03.470> drinking

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
do a ground-and-pound chemistry drinking

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109 
do a ground-and-pound chemistry drinking
a<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.650> coffee<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.000> my

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
a lot of coffee because it's just got my

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.719 
a lot of coffee because it's just got my
game<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.229> here's<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.500> Kyle<00:01:07.680> Wilson<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.610> like

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
game and here's a Kyle Wilson I was like

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.510 
game and here's a Kyle Wilson I was like
2am<00:01:08.850> man<00:01:09.689> coverages<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.320> Kyle<00:01:10.830> also<00:01:11.130> good<00:01:11.369> for

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
2am man coverages and Kyle also good for

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.730 
2am man coverages and Kyle also good for
it<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.990> man<00:01:13.260> chemistry

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it I'm not going to do a man chemistry

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.710 
it I'm not going to do a man chemistry
though<00:01:14.030> I'm<00:01:15.030> probably<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.600> doing

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
though I'm probably going to be doing

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
though I'm probably going to be doing
pass<00:01:16.170> rush<00:01:16.380> chemistry<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.009> i<00:01:17.130> feel<00:01:17.340> like

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
pass rush chemistry because i feel like

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.710 
pass rush chemistry because i feel like
the<00:01:17.640> stopping<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> runs<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> little

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the stopping the runs can be a little

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.179 
the stopping the runs can be a little
more<00:01:18.840> important<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.259> year<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> run

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
more important this year with the run

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.890 
more important this year with the run
free<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.610> i<00:01:21.030> don't<00:01:21.180> want<00:01:21.299> my<00:01:21.390> opponents<00:01:21.810> to

free and i don't want my opponents to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.999 
free and i don't want my opponents to
clock<00:01:22.110> control<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.590> something<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> use

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
passwords chemistry we were the run

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320 
passwords chemistry we were the run
stuff<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.280> stopping<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> run<00:01:26.850> the

pass rush chemistry is going to be
significantly<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:29.310> important<00:01:30.119> because

defense<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.829> need<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:40.979> make<00:01:41.040> sure<00:01:41.159> that

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
defense so you need to make sure that

defense so you need to make sure that
you<00:01:41.490> commit<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.909> stopping<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> run<00:01:42.509> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
you commit to stopping the run and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
you commit to stopping the run and
that's<00:01:43.170> why<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.380> pass<00:01:43.890> rush<00:01:44.220> because<00:01:44.460> the

that's why I like pass rush because the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.940 
that's why I like pass rush because the
boost<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.240> give<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:46.229> help<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.619> run

it's<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.030> video<00:04:33.270> or<00:04:33.420> not<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.720> did<00:04:34.050> pull<00:04:34.230> Run

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
it's in this video or not I did pull Run

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.230 
it's in this video or not I did pull Run
DMC<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.010> I'm<00:04:35.400> really<00:04:35.520> excited<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:36.000> use<00:04:36.090> them

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
DMC and I'm really excited to use them

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.580 
DMC and I'm really excited to use them
because<00:04:36.300> even<00:04:36.600> though<00:04:36.690> I'm<00:04:36.780> using<00:04:37.020> ground<00:04:37.410> and

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
because even though I'm using ground and

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.430 
because even though I'm using ground and
pound<00:04:37.650> chemistry<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:38.390> don't<00:04:39.390> need<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.990> back<00:04:40.170> to

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
pound chemistry I don't need the back to

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.510 
pound chemistry I don't need the back to
do<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.800> because<00:04:41.040> he's<00:04:41.160> going<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.370> get<00:04:41.430> the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
do it because he's going to get the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.070 
do it because he's going to get the
ground<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:41.850> pound<00:04:41.940> TRUCKING<00:04:42.540> up<00:04:42.720> from<00:04:42.960> the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
ground and pound TRUCKING up from the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.170 
ground and pound TRUCKING up from the
chemistry<00:04:43.500> boost<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.220> can<00:04:44.490> use<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.670> different

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
chemistry boost so I can use a different

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.750 
chemistry boost so I can use a different
back<00:04:45.330> like<00:04:45.570> DMC<00:04:46.110> who<00:04:46.290> has<00:04:46.500> 80<00:04:46.890> trucking<00:04:47.430> but

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
back like DMC who has 80 trucking but

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.700 
back like DMC who has 80 trucking but
also<00:04:47.910> as<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.150> 96<00:04:48.600> speed<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.020> combined<00:04:49.680> with

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
also as the 96 speed and combined with

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.380 
also as the 96 speed and combined with
the<00:04:49.860> chemistry<00:04:50.100> boost<00:04:50.430> will<00:04:50.550> get<00:04:50.670> like<00:04:50.880> 99

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
the chemistry boost will get like 99

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.780 
the chemistry boost will get like 99
trucking<00:04:51.780> well<00:04:52.200> not<00:04:52.320> i<00:04:52.380> but<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.130> altie<00:04:53.640> why

very much on the edges so he's kind of
liability<00:07:09.120> but<00:07:09.360> you<00:07:09.420> have<00:07:09.540> to<00:07:09.660> game<00:07:10.020> plan

liability but you have to game plan
around<00:07:10.410> that<00:07:10.940> but<00:07:11.940> the<00:07:12.060> ability<00:07:12.240> for<00:07:12.480> him<00:07:12.810> to
