 under gast himself decides what he 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.899
 it perceives and what is not particularly 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.490
 For example, I like the 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.910
 Pencil sculptures in the Atlantic 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.950
 restaurant our a corrective the big one 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.840
 pink sunglasses on the sports 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.610
 tag is great for safe 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.149
 or for the look through the pink 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.149
 glasses 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.510

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.840
 Jonas Cats is a children's book author 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.369
 Illustrator and sculptor on 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.500
 different decks one can its 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.600
 well-known wooden figures with the thick ones 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.470
 bellies and expressive eyes 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.470
 Find 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.950
 these are basically the figures 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.630
 also passengers who ride here 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.510
 So I could imagine that too 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.700
 here a similar couple in nature 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.850
 stands and I look more closely here 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.660
 so they are totally untreated and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.170
 Now they do not even look relative 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.930
 fresh out so but i would like her 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.670
 sometimes in white she does not see ten years 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.130
 because then the shoulders become the heads 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.810
 polished so bright that I think that wants 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.090
 I have to be that 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:28.360
 they should be touched on everyone 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.580

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.800
