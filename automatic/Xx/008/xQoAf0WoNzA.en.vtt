attribute<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.869> does<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.229> mean<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.770> may<00:01:49.890> be

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
attribute so does this mean there may be

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920 
attribute so does this mean there may be
more<00:01:50.189> opportunities<00:01:50.460> or<00:01:51.119> ways<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.600> increase

your<00:01:52.049> special<00:01:52.619> stats<00:01:52.890> also<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.210> further<00:01:54.509> gives

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
your special stats also it further gives

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
your special stats also it further gives
the<00:01:54.899> idea<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:55.649> no<00:01:55.860> skills

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the idea that there are no skills

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.740 
the idea that there are no skills
because<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> character<00:01:57.119> would<00:01:57.240> focus<00:01:57.450> on

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
because a character would focus on

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.170 
because a character would focus on
leveling<00:01:58.380> their<00:01:58.590> specials<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.969> know<00:02:00.030> but

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
leveling their specials I don't know but

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.030 
leveling their specials I don't know but
it<00:02:00.299> doesn't<00:02:00.570> look<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:01.649> skills

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
it doesn't look like we will see skills

returning<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.700> point<00:02:03.030> want<00:02:03.899> more

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
returning at this point want more

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.440 
returning at this point want more
evidence<00:02:04.590> well<00:02:04.979> here<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.310> go<00:02:05.340> looking<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
evidence well here you go looking at the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
evidence well here you go looking at the
customization<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.290> weaponry<00:02:07.740> at<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.310> e3<00:02:08.459> demo

which<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.479> very<00:02:09.750> extensive<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.800> see<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
which is very extensive we see that the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.940 
which is very extensive we see that the
player<00:02:11.459> requires<00:02:12.000> ranks<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.840> particular

san<00:02:14.310> our<00:02:14.520> guess<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.120> these<00:02:15.540> particular

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
san our guess is that these particular

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.860 
san our guess is that these particular
things<00:02:16.110> are<00:02:16.680> ranks<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.340> perks<00:02:17.730> when<00:02:18.599> building

the energy weapons category the player
appears<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.190> need<00:02:23.370> ranks<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:23.940> science<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.050> we

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
appears to need ranks in science but we

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.470 
appears to need ranks in science but we
don't<00:02:25.410> have<00:02:25.500> ranks<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.129> a<00:02:26.250> skill<00:02:26.580> Dewey<00:02:26.940> it

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
don't have ranks of a skill Dewey it

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.150 
don't have ranks of a skill Dewey it
appears<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.140> science<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.620> now<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.860> perk

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
appears that science is now a perk

nut which in previous games was used to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.530

add<00:02:40.650> points<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.160> gun<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.640> repair<00:02:41.970> though

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
add points to gun and repair though

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.990 
add points to gun and repair though
there<00:02:42.959> seems<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.349> be<00:02:43.470> no<00:02:43.680> skills<00:02:44.129> anymore<00:02:44.760> once

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
there seems to be no skills anymore once

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.449 
there seems to be no skills anymore once
again<00:02:45.420> interestingly<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:46.980> seen<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.340> go

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
again interestingly this is seen to go

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.759 
again interestingly this is seen to go
all<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.670> way<00:02:47.819> up<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.120> rank<00:02:48.569> for<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.530> maybe

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
all the way up to rank for so maybe

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.339 
all the way up to rank for so maybe
there<00:02:50.099> are<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.250> lot<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.459> ranks<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:51.030> perks<00:02:51.349> repair

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
there are a lot of ranks of perks repair

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.569 
there are a lot of ranks of perks repair
seems<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.739> have<00:02:52.829> been<00:02:52.950> removed<00:02:53.280> along<00:02:53.519> with

you only have a certain amount of levels
and<00:03:21.060> therefore<00:03:21.630> perks<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.200> pick<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:22.739> many<00:03:23.340> ways

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.940 
and therefore perks to pick in many ways
this<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.209> more<00:03:24.480> realistic<00:03:24.870> here's<00:03:25.470> my<00:03:25.709> thought

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
this is more realistic here's my thought

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.160 
this is more realistic here's my thought
on<00:03:26.069> topic<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.700> plasma<00:03:27.329> rifle<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> combat

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
on topic a plasma rifle and a combat

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.259 
on topic a plasma rifle and a combat
rifle<00:03:28.650> are<00:03:28.829> essentially<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> same<00:03:29.639> thing<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
rifle are essentially the same thing and

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.539 
rifle are essentially the same thing and
it's<00:03:30.510> only<00:03:30.690> aiming<00:03:31.200> involved<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:32.069> was<00:03:32.190> kind<00:03:32.400> of

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
it's only aiming involved it was kind of

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.009 
it's only aiming involved it was kind of
silly<00:03:32.819> that<00:03:33.120> they're<00:03:33.269> different<00:03:33.450> skills

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
silly that they're different skills

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.229 
silly that they're different skills
energy<00:03:34.560> weapons<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.040> guns<00:03:35.220> now<00:03:35.880> they<00:03:36.060> would

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
energy weapons and guns now they would

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.879 
energy weapons and guns now they would
be<00:03:36.329> determined<00:03:36.510> by<00:03:36.900> perception<00:03:37.530> which<00:03:37.709> is

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
be determined by perception which is

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.309 
be determined by perception which is
just<00:03:38.069> your<00:03:38.190> accuracy<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.970> now<00:03:39.480> science<00:03:40.109> is

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
just your accuracy and now science is

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.410 
just your accuracy and now science is
involved<00:03:40.829> in<00:03:40.950> creating<00:03:41.220> energy<00:03:41.670> weapons<00:03:42.239> and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
involved in creating energy weapons and

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.199 
involved in creating energy weapons and
gun<00:03:42.930> not<00:03:43.200> in<00:03:43.380> standard<00:03:43.739> guns<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.579> makes<00:03:45.000> sense

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
gun not in standard guns it makes sense

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.990 
gun not in standard guns it makes sense
to<00:03:45.329> me<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.049> truly<00:03:46.519> interesting<00:03:47.519> topic
