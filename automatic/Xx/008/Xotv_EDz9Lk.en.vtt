there's like a four USB hub let me just

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.479 
there's like a four USB hub let me just
unlock<00:03:03.040> this<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.760> can<00:03:03.880> see<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.150> pops<00:03:04.390> open<00:03:04.660> and

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
unlock this you can see it pops open and

of fly out to the front so then for

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.100 
of fly out to the front so then for
example<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.540> could<00:03:13.810> put<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:15.299> USB<00:03:16.299> thumb<00:03:16.540> drive

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
example you could put a USB thumb drive

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.900 
example you could put a USB thumb drive
in<00:03:17.500> here<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:19.440> when<00:03:20.440> you're<00:03:20.590> finished<00:03:20.920> just

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
in here and when you're finished just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.220 
in here and when you're finished just
push<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.269> back<00:03:22.690> into<00:03:22.989> place<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:25.230> then

push it back into place and and then

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.860 
push it back into place and and then
lock<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.269> see<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.500> secure

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
lock it you can see that it is secure

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.530

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
can see it now that's a thumb drive but

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.890 
can see it now that's a thumb drive but
it<00:03:37.840> could<00:03:38.019> be<00:03:38.200> again<00:03:38.859> any<00:03:39.370> USB<00:03:40.120> device<00:03:40.660> let<00:03:40.840> me

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
it could be again any USB device let me

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.780 
it could be again any USB device let me
open<00:03:41.049> it<00:03:41.200> up<00:03:41.320> again<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.799> connect<00:03:42.489> something

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.059 

this<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:50.069> mouse<00:03:50.430> just<00:03:54.530> push<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:55.829> if<00:03:55.980> you

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
this is a mouse just push it in if you

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.309 
this is a mouse just push it in if you
have<00:03:56.280> two<00:03:56.579> little<00:03:56.969> tricky<00:03:57.269> with<00:03:57.390> with<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> cable

on<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.939> but<00:03:59.939> you<00:04:00.060> can<00:04:00.090> still<00:04:00.420> do<00:04:00.599> it<00:04:01.189> just

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
on this but you can still do it just

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.319 
on this but you can still do it just
kind<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.459> push<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.819> right<00:04:03.420> in<00:04:04.939> and<00:04:05.939> once<00:04:06.150> it's

you have connected into the USB port or
ports<00:04:52.080> like<00:04:52.620> for<00:04:53.010> example<00:04:53.099> kids<00:04:53.820> now<00:04:54.270> keep<00:04:54.630> in

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
ports like for example kids now keep in

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.189 
ports like for example kids now keep in
mind<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.349> you<00:04:55.860> can<00:04:56.099> only<00:04:56.340> install<00:04:57.199> devices

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
mind that you can only install devices

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.890 
mind that you can only install devices
of<00:04:58.490> certain<00:04:59.490> lengths<00:04:59.909> for<00:05:00.060> example<00:05:00.539> flash

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
of certain lengths for example flash

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.040 
of certain lengths for example flash
drives<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.669> certain<00:05:02.669> lengths<00:05:03.030> because<00:05:03.449> so

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
drives of certain lengths because so

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.070 
drives of certain lengths because so
this<00:05:04.229> will<00:05:04.320> only<00:05:04.500> go<00:05:04.830> back<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:05.669> far<00:05:05.699> and<00:05:06.449> also

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
this will only go back so far and also

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.920 
this will only go back so far and also
you<00:05:07.800> know<00:05:07.919> devices<00:05:08.520> like<00:05:08.789> keyboards<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.599> mice

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
you know devices like keyboards and mice

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.170 
you know devices like keyboards and mice
that<00:05:10.349> have<00:05:10.500> connectors<00:05:10.979> on<00:05:11.220> them<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:11.909> are

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
that have connectors on them that are

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.670 
that have connectors on them that are
certain<00:05:12.750> lengths<00:05:13.020> as<00:05:13.139> well<00:05:13.320> because

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
certain lengths as well because

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.000 
certain lengths as well because
otherwise<00:05:14.250> this<00:05:14.820> front<00:05:15.330> door<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.650> know<00:05:16.800> will

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
otherwise this front door you know will
