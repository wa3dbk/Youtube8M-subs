00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
looking for new developers at that time

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.230 
looking for new developers at that time
so<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.570> safe<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.079> say<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:05.240> it's

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
so I think it's safe to say that it's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.880 
so I think it's safe to say that it's
just<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.810> matter<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.049> time<00:02:07.350> till<00:02:07.619> we<00:02:07.649> hear

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
just a matter of time till we hear

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.100 
just a matter of time till we hear
something<00:02:08.369> about<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.509> don't<00:02:09.869> want

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
something about it and if you don't want

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.390 
something about it and if you don't want
to<00:02:10.229> miss<00:02:10.379> it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
to miss it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.309 
to miss it
