there but my friend didn't want to get
up<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.890> got<00:01:20.310> first<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.850> he<00:01:20.939> didn't<00:01:21.210> want<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
so I told him to kill himself that's why

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240 
so I told him to kill himself that's why
I<00:01:23.610> survived<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> screen<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> could

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
I survived on the screen and so I could

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.160 
I survived on the screen and so I could
share<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> pile<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.150> form<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> solo
