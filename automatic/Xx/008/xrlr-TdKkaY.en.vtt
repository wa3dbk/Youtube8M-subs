my<00:00:04.520> name<00:00:04.640> is<00:00:04.730> John<00:00:04.910> I<00:00:04.940> work<00:00:05.180> with<00:00:05.299> Qualcomm<00:00:05.480> I'm

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
my name is John I work with Qualcomm I'm

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.900 
my name is John I work with Qualcomm I'm
in<00:00:05.990> the<00:00:06.080> gaming<00:00:06.350> studio<00:00:06.620> and<00:00:07.190> this<00:00:07.520> is<00:00:07.640> a<00:00:07.669> demo

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
in the gaming studio and this is a demo

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.940 
in the gaming studio and this is a demo
that<00:00:08.120> we<00:00:08.210> wrote<00:00:08.420> to<00:00:08.930> show<00:00:09.110> the<00:00:09.290> power<00:00:09.470> of<00:00:09.680> our

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
that we wrote to show the power of our

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.130 
that we wrote to show the power of our
Snapdragon<00:00:10.550> 800<00:00:10.940> series<00:00:11.270> and<00:00:11.720> this<00:00:11.840> is<00:00:11.960> called

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.140 
Snapdragon 800 series and this is called

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.990 
Snapdragon 800 series and this is called
fortress<00:00:12.560> fire<00:00:12.800> and<00:00:13.400> what<00:00:13.640> we're<00:00:13.730> trying<00:00:13.940> to

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
fortress fire and what we're trying to

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.060 
fortress fire and what we're trying to
do<00:00:14.120> is<00:00:14.270> show<00:00:14.300> that<00:00:14.510> back<00:00:14.870> in<00:00:15.020> 2012<00:00:15.590> we<00:00:15.920> had<00:00:16.040> a

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
do is show that back in 2012 we had a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.680 
do is show that back in 2012 we had a
demo<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.610> this<00:00:16.700> is<00:00:16.880> kind<00:00:17.090> of<00:00:17.150> what<00:00:17.300> it<00:00:17.390> did<00:00:17.540> we

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
demo and this is kind of what it did we

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.900 
demo and this is kind of what it did we
had<00:00:17.870> we<00:00:18.410> had<00:00:18.560> water<00:00:18.800> reflecting<00:00:19.460> and<00:00:19.640> we<00:00:19.760> had

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
had we had water reflecting and we had

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.760 
had we had water reflecting and we had
cloth<00:00:20.180> and<00:00:20.450> it's<00:00:20.900> real<00:00:21.110> time<00:00:21.380> it's<00:00:21.590> not<00:00:21.740> a

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
cloth and it's real time it's not a

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.290 
cloth and it's real time it's not a
movie<00:00:22.100> you<00:00:22.220> can<00:00:22.250> touch<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:22.730> cloth<00:00:22.940> and<00:00:23.210> you

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
movie you can touch the cloth and you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.260 
movie you can touch the cloth and you
can<00:00:23.420> see<00:00:23.600> that<00:00:23.860> it<00:00:24.860> reacts<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:25.520> we<00:00:26.150> have

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
can see that it reacts and we have

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.660 
can see that it reacts and we have
real-time<00:00:26.600> reflections<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:27.710> we're<00:00:28.280> dividing

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
real-time reflections so we're dividing

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.980 
real-time reflections so we're dividing
the<00:00:28.789> load<00:00:28.940> up<00:00:29.119> between<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.449> CPU<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:29.930> GPU

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
the load up between the CPU and the GPU

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.810 
the load up between the CPU and the GPU
so<00:00:30.530> on<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.740> CPU<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:31.250> got<00:00:31.400> the<00:00:31.550> cloth

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
so on the CPU we got the cloth

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.819 
so on the CPU we got the cloth
simulation<00:00:32.060> the<00:00:32.599> water<00:00:32.810> simulation<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:33.739> on

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
simulation the water simulation and on

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.190 
simulation the water simulation and on
the<00:00:33.920> GPU<00:00:34.220> we<00:00:34.400> got<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.760> real-time<00:00:35.450> reflections

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
the GPU we got the real-time reflections

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.590 
the GPU we got the real-time reflections
and<00:00:36.350> stuff<00:00:36.530> like<00:00:36.650> that<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:37.100> but<00:00:37.790> now<00:00:37.940> it's<00:00:38.090> 2013

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
and stuff like that so but now it's 2013

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.479 
and stuff like that so but now it's 2013
so<00:00:39.140> we're<00:00:39.260> gonna<00:00:39.350> expand<00:00:39.800> out<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.160> show<00:00:40.310> what

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
so we're gonna expand out and show what

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.639 
so we're gonna expand out and show what
the<00:00:40.579> 800<00:00:41.060> series<00:00:41.239> can<00:00:41.600> do<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.260> now<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:42.500> can

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
the 800 series can do and now you can

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.530 
the 800 series can do and now you can
see<00:00:42.800> we<00:00:42.920> can<00:00:43.070> have<00:00:43.100> much<00:00:43.460> bigger<00:00:43.730> environments

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
see we can have much bigger environments

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.940 
see we can have much bigger environments
we<00:00:44.630> can<00:00:44.750> have<00:00:44.870> more<00:00:45.079> things<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:45.590> there<00:00:45.739> we<00:00:45.829> can

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
we can have more things in there we can

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.460 
we can have more things in there we can
have<00:00:46.100> animated<00:00:46.700> characters<00:00:47.660> in<00:00:47.899> there<00:00:48.140> we<00:00:48.320> can

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
have animated characters in there we can

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.010 
have animated characters in there we can
have<00:00:48.649> different<00:00:49.309> effects<00:00:49.640> this<00:00:50.630> dragons

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
have different effects this dragons

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.060 
have different effects this dragons
going<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.200> come<00:00:51.350> down<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.620> do<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:51.800> can

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
going to come down and do this can

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.130 
going to come down and do this can
sequence<00:00:52.579> we've<00:00:53.239> got<00:00:53.450> these<00:00:53.630> particle

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
sequence we've got these particle

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.370 
sequence we've got these particle
effects<00:00:54.440> going<00:00:54.680> on<00:00:54.950> we've<00:00:55.160> got<00:00:55.370> audio

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
effects going on we've got audio

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.200 
effects going on we've got audio
surround<00:00:57.380> sound<00:00:57.739> positional<00:00:58.399> audio<00:00:58.610> that's

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
surround sound positional audio that's

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.179 
surround sound positional audio that's
all<00:00:59.420> handled<00:00:59.600> by<00:00:59.780> the<00:00:59.870> DSP

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.950 

so<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.789> can<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:05.999> the<00:01:06.119> dragons<00:01:06.479> gonna<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.780> his

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
so you can see the dragons gonna do his

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.529 
so you can see the dragons gonna do his
little<00:01:07.140> sequence<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.249> fly<00:01:08.520> away<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
little sequence and and fly away and you

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:10.789 
little sequence and and fly away and you
know<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.659> dragon<00:01:10.049> interactions<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
know the dragon interactions the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.349 
know the dragon interactions the
environment<00:01:11.310> we've<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:11.819> all<00:01:11.909> these<00:01:12.030> physical

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
environment we've got all these physical

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.389 
environment we've got all these physical
effects<00:01:12.899> all<00:01:13.109> all<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.679> to<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:14.069> of<00:01:14.159> sell

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
effects all all in there to kind of sell

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:15.950 
effects all all in there to kind of sell
the<00:01:14.520> scene<00:01:14.700> make<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.179> realistic<00:01:15.509> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the scene make it look realistic and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.359 
the scene make it look realistic and
then<00:01:16.469> everybody<00:01:16.859> comes<00:01:17.100> back

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
then everybody comes back

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.950 
then everybody comes back
and<00:01:19.909> you're<00:01:20.060> back<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.390> 'county<00:01:20.600> your<00:01:20.719> steady

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
and you're back to 'county your steady

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.450 
and you're back to 'county your steady
state<00:01:21.049> scene<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:21.859> can<00:01:22.039> you<00:01:22.159> know<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.280> can

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
state scene and I can you know I can

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.219 
state scene and I can you know I can
move<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:22.759> camera<00:01:22.909> around<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:23.780> real<00:01:23.990> time

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
move the camera around it is real time

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.020 
move the camera around it is real time
you<00:01:24.590> know<00:01:24.619> at<00:01:24.770> any<00:01:25.250> point<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.549> can<00:01:25.579> do<00:01:25.820> this

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
you know at any point I can do this

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.849 
you know at any point I can do this
we've<00:01:26.630> got<00:01:26.750> another<00:01:26.990> kind<00:01:27.289> of<00:01:27.350> cool<00:01:27.560> can

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
we've got another kind of cool can

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.809 
we've got another kind of cool can
sequence<00:01:28.280> if<00:01:28.579> I<00:01:28.729> touch<00:01:28.969> this<00:01:29.179> button<00:01:29.390> here

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
sequence if I touch this button here

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.899 
sequence if I touch this button here
this<00:01:31.819> just<00:01:32.030> shows<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.710> polygon<00:01:34.460> count<00:01:34.700> the

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
this just shows the polygon count the

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.309 
this just shows the polygon count the
number<00:01:35.179> of<00:01:35.299> triangles<00:01:35.689> that<00:01:35.990> we're<00:01:36.110> drawing

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
number of triangles that we're drawing

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.109 
number of triangles that we're drawing
so<00:01:36.979> as<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.219> circles<00:01:37.429> through<00:01:37.759> it's<00:01:37.909> going<00:01:38.060> to

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
so as it circles through it's going to

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.730 
so as it circles through it's going to
go<00:01:38.209> into<00:01:38.329> wireframe<00:01:38.569> mode<00:01:38.990> here<00:01:39.229> in<00:01:39.319> a<00:01:39.380> second

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
and just kind of show the number of

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.719 
and just kind of show the number of
polygons<00:01:42.530> were<00:01:42.649> really<00:01:42.950> drawing<00:01:43.219> there's

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
polygons were really drawing there's

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.490 
polygons were really drawing there's
just<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:44.030> lot<00:01:44.209> there's<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:44.630> lot<00:01:44.659> going<00:01:45.140> on<00:01:45.259> in<00:01:45.439> the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
just a lot there's a lot going on in the

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.800 
just a lot there's a lot going on in the
scene<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.340> this<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.640> all<00:01:46.759> being<00:01:46.969> rendered<00:01:47.450> at

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
know it's it's it's it's not can you can

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.270 
know it's it's it's it's not can you can
move<00:01:55.099> it<00:01:55.189> around<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:56.239> can<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.689> don't<00:01:56.959> know

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
move it around you can I don't know

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.060 
move it around you can I don't know
move<00:01:59.280> them<00:01:59.400> around

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
move them around

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.770 
move them around
to<00:02:01.520> look<00:02:01.670> at<00:02:01.760> different<00:02:02.030> things<00:02:02.060> he's

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
to look at different things he's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.930 
to look at different things he's
basically<00:02:03.260> an<00:02:03.440> apostate<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.190> vayan<00:02:04.490> plasm

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
basically an apostate so vayan plasm

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.700 
basically an apostate so vayan plasm
they'll<00:02:05.450> finish<00:02:05.690> his<00:02:05.930> little<00:02:06.170> flight<00:02:06.440> and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
they'll finish his little flight and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.040 
they'll finish his little flight and
he'll<00:02:06.920> fly<00:02:07.909> back<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.450> then<00:02:08.570> one<00:02:08.690> more<00:02:08.840> thing<00:02:08.960> I

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
he'll fly back and then one more thing I

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.359 
he'll fly back and then one more thing I
want<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.229> show<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.649> one<00:02:10.100> of<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> things

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
want to show you is one of the things

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.190 
want to show you is one of the things
that<00:02:10.520> Qualcomm<00:02:10.729> can<00:02:11.120> do<00:02:11.270> is<00:02:11.810> some<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.140> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
that Qualcomm can do is some of the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.720 
that Qualcomm can do is some of the
other<00:02:12.230> competitors<00:02:12.560> can't<00:02:12.980> do<00:02:13.130> maybe<00:02:13.370> as<00:02:13.520> well

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
other competitors can't do maybe as well

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.970 
other competitors can't do maybe as well
is<00:02:13.970> we<00:02:14.750> can<00:02:14.900> distribute<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.440> load<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:15.830> if<00:02:15.920> I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
is we can distribute the load so if I

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.220 
is we can distribute the load so if I
pull<00:02:16.190> up<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.490> graphs<00:02:17.030> here<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.690> can<00:02:17.840> see<00:02:18.050> that

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
pull up the graphs here you can see that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.690 
pull up the graphs here you can see that
we're<00:02:18.350> distributing<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.040> load<00:02:19.070> between<00:02:19.550> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
we're distributing the load between the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.550 
we're distributing the load between the
four<00:02:20.090> cores<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:20.990> see<00:02:21.080> how<00:02:21.140> busy<00:02:21.410> they<00:02:21.530> are

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
four cores you can see how busy they are

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.470 
four cores you can see how busy they are
you<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:21.890> see<00:02:21.920> oh<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.190> GPU<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.640> busy<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
you can see oh the GPU is busy the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.000 
you can see oh the GPU is busy the
course<00:02:23.720> right<00:02:23.930> now<00:02:23.990> are<00:02:24.260> being<00:02:24.410> used<00:02:24.680> for

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
course right now are being used for

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.730 
course right now are being used for
cloth<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.780> water<00:02:27.080> as<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.350> mentioned<00:02:27.650> before

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
cloth and water as I mentioned before

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.270 
cloth and water as I mentioned before
but<00:02:28.370> if<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.580> pause<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.180> for<00:02:29.209> instance<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:31.160> can

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
but if I pause it for instance you can

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.680 
but if I pause it for instance you can
see<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.730> cores<00:02:31.970> aren't<00:02:32.270> being<00:02:32.420> used

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
see that the cores aren't being used

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.740 
see that the cores aren't being used
anymore<00:02:32.959> because<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.790> OS<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
anymore because the OS and the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.600 
anymore because the OS and the
Snapdragon<00:02:36.320> processor<00:02:36.770> realized<00:02:37.250> they're

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
Snapdragon processor realized they're

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.220 
Snapdragon processor realized they're
not<00:02:37.760> being<00:02:37.940> used<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.390> powers<00:02:38.690> them<00:02:38.840> down<00:02:39.020> so

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
not being used so powers them down so

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.140 
not being used so powers them down so
your<00:02:39.350> batteries<00:02:39.650> last<00:02:39.860> longer<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.550> then<00:02:41.000> if

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
your batteries last longer and then if

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.580 
your batteries last longer and then if
they're<00:02:41.300> being<00:02:41.450> used<00:02:41.570> again<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.110> can<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.440> can

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
they're being used again I can I can

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.199 
they're being used again I can I can
move<00:02:42.680> around<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.100> if<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.520> need<00:02:43.700> them<00:02:43.790> again<00:02:44.090> and

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
move around and if I need them again and

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.340 
move around and if I need them again and
I<00:02:44.270> turn<00:02:44.450> them<00:02:44.570> on<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.810> can<00:02:44.930> see<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.140> course

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
I turn them on you can see the course

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.380 
I turn them on you can see the course
come<00:02:45.560> back<00:02:45.709> on<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.700> course<00:02:46.970> come<00:02:47.239> on

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
come back on so then of course come on

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.990 
come back on so then of course come on
and<00:02:47.540> off<00:02:47.660> on<00:02:47.989> demand<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:49.610> we<00:02:49.730> do<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.940> for

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
and off on demand and so we do that for

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.110 
and off on demand and so we do that for
power<00:02:50.270> saving<00:02:50.690> that's<00:02:51.500> pretty<00:02:51.739> much<00:02:52.120> that's

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
power saving that's pretty much that's

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.430 
power saving that's pretty much that's
pretty<00:02:53.239> much<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.660> demo

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.020 

yeah<00:02:57.440> Batman's<00:02:57.800> over<00:02:58.010> here<00:02:58.220> I'm<00:02:58.520> not<00:02:58.670> I'm<00:02:59.000> not

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
yeah Batman's over here I'm not I'm not

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.910 
yeah Batman's over here I'm not I'm not
as<00:02:59.270> familiar<00:02:59.480> with<00:02:59.750> Batman<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.770> was

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
as familiar with Batman this is this was

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.430 
as familiar with Batman this is this was
a<00:03:00.950> game<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.430> was<00:03:01.490> done<00:03:01.670> by<00:03:01.820> Gameloft<00:03:02.440> and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
a game that was done by Gameloft and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680 
a game that was done by Gameloft and
again<00:03:03.710> this<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.070> just<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.370> show<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.790> power<00:03:05.120> of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
again this is just to show the power of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.560 
again this is just to show the power of
the<00:03:06.040> 800<00:03:07.040> series<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:07.880> can<00:03:08.060> see<00:03:08.240> this<00:03:08.360> is<00:03:08.540> a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
the 800 series so you can see this is a

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.720 
the 800 series so you can see this is a
you<00:03:09.140> know<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.860> standard<00:03:10.070> console

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
you know this is a standard console

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.310 
you know this is a standard console
quality<00:03:10.910> game<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.570> can<00:03:11.690> see<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.900> graphics

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
quality game you can see the graphics

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.540 
quality game you can see the graphics
that<00:03:12.440> we<00:03:12.560> have<00:03:12.710> on<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:12.950> thing<00:03:13.190> is<00:03:13.280> really
