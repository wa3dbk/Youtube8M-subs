00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.319
 many these climates so here I am 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.339
 head towards sacem street turns so 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.899
 I'll take the rer 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.639
 I will go there so I hope I 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.780
 could finish a little bit then we get 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.610
 will regain after his clash with a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.110
 phone that insult him to babies but 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.110
 good is not really going to more 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.479
 he 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.420
 hello so I'm sorry I'm with 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.649
 my phone my phone is there 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.689
 shitty quality 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.549
 so that's actually where I come back to 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.140
 choice must I look there so I 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.259
 come back wine party it sounds cherry round 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.340
 was waiting for the press that I would 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.240
 clip what is quoted it's from 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.880
 blow there I had the sheet 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.660
 So here I come back from the assassin's 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.709
 creed unions x 2 turns so on paris 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.750
 so it was just to tell you a 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.880
 little bit my impressions of the game 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.680
 so just so we actually 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.330
 came back we had a little bit of 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.420
 happened in fact there was a kind of 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.000
 these super nice as a deco in fact 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.920
 there were table species with no 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.350
 really an atmosphere I do not find the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.870
 words an atmosphere really not that makes 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.420
 the festive time at which the game is going to 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.849
 unroll so it was his playstation 4 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.620
 This is the alpha version there were 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.780
 screens everywhere so I took a 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.160
 headphones then I could try so it was 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.430
 a little demo actually where there is a 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.349
 game phase let's say infiltration 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.090
 we could try some novelties 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.850
 have obviously made a drink 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.560
 are nagging so here is the big 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.200
 novelty is the crapa in fact we have a 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.090
 grappling it's huge you can ride everything 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.160
 at the top of the buildings much faster 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.170
 it's really huge and then we have 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.019
 a gameplay phase in fact with 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.300
 carriages one can drive a car 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.680
 carriage so it was a bit peculiar 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.260
 in the sense that there is still a lot 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.910
 of two carriages a little bit a little 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.980
 bang finally after that is he version 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.730
 alpha obviously graphically the 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.430
 game still remains we'll say in in 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.230
 in the fat finally I know more about them 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.330
 words still remain in the domain of 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.060
 the unil unity with small 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.410
 gameplay improvements 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.080
 for now we can not either 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.550
 too much to know but he's already moving 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.560
 his movements were rather 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.150
 interesting so I'm here 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.890
 just wanted to thank because 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.110
 so in fact when I finished 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.300
 do the demo there is someone who is 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.739
 come to me who actually wanted that I 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.150
 choose an interview that I answer 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.760
 a few questions to find out if 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.230
 I thought of the game so I thank you 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.120
 for giving me this because suddenly 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.819
 I was not expecting that so that's the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.319
 site is not his guide point fr so 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.700
 do not hesitate to see them simply 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.800
 so I'm sorry I'm really 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.110
 punctured in fact so there is a picture on 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.090
 twitter i'm not telling you the slice the 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.700
 slice ruffecois but in fact it goes there 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.290
 where the right after the taf actually hit 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.450
 I left I signed up for the 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.100
 session of 20 hours and right now I 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.560
 I'm really super puncture so I 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.729
 apologize for the defeated head but yes I 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.739
 know how to smile 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.360
 so here is in any case I you 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.520
 Thank you very much for organizing your 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.800
 series by winning thank you actually for 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.840
 for this interview you will surely 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.250
 see on the site so here is as usual 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.990
 I saw that bullshit yesterday I 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.979
 present so that's after I got it 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.450
 in the meantime so I actually got 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.919
 little tattoos you know we 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.240
 done with water we see that it was 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.400
 really I 'm a father so here they are 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.669
 are really nice little touches 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.080
 like that a big one like that so that's 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.430
 super cool so here I am going to try to 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.590
 to do a kind of small editing with 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.030
 because what I could do with the game 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.500
 do not see filming I did some 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.150
 photos I have a little filming before 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.450
 so I apologize if I look the same 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.360
 because it's horrible to watch the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:05.140
 whey and look at what I took at 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.850
 happy meal pecked ue 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.140
 Anyway, that's fine 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.870
 is super fun to take a 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.520
 joystick in play by playing back in 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.620
 made a controller in hand it was great 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.900
 to play it was cool so that's it 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.200
 frankly ben jawad coming out and then 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.500
 it's especially that in the end at the end I 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.060
 you filmed a little bit in the end 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.100
 with the two non collector figurines 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.360
 but the collector's figure is huge 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.040
 I think that's one of the most 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.040
 big the thing really has to have 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.070
 the place for a I look forward to the 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.070
 next
