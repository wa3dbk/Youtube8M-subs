cannon<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:26.039> 4<00:00:26.460> by<00:00:26.609> 3<00:00:26.640> by<00:00:27.060> 2<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.590> had<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.010> 3<00:00:29.699> by

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
cannon is a 4 by 3 by 2 I had it a 3 by

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.179 
cannon is a 4 by 3 by 2 I had it a 3 by
3<00:00:29.849> by<00:00:30.269> 2<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.960> sometimes<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:31.980> would

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
3 by 2 but sometimes and this would

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.440 
3 by 2 but sometimes and this would
happen<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:34.290> TNT<00:00:35.010> would<00:00:35.399> go<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.210> slab

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
happen and the TNT would go on the slab

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.910 
happen and the TNT would go on the slab
and<00:00:36.750> explode<00:00:37.879> kind<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:43.350> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and explode kind of like that so you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.150 
and explode kind of like that so you
will<00:00:44.250> need<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.910> water<00:00:45.360> bucket<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.960> button<00:00:46.469> 5

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160

and now all you need to do is load it

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.039 
and now all you need to do is load it
loading<00:01:17.369> usually<00:01:17.790> takes<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.180> most<00:01:18.330> part<00:01:18.780> over

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
loading usually takes the most part over

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.620 
loading usually takes the most part over
the<00:01:19.290> most<00:01:19.530> amount<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.799> time<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.240> fairly

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the most amount of time but it is fairly

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.840 
the most amount of time but it is fairly
simple<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.920> could<00:01:23.070> also<00:01:23.250> load<00:01:23.670> this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
simple you could also load this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.810 
simple you could also load this
something<00:01:24.420> tip<00:01:24.750> no<00:01:25.200> else<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.189> could<00:01:26.340> also<00:01:26.490> put

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
something tip no else you could also put

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.800 
something tip no else you could also put
this<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:30.360> get<00:01:30.570> shot

this from the back so you don't get shot
off<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.229> easily<00:01:31.409> which<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> always<00:01:32.369> safer<00:01:34.220> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
off as easily which is always safer and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.120 
off as easily which is always safer and
there<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.299> now<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:37.350> could<00:01:37.740> shoot

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
there you have it now you could shoot

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
semi-automatic icarus it all you have to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.760 
semi-automatic icarus it all you have to
do<00:01:43.890> protect<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> job<00:01:45.079> now<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.110> only<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
do protect the job now with only a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.219 
do protect the job now with only a
little<00:01:47.040> bit<00:01:47.280> more<00:01:47.430> TNT<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:48.329> more<00:01:48.600> button<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
little bit more TNT one more button and

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.100 
little bit more TNT one more button and
one<00:01:49.799> more<00:01:50.009> dispenser<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:51.630> make<00:01:51.930> this

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
one more dispenser you can make this

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.130 
one more dispenser you can make this
thing<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.790> an<00:01:54.090> Icarus<00:01:56.210> but<00:01:57.210> also<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.570> cannon

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
thing it is an Icarus but also a cannon

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.070 
thing it is an Icarus but also a cannon
so<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.860> shot<00:02:00.670> off<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.240> they<00:02:01.510> can<00:02:01.659> t<00:02:01.780> get<00:02:01.870> shot

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
so you shot off and they can t get shot

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.140 
so you shot off and they can t get shot
off<00:02:02.260> it's<00:02:02.590> pretty<00:02:02.860> powerful<00:02:03.070> because<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.790> has

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
off it's pretty powerful because it has

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.170 
off it's pretty powerful because it has
those<00:02:04.420> extra<00:02:04.810> two<00:02:04.930> dispensers<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.490> if<00:02:07.000> you

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
those extra two dispensers so if you

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.580 
those extra two dispensers so if you
really<00:02:07.330> want<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.690> easily<00:02:07.960> convert<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.410> just

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
really want to easily convert it just

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.790 
really want to easily convert it just
break<00:02:08.770> these<00:02:08.920> two<00:02:09.130> like<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:11.590> let<00:02:11.770> me

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
break these two like this and now let me

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.070 
break these two like this and now let me
get<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> Santa<00:02:12.310> here<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.870> let's<00:02:13.870> try<00:02:14.020> this

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
get the Santa here and let's try this
