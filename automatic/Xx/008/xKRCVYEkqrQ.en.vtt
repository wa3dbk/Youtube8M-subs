00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
 hello people to the new video it is 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 again a little review today 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:16.320
 morning lego city mÃ¼ller has the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.750
 Number 44 3 2 and is on vacation 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.990
 then I would say deal take us 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.539
 now with the things goes with the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.279
 mini figures that I take here now 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:39.500
 will 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:39.500
 this has a wife and another 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:54.260
 you can see that and a man already that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:01:00.180
 I also really liked it a lot 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:06.119
 two fish have you realize that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:09.390
 Fish are two fish and of course 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:15.210
 another rotten banana here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.729
 a banana and the cool extra something to me 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.619
 The two like it very much 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.460
 So the two paper baskets here can 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.750
 to do things and then just 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.189
 close again or here too 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.130
 open and here I already have a few 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.229
 create rotate and close again 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.490
 I'll come back later for what 's good 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:46.170
 Once again we were on it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.140
 with the miller dry himself yes deer 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 and very nice to see it has a lot 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.170
 many lights 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.299
 you do not have that and here it has two 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.110
 I like it very much 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.140
 and that I also say something now 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.850
 I really like about the is that the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.640
 just give it all up 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.950
 and then someone comes in and does it 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.060
 close 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:18.290
 also very easy then we go 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.560
 here a bit to the side sees 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.300
 you are not that spectacular 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:30.620
 here that this is that one there 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.680
 can reassign a figure that just two 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.360
 have people seat because they are in front 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.269
 next to not two people place 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:46.780
 we are back on the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:46.780
 On the other side it will be a cool broom 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:57.650
 broom to the floor and a whisk 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:01.459
 Look was also the garbage to me 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.620
 has accumulated with the broom on here 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.530
 to push 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.299
 Well then I would say here now 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.480
 Because here it is also very 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.769
 exciting 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.859
 I said yes I'll come 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.180
 Team these paper baskets back without 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.739
 Hard to say what 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.160
 for what they are good 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:27.079
 when i take off the lid here is 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:30.380
 the lid and just press it here 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.620
 the light did not matter 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.359

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.310
 and now I would say I tell you 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:49.130
 That's what you do with the wheel 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:54.519
 you can can the waste be purely so 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:57.980

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.139
