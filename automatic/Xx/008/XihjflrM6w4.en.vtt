 commenting here I bring you today I bring you 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:15.719
 a guide on how to create an archer of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:19.200
 discretion is good because the first thing 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.770
 race the elf race of the forest is the best 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.270
 of goalkeeper and bonus athlete 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.000
 now the discretion skills in 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.340
 discretion we will have all the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.950
 advantages and turns 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.150
 steps of zero killer blades aim 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.480
 deadly all I 'm missing the last 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.580
 but we are going to have them all 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.670
 then armed a light one is also 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.540
 indispensable is valid with all 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.340
 advantages are worth here two are still missing and 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.370
 a d 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.970
 agile defender but good we will give him 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.510
 all archery and archery also all 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.780
 the advantages since they are all very good 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.350
 and they come in handy 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.630
 after smithy smithy 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.869
 I do not have all the advantages I like 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.920
 have all the arcs and web and all the 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.170
 armor minus the heavy ones clear but 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.180
 I recommend you go for the branch 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.350
 of heavy armor for the bow is 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.900
 water and then take the armor 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.680
 down 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.680
 and good 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.080
 now everyone else can upload it 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.270
 something 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.970
 to get more levels and more 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.510
 enchantment enchantment 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.180
 let's give it nothing but charming 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.840
 and lovely insightful charming 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.670
 body and additional effect 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.579
 so that all this is very easy 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.670
 let's give to love our 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.869
 our armor and our bow is worth 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.500
 to give more damage with the bow for 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.620
 have more health endure what you want and 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.720
 so we can also make a team of 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.989
 smithy as well getting the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.750
 blacksmith's charm that I think 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.940
 that was that weapons weapons 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.670
 armor can be improved somewhat by 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.660
 a hundred more if we have that and all the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.629
 advantages of enchantment that I finish 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.940
 to say the team can improve it 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.400
 a lot more and you will do a lot more damage 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.370
 ok and then already if you love it is with 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.950
 additional damage as it will be much more 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.920
 well I wasted a date of 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.370
 ethics but a gene or if it does not matter then 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.370
 good 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.420
 that's all and good and later what 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.280
 I will upload a video of a demonstration of 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.670
 Archery discretion and nothing I hope 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.670
