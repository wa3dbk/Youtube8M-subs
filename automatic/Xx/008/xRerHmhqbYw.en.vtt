00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.299
 weapons of the future 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.369
 electronic in a combat situation 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.669
 choosing the right weapon 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.080
 moment means defeat the enemy 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.080
 especially protected body armor 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.339
 while the usual choices are automatic 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:35.120
 rifle with a powerful cartridge 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.909
 able to punch body armor his field 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.089
 small caliber but having a large 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:41.460
 speed may incur significant 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.260
 defeat 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 the bomb 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.800
 he was pushed resides all on 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.210
 your way by the way it is unlikely that you will be happy 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.140
 even if you are wearing body armor 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.260
 all this advantage of a powerful patron 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 caliber 5 56 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.540
 these munitions are these assets in the distance 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.770
 up to five hundred meters 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.730
 but in melee for example when stripping 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.720
 smaller weapons are required indoors 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.580
 sizes comfortable in cramped 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.580
 space 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.230
 so for that we have m 50 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.410
 in tight spaces where good is needed 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.590
 firepower and it is quite reliable 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.900
 weapons for most people 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.960
 the disadvantage of this weapon is that in it 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 used nine millimeter 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.050
 pistol cartridges are not powerful enough 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.570
 to pierce the standard 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.340
 body armor 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.140
 that is, this time no longer passes 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.289
 through and I tell you this is not too 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.009
 nice sight when you shoot 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.219
 to the guy the trucks think they got sick 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.009
 about forty ready to shoot back 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.009
 so low prices 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.680
 so for melee required 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.720
 compact weapon type m 3 5 demolition 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.159
 bullet penetration 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.159
 large caliber 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.440
 meet just such a weapon this 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.090
 this and their families 1 last development 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.090
 individual weapon protection 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.659
 I arrived at the shooting range 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.249
 Virginia club to see all 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.249
 with my own eyes 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.499
 this weapon has power 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.180
 automatic rifle but by 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.989
 compactness comparable to a gun 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.989
 machine gun 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.649
 Bruce Jackson was a consultant at 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:50.259
 the development of m 3 71 and 72 especially then what is not 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.239
 capable pistols main problem in 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.289
 that in certain 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:54.649
 situations you have to resort 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.149
 to auxiliary weapons time is something 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:58.719
 more secretive capable of more 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.369
 than pistols 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.369
 ideologue excavations 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.719
 m piseeva working on powder gases it 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.319
 multipurpose light and compact weapons 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.569
 the weight of which with 20 rounds less than two 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.319
 kilograms 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.519
 he has a retractable butt that is you 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.979
 can give the machine length 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:19.889
 automatic rifle and summer 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.829
 reduce it to the size of a gun 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.009
 machine gun shoot from the shoulder or hold 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.179
 in front of you like a gun 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:29.589
 the cube he shoots cartridges of caliber 4 and 6 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.419
 special ammunition with 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.539
 high speed bullets possessing 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.509
 punching power rifle cartridge 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.629
 I believe that the real rifle 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.019
 ammunition smaller than a caliber pistol 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.599
 whom and what advantage does lidia have 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.249
 mode increased shot distance 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.680
 increased penetration 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.589
 ability 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:52.539
 year of birth that his punching 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:55.059
 boeing ability and 7 higher than i will 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.010
 small arms models 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.610
 will become him in a special position if 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.640
 so this is a breakthrough weapon of modern combat i 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.759
 I want to personally go to this club 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.759
 increase penetration 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.949
 these are small patrons big 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.069
 power 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:17.250
 2 ports 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.410
 just look there is pretty good 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.830
 Group 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.840
 m so we know for sure that the target is pierced 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.740
 it says a lot about it 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.379
 this 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.489
 tablet of the day to see what u 

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:35.259
 this cartridge breakdown force is necessary 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.080
 look from one side and then from 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.680
 inverse 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.539
 you can imagine what it would be like there 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:42.849
 was your head 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.849
 game over 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.090
 aya silencer 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.120
 made in such a way that does not affect 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.319
 firing accuracy 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.810
 Nina rate of fire 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.760
 compactness is not achieved at the expense of 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.840
 firepower and here is the 950 shooting time 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.160
 shots per minute which is comparable 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.000
 with the rate of fire of any gun 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.639
 machine gun 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.460
 this weapon is secretive and at the same time 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.460
 deadly 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.800
 I can say that such penetrating power 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.800
 weapons with a silencer is something 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.439
 this is scary 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.469
 no need to study the mighty greenpeace Sejm 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.529
 no chance to escape 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.859
 Russia has a small Taliban 

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:33.249
 dimensions 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.050
 a strong beat
