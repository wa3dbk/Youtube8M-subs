00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
trying to look at from the soft armor

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:32.800 
trying to look at from the soft armor
ballistic<00:00:31.970> system<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:32.480> how<00:00:32.570> it<00:00:32.599> actually

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
ballistic system and how it actually

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.540 
ballistic system and how it actually
integrates<00:00:33.350> with<00:00:33.530> soft<00:00:33.770> armor<00:00:34.010> carriers<00:00:34.400> as

well<00:00:35.120> as<00:00:35.239> pouch<00:00:35.480> designs<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.290> really<00:00:36.860> trying

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
well as pouch designs and really trying

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.930 
well as pouch designs and really trying
to<00:00:37.160> take<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.850> approach<00:00:38.210> of<00:00:38.450> a<00:00:39.850> more<00:00:40.850> or<00:00:40.910> less

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
to take the approach of a more or less

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.870 
to take the approach of a more or less
in<00:00:41.149> engineering<00:00:41.690> style<00:00:42.230> design<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:43.489> really

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
in engineering style design and really

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.940 
in engineering style design and really
tried<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.420> take<00:00:44.630> our<00:00:44.870> industry<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.770> a<00:00:45.800> next

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
for us we were trying to look at the

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.320 
for us we were trying to look at the
overall<00:01:06.830> carrier<00:01:07.340> system<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:07.820> structure<00:01:08.210> and

literally over the course of the last
nine<00:01:17.780> months<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:18.740> know<00:01:18.830> broke<00:01:19.250> all<00:01:19.430> these

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
nine months you know broke all these

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.720 
nine months you know broke all these
products<00:01:20.030> out<00:01:20.410> took<00:01:21.410> Gram<00:01:21.740> skills<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.520> was

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
products out took Gram skills and was

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.030 
products out took Gram skills and was
just<00:01:22.910> fanatical<00:01:23.420> around<00:01:23.720> trying<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.229> look<00:01:24.920> at

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
just fanatical around trying to look at

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.770 
just fanatical around trying to look at
where<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.340> weight<00:01:25.520> was<00:01:26.030> was<00:01:26.390> really<00:01:26.600> coming

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
where the weight was was really coming

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.550 
where the weight was was really coming
from<00:01:27.020> for<00:01:27.680> me<00:01:27.800> it<00:01:27.979> was<00:01:28.040> really<00:01:28.460> trying<00:01:29.030> to

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
from for me it was really trying to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.770 
from for me it was really trying to
drive<00:01:30.560> what<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.940> what<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.600> right

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
drive what is the what is the right

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.290 
drive what is the what is the right
direction<00:01:32.990> for<00:01:33.500> weight<00:01:33.950> savings<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.640> why<00:01:35.000> we

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
direction for weight savings and why we

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.510 
direction for weight savings and why we
were<00:01:35.479> why<00:01:35.900> we<00:01:36.080> were<00:01:36.290> not<00:01:36.680> able<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:37.009> get<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.490> it

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
were why we were not able to get to it

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.020 
were why we were not able to get to it
to<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:37.850> lower<00:01:38.060> away<00:01:38.300> requirement<00:01:39.790> what<00:01:40.790> would<00:01:41.000> I

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
to a lower away requirement what would I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.300 
to a lower away requirement what would I

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
deserve that so what I try to do is I I

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.850 
deserve that so what I try to do is I I
went<00:02:14.330> through<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:14.600> entire<00:02:14.840> process<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.709> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
went through this entire process and I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.590 
went through this entire process and I
realized<00:02:16.340> very<00:02:16.550> quickly<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:17.000> none<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
realized very quickly that none of the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.630 
realized very quickly that none of the
manufacturers<00:02:18.500> nylon<00:02:18.890> wise<00:02:19.130> anything<00:02:19.519> else

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
manufacturers nylon wise anything else

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.070 
manufacturers nylon wise anything else
like<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.790> as<00:02:20.150> hard<00:02:20.360> as<00:02:20.450> they<00:02:20.570> were<00:02:20.630> searching

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
like that as hard as they were searching

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.660 
like that as hard as they were searching
as<00:02:21.170> hard<00:02:21.350> as<00:02:21.410> they<00:02:21.530> were<00:02:21.620> trying<00:02:21.830> we're<00:02:22.489> really

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
as hard as they were trying we're really

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.759 
as hard as they were trying we're really
looking<00:02:22.970> at<00:02:23.299> all<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.930> different<00:02:24.080> pieces<00:02:24.440> of

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
looking at all the different pieces of

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.009 
looking at all the different pieces of
the<00:02:24.830> puzzle<00:02:24.980> together<00:02:25.269> so<00:02:26.269> what<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.450> decided<00:02:26.540> I

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
the puzzle together so what I decided I

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.410 
the puzzle together so what I decided I
had<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.320> actually<00:02:27.500> hybridize<00:02:28.209> packages<00:02:29.209> or

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
had to actually hybridize packages or

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.270 
had to actually hybridize packages or
hybridized<00:02:29.810> materials<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.560> when<00:02:30.980> we<00:02:31.070> came<00:02:31.220> up

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
hybridized materials and when we came up

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.520 
hybridized materials and when we came up
with<00:02:31.549> pv

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
with pv

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.830 
with pv
it<00:02:32.860> increased<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.459> abrasion<00:02:34.120> resistance<00:02:34.630> of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
it increased the abrasion resistance of

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.830 
it increased the abrasion resistance of
the<00:02:35.020> regular<00:02:35.470> standard<00:02:35.680> 500<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.280> your<00:02:36.400> nylon

the regular standard 500 in your nylon

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.380 
the regular standard 500 in your nylon
78<00:02:37.840> times<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.770> very<00:02:38.980> very<00:02:39.040> significant<00:02:39.819> we

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
78 times so very very significant we

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.030 
78 times so very very significant we
were<00:02:40.480> able<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.720> take<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.350> know<00:02:41.440> our<00:02:41.680> standard
