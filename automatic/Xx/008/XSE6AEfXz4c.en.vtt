 I was now to me 42 same thing 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.340
 increased memory making this increase the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.800
 5% 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.100
 each time they increase I advise you 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:57.319
 to take a test to see if it's changing 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:00.489
 A lot of people are trying very hard to use this. 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.489

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.780

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.730
 That's right people at the end 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:22.060
 You will see that it will appear is the average 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:25.030
 from fps to score a little more 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:40.600
 temperature of the planet can not 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:42.030
 very hot and then it helps 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.180

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.180
