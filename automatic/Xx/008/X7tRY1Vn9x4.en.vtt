1 2 is an IP let me go ahead and launch
the<00:00:21.180> ar.drone<00:00:21.480> app<00:00:21.930> give<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.039> second<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the ar.drone app give it a second the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.390 
the ar.drone app give it a second the
pilot<00:00:24.390> icon<00:00:25.170> should<00:00:25.320> go<00:00:25.439> dark<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.980> then<00:00:26.250> that

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.410 
so today's a little bit of a weird day
it<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.219> think<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.610> were<00:00:56.670> saying<00:00:56.969> 13

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it was a think of as they were saying 13

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.939 
it was a think of as they were saying 13
kilometers<00:00:57.840> an<00:00:57.930> hour<00:00:57.989> wind<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.829> was

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
kilometers an hour wind but it was

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.590 
kilometers an hour wind but it was
gusting<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> 23<00:01:00.090> 28<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.030> very<00:01:03.210> stable

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
gusting up to 23 28 so it's very stable

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
gusting up to 23 28 so it's very stable
other<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.350> when<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.769> jerk<00:01:05.010> around

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
other than when you see jerk around

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.620 
other than when you see jerk around

that's it fighting the gusty winds what
I<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.380> used<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.830> though<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.659> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
I do have to get used to though is the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.740 
I do have to get used to though is the
controls<00:01:19.700> see<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.790> jerking<00:01:21.150> around<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.600> that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
controls see it jerking around like that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
oh so now we're on the onboard footage

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.550 
oh so now we're on the onboard footage
like<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.780> saying<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.140> reason<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
like I was saying the reason it's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
like I was saying the reason it's
jerking<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:25.920> over<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> place<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
jerking all over the place is the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.910 
jerking all over the place is the
controls<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.320> minute<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> let<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
controls the minute you let go the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.850 
controls the minute you let go the
sticks<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.579> automatically<00:01:30.530> try<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> hover

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
sticks they automatically try to hover

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
sticks they automatically try to hover
and<00:01:32.159> stay<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.549> spot<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.210> unless<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.750> slow<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and stay in spot so unless you slow it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.539 
and stay in spot so unless you slow it
down<00:01:34.229> smoothly<00:01:34.799> before<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.250> let<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.490> two

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
down smoothly before you let go two

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.090 
down smoothly before you let go two
sticks<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.060> love<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.750> swing<00:01:37.680> back

sticks you love you have that swing back

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.060 
sticks you love you have that swing back
and<00:01:38.130> forth<00:01:38.369> motion<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.540> no

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
and forth motion is what I have no

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.230 
and forth motion is what I have no
notice<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:43.159> as<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.369> everything<00:01:44.700> time<00:01:45.060> and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.070 

you

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.540 

alright<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.440> do<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.100> little<00:02:23.280> bit<00:02:23.430> more

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
alright so do a little bit more

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.460 
alright so do a little bit more
exploring<00:02:24.240> just<00:02:24.750> get<00:02:24.900> accustomed<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
exploring just get accustomed to the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.460 
exploring just get accustomed to the
ranges<00:02:25.920> as<00:02:26.070> well<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:27.750> read<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:27.990> lot<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.260> mods

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
ranges as well I have read a lot of mods

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.590 
ranges as well I have read a lot of mods
that<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:28.980> increase<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.310> range<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.240> on<00:02:30.390> so

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
that we can increase the range so on so

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.500 
that we can increase the range so on so
forth<00:02:30.630> but<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.560> now<00:02:31.880> seems<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.970> be<00:02:33.030> adequate

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
forth but for now seems to be adequate

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.150 
forth but for now seems to be adequate
pretty<00:02:33.990> much<00:02:34.170> shipped<00:02:34.500> up<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.860> down<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
pretty much shipped up and down the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.290 
pretty much shipped up and down the
street<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:37.520> I'm<00:02:38.520> assuming<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:38.940> well<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> know

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
street and I'm assuming as well I know

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.550 
street and I'm assuming as well I know
there<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.750> quite<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.020> bit<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.260> Wi-Fi

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
there is quite a bit of Wi-Fi

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.680 
there is quite a bit of Wi-Fi
connections<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> air<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.760> guess<00:02:42.660> my

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
connections in the air so I guess my

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.330 
connections in the air so I guess my
next<00:02:42.870> test<00:02:43.320> will<00:02:43.470> be<00:02:43.590> at<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> park<00:02:44.010> I'm

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
next test will be at the park I'm

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.860 
next test will be at the park I'm
thinking<00:02:44.550> I'm<00:02:44.760> going<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.970> get<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.450> lot<00:02:45.540> better

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
thinking I'm going to get a lot better

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.980 
thinking I'm going to get a lot better
range<00:02:46.200> out<00:02:46.440> there<00:02:46.910> no<00:02:47.910> interference<00:02:48.570> although

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
range out there no interference although

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.960 
range out there no interference although
i<00:02:49.020> do<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.440> notice<00:02:49.650> how<00:02:49.860> close<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.130> was<00:02:50.340> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
i do you notice how close that was and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.760 
i do you notice how close that was and
pretty<00:02:51.600> much<00:02:51.690> at<00:02:51.960> this<00:02:52.110> point<00:02:52.200> when<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.590> see

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
pretty much at this point when you see

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.980 
pretty much at this point when you see
the<00:02:53.010> on-screen<00:02:53.790> or<00:02:53.970> signing<00:02:54.750> out<00:02:54.840> they<00:02:54.930> on

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
the on-screen or signing out they on

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.080 
the on-screen or signing out they on
screen<00:02:55.230> with<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.380> onboard<00:02:55.860> video<00:02:56.130> that's<00:02:56.580> i'm

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
screen with the onboard video that's i'm

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.740 
screen with the onboard video that's i'm
flying<00:02:57.420> fpv<00:02:57.930> i'm<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.410> really<00:02:58.560> looking<00:02:58.800> at<00:02:59.070> the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
flying fpv i'm not really looking at the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.520 
flying fpv i'm not really looking at the
at<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.810> quad<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:06.240> that's<00:03:07.020> what<00:03:07.260> kind<00:03:07.470> of

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
at the quad and that's what kind of

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.110 
at the quad and that's what kind of
makes<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:07.950> tough<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.400> find<00:03:08.640> there's<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.910> little

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
makes it tough I find there's a little

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.540 
makes it tough I find there's a little
bit<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.510> lag<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.680> sometimes<00:03:11.100> when<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.370> see

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
bit of a lag so sometimes when you see

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.220 
bit of a lag so sometimes when you see
some<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:11.970> jerking<00:03:12.360> motion<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.750> guess<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:13.020> can't

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
some that jerking motion I guess I can't

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.390 
some that jerking motion I guess I can't
bail<00:03:13.470> him<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:13.770> on<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:13.980> way<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.220> that's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
bail him it all on the way and that's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.040 
bail him it all on the way and that's
probably<00:03:14.550> me<00:03:14.940> panicking<00:03:15.420> because<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.780> wasn't

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
probably me panicking because it wasn't

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.210 
probably me panicking because it wasn't
coming<00:03:16.260> back<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.590> way<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.710> wanted<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:19.220> all

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
coming back the way I wanted to all

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.950 
coming back the way I wanted to all
right<00:03:20.400> another<00:03:20.820> quick<00:03:21.090> pass<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.870> the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
right another quick pass in the

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:30.670 
right another quick pass in the
direction<00:03:22.200> there's<00:03:23.040> me<00:03:23.310> go<00:03:23.820> pro<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.060> my<00:03:24.240> head

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.070 

and<00:03:31.680> long<00:03:32.340> run<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.700> probably<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.240> gonna<00:03:33.330> bump

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
and long run to probably just gonna bump

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.660 
and long run to probably just gonna bump
up<00:03:34.230> all<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.590> rates<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:34.950> way<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.220> get<00:03:35.430> full

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
up all the rates that way I get full

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.970 
up all the rates that way I get full
control<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.210> quad<00:03:36.560> right<00:03:37.560> now<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.740> can

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
control of the quad right now you can

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.470 
control of the quad right now you can
see<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> forward<00:03:38.760> motion<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.210> really

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
see that the forward motion is really

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.290 
see that the forward motion is really
limited<00:03:40.280> but<00:03:41.280> once<00:03:41.520> you<00:03:41.670> flick<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:41.940> settings

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
limited but once you flick the settings

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.880 
limited but once you flick the settings
on<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.630> outdoor<00:03:42.900> Hall<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.140> think<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.770> brings

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
on for outdoor Hall I think it brings

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.180 
on for outdoor Hall I think it brings
you<00:03:44.070> up<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.190> close<00:03:44.460> to<00:03:44.610> fifty<00:03:44.880> percent<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.420> the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
you up to close to fifty percent of the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:59.600 
you up to close to fifty percent of the
travel<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.250> guess<00:03:47.400> you'd<00:03:47.550> say

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.140 

but<00:04:00.610> even<00:04:01.360> at<00:04:01.450> those<00:04:01.630> settings<00:04:01.990> it's<00:04:02.290> still

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
but even at those settings it's still

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.520 
but even at those settings it's still
pretty<00:04:04.150> adequate<00:04:04.600> especially<00:04:05.290> for<00:04:05.470> a

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
pretty adequate especially for a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.890 
pretty adequate especially for a
beginner<00:04:05.980> I've<00:04:06.610> been<00:04:06.850> flying<00:04:07.120> for<00:04:07.360> quite<00:04:07.870> a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
beginner I've been flying for quite a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.610 
beginner I've been flying for quite a
while<00:04:08.110> now<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.120> me<00:04:10.570> again<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:11.020> feels<00:04:11.470> a

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
while now so to me again it feels a

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.530 
while now so to me again it feels a
little<00:04:11.680> limited<00:04:12.010> I'm<00:04:12.760> gusting<00:04:13.240> to<00:04:13.270> doing

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
little limited I'm gusting to doing

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.949 
little limited I'm gusting to doing
loops<00:04:13.750> with<00:04:13.930> my<00:04:14.080> mqx<00:04:15.269> which<00:04:16.269> is<00:04:16.390> another<00:04:16.600> micro

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
loops with my mqx which is another micro

loops with my mqx which is another micro
quad<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:18.519> guys<00:04:18.670> haven't<00:04:19.060> seen<00:04:19.269> that<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.630> do

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
quad you guys haven't seen that I do

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.440 
quad you guys haven't seen that I do
have<00:04:20.049> footage<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:23.010> alright<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.450> pretty

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
have footage of it alright so pretty

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.410 
have footage of it alright so pretty
much<00:04:25.570> done<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:25.960> run<00:04:27.030> get<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.090> little<00:04:28.300> bit<00:04:28.390> of

much done this run get a little bit of
