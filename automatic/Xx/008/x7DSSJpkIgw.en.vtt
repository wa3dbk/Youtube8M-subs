00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.429 
to run the light I do have that light
just<00:02:13.340> hanging<00:02:13.879> down<00:02:14.030> from<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.409> from<00:02:15.409> the

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
just hanging down from the from the

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.990 
just hanging down from the from the
rafter<00:02:15.920> there<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:17.769> but<00:02:18.769> it's<00:02:18.890> only<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.220> 60<00:02:19.849> watt

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
rafter there and but it's only a 60 watt

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.180
