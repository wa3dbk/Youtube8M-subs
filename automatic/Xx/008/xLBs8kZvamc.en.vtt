to replace a single a line so the first

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.800 
to replace a single a line so the first
thing<00:00:24.939> we're<00:00:25.089> going<00:00:25.179> to<00:00:25.239> do<00:00:25.390> is<00:00:25.509> we're<00:00:25.689> going

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:29.249 
to go to the good side of the Licklider

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.810 
to go to the good side of the Licklider
for<00:00:30.249> the<00:00:30.460> good<00:00:30.699> line<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:33.219> we're<00:00:33.640> going<00:00:33.789> to

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
for the good line and we're going to

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.000 
for the good line and we're going to
measure<00:00:34.000> from<00:00:35.789> one<00:00:36.789> end<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.300> other<00:00:38.010> just

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:57.560 
measure from one end to the other just
to<00:00:39.100> make<00:00:39.250> sure<00:00:39.280> that<00:00:39.609> this<00:00:39.850> line<00:00:40.090> does<00:00:40.420> match

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.569 

lines<00:00:58.570> looks<00:00:58.899> good<00:00:59.190> now<00:01:00.190> what<00:01:00.339> we're<00:01:00.429> going<00:01:00.519> to

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:25.670 
to replace it with a good line okay
coming<00:03:17.340> down<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.879> very<00:03:18.090> end<00:03:24.560> putting<00:03:25.560> it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
coming down to the very end putting it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.240 
coming down to the very end putting it
exactly<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.700> way<00:03:26.849> we<00:03:27.120> had<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.810> old<00:03:28.290> line

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:54.160 

putting<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.430> through<00:03:32.579> just<00:03:32.909> like<00:03:33.150> that

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.460 

simpler<00:03:55.170> than<00:03:55.379> it<00:03:55.500> looks

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
simpler than it looks

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.460 
simpler than it looks
tighten<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.530> up<00:03:58.590> so<00:04:00.109> we're<00:04:01.109> done<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.290> a

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
tighten it up so we're done with a

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.319 
tighten it up so we're done with a
cascade<00:04:02.040> part<00:04:02.340> now<00:04:02.489> all<00:04:02.670> we<00:04:02.790> have<00:04:02.909> to<00:04:02.970> do<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.209> go

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
cascade part now all we have to do is go

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.110 
cascade part now all we have to do is go
all<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.480> way<00:04:03.540> down<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.920> hook<00:04:05.849> up<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
all the way down and hook up the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.839 
all the way down and hook up the
mountain<00:04:06.949> now<00:04:07.949> that<00:04:08.220> we're<00:04:08.400> back<00:04:08.609> at<00:04:08.760> the

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
mountain now that we're back at the

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.879 
mountain now that we're back at the
other<00:04:09.000> end<00:04:09.239> we<00:04:09.510> want<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.810> place<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.470> lines

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
other end we want to place the a lines

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.300 
other end we want to place the a lines
back<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.400> malian<00:04:12.949> exactly<00:04:13.949> the<00:04:14.069> way<00:04:14.160> we

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
back in the malian exactly the way we

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.279
