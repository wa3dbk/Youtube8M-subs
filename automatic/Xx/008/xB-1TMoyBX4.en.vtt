00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 yes because you trainers who have a field 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.799
 concert and everything seemed to be hey ron 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:13.200
 jans in that spider and 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:15.599
 and am a mighty eagle and then yes luck 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.100
 damage 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.660
 when people were just like me and mattie 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.880
 back for a new episode of 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.850
 her i love it this will be so 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.019
 nice because prepare for the weakest 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.510
 play site 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.490
 in other words, the players with the least strength 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.140
 we just leave it at every position 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.090
 start with the team and my keeper is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.070
 you know who it is you stir your fancy 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.890
 on a scale from one to pizza 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.760
 he just pizza power so little so 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.760
 unbelievable 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.149
 later started with the strongest 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.899
 player from the team and that is nico per 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.050
 week 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.480
 oh oh boy 184 but really a spree it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.160
 brother of coconut head but with 41 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.199
 gets the strongest player out 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.780
 the team a partner in crime is one 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.510
 second strongest games out of 10 rows 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.739
 yes so little expensive armin already agree who 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.500
 this man is bad like the other and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.299
 e39 collar and so these are the little ones 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.640
 player of the team does not happen back 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.990
 quite coincidentally of course not this 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.400
 the two cents neighborhood series always 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.810
 stronger than the line let's continue 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.780
 to the next player and that is 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.880
 the p this ark smit is a guy who 28 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.470
 power hey i really wonder was i in 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.710
 fifa would sit would I have more strength 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.409
 I have to say yes yes not too 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.030
 be strong or so and is still broken little 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.890
 I really can not imagine it 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.470
 we continue to my respect is paul 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.399
 verhaegh no is dwight tiendalli no there 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.320
 is this charming young man he is small 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.240
 so that explains a lot twist 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.940
 I think it right back to those high 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.709
 lives working and boys and they didn't neighborhood 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.299
 pace became more focused at disk 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.009
 where 30 strength is not too much and 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.009
 we go to my midfielder and 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.720
 the first is xavier shabby in that 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.030
 two of them also see such a thin explanation 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.950
 not narrow heads but this guest has 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.479
 28 power quite normal 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.090
 above average then I have another 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.810
 midfielder I believe yes oh yes almost me 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.090
 I think better effort you can do that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.900
 left center is really a great pink 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.880
 it is and he is very small while being 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.760
 it strongly looks like he bases dibasic 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.920
 really so yo i got a job i like the stars 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.890
 and when you see that 25 power 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.689
 then you think so 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.819
 but my favorite player is out of 10 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.969
 this man does need this one then said it 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.459
 man got blind with she's bald really 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:38.040
 my good pema has been with ben to 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.040
 the worst power in the game both 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.719
 21 but both fast and not both 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.909
 bald but then it's time for me 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:48.329
 pointed, this is the closure 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.280
 This is a slackest song in the game 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.519
 barely a year older than I live where where 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.439
 he 24 power 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.109
 yes yes we have to say there we have 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.090
 another bronze spire that is what scratch card 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.829
 not that much for groups 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.450
 oiled quarter hour look at his 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.040
 how much power do you think you have fun there 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.319
 how much power think that is so cool 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.239
 your thing similar to the jacket 70 or so at 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.930
 such a tank do that beard and the cup song 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.180
 the russian she and 27 he gets 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.760
 you know i'm lucky because and one shines 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.400
 pointed are your silver nrt 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.819
 marcos junior and he is thank goodness 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.349
 fucking fast and he also has 27 strength 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.579
 so I can use it I think 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.049
 instead of the other I was almost 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.060

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:36.870

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.780
 your trainers who cosnett a field and 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.060
 everything seemed to have been 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.390
 roy jansen who spin and am a mighty 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.670

 google ears three two year nice man who 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.070
 team played reasonably well due to the speed 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.710
 that they still had but actually duel 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.970
