with the little tiny brush I used and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.259 
with the little tiny brush I used and
then<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.080> use<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> gel<00:02:58.590> eyeliner<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.310> top<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.120> that

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.360 
like white on the inner corner you know
and<00:03:17.040> apparently<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.269> doing<00:03:18.570> lips<00:03:18.780> now

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
and apparently of you doing lips now

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.670 
and apparently of you doing lips now
this<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:20.549> really<00:03:20.670> hard<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.030> narrate<00:03:21.500> all<00:03:22.500> I'm

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
this is really hard to narrate all I'm

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.890 
this is really hard to narrate all I'm
doing<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.160> giving<00:03:23.370> myself<00:03:23.700> chola<00:03:24.209> lips<00:03:24.540> and

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
doing is giving myself chola lips and

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.830 
doing is giving myself chola lips and
then<00:03:25.350> afterwards<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:26.130> fill<00:03:26.370> them<00:03:26.519> in<00:03:26.840> this

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
then afterwards I fill them in this

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.599 
then afterwards I fill them in this
takes<00:03:28.170> me<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.410> really<00:03:28.769> long<00:03:28.890> time<00:03:29.040> because<00:03:29.489> I

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
takes me a really long time because I

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.309 
takes me a really long time because I
always<00:03:29.880> out<00:03:30.239> when<00:03:30.420> my<00:03:30.569> lip<00:03:30.750> shape<00:03:30.989> like

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
differently than it actually is and then

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.819 
differently than it actually is and then
I<00:03:33.239> look<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.870> have<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.170> wipe<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.470> off<00:03:34.590> like
