00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 although all the animes look for 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.580
 entertain not everyone do the same and there 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.839
 a great variety of genres however 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.880
 we always like to see which one is the best 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.700
 so here is our ranking by 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.170
 genres of the season autumn 2003 who 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.969
 know maybe you discover that some animal 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.070
 that did not catch your attention is better 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.720
 of what we expect if you like what 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.520
 we do because you do not give us a gift 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.500
 like and share it with others or tacos 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.359
 if you do not like tell us what we do wrong 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.650
 the comments 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.180
 we start with the first four 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.010
 episodes of sports animes 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 where we will compare the damon no deis 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.230
 jaime no and by raising multiple yoga from 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.520
 Basket 2 icon for the categories that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.320
 we chose in history we are 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.480
 looking for something that highlights the sport is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.219
 protagonists with sports we refer 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.440
 that also explains us rules and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.910
 techniques in addition to animation in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 personality we look for characters 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.570
 diverse that add to the history and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.629
 music would have to highlight what happens 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 on the screen in daimuses we do not like the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.289
 story although it does not seem to have anything of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.149
 special so far for sport 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.920
 they explain a couple of things and the animation 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.350
 It has its own style, although it is lacking 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.000
 more exciting scenes the anime we 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.960
 introduce in various characters so 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 fast and light 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.430
 it's fine to start but we hope 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.590
 development and the music is nice but 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.540
 nothing else 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.100
 we continue with haiti - and then in general 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.930
 it seems like a regular animal in everything 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.700
 look with a little bland humor and fights 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 Unrealistic with movements 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.050
 specials in a lot of dialogue which is 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.060
 normal in the anime the story is very 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.830
 scattered between the characters and it does not help 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.350
 that they do not reintroduce them in any way 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.210
 which drives away new viewers in 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.910
 general does not have much to call us the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.350
 attention in yagua multi pedal la 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.940
 History is more comedy than sport 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 so far however we have learned 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.200
 quite about cycling the music is going 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 according to the subject in general however 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.220
 maybe the weakest thing is the animation in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.899
 the bike scenes the characters 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.090
 could be as strong as they have been 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.740
 interviewed several only missing one 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.450
 introduction officially by 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.220
 Finally we have cured with two eggs 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.080
 that I think is the perfect example of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.940
 how to make a sports anime you 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.229
 we put a 9 in all the categories already 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.880
 that the history of the generation 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.830
 miraculous the kings without crown and the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.810
 curoo curo team is undoubtedly the best 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.820
 in sports of this season with 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.840
 detailed and smooth animations in addition 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.700
 of a rapid pace in the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.769
 clashes and great music 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.000
 in every sense the only one but that could 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.750
 find them is the amount of 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.520
 characters 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.980
 you have to be aware of being 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.540
 season 2 plus however it's easy 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.640
 locate them whenever they appear in 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.530
 screen we'll hope it keeps improving 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.380
 with a final grade of 9 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.350
 obviously then in last place 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.690
 we would have jaime no and with a 5.8 what 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.080
 which is a regular soul then came to 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.690
 very chinese peda with 7.3 damon you do not see with 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.430
 7.7 in second place and cured with ovas 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.730
 came in first with a wide 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.739
 advantage 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.510
 because you still tell us that you thought this 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.370
 in the comments and do not forget 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.700
 like it and share it with others to 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.700
 tacos
