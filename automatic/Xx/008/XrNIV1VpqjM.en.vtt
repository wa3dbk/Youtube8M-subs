and if you notice on the legs I kind of

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.809 
and if you notice on the legs I kind of
made<00:01:15.009> a<00:01:15.039> little<00:01:15.189> bit<00:01:15.459> of<00:01:15.609> a<00:01:15.670> black<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:18.549> me<00:01:18.670> it

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
made a little bit of a black to me it

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.099 
made a little bit of a black to me it
just<00:01:18.850> breaks<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:19.359> up<00:01:19.450> makes<00:01:19.719> it<00:01:19.810> looks<00:01:19.990> more

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
just breaks it up makes it looks more

natural

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
natural

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.899 
natural
that's<00:01:21.369> why<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:21.609> always<00:01:22.329> see<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.929> large<00:01:23.350> marker

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
that's why you always see a large marker

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.879 
that's why you always see a large marker
laying<00:01:24.909> in<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.149> bottom<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.509> my<00:01:25.600> dug<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:26.859> a

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:26.889 
laying in the bottom of my dug and on a

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:30.949 
laying in the bottom of my dug and on a
frog<00:01:27.219> all<00:01:28.029> you<00:01:28.509> do<00:01:28.689> is<00:01:28.959> just<00:01:29.590> pull<00:01:29.799> it<00:01:29.950> tight

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
frog all you do is just pull it tight

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.059 
frog all you do is just pull it tight
and<00:01:31.959> then<00:01:32.139> I<00:01:32.229> just<00:01:32.409> go<00:01:32.560> around<00:01:32.679> it<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:36.009> that

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
and then I just go around it like that

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.880 
and then I just go around it like that
and<00:01:36.549> I<00:01:36.609> do<00:01:36.670> some<00:01:36.999> rings<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.479> it

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.970 

it's<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:40.610> pretty<00:01:40.850> quick<00:01:41.090> modification<00:01:41.930> but<00:01:42.800> to

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
it's a pretty quick modification but to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.230 
it's a pretty quick modification but to
me<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.280> just<00:01:43.310> gives<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.820> more<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.120> a<00:01:44.210> natural

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
me it just gives it more of a natural

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.010 
me it just gives it more of a natural
look<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:49.160> it<00:01:49.400> works<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.480> have<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.750> lot<00:01:50.990> of

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
look and it works so I have a lot of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.210 
look and it works so I have a lot of
confidence<00:01:51.650> in<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.900> break<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:54.050> up<00:01:54.260> especially

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
confidence in it break it up especially

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.590 
confidence in it break it up especially
if<00:01:55.310> I'm<00:01:55.430> throw<00:01:55.640> throw<00:01:56.000> them<00:01:56.120> like<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.270> white

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
one that's not even modified yet a lot

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.000 
one that's not even modified yet a lot
of<00:02:22.760> frogs<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.270> buy<00:02:23.420> have<00:02:23.720> really<00:02:24.380> long

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
of frogs that you buy have really long

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.080 
of frogs that you buy have really long
legs<00:02:25.510> if<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.660> have<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.870> lot<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.350> drag<00:02:28.090> behind

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
legs if you have a lot of drag behind

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.530 
legs if you have a lot of drag behind
the<00:02:29.510> hooks<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.890> bait<00:02:31.070> will<00:02:31.310> not<00:02:31.580> walk<00:02:31.910> side<00:02:32.330> to

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
the hooks the bait will not walk side to

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.210 
the hooks the bait will not walk side to
side<00:02:32.780> because<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.440> like<00:02:33.620> an<00:02:33.770> anchor

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
side because you have like an anchor

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.340 
side because you have like an anchor
back<00:02:34.430> there<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.300> one<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.600> first<00:02:35.780> things<00:02:36.110> I

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
back there so one of the first things I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.699 
back there so one of the first things I
do<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.700> like<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.060> trim<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.690> lot<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.500> length

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
do is I like to trim a lot of the length

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.140 
do is I like to trim a lot of the length
of<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.950> leg<00:02:40.130> off<00:02:41.560> pair<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.680> scissors<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.630> cut

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
of the leg off pair of scissors and cut

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.509 
of the leg off pair of scissors and cut
that's<00:02:47.150> about<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.570> length<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:48.350> I<00:02:48.410> like<00:02:48.769> then

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
that's about the length that I like then

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.360 
that's about the length that I like then
I'll<00:02:49.610> take<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.030> white<00:02:50.269> belly<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:52.220> my

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.370 

and<00:03:03.910> just<00:03:04.090> kind<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.300> mark<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.630> up<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.810> little<00:03:04.930> bit

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
and just kind of mark it up a little bit

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.190 
and just kind of mark it up a little bit
break<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.400> up<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:06.790> I'll<00:03:07.300> even<00:03:07.570> take<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.020> white

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
legs and do the same thing with a little

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:20.940 
legs and do the same thing with a little
bit<00:03:11.410> of<00:03:11.440> black<00:03:11.650> on<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.830> other

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
bit of black on it the other

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.220 
bit of black on it the other
modification<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:21.940> can<00:03:22.240> do<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.630> Frog<00:03:22.900> is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
modification that you can do the Frog is

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.390 
modification that you can do the Frog is
you<00:03:23.800> can<00:03:23.920> add<00:03:24.070> weight<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.610> inside<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.270> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you can add weight to the inside of it a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.150 
you can add weight to the inside of it a
rattle<00:03:27.400> system<00:03:27.820> works<00:03:28.030> real<00:03:28.300> well<00:03:28.920> or<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.100> can

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
rattle system works real well or you can

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.790 
rattle system works real well or you can
actually<00:03:30.430> add<00:03:30.730> weight<00:03:31.150> if<00:03:31.900> I'm<00:03:32.140> fishing<00:03:32.350> mats

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
actually add weight if I'm fishing mats

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.100 
actually add weight if I'm fishing mats
that<00:03:33.070> are<00:03:33.340> real<00:03:33.550> heavy<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.240> I'm<00:03:34.570> keen<00:03:34.870> on<00:03:35.080> a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
that are real heavy and I'm keen on a

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.160 
that are real heavy and I'm keen on a
frog<00:03:36.150> then<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.180> like<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.480> add<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.630> lot<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:37.930> weight

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
frog then I like to add a lot of weight

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.860 
frog then I like to add a lot of weight
to<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.470> Frog<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.910> make<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.240> move<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.660> mat

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
to the Frog to make it move the mat

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.130 
to the Frog to make it move the mat
because<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.470> if<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.950> mat<00:03:42.160> is<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:43.450> thick<00:03:43.840> a

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
because of if the mat is that thick a

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.690 
because of if the mat is that thick a
lot<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.470> times<00:03:44.650> your<00:03:44.830> frog<00:03:45.040> grew<00:03:45.250> over<00:03:45.400> top<00:03:45.610> of

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
lot of times your frog grew over top of

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.890 
lot of times your frog grew over top of
the<00:03:45.760> fish<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.180> fish<00:03:46.300> can't<00:03:46.600> detect

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
the fish and the fish can't detect

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.130 
the fish and the fish can't detect
anything<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:48.130> I<00:03:48.190> like<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.400> heavy<00:03:48.820> frog<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:50.050> know

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
anything so I like a heavy frog you know

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.870 
anything so I like a heavy frog you know
something<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.560> will<00:03:50.740> push<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.610> mat<00:03:51.850> a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
something that will push the mat a

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.970 
something that will push the mat a
little<00:03:52.180> bit<00:03:52.360> just<00:03:52.990> add<00:03:53.230> weight<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.709> Frog

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
little bit just add weight to the Frog

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.070 
little bit just add weight to the Frog
you<00:03:54.190> don't<00:03:54.370> care<00:03:54.520> if<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:54.790> floats<00:03:55.000> or<00:03:55.180> not<00:03:55.360> and

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
you don't care if it floats or not and

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.600 
you don't care if it floats or not and
that<00:03:56.260> works<00:03:56.440> real<00:03:56.650> good<00:03:56.680> just<00:03:57.160> simple<00:03:57.520> little

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
that works real good just simple little

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.000 
that works real good just simple little
modifications<00:03:58.360> like<00:03:58.420> that<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.709> make<00:03:59.830> the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
modifications like that to make the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.350 
modifications like that to make the
difference<00:04:00.340> between<00:04:00.520> catching<00:04:01.060> a<00:04:01.120> few<00:04:01.330> fish

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
difference between catching a few fish

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.740 
difference between catching a few fish
and<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.780> whole<00:04:01.959> lot<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.260> fashion
