really slow the bait sacks give us one
restraint<00:00:52.900> and<00:00:53.110> water<00:00:53.379> seconding<00:00:54.010> have<00:00:54.519> a

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
restraint and water seconding have a

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.049 
restraint and water seconding have a
lotta<00:00:54.879> action<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.960> click<00:00:56.350> are<00:00:56.530> not<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:57.059> debate

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
lotta action and click are not to debate

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.200 
lotta action and click are not to debate
it<00:00:58.600> has<00:00:58.899> low<00:00:59.110> action<00:00:59.379> it's<00:01:00.010> just<00:01:00.219> as<00:01:00.370> hard<00:01:00.610> as

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
it has low action it's just as hard as

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.900 
it has low action it's just as hard as
making<00:01:01.660> a<00:01:01.840> baked<00:01:02.050> an<00:01:02.230> asshat<00:01:02.590> so<00:01:03.430> this<00:01:03.879> is

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
making a baked an asshat so this is

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.330 
making a baked an asshat so this is
meant<00:01:04.270> to<00:01:04.390> running<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:05.050> introduced<00:01:05.890> shaft

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
meant to running a introduced shaft

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.630 
meant to running a introduced shaft
water<00:01:06.720> swim<00:01:07.720> straight<00:01:08.200> doesn't<00:01:09.160> really<00:01:09.310> jump

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
water swim straight doesn't really jump

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.130 
water swim straight doesn't really jump
around<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.970> lot<00:01:10.119> but<00:01:10.330> it's<00:01:10.509> not<00:01:10.660> a<00:01:10.690> threat<00:01:10.960> it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
around a lot but it's not a threat it

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.529 
around a lot but it's not a threat it
just<00:01:11.320> went<00:01:11.530> straight<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:12.550> he<00:01:12.850> decided<00:01:13.390> that

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
just went straight so he decided that

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.050 
just went straight so he decided that
one<00:01:14.050> of<00:01:14.080> techniques<00:01:14.649> is<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.430> make<00:01:15.580> product

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
one of techniques is to make product

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.029 
one of techniques is to make product
that<00:01:16.180> just<00:01:16.450> goes<00:01:16.630> straight<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:17.560> imitate<00:01:18.009> that

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
that just goes straight to imitate that

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.060 
that just goes straight to imitate that
type<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:18.880> just<00:01:19.240> not<00:01:19.750> trends<00:01:20.200> don't<00:01:20.530> rate<00:01:20.800> so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
type of a just not trends don't rate so

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.029 
type of a just not trends don't rate so
that's<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.910> quick<00:01:22.210> learners<00:01:22.570> design<00:01:23.039> this

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
that's the quick learners design this

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.359 
that's the quick learners design this
actually<00:01:24.369> has<00:01:24.759> a<00:01:25.479> hole<00:01:26.020> in<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.320> mouth<00:01:26.530> so

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
actually has a hole in the mouth so

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.550 
actually has a hole in the mouth so
water<00:01:27.670> will<00:01:27.789> actually<00:01:27.940> go<00:01:28.390> through<00:01:28.439> chat<00:01:29.439> is<00:01:29.530> a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
water will actually go through chat is a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.560 
water will actually go through chat is a
little<00:01:29.830> slipping<00:01:30.250> gills<00:01:30.930> water<00:01:32.400> bottles

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
little slipping gills water bottles

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.510 
little slipping gills water bottles
later<00:01:34.570> time<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:35.229> little<00:01:35.590> water<00:01:35.950> movement<00:01:36.280> that

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
later time a little water movement that

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.190 
later time a little water movement that
comes<00:01:36.790> out<00:01:36.970> of<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.119> gills<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.570> fish<00:01:37.600> can<00:01:37.900> sense

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
comes out of the gills of fish can sense

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.800 
comes out of the gills of fish can sense
that<00:01:38.409> again<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.549> we<00:01:39.670> got<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.850> tail<00:01:40.329> that<00:01:40.360> helps

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
that again that we got a tail that helps

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.109 
that again that we got a tail that helps
table<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.470> thus<00:01:41.619> will<00:01:41.770> fish<00:01:42.040> swim<00:01:42.759> straight

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
table and thus will fish swim straight

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.870 
table and thus will fish swim straight
in<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.390> water<00:01:43.420> just<00:01:44.020> like

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
in the water just like

it's<00:02:34.560> if<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.160> see<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.460> veins<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.940> color

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
it's if you can see the veins to color

and the bottom half debate has a higher

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.630 
and the bottom half debate has a higher
salt<00:02:39.510> concentration<00:02:39.890> then<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.980> top<00:02:41.190> half<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640

little Bowl is back here that's me to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.380 
little Bowl is back here that's me to
keep<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.230> tail<00:02:52.440> statement<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.280> they've<00:02:54.090> even

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
keep the tail statement and they've even

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.980 
keep the tail statement and they've even
gone

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990

that's near to have a split-tail and see

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.680 
that's near to have a split-tail and see
it<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.200> tails<00:02:59.440> split<00:03:00.240> it's<00:03:01.240> such<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> small

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
it the tails split it's such a small

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.650 
it the tails split it's such a small
little<00:03:02.230> bait<00:03:02.980> mr.<00:03:03.490> small<00:03:03.730> design<00:03:04.120> actually

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
little bait mr. small design actually

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.530 
little bait mr. small design actually
vibrates<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.590> then<00:03:06.190> exhale

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
vibrates and then exhale

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.830 
vibrates and then exhale
so<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.890> emotion<00:03:09.900> technique<00:03:10.900> by<00:03:11.590> shad

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
so this is the emotion technique by shad

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.750 
so this is the emotion technique by shad
4.8<00:03:13.840> sighs<00:03:14.079> we're<00:03:14.439> going<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.650> start<00:03:14.980> with<00:03:15.069> and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
4.8 sighs we're going to start with and

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
really your line of straight your made

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.970 
really your line of straight your made
it<00:03:20.180> straight<00:03:20.450> probably<00:03:21.140> about<00:03:21.290> before<00:03:21.680> six

it straight probably about before six
pound<00:03:22.190> test<00:03:22.400> line<00:03:22.510> something<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:23.900> we

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
pound test line something like that we

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.860 
pound test line something like that we
put<00:03:24.800> to<00:03:24.920> be<00:03:25.010> out<00:03:25.300> soon<00:03:26.300> now<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:26.450> actually
