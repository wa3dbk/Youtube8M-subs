00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
honest is you guys already like this we

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.559 
honest is you guys already like this we
switched<00:02:37.189> it<00:02:37.370> out<00:02:37.430> over<00:02:37.639> the<00:02:37.819> weekend<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
switched it out over the weekend the

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.179 
switched it out over the weekend the
desks<00:02:39.019> for<00:02:39.049> that<00:02:39.349> which<00:02:39.500> really<00:02:39.739> changes<00:02:40.159> the

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
desks for that which really changes the

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.979 
desks for that which really changes the
whole<00:02:40.250> setup<00:02:40.639> I<00:02:40.939> think<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.510> looks<00:02:41.629> really<00:02:41.689> nice

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
whole setup I think it looks really nice

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.569 
whole setup I think it looks really nice
in<00:02:42.049> my<00:02:42.230> opinion<00:02:42.290> again<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.099> chair<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.459> so

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
in my opinion again this chair is so

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.369 
in my opinion again this chair is so
comfortable<00:02:44.269> but<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.510> think<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.780> DX<00:02:45.049> racer1

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
comfortable but I think a DX racer1

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.349 
comfortable but I think a DX racer1
would<00:02:45.650> fit<00:02:45.799> nicer<00:02:46.129> my<00:02:46.609> dad's<00:02:46.819> sure<00:02:47.090> look<00:02:47.269> at

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
would fit nicer my dad's sure look at

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.000 
would fit nicer my dad's sure look at
that<00:02:47.450> that's<00:02:47.569> slackin<00:02:48.109> DX<00:02:48.379> racer<00:02:48.680> who<00:02:48.829> come
