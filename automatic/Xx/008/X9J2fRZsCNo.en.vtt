00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.320
 Federal Defense Minister de Maiziere comments on the attack in 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.320
 Afghanistan where a soldier died 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.649
 KR 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:16.139
 I have the today 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.810
 sad duty 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.359
 she and the 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.650
 German at maturity 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.359
 over a momentous stop 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.339
 in german so data in Afghanistan 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.289
 to teach 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.900
 in this attack is a German soldier 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.430
 like 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.490
 At the moment we also know about a broader German soldier 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.840
 the easy one 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.880
 and an Afghan language with Fler 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.880
 the middle-wounded 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.230
 for medical care and Weber cooling was prompt 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.280
 initiated 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.440
 the wounded were Jens ambulances from the Kunduz 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.180
 brought to further care 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.190
 this plot also belongs 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.700
 he meets us 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.660
 my heart 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.440
 it was a coward 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.520
 anonymous explosive stop 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.520
 of a young man literally out of life 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.120
 has torn 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.320
 this plot underlines 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.590
 under which big dangers 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.960
 our soldiers 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.530
 in Afghanistan 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.960
 their service 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.100
 for our safety 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.690
 and her mission 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.750
 fulfill 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 our soldiers are certainly good 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.150
 and well equipped 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.850
 yet it can not be a hundred percent Schoeps 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.340
 the fulfillment of your order 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.140
 If necessary, our own soldiers also demand their own lives 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 To use health 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.530
 that distinguishes the occupation of the soldier 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.500
 from all the others 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.460
 This reminds us of today 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.769
 with brutal 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.179
 clarity 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.009
 the use of our soldiers 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.129
 and we victims 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.580
 commit ourselves in the arrangement for peace and stability 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.329
 and so on together too 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.139
 for our own in safety 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.709
 to subside 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.919
 we are making progress in Afghanistan 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.319
 we have the right strategy 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.319
 and we will continue to enforce this strategy 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.499
 because even 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.429
 there are jarring Dold punches 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.439
 how to go today 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.599
 and there such a risk 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.189
 exists as well 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.959
 in the future 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.249
 grape 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.189
 around this fallen comrade 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.469
 the whole Bundeswehr 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.959
 for a good one 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.269
 comrades 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.019
 our thoughts are with the relatives 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.049
 and families 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.479
 May they find comfort and help 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.559
 is so good 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.339
 also honored 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:15.979
 and we try them
