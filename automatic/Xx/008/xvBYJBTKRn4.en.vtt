00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.680 
so because they are ready earlier they
started<00:05:17.020> to<00:05:17.110> read<00:05:17.320> their<00:05:17.620> books<00:05:17.890> in<00:05:18.690> Finland

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
started to read their books in Finland

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.200

teachers<00:05:20.290> recognize<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.340> embrace<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.970> fact

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
teachers recognize and embrace the fact

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.930 
teachers recognize and embrace the fact
that<00:05:22.420> students<00:05:23.200> learn<00:05:23.530> at<00:05:23.890> different<00:05:23.940> paces

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
that students learn at different paces

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.810 
that students learn at different paces
so<00:05:25.870> it's<00:05:26.050> common<00:05:26.500> for<00:05:26.530> classes<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:27.400> be<00:05:27.490> working

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
so it's common for classes to be working

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.150 
so it's common for classes to be working
on<00:05:27.970> several<00:05:28.300> assignments<00:05:28.990> at<00:05:29.110> once<00:05:29.350> while<00:05:29.980> the
