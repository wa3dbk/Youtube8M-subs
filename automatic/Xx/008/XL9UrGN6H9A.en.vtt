00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
cases you'll find that nearly all of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
cases you'll find that nearly all of
them<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.420> punch<00:01:36.720> cards<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.320> they'll<00:01:37.500> see

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
them have on punch cards so they'll see

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
bulky he's probably the wrong material I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.479 
bulky he's probably the wrong material I
think<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:09.090> doesn't<00:02:09.300> hang<00:02:09.599> properly

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
think and just doesn't hang properly

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.520 
think and just doesn't hang properly
also<00:02:11.489> he<00:02:11.879> actually<00:02:12.150> looks<00:02:12.330> at<00:02:12.450> his<00:02:12.569> best<00:02:12.810> silly

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
also he actually looks at his best silly

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.090 
also he actually looks at his best silly
the<00:02:13.620> car<00:02:13.800> once<00:02:14.130> comes<00:02:14.370> out<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> car<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.569> coat

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
the car once comes out the car that coat

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.750 
the car once comes out the car that coat
bolts<00:02:17.100> up<00:02:17.250> even<00:02:17.610> further<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:19.080> then<00:02:19.319> becomes

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
bolts up even further and then becomes

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.460 
bolts up even further and then becomes
even<00:02:20.760> more<00:02:20.790> odd<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.330> look<00:02:21.510> at<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> character

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
even more odd to look at as a character

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.190 
even more odd to look at as a character
so<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.520> bit<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.790> shame<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.690> far<00:02:24.990> as

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
so that's a bit of a shame as far as

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.830 
so that's a bit of a shame as far as
accessories<00:02:26.160> concern<00:02:26.610> he<00:02:27.240> comes<00:02:27.540> with<00:02:27.690> his

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
accessories concern he comes with his

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.930 
accessories concern he comes with his
snake<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:29.459> cloak<00:02:29.790> his<00:02:30.480> necklace<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.940> walking

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
snake the cloak his necklace and walking

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.820 
snake the cloak his necklace and walking
stick

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
stick

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.690 
stick
he<00:02:34.830> has<00:02:34.980> articulation<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.209> his<00:02:37.100> neck<00:02:38.100> his

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
he has articulation to his neck his

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.449 
he has articulation to his neck his
wrist<00:02:39.150> his<00:02:39.540> waist<00:02:39.900> hips<00:02:40.650> shoulders<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
wrist his waist hips shoulders and

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.199 
wrist his waist hips shoulders and
elbows<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.069> think<00:02:44.220> also<00:02:44.550> all<00:02:44.940> things

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
elbows so I think also all things

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.370 
elbows so I think also all things
considered<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.780> he<00:02:45.840> probably<00:02:45.989> doesn't<00:02:46.200> look

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
considered and he probably doesn't look

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:59.380 
considered and he probably doesn't look
too<00:02:46.680> bad<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:47.010> nine<00:02:47.190> hundred<00:02:47.370> years<00:02:47.550> old

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:10.610
