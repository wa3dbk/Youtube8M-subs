kind<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.570> driving<00:01:33.990> around<00:01:34.079> staying<00:01:34.560> along<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
kind of driving around staying along the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
kind of driving around staying along the
outside<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.420> need<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.780> more

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
outside because I just need one more

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.609

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.530 
kill I don't want to be silly or
anything<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.100> got<00:01:41.250> about<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> minute<00:01:41.909> 15<00:01:42.090> on

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
anything and I got about a minute 15 on

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.179 
anything and I got about a minute 15 on
the<00:01:42.630> clock<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.140> left<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.590> we're<00:01:43.799> doing<00:01:44.070> this

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the clock and left so we're doing this

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.969 
the clock and left so we're doing this
in<00:01:44.369> real<00:01:45.000> good<00:01:45.299> time<00:01:45.509> I'm<00:01:46.500> sure<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.920> not

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
in real good time I'm sure it's not

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.550 
in real good time I'm sure it's not
anywhere<00:01:47.490> close<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> record<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.689> I'll

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
anywhere close to record time but I'll

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.540 
anywhere close to record time but I'll
take<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.190 

so<00:01:53.550> there<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:53.910> just<00:01:54.090> snuck<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:54.750> behind<00:01:54.780> them

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
so there we go just snuck up behind them

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.650 
so there we go just snuck up behind them
