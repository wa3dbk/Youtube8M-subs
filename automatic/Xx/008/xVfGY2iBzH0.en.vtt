I'll put a link in the description okay
let's<00:02:22.360> try<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.600> next<00:02:22.810> one

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.710 

water<00:02:28.470> put<00:02:29.470> them<00:02:29.590> in<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> water<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.540> best

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
water put them in the water is the best

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.870 
water put them in the water is the best

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
way to fill them up and not hold them in

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.830 
way to fill them up and not hold them in
the<00:02:33.940> air<00:02:33.970> because<00:02:34.330> they'll<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.600> start

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the air because they'll just start

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:46.420 
the air because they'll just start
falling

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430
