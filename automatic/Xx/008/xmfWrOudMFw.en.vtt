00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
were working on but we ended up with a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
were working on but we ended up with a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.180 
and so we had a lot of extra units
laying<00:02:01.319> around<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.770> needed<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> figure

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
laying around that we needed to figure

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.370 
laying around that we needed to figure
out<00:02:02.399> what<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.789> were<00:02:02.910> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.179> do<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:03.810> so

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
out what we were going to do it and so

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
out what we were going to do it and so
someone<00:02:04.950> approached<00:02:05.220> me<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.550> said<00:02:05.789> we<00:02:06.330> need

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
someone approached me and said we need

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.779 
someone approached me and said we need
to<00:02:06.539> create<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.170> game<00:02:07.349> to<00:02:07.679> use<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.280> arcade

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to create a game to use up these arcade

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.999 
to create a game to use up these arcade
machines<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.360> haven't<00:02:09.720> sold<00:02:09.899> well<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.920> why

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
machines that haven't sold well so why

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.890 
machines that haven't sold well so why
don't<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.190> work<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.060> together<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.870> I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
don't we work on this together and so I

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.930 
don't we work on this together and so I
started<00:02:13.260> by<00:02:13.380> kind<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.800> drawing<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.610> art<00:02:14.760> for

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
started by kind of drawing the art for

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.180 
started by kind of drawing the art for
my<00:02:14.970> game<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.480> working<00:02:16.050> as<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> director<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:16.890> it

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
my game and working as a director on it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.330 
my game and working as a director on it
and<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.400> game<00:02:17.849> turned<00:02:18.120> into<00:02:18.420> donkey<00:02:19.020> kong

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
and that game turned into donkey kong

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.160 
and that game turned into donkey kong
which<00:02:20.340> ended<00:02:20.700> up<00:02:20.760> selling<00:02:21.000> rather<00:02:21.599> well<00:02:21.870> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
which ended up selling rather well and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.220
