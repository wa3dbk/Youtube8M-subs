00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.300
 Sven Kirsten has to take quite hard but the gong saved him 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.039
 but let's start from scratch 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.739
 around 19 clock fills the Schweinfurt ice rink where where 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.660

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.780
 around it around 1000 500 boxes enthusiastic fans looking forward to tough fights 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.000
 among them also the patron Gudrun Grieser 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.320
 until the main fight they had to wait a bit longer five preliminary fights were 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.720
 on the program 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.840
 here was already fierce and the spectators of high-class martial arts 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 necessary 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.080
 Afterwards the freestyle kung-fu world champion Michael MÃ¶ller is driving 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.290
 his breathtaking stunts set the mood in good time at the peak 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.490
 meanwhile, Sven Kirst is preparing his minivan for the teams 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.420
 forthcoming fight before 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.210
 then it finally started in the Eistobel it stopped no more spectators 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 his place as the two boxers need to bring 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.140
 after the national anthems, the referee wishes earners crack both 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.659
 still a fair fight and then he sounds very anxious the gong to 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.070
 first round and both boxers love to go immediately 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.790
 No sign of fear and careful touch Swank shows funny 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.860
 In the first rounds, this is a title to defend at all costs 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.560
 but his opponent Tommy Bach from America shows little impressed 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.560
 and found after initial problems more and more in the fight 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.490
 then finally the sixth round 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.260
 three goats rashes 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 and finally the redeeming gate 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.049
 Sven Kirsten Band visibly battered back into his corner 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.709
 he comes had the save but the 38-year-old Schonunger he gets 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.529
 We quickly develop a fight at the highest level 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.959
 Now you notice both fighters on the exhaustion and both are hard 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.249
 Hits 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.419
 however, both fighters bite until the end of the twelfth round 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.950
 and then it is finally done 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.400
 the fighters and caretakers tear their arms in the air all are now excited 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.409
 how the judges saw the upcoming rounds 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.120
 and then the result of death to confusion but then it is clear and decided that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.529
 If Kirsten has not won the fight but his title, however 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:45.949
 successfully defended 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.189
 Giant cheers break out among the 1000 500 spectators at the Americans 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.419
 However, this verdict encounters a lot of incomprehension
