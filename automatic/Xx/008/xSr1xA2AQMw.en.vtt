 while mixing the ingredients and 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.429

 now you see this whole egg of the 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:50.639
 left of rafael 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.920
 or a cup of oil what I'm 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:01:04.440
 doing I'm using a container of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:07.770
 glass and sense reads that same flight can be 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.590
 A snack can eat a pie jewelry 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.280
 cool to go to your house 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.710
 It does not heat up so it can be the secret of 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.450
 goal here people look you can 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.350
 even before turning water 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.189
 I say all the flour that was made here 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.049
 on my side my meal took over in 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.619
 kingdom of flour balls 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.659
 then this book guaranteed to succeed 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.640
 I'll put half a cup of water to 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.640
 heat in the microwave for 30 seconds 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:59.149
 ball you will control the water you 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:03.959
 You can feel the mass of the cake in the milonga. 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.719
 me but a little softer than a 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.509
 mass in a conventional manner 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.920
 remembering that this mass can be roasted 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.459
 in the conventional oven 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.290
 which is today's tip will do will 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:22.079
 being is you will catch the same breed 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.940
 ideal is not to pass the middle he has to 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.940
 have room to grow 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.329
 how much time of 40 seconds did I get 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.329
 I'll start with 40 seconds of good play 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:48.430
 after forty weeks, look what 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.239
 wonder this good test goes good plays 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.780
 clean 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.200
 I will say in what the second step without 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.349
 make noise here doing great that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.660
 such more shaving as 40 seconds 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.660
 it hurts five minutes to recipe 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:24.190
 Let's have a big dry time. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:28.160
 Look at this test drive tape and now 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.640

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.880
 this Chinese xichangana thing 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.160
 so today we will make ganache one 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.070
 Battle novelty is the cream of milk. 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.050
 of the launching pitch here on the coast of Cati 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.010

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.030
 500 grams of chocolate can break into 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.570
 smaller pieces smaller if we go there 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.500
 analyze this chocolate boot has to be 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:08.840

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:13.360
 start with 10 minutes in a microwave 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.769

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.419
 go goal 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:27.190
 the heat that is in the remaining chocolate 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:30.510
 is melting to exist and never 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.510

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:17.140
 the one who believes and stay 10 more 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.140

 phishing 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:44.779
 the old 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.910
 I talked to our cookie of glory. 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:07:09.080

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.820
 easy to make five minutes with the goal 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.470

 crew is more enjoyable and then only 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:37.470
 wonderful package that I believe 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.470
