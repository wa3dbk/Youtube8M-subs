00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello welcome to kitchen with carmen today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.850
 I'm going to make homemade mayonnaise and I'm going to 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.950
 teach some tricks so you do not 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.690
 cut and we receive more days and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.519
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.980
 the following one egg at temperature 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.800
 environment sunflower or olive oil 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.020
 soft a pinch of salt and a dash of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 vinegar or lemon juice first thing 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.920
 what I'm going to do is facilitate the egg 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 well the morning is now it lasted much longer 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.789
 time and so we will avoid the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.949
 bacteria such as salmonellosis 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.380
 but if you want you can jump to this 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.480
 step and to pasteurize the egg what 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.460
 I have done is put with a saucepan and with the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.210
 open plate over medium low heat I 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.710
 waited for it to reach 61 degrees celsius 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 and this is the time to leave the egg 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.850
 submerged 4 minutes or this temperature and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.579
 once it has passed the four minutes 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.110
 I turn off the wta plate and set it aside and I go to 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.110
 cool it with cold water 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.040
 Now I have put the egg in a glass 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.230
 beater and I'll take the oil that 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.230
 will be three times the volume of the egg 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.220
 to prevent it from being cut I'm going to leave 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.810
 stand for 5 minutes the oil and the egg 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.790
 so that both of them catch the same 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.850
 now I'm going to salt 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.620
 and the vinegar or lemon juice 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.560
 then put in the blender 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.750
 hand in the background and left like this for 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.110
 about one minute at speed 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.110
 low 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.350
 after the minute we will raise it 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.740
 and crouching gently until you're 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.740
 made 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.260
 and after a few seconds as you can 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.510
 see the morning is already ready and the 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.520
 I'm going to move to a container and like 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.659
 you can see after moving it is very 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.659
 soft 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.909
 and as the egg is pasteurized the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.009
 mayonnaise as well as a film or put in a 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.750
 glass jar we put it in the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.909
 refrigerator and it can last us until a 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.229
 week and if you liked my recipes
