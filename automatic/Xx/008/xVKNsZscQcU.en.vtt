00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.700
 good guys like always and even talk 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.400
 today I returned to me I enjoy it 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.440
 today I am the only help because 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.710
 practically if you do n't know gianni you are 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.439
 broken help pc assist and of course 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.659
 there is someone who helps me gianni you are 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.249
 broken the pc and therefore being missed 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:24.609
 let's say the last group of me enjoy it 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:26.859
 where we had done that had made a 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.829
 the presentation of the new dcc here I am 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.480
 here alone on cruz which happens to be the 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.650
 my favorite map of this new 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.600
 package so I have to say to be 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.160
 quite satisfied for now there is 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.590
 someone who is shooting me from behind 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.960
 so we stop for a moment to rest 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.700
 we catch our breath and then leave again 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.910
 deathmatch because essentially 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.340
 help because in the domain I would like to have one 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.710
 team that will help me a little 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.690
 instead the match let's say you can play 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.750
 more solo and then a game that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.550
 however it lasts less 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.100
 I know so much that I have the wrong weapons because 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.379
 otherwise after that, after all, they are there 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.990
 clashes both from the short and the long 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.940
 distance and therefore a weapon like the n 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.900
 perhaps it would have been perfect though 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.900
 with my mp 7 I can get by now 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.420
 let's find out where he went to 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.820
 hunt this cunning nemi I get 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.500
 always behind as if you had us 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.150
 written kill me behind that more 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.120
 funny 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.490
 ok we took him now too if here 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.490
 I have seen an enemy there 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.950
 it doesn't go down to us dead a moment 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.069
 had taken badly because I continued to 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.659
 shoot him and didn't go down he didn't want to 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.130
 dying was too close to life 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.319
 for goodness sake, a beautiful thing to be 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.329
 stick to life but what the fuck I am 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.340
 saying that what is killed is killed 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.990
 grenade meanwhile I'm delirious but later 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.709
 all this is smog 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.119
 where are you that say sodium there is a 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.920
 sniper down there it seems that I don't 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.329
 I've never seen it before, I've seen it is 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.219
 I just wanted to take this first 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.349
 target and then go back to 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.719
 mating it maybe didn't see me on 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:11.519
 serious though that is a little where one is 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.140
 went to is there that you live save me 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.760
 perfect then or rewards maybe a little 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.030
 too high now that I think about it 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.379
 because a stealth helicopter is really 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.090
 difficult node to take deathmatch 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.329
 also because the game is as short as I have 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.120
 said before and we say that it is not so 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:33.870
 easy to do all these kilos without ever 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.099
 dying shit sniper now chasing him 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.019
 he chases the snipers all over the place 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.859
 map let's see where it went to 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:45.190
 hunt down here with someone 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.950
 1 and 2 from now would serve a flag 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.109
 pity that it is not another domain 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.209
 chille I should have the helicopter because 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:56.290
 how funny the apples alone and then not 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:00.030
 I'll take help 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.370
 go we have the helicopter wait for a 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.889
 fuck but I'm an idiot I had to wait 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.319
 half a second then I would be safe 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.480
 try well i wanted to run like mine 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.050
 usually and unfortunately this choice is not me 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.290
 rewarded then we enter the 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.040
 in the fuselage of the plane now 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.640
 unused and see 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.260
 ok there's no one here even so 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.870
 rush into the middle of the map another enemy 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.780
 who also flees another who escapes who he is 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.490
 who is trying to knock him down yes there is 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.680
 someone who does too much of the funny guy from 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.240
 I think these parts are you who are 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.340
 you want to come down here come here where 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.750
 ago where you run you ok menage abused on 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.950
 I was seriously thinking he was joking 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.480
 instead in the year of madonna you do not create 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.390
 pile they haven't thrown up seriously 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.300
 after 20 seconds help 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.190
 ok they just devastated me at gand e 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.860
 then 41 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.420
 we are there, that is, they are also beating us 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.120
 they need but will find today I have spread out in 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.880
 the middle of da but need the moment 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.980
 take the team's reins 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.340

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:17.230

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.350
 come here come here madonna I was going to 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.180
 bring back both of you 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.460
 where I knew 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.990

 I could live without then eye 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.910

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.760
