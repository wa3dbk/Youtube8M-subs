00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.850
 Dear friends, we are here in 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.540
 beautiful 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.940
 5 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.079
 The 12 o'clock noon seats therefore 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.520
 I looked for a shady cookie 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.879
 and now there's a second one 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.879
 politics 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.650
 fucking on zwickau very much horny here 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.119
 yes, yes 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.240
 basement, cellar 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.060
 so i'm back from zwickau and 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.340
 louder now I have about 750 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.570
 kilometer related after that 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.820
 that's how you do not know that 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.220
 direct route from main road detour 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.620
 and you drive but constantly 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.280
 the 750 kilometers were ready 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.170
 without breakdown and a disc acute service 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.190
 to perform 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.330
 At this point it is time for 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.700
 a little feedback to the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.770
 event itself and at first 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.710
 first place a very nice greeting 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.930
 to the adac saxony 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.980
 because when you withdrew your plaque came 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.020
 here the row lakic 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.400
 this must be fast reality 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.530
 Do not even happen to be away 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.360
 is a bit annoying but it is now 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.440
 nevertheless, it happened to be one 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.600
 pretty hot race 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.430
 and that literally 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.450
 because the weather would not be quite so 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.360
 need to exaggerate 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.950
 it was way too hot on saturday though 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.360
 nevertheless, the organizers of this 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.550
 quite a lot of effort 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.130
 and at least made sure that it 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.270
 to drink something everywhere 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.340
 All in all, because the organization 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.470
 pretty good of the race so like 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.110
 not again next year 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.110
 make it quite so far away from this sense
