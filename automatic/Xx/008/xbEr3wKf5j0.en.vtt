00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.290
 He says that we do things as a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.389
 novelty a kinder pinguì to taste 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.949
 raspberry I don't even think it existed 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.900
 Romanian wrote a girl on mine 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.090
 page and is still message of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
 kinder pinguì with strawberry raspberry 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 what did a god do exist 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.449
 and here I was super happy to not be able to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.660
 taste and don't know what to do there 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.550
 expense or fact because he wanted 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 speak very curious so I am very 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 curious I like something that is pink 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:46.350
 which and therefore and therefore and therefore 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:48.379
 let's taste the languages ​​we say 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.370
 that the beginning is not the best 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.410
 but if you have n't seen them 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.180
 crush because it offers ideas then it 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.070
 admit a nasty little girl upon entering 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.100
 to the faith milk probably the lobsters 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.320
 instead I don't know if it is Christian milk 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.840
 and namely on how to also return the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.260
 dark chocolate and this thing is not me 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.760
 really like milk chocolate if 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.350
 don't miss the normal prime leader 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:27.180
 they are real dark chocolate 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:29.869

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.869
 they remember something 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.990
 I can't understand that but it was there 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.450
 definitely some kind cookie that 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.759
 he had a shelf so maybe you don't know 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.140
 what they remind me of 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.140
 you know the cookies they had 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.830
 a spongy layer of sponge cake then 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.020
 inside like an orange jelly 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.659
 or to certain reds therefore hypothesizes both 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.399
 raspberry bo and above a thing that them 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.560
 covered what areas of chocolate you know 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:20.230

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:23.000
 good cabbage good good good a 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.060
 quit eating feels great 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.190
 not too raspberry to know the area that you 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.380
 then as you eat more ribera al 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.150
 milk let's minimize this thing of 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.030
 boxing we are appealed then there is written 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.069
 or start making pure raspberry with 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.110
 Fructose syrup is fructose 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.579

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.400
 distant good is practically standing for me 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.530
 drowning because live with the excuse 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.750

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.060
 unfortunately the special always free 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.430
 why but someone might think 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.260
 that they send me what for free and instead 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.900
 unfortunately you don't realize it 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.470

 pink sincerely on the package 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.569

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.549
