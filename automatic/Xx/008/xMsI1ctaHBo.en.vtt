00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.689 
getting DNA bombs so the first and most
important<00:00:27.599> thing<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.109> think<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.619> use<00:00:29.070> in

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
important thing I think to use in

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.450 
important thing I think to use in
advanced<00:00:30.480> warfare<00:00:31.019> specifically<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.130> DNA

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
advanced warfare specifically to get DNA

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.310 
advanced warfare specifically to get DNA
bumps<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> system<00:00:33.510> half<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.079> most

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
bumps is the system half of the most

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.229 
bumps is the system half of the most
overpowered<00:00:35.010> kill<00:00:35.250> streak<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:35.850> opinion<00:00:36.120> in

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
overpowered kill streak in my opinion in

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
overpowered kill streak in my opinion in
the<00:00:36.360> history<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> Call<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.140> Duty<00:00:37.500> due<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the history of Call of Duty due to the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.490 
the history of Call of Duty due to the
fact<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.489> there's<00:00:38.700> EXO's<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.450> game<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
fact that there's EXO's in this game and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.790 
fact that there's EXO's in this game and
you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.829> disable<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.730> 40<00:00:42.300> seconds<00:00:43.020> with

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you can disable them for 40 seconds with

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.639 
you can disable them for 40 seconds with
the<00:00:43.980> disabled<00:00:44.550> XO<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.960> most<00:00:46.230> Opie

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the disabled XO so it's it's a most Opie

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.729 
the disabled XO so it's it's a most Opie
killstreak<00:00:47.070> number<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.120> tip<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.390> getting

killstreak number one tip for getting
DNA<00:00:49.739> bombs<00:00:50.010> using<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.610> system<00:00:50.789> hack<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
DNA bombs using the system hack so the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.650 
DNA bombs using the system hack so the
biggest<00:00:51.930> bonus<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.070> two<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.090> these<00:00:54.239> stats<00:00:54.539> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
biggest bonus and two of these stats of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.729 
biggest bonus and two of these stats of
people<00:00:54.899> don't<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.289> know<00:00:55.469> about<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
people don't really know about the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.189 
people don't really know about the
killstreaks<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:57.120> advanced<00:00:57.480> warfare<00:00:57.930> which<00:00:58.079> i

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
killstreaks in advanced warfare which i

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.770 
killstreaks in advanced warfare which i
think<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> best<00:00:58.710> class<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.850> using<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
think is the best class for using is the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
think is the best class for using is the
UAV<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.379> basically<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.859> game<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> UAV

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
UAV so basically in this game the UAV

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
UAV so basically in this game the UAV
last<00:01:02.730> 35<00:01:03.449> seconds<00:01:03.989> which<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.739> put<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
last 35 seconds which if you put that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.420 
last 35 seconds which if you put that
into<00:01:05.220> perspective<00:01:05.400> 35<00:01:06.330> seconds<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.320> long

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
into perspective 35 seconds is a long

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.550 
into perspective 35 seconds is a long
time<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.820> take<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.570> example<00:01:09.780> someone<00:01:10.409> like

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
time so take for example someone like

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
time so take for example someone like
myself<00:01:10.740> who<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.460> 15<00:01:11.909> UAVs<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
myself who can get like 15 UAVs in a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.990 
myself who can get like 15 UAVs in a
game<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> UAV<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.580> nearly<00:01:14.760> eight

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
game I can have a UAV for nearly eight

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.420 
game I can have a UAV for nearly eight
minutes<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> match<00:01:16.009> which<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> same

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
minutes in a match which is the same

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.850 
minutes in a match which is the same
thing<00:01:17.490> about<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.150> best<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.229> next<00:01:19.680> thing<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
thing about so the best and next thing I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
thing about so the best and next thing I
recommend<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.369> UAV<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:21.150> extended<00:01:21.780> time

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
recommend is a UAV with extended time

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
recommend is a UAV with extended time
and<00:01:22.290> threat<00:01:22.979> detection<00:01:23.310> thur<00:01:23.520> detection<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and threat detection thur detection is

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
and threat detection thur detection is
basically<00:01:24.360> Oracle<00:01:24.900> mode<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.380> Oracle<00:01:25.799> mall

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
basically Oracle mode with Oracle mall

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.170 
basically Oracle mode with Oracle mall
you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.220> see<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:26.460> through<00:01:26.700> walls<00:01:26.970> see

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
you can go see them through walls see

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
you can go see them through walls see
them<00:01:27.330> across<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> map<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> highlight<00:01:28.799> which

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
them across the map and highlight which

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.200 
them across the map and highlight which
way<00:01:29.250> they're<00:01:29.460> looking<00:01:29.790> which<00:01:29.939> were<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
way they're looking which were the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.550 
way they're looking which were the
facing<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.689> they're<00:01:30.810> laying<00:01:31.020> down<00:01:31.170> if<00:01:31.439> they're

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
facing if they're laying down if they're

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
facing if they're laying down if they're
sitting<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> corner<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.909> basically<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
sitting in a corner it's basically a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.810 
sitting in a corner it's basically a
hack<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.380> two<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.130> best<00:01:35.280> things<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.670> game

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
hack so two of the best things the game

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.640 
hack so two of the best things the game
are<00:01:35.939> basically<00:01:36.210> hacking<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> game<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.619> is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
are basically hacking the game which is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.950 
are basically hacking the game which is
in<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.670> opinion<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.030> best<00:01:39.180> things<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.540> use<00:01:39.659> so

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
in my opinion the best things to use so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.380 
in my opinion the best things to use so
basically<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.590> UAV<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.790> extended<00:01:42.150> time<00:01:42.270> is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
basically a UAV with extended time is

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.560 
basically a UAV with extended time is
gonna<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.570> 50<00:01:42.990> seconds<00:01:43.680> too<00:01:43.829> long<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.570> with

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
gonna be 50 seconds too long and with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
gonna be 50 seconds too long and with
speed<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.020> their<00:01:46.409> speed<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.220> guys

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
speed on their speed a lot of you guys

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.920 
speed on their speed a lot of you guys
know<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.729> most<00:01:47.909> recommended<00:01:48.240> attachment

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
know it's my most recommended attachment

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440 
know it's my most recommended attachment
UAV<00:01:49.799> updates<00:01:50.189> every<00:01:50.399> four<00:01:50.850> seconds<00:01:51.329> with

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
UAV updates every four seconds with

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
UAV updates every four seconds with
speed<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.110> updates<00:01:52.409> every<00:01:52.560> two<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> half

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
speed it updates every two and a half

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.120 
speed it updates every two and a half
seconds<00:01:53.880> which<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.119> up<00:01:54.360> almost<00:01:54.750> twice<00:01:55.560> as<00:01:55.590> fast

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
seconds which is up almost twice as fast

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.639 
seconds which is up almost twice as fast
which<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.090> why<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> recommend<00:01:57.930> using<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.380> best

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
which is why I recommend using it best

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.920 
which is why I recommend using it best
to<00:01:58.770> kill<00:01:59.009> shakes<00:01:59.250> UAV<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.759> system<00:02:00.210> hack<00:02:00.390> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to kill shakes UAV and system hack you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.480 
to kill shakes UAV and system hack you
can<00:02:01.079> run<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> war<00:02:01.500> board<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:01.890> salt<00:02:02.100> join<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.340> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
can run a war board or salt join if you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.480 
can run a war board or salt join if you
want<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.380> run<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> salt<00:02:04.770> junk<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.219> it'll

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
want but I just run a salt junk is it'll

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.980 
want but I just run a salt junk is it'll
fly<00:02:05.700> around<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> few<00:02:06.390> kills<00:02:06.630> here<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
fly around and get a few kills here and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.300 
fly around and get a few kills here and
there<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> vicious<00:02:08.160> you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
there but like if you get a vicious you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.979 
there but like if you get a vicious you
want<00:02:08.459> how<00:02:08.550> many<00:02:08.640> kills<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.239> off<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
want how many kills you are off so I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.270 
want how many kills you are off so I
just<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.259> me<00:02:10.379> using<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.679> salt<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.129> think

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
just like me using a salt on I think

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.760 
just like me using a salt on I think
using<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.730> salt<00:02:12.030> Jonah<00:02:12.270> lethal

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
using the salt Jonah lethal

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.650 
using the salt Jonah lethal
streaked<00:02:13.070> is<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.790> little<00:02:14.120> bit<00:02:14.240> better<00:02:14.450> than

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
streaked is a little bit better than

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.450 
streaked is a little bit better than
using<00:02:14.960> like<00:02:15.260> overclocked<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:16.070> once<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.370> use

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
using like overclocked it's once you use

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.010 
using like overclocked it's once you use
overclock<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:16.940> runs<00:02:17.420> out<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.810> thing<00:02:17.990> about

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
overclock it runs out the thing about

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.410 
overclock it runs out the thing about
the<00:02:18.260> system<00:02:18.650> hack<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:19.100> disabled<00:02:19.700> XO<00:02:20.090> obviously

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
the system hack is disabled XO obviously

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.050 
the system hack is disabled XO obviously
guys<00:02:20.540> knows<00:02:20.720> 150<00:02:21.320> points<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.190> double

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
guys knows 150 points and then double

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.030 
guys knows 150 points and then double
extended<00:02:23.540> time<00:02:23.750> which<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.140> at<00:02:24.320> 1,200<00:02:24.860> points

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
extended time which is at 1,200 points

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.340 
extended time which is at 1,200 points
that<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.760> system<00:02:26.090> hack<00:02:26.240> will<00:02:26.450> last<00:02:26.660> for<00:02:26.930> 40

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
that the system hack will last for 40

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.140 
that the system hack will last for 40
full<00:02:27.530> seconds<00:02:28.010> with<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.610> both<00:02:28.940> these

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
full seconds with so both these

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.000 
full seconds with so both these
killstreaks<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:29.930> insanely<00:02:30.380> long<00:02:30.500> time

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
killstreaks to have insanely long time

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.530 
killstreaks to have insanely long time
so<00:02:31.220> obviously<00:02:31.700> well<00:02:31.880> harder<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.210> get<00:02:32.330> with<00:02:32.510> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
so obviously well harder to get with a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.150 
so obviously well harder to get with a
higher<00:02:32.930> amount<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.500> amount<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.770> time<00:02:34.010> they

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
higher amount the amount of time they

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.460 
higher amount the amount of time they
last<00:02:34.400> mix<00:02:34.700> them<00:02:34.910> well<00:02:35.060> worth<00:02:35.240> using<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.930> that's

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
last mix them well worth using so that's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.320 
last mix them well worth using so that's
tip<00:02:36.740> number<00:02:36.800> one<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.370> your<00:02:37.520> killstreaks<00:02:38.000> setup

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
tip number one is your killstreaks setup

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.940 
tip number one is your killstreaks setup
obviously<00:02:38.810> number<00:02:39.080> two<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.500> going<00:02:39.710> to<00:02:39.770> be<00:02:39.860> your

cover in a video if you guys want to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.220 
cover in a video if you guys want to
check<00:03:40.490> it<00:03:40.610> out<00:03:40.640> links<00:03:40.880> in<00:03:40.970> description<00:03:41.020> but<00:03:42.020> we

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
check it out links in description but we

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.470 
check it out links in description but we
make<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.500> video<00:03:42.740> so<00:03:42.980> it's<00:03:43.880> basically<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.300> sign

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
make the video so it's basically to sign

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.170 
make the video so it's basically to sign
my<00:03:44.600> angles<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:45.320> routes<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.400> on<00:03:46.640> certain<00:03:47.030> maps

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
my angles and routes so on certain maps

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.420 
my angles and routes so on certain maps
like<00:03:47.450> domination<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.350> my<00:03:48.680> biggest<00:03:48.920> pain<00:03:49.250> is

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
like domination and my biggest pain is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.040 
like domination and my biggest pain is
play<00:03:49.640> domination<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.209> get<00:03:50.360> DNA<00:03:50.480> Bob's<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.840> think

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
play domination to get DNA Bob's I think

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.020 
play domination to get DNA Bob's I think
it's<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.290> best<00:03:51.500> game<00:03:51.740> mode<00:03:52.010> taking<00:03:52.940> those

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
it's the best game mode taking those

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.960 
it's the best game mode taking those
angles<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:53.870> taking<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.709> smartest<00:03:55.280> routes<00:03:55.640> in

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
angles and taking the smartest routes in

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.210 
angles and taking the smartest routes in
this<00:03:56.180> game<00:03:56.360> obviously<00:03:56.530> exosuits<00:03:57.530> angles<00:03:57.980> and

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
this game obviously exosuits angles and

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.160 
this game obviously exosuits angles and
routes<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.610> basically<00:03:58.880> or<00:03:59.060> go<00:03:59.240> together<00:03:59.420> so<00:03:59.750> if

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
routes to basically or go together so if

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.890 
routes to basically or go together so if
you<00:04:00.740> take<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:00.980> map<00:04:01.220> like<00:04:01.400> riot<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:02.420> best<00:04:02.660> angle

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
you take a map like riot the best angle

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.770 
you take a map like riot the best angle
is<00:04:03.260> on<00:04:03.440> top<00:04:03.709> if<00:04:04.010> yours<00:04:04.610> if<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:05.120> have<00:04:05.270> C<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:05.720> B

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
is on top if yours if you have C and B

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.230 
is on top if yours if you have C and B
and<00:04:06.080> you're<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.709> top<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.340> want<00:04:07.520> it<00:04:07.610> ATS<00:04:08.060> down

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
and you're on top you want it ATS down

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.940 
and you're on top you want it ATS down
the<00:04:08.540> stairs<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.350> right<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:09.739> then<00:04:09.830> the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
the stairs to the right and then the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.920 
the stairs to the right and then the
street<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.459> left<00:04:10.520> of<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:10.760> cars<00:04:11.000> are<00:04:11.270> so

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
street to the left of the cars are so

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.780 
street to the left of the cars are so
you<00:04:11.989> have<00:04:12.140> your<00:04:12.170> best<00:04:12.470> angle<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:13.100> then<00:04:13.610> your

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
you have your best angle and then your

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.449 
you have your best angle and then your
route<00:04:14.060> is<00:04:14.239> going<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.570> be<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.810> go<00:04:14.930> up<00:04:15.080> top<00:04:15.459> so

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
route is going to be to go up top so

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.280 
route is going to be to go up top so
that<00:04:16.489> they<00:04:16.850> work<00:04:17.120> together<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.900> then

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
that they work together and then

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.050 
that they work together and then
movement<00:04:18.859> obviously<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.520> want<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.790> be<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:19.880> the

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
movement obviously you want to be on the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.810 
movement obviously you want to be on the
top<00:04:20.330> move<00:04:20.750> around<00:04:21.020> a<00:04:21.229> lot<00:04:21.430> double<00:04:22.430> jumping

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
top move around a lot double jumping

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.780 
top move around a lot double jumping
just<00:04:23.060> windows<00:04:23.479> gun<00:04:23.720> fights<00:04:23.990> but

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
just windows gun fights but

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.690 
just windows gun fights but
then<00:04:25.240> take<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:25.630> map<00:04:25.900> like<00:04:26.080> come<00:04:26.440> back<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:27.370> route

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
then take a map like come back the route

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.640 
then take a map like come back the route
you<00:04:27.730> want<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.090> take<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.450> most<00:04:28.600> is<00:04:28.840> never<00:04:29.290> in<00:04:29.500> to

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
you want to take the most is never in to

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.890 
you want to take the most is never in to
be<00:04:29.860> come<00:04:30.370> back<00:04:30.580> on<00:04:30.760> beat<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.390> are<00:04:31.540> going<00:04:31.780> to

be come back on beat you are going to

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.080 
be come back on beat you are going to
die<00:04:32.080> every<00:04:32.470> time<00:04:32.500> by<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.860> grenade<00:04:33.040> so<00:04:33.400> take<00:04:33.940> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
die every time by a grenade so take the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.090 
die every time by a grenade so take the
right<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.540> left<00:04:34.600> go<00:04:35.590> into<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.890> building

right to the left go into that building
and<00:04:36.370> take<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.610> higher<00:04:37.000> angle<00:04:37.270> from<00:04:37.510> a

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
and take a higher angle from a

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.420 
and take a higher angle from a
second-story<00:04:38.050> building<00:04:38.410> it's<00:04:39.040> going<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.310> be<00:04:39.400> a

lot of go up on the roof take a high

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.900 
lot of go up on the roof take a high
angle<00:04:41.650> biggest<00:04:42.190> thing<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.400> recommend<00:04:42.490> in<00:04:42.820> this

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
angle biggest thing I recommend in this

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.460 
angle biggest thing I recommend in this
game<00:04:43.060> is<00:04:43.150> just<00:04:43.180> taking<00:04:43.450> higher<00:04:43.810> angles<00:04:44.320> and

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
game is just taking higher angles and

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.850 
game is just taking higher angles and
taking<00:04:45.250> smart<00:04:45.670> routes<00:04:45.910> that<00:04:46.750> will<00:04:46.960> lift<00:04:47.230> lead

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
taking smart routes that will lift lead

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.550 
taking smart routes that will lift lead
to<00:04:48.340> good<00:04:48.550> angles<00:04:49.030> that's<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.420> biggest<00:04:49.780> tip<00:04:50.350> I

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
to good angles that's the biggest tip I

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.650 
to good angles that's the biggest tip I
can<00:04:50.620> give<00:04:50.950> just<00:04:51.520> going<00:04:51.820> for<00:04:51.970> DNA<00:04:52.270> bombs<00:04:52.480> in

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
can give just going for DNA bombs in

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.840 
can give just going for DNA bombs in
this<00:04:52.780> game<00:04:52.960> is<00:04:53.110> taking<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.860> smartest<00:04:54.520> route

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
this game is taking the smartest route

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.850 
this game is taking the smartest route
possible<00:04:55.120> every<00:04:55.660> time<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.170> then<00:04:56.710> obviously

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
possible every time and then obviously

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.950 
possible every time and then obviously
spawn<00:04:57.430> spawns<00:04:57.970> are<00:04:58.150> going<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.360> influenced<00:04:58.840> by

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
spawn spawns are going to influenced by

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.960 
spawn spawns are going to influenced by
everything<00:04:59.410> so<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.220> way<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.460> move<00:05:00.820> around

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
everything so the way you move around

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.720 
everything so the way you move around
the<00:05:01.090> map<00:05:01.150> will<00:05:01.480> influence<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.020> spawns<00:05:02.730> so

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
the map will influence the spawns so

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.610 
the map will influence the spawns so
that's<00:05:03.970> a<00:05:04.060> that's<00:05:04.570> just<00:05:04.750> why<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.140> think<00:05:05.530> the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
that's a that's just why I think the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.020 
that's a that's just why I think the
angles<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.100> routes<00:05:06.250> are<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.460> most<00:05:06.580> important

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
angles and routes are the most important

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.580 
angles and routes are the most important
thing<00:05:07.150> in<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.300> game<00:05:07.510> you<00:05:07.810> always<00:05:08.200> want<00:05:08.530> to

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
thing in the game you always want to

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.190 
thing in the game you always want to
have<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.890> upper<00:05:09.310> advantage<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.200> outsmarting

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
have the upper advantage and outsmarting

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.480 
have the upper advantage and outsmarting
your<00:05:11.350> enemies<00:05:11.740> is<00:05:11.950> how<00:05:12.100> you're<00:05:12.220> going<00:05:12.310> to<00:05:12.430> get

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
your enemies is how you're going to get

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.520 
your enemies is how you're going to get
a<00:05:12.550> DNA<00:05:12.760> bomb<00:05:13.120> like<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.390> can<00:05:13.540> always<00:05:13.960> out<00:05:14.200> gun

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
a DNA bomb like you can always out gun

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.410 
a DNA bomb like you can always out gun
people<00:05:14.740> but<00:05:15.160> you're<00:05:15.640> playing<00:05:15.910> against<00:05:16.090> six

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
thing about angles and routes is making

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.140 
thing about angles and routes is making
the<00:05:29.140> enemies<00:05:29.470> work<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:30.010> kill<00:05:30.280> you<00:05:30.400> make<00:05:31.000> it
