00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.359
 Hello dear viewers me 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.340
 name is Sergey Antonov poet photo in 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.460
 flight. py we are today on 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.860
 exhibit si and p2015 also known as 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.560
 photo forum we wandered to the company booth 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.049
 olympus and and we say slept on sour cream and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.619
 us product coach pavel what 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.329
 new this year first and well not me 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.149
 I know that you are interested in you 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.459
 such a thing in the hands of olympus m52 which 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.560
 we recently had on tests and on such 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.299
 the test was one of the most interesting and how 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.549
 In general, you camera and what's new 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.590
 really hello and this year 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.229
 we are probably representatives of one of the most 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.239
 0 interest on the present moment all 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.420
 SLR cameras in our market is her 5 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:57.030
 Margoula as already said here is the camera in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.640
 this year won two products of the year she 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.049
 extruded won as better 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.770
 advanced mirrorless camera 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.810
 and the best camera for video shooting then 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.160
 there is a new mirrorless 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.959
 this is probably the first Olympic 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.970
 mirrorless which is very strong 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.799
 extended video shooting 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.450
 First, in terms of seeing that she had 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.459
 she improved the first camera olympus 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.519
 which finally appeared advanced 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.709
 video settings and as before 24 megabits 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.200
 it was just the usual full hd now with us 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.450
 77 megabits per second there is a degree 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.980
 squeezing str intro and all frequencies appeared 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.810
 frames 24p 25-35 and 6050 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.269
 stabilizer is even better than before 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.040
 it is the same 5 axial but worth 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.780
 new generation gyro sensor more 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.459
 sensitive and he can now 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.829
 compensate even more steps 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.319
 exposure but 5 darts plow 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.829
 and therefore 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.090
 he works very well on video 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.849
 synchronously with the electronic system 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.310
 stabilization so you can 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.620
 there is a movement out of the car to shoot video 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.060
 without shaking without problems or what they carried 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.459
 wild and need nothing essentially here 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.109
 Like a built-in garden hait gyro sensor 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.939
 which determines the position of the camera in 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.620
 space matrix is suspended on 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.810
 magnetic field it sends pulses to 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.939
 matrix matrix retains its position 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.620
 on earth, therefore, any 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.099
 your slightest fluctuations are not easy 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.250
 remain invisible video and photography 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.129
 what was interesting from optics in this 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.699
 on optics we announced in February 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.980
 new fishy 8 millimeters self it 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:30.260
 strong happiness offer fragma 18 and also 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.889
 We announced that this summer on sale 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.730
 lens arrives with a 714 28 constant 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.340
 silver 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.180
 that is, the very professional 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.250
 wide-angle lens that we donâ€™t 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.989
 lacked our ruler effective 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.169
 focal length as I understand there from 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.299
 14 to 28 will recount and Kovalin 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.159
 films yes what are the expectations about this 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.689
 The lens is primarily about the lens 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.819
 therefore, it will be oriented first 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.250
 turn on photo enthusiasts on 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.629
 professionals who do not need him 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.759
 through professional work 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.040
 shoot architecture landscapes all that 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.569
 whether you want a wide-angle 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.250
 lens and there are familiar photographers 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.259
 who like to shoot portraits on 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.540
 wide-angle lenses such surf 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:10.340
 with this distortion with these perspectives 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.199
 principle lens is useful for what 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.819
 anything august waterproof 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.590
 any terms you can 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.539
 use no problem at all 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.130
 value yet with your not 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.630
 defined mucus from current 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.729
 economic situation I think many 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.289
 understand what to predict the price tag on 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.860
 the same lens that will appear in the summer 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.189
 still hard enough 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.560
 what else was new this year what 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.189
 cameras we can be from compact 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.009
 rulers 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:37.620
 arrived well or go to the market 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:41.599
 Now we announced waterproof 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:46.069
 only the same 860 is an upgrade previous 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:48.539
 750 she has a Wi fi DPS slender and 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.520
 there was an extra button for 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.860
 selfie shooting that are on 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.990
 the front of the camera appeared 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.120
 timelapse video 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.650
 but various other such interesting 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.330
 fishhechki and so in general it is almost 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.419
 same camera as last year 750000 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.189
 old camera upgrade with one more 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.590
 which would be well the same 5 axial 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.539
 stabilizer is in our flagship 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.159
 cameras so it will be possible to video 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.080
 just as well write quality with 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.620
 our indy camera series 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.710
 Well, going back to the top five itself 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.240
 the camera as far as I could understand she 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.669
 almost one to one 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.250
 matches your flagship unit 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.400
 because probably there is probably no such 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.620
 functions that it would not have and if 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.319
 take more video and more advanced 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.580
 stabilizer she gets it 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.560
 beats and moreover it is made in 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.569
 more compact case even if on 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.520
 hang it here this one kit for all 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.110
 equal it turns out less really m5 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.210
 Marple she has almost the entire 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.699
 functionality that there is a camera to her madden 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.379
 and even more, that is, in addition to the video mode 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.960
 she has 40 megapixel mode 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.729
 which allows using a series of 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.860
 eight frames the camera makes sticks together 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.080
 photos to do with a resolution of 40 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.610
 megapixel photo of a step can be opened on 4 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.000
 megapixels this snapshot 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:09.080
 here is her madden is equipped with phase 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.370
 sensors on the sensor and thus 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.250
 user of our old mirror 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.500
 systems can use on it through 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.020
 slope adapter valuable functionality with 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.719
 same autofocus speed without 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.699
 problems with arabic ticks here plus phase 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.979
 sensors how year everything is fine 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.360
 understand works very well on 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.699
 AF tracking 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.439
 because with phase focusing 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:36.539
 very different lenses move on 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.889
 account what the camera can better follow 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.779
 objects and 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.000
 that is, they work not only with the old 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:44.009
 optics but from new look and micro four 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.379
 Third, that is, when the tracking is turned on 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:49.319
 autofocus even connect full 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:51.120
 phase autofocus which will be great 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.879
 keep track of any objects 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.860
 but roughly speaking here is the camera I eat 5 mark2 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:58.529
 she has autofocus half frame 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.050
 second thanks to the contrast in the camera eat 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.759
 one with firmware 309 frames per second 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.529
 follow autofocus and it always keeps 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.900
 objects in the zone of sharpness 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:08.879
 i.e. camera her madden she stays 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.800
 still the flagship but it is separated 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:12.930
 a little bit in this segment, I think more 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.909
 for reportage shooting for sports 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.699
 shooting is more for amateur for 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:20.129
 video for some creative ideas but 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:22.379
 not quite meant for shooting 

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:24.900
 sporting events and things like that 

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:26.190
 save the big pavel as always 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.539
 very nice to talk with you i 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.819
 I hope that not the last time we meet 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:32.689
 at the nearest exhibitions and great too 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:35.239
 see you i say wish you success 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:38.449
 its we and the company well and please us 

00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:41.169
 more often and new ones sure thanks 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:41.169
 thank
