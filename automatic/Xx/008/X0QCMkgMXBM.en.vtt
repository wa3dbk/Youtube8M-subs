00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.280
 the orientation of the epa detects 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.160
 movements that we do with him knows if 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.140
 is horizontal or vertical 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.150
 depending on that the screen goes 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.490
 adapt along with everything it contains 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.369
 I'm going to turn it around at this moment to 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.410
 that you see as the icons literally 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.460
 rotate to fit in the new 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.529
 position 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.890
 This behavior is used by some 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.190
 programs and games but also many 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.079
 others only adapt to only one 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.120
 of the two positions so 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.530
 we must accommodate the ipad in 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.809
 said position to be able to see 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.550
 correctly the content in the case of 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.800
 the applications or games that support 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.159
 I recommend you use the most 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.059
 comfortable for example here I have open the 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:57.339
 safari browser I have a note or 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.289
 news in this position that I have 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.829
 currently the iPad vertically 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.809
 I have more space to read what 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.820
 facilitates reading in the letters you see 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.220
 larger however I change it from 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.040
 position and see how the letters are made 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.050
 smaller 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.930
 by adapting the width of the screen 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.200
 current everything becomes smaller when 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 we are in a vertical orientation but 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.610
 if we change it to orientation 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.990
 horizontal we see how it gets bigger 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.120
 all inclusive we can use the zoom to 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.070
 closer but the best would be to use 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.320
 the option of the reader that we will see more 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.240
 forward when you use a keyboard in 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.090
 screen also in this position it 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.190
 makes it bigger I'm going to show it we see 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.990
 how the keyboard appears if we change the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.940
 orientation becomes smaller and 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.820
 logically it is more complicated to press 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.640
 the keys when we use the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.320
 visualization of images depending on 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 the proportion they have will be adapted to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.470
 the screen here I have images with 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.509
 different proportions wider 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.430
 than the others for example this image 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.460
 has a proportion that fits 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.310
 perfectly on the ipad screen of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.860
 horizontal form but the one that follows has 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.650
 a different orientation is longer 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.660
 that wide although the proportion fits 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.980
 perfectly with the ipad screen 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.560
 but in vertical form 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.840
 I'm going to do it we see how it adapts to the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.170
 screen the image is logically made 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.810
 larger and by rotating it or changing the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.909
 orientation is automatically rotated 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.069
 then we already know that depending on 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.019
 the proportion that the images have is 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.200
 the way we're going to accommodate the 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.750
 tablet to see it as big as possible 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.340
 inside the screen this from the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.530
 orientation as you can see is nothing 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.470
 complicated is just using logic 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.450
 when we want to see a larger text 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.849
 you always have to use orientation 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.099
 horizontal the same will happen with the 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.440
 photos that have a proportion 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.900
 different from the horizontal screen of the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.730
 ipad in the next video I will talk 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.950
 about gestures on screen that is the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.260
 way we interact with the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.260
 screen using our fingers
