forward in a way where everybody can

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.180 
forward in a way where everybody can
succeed<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.320> means<00:04:34.530> I've<00:04:34.680> got<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.980> think

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
succeed and that means I've got to think

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.820 
succeed and that means I've got to think
about<00:04:35.310> those<00:04:35.700> workers<00:04:36.000> in<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.780> video<00:04:37.020> just

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
about those workers in that video just

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.590 
about those workers in that video just
as<00:04:37.950> much<00:04:38.390> as<00:04:39.390> I'm<00:04:39.630> thinking<00:04:39.990> about<00:04:40.610> folks<00:04:41.610> who

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
as much as I'm thinking about folks who

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.050 
as much as I'm thinking about folks who
have<00:04:42.690> been<00:04:42.810> much<00:04:42.990> more<00:04:43.020> successful

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.960 

I<00:04:52.360> what<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:53.389> would<00:04:53.690> say<00:04:53.900> is<00:04:54.169> is<00:04:54.410> that<00:04:54.650> mr.<00:04:55.520> Romney

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
I what I would say is is that mr. Romney

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.740 
I what I would say is is that mr. Romney
is<00:04:57.010> responsible<00:04:58.010> for<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.850> proposals<00:04:59.510> he's

putting forward for how he says he's

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.210
