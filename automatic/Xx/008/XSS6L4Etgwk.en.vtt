00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 who 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.670
 more 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.540
 hello I was just shopping and that 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.520
 in a grocery and me 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.340
 I thought I show you to the 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.140
 I'm looking for food that I buy 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.100
 because many are interested in it and 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.140
 let's get started 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.940
 When I'm in the pro head that's one 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.980
 There you can do a lot of bio 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.820
 Things buy a lot of vegan stuff 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.570
 and there I have a soja once 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.070
 bought milk that is the soy sorry of 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.660
 alpro here is no soy milk 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.530
 more drunk and that's why I'm very 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.860
 strained and try now on soy and 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.100
 almond milk instead of regular 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.600
 cow milk neighbor comment I hope we 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.059
 It can not be though the word 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.280
 Truck passing the soymilk 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.650
 a euro 80 tasted and I think for 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.629
 a liter that's okay 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.699
 and perhaps so yes I have my 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:07.159
 then there is such a thing 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.620
 yogurt bought with organic vegetable 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.470
 and also yes and that is so with 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.420
 raspberries and I compose I have it 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.280
 never eaten but i can feel it myself 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.560
 pretty well imagine and it does too 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.189
 only cost 92 I think for 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.329
 yogurt cups 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.500
 this is not a food now 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.240
 but then I have from me too 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.600
 knew like a nail polish remover 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.369
 he bought smells of soybean oil and orange 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.350
 and then I have already as me 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.729
 have already got a pack empty 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.590
 and I really like him really well 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.229
 and he does not smell that hard 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.780
 nagging feeling so that has two euro 80 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.460
 how much does it cost and without it 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.719
 next one was a little expensive so i am so 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.850
 a full- force spelled raspberry muesli 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.600
 bought and that cost four euros 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.450
 that's 250 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.009
 There is already something expensive inside 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.189
 pretty yummy as it stands there without 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.850
 Citrus fruits or nuts without added 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.440
 sugar and without wide so at 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.390
 have many american youtube on 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.819
 I heard a lot of risen lying 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.920
 so the rice must be made 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.860
 and then found one in this one 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.750
 a normal business 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.239
 spaghetti and then one 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.940
 Turned I would not like it 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.489
 but that's all Italian for that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.580
 I can not say much but she calls 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.420
 probably high price fits it 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.920
 Simply rice noodles and certainly also very 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.800
 compliant standard and are bleeding after 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.000
 free and have both packs individually 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.610
 92 cost the self for example 250 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.860
 grams inside and help to 250 grams 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.450
 Like you, I do not know any chocolate 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.489
 more and I wanted one anyway 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.650
 buy troublesome and then have one 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.840
 without a show found that very difficult 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.510
 most chocolate inside and that is 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.260
 a highlight of the cereal bars of the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.060
 brand topics like part no idea knows 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.220
 no sugar in it so most 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.360
 is comes from dates and other sweet ones 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.370
 For example, apricots and foods 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.750
 it costs 1 99 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.320
 then I have the mark 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.420
 Maps were bought organic short mix 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:21.030
 these are pumpkin seed sunflower seeds 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.920
 inside and that cost a worldview 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.680
 then I found that and that is 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.950
 actually a normal jam 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.350
 a raspberry jam from allofs though 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.430
 you say that actually I did not want to 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.810
 buy but then I have the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.500
 read through ingredients and have 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.020
 discovered that there was no sugar in it 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.600
 and that is only agave thick juice inside 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.630
 as a sweetener so to speak and simple 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.770
 different juices and so no 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.030
 added or sugar and that wanted 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.800
 I really want to try it because so 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.150
 far as I know, there are only with it 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.470
 trouble loading where a lot of sugar inside 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.160
 is 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.360
 and that cost three euros 20 then 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.890
 I wanted an almond cream 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.900
 Try and therefore I have only 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.500
 a small pack for one euro 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.900
 Bought 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.040
 I'll get a lot of it and that 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.540
 There are actually quite big 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.310
 glass and I just wanted to 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.870
 So try the little bakken 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.790
 good grades 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.280
 although not so good hotel 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.140
 but probably I have now 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.750
 already open but those are pumpkin seeds 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.750
 and they are salted and 100 percent 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.060
 biologically by biohof martina schmidt 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.740
 this is a biohof in zagersdorf and that 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.050
 is very good about regional products 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.790
 buys so I bought I 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.640
 I'm sure that cost 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.740
 I have a shop in my place 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.790
 bought not at poker but me 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.010
 always find it very convenient if you are 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.470
 So a short mix has you so 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.780
 Snacking can also force you to buy because 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.220
 sometimes you have the tv already 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.690
 lust on the grain or chips and that is 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.550
 very good if you have an alternative 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.500
 such as pumpkin seeds we want 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.110
 I like to have such a snack video 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.030
 make good healthy alternative 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.410
 Finally, I still have spec 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.300
 bought a bit of fruit 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.720
 Maybe you know that on the side of the road 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.560
 Sometimes they are just where fruit stands 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.919
 to buy fruit from regional channels 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.440
 can 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.300
 and there I have mine on earth 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.370
 That's a hammer kilo and has eight 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.220
 It costs a lot, though 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.030
 for being from the region is ok 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.040
 and then I have one more 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.040
 bought a kilo khat from marin and that 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.420
 Cost 16 euros yes that's all and 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.070
 I want to go to school 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.960
 thoughts or others you have me one 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.150
 gift certificate from the broker and he 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.650
 that made it all possible that is 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.420
 I bought us usually can 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.740
 i dont eat too much myself i would 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.050
 I can recommend it several new ones 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.640
 products bought in sofia speech no me 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.410
 always find that exciting when you are 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.900
 Something else there is always what you 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.490

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.300
