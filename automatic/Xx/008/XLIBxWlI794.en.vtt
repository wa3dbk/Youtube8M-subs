00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.350
 we 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.939
 hello and welcome to the learner the 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.150
 guitar point fr so today I 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.369
 wanted to talk to you about three methods 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.960
 different from playing the guitar finally 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.349
 three different ways of playing 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.469
 the guitar 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.600
 so in fact you ask the question 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.730
 often you ask me there that to know 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.059
 if it's better to play law with a 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.680
 pick or a so today I'm going 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.809
 explain to you a little bit 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.809
 different ways to play the 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.420
 guitar and what are the benefits and 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.059
 their disadvantages 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.469
 first of all the pick day then the 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.460
 pick day it is done 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.460
 essentially 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.590
 this is for you to agree to scratch 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.590
 like that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.560
 So that's the sound really 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:29.229
 specific of the pick that will scratch 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:32.470
 scratch the strings so then we use 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.770
 especially in folk guitar and very rarely 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.420
 in classical guitar this is the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 pick can also play 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.280
 he 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.180
 here is to play note to note in precision 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.860
 so what is difficult to do with 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.049
 the pick is that sometimes 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.000
 for example if I do not want to play 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.610
 this rope here in my agreement but I 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.560
 want to play back rope but without the 107 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.729
 salad salad body so here is going 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.030
 I need to block the rope with my 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.739
 finger 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.050
 that's what's great 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.160
 pick especially as turned to when 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.239
 we are beginners it's going to take 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.670
 learn times blocked strings 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.769
 these are these next if I want to play 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.280
 only seven strings tie this rope there 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.440
 there it will become difficult since 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.730
 and that's very difficult to jump 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.490
 all the strings like that he'll have to 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.560
 find a way to block them and 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.880
 frankly that's okay it's not practical 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.230
 one of the other advantages of the pick 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.910
 we can do as soon as we can 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.910
 calls ghost notes ie 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.080
 this is an agreement of the on which 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.080
 I actually support here with the palm of my 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.580
 hand and lets you do more than this 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.230
 more percussive price which is to 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.140
 rock features 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.970
 so that's it's a first way 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.390
 to play so with the pick so 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.340
 so there is one last technique so 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.050
 that is a fairly advanced technique 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.970
 still classified is what we 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.080
 calls the hybrid picking ie 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.380
 that you will play both with the 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.380
 muses on time 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.920
 and then with your rights 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.959
 Oh 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.250
 that's good to do the flanges 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.860
 picking like that is you're going 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.620
 so be able both under the yoke and 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.620
 note to note is precisely catch 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 1 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.150
 the other strings with the others must 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.440
 so it's with these three douala what 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.700
 is difficult is that the little finger 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.330
 very often but it's the one we 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.850
 work the least 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.370
 So here we have to start 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:54.409
 muscular and the advantage is that 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.409
 you will be able to mix 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.730
 the precision jeans 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.980
 and scratching day like this here 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.460
 so there is an alternative to that so 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.070
 use the pick - use 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.010
 pick of that shape then so 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.420
 you are able to use two pick 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.920
 of this type then it's your pick that 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.350
 get on the thumb like that and that 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.550
 it is used in alternative picking 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:31.170
 picking ie with the pic here 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:33.150
 you're going to play and that's low 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.840
 the advantage that you really attack 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.460
 the ropes here from the side the finger the thumb 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.110
 so he is he is right he is 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.120
 to be able to attack every time here 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.780
 quietly without the need for 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.780
 break the hand 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.620
 so that's the second technique so this 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.960
 then you can play well 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.960
 obviously with nothing at all 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.230
 or 

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:14.489
 room advantage is that it leaves you 

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:16.439
 a great ease of play to you 

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:16.979
 feel directly directly 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.879
 ropes 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.639
 so that's all on one 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.169
 folk guitar 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.459
 you will have to play very hard for you 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.039
 to hear ie if you play 

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:31.619
 there are three people who speak that 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.029
 you try to have the accuracy the 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:39.179
 speed and strength 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:41.909
 it's pretty difficult here it's in 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:45.799
 do you hear that I play hard but 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:48.509
 in fact I do not speak at all 

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:51.629
 last last alternative that I 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:55.529
 present you today so we more 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:58.979
 that put the pick on the go 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:04.109
 here I happen to play with 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:07.529
 tabs like this so you'll see there 

00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:09.749
 ya on the videos on the internet 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.789
 you see are wasted and igor 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:13.199
 pressignac hop there who plays regularly 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.149
 with his nails is so the 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:18.169
 advantage is that the sound the guitar is 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:18.169
 very very beautiful brilliant 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.770
 and 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.900
 so today I have you 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.620
 presented to different ways of attacking 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.680
 your strings 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.199
 so you have so with the tabs here 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.400
 but nike fell so with the 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:53.960
 english hop with the thumb pick 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:56.419
 with nothing at all and with the pick 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.000
 Russia here I thank you for having
