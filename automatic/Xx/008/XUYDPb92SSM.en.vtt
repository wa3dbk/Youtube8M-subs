00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.190 

okay<00:00:03.090> I've<00:00:03.179> had<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.330> little<00:00:03.419> more<00:00:03.540> time<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.990> play

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
okay I've had a little more time to play

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.930 
okay I've had a little more time to play
with<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.470> amp<00:00:04.680> now<00:00:04.890> I'd<00:00:05.190> like<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.430> demo<00:00:05.730> it

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
with the amp now I'd like to demo it

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.820 
with the amp now I'd like to demo it
just<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.270> little<00:00:06.359> bit<00:00:06.569> better<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:06.899> time<00:00:06.960> this

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
just a little bit better this time this

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.020 
just a little bit better this time this
is<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.130> evh<00:00:08.580> 5150<00:00:09.510> 3<00:00:10.139> an<00:00:10.440> amplifier<00:00:10.920> made<00:00:11.849> by

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
is the evh 5150 3 an amplifier made by

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.200 
is the evh 5150 3 an amplifier made by
fender<00:00:12.330> three<00:00:13.080> channels<00:00:13.639> channel<00:00:14.639> one<00:00:14.820> green

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
fender three channels channel one green

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.410 
fender three channels channel one green
channel<00:00:15.750> which<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.279> clean<00:00:17.820> channel<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.300> it

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
channel which is a clean channel and it

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420 
channel which is a clean channel and it
has<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> gain<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.710> which<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.830> cool<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
has a gain on it which is cool so that

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.670 
has a gain on it which is cool so that
you<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.699> make<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.060> crunchy<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:22.020> well<00:00:22.230> as<00:00:22.410> clean

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
you can make it crunchy as well as clean

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.279 
you can make it crunchy as well as clean
you<00:00:22.830> can<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.070> either/or<00:00:23.880> then<00:00:24.570> channel<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
you can do either/or then channel to the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.230 
you can do either/or then channel to the
blue<00:00:25.529> channel<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.849> crunch<00:00:27.150> channel

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
blue channel which is the crunch channel

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.710 
blue channel which is the crunch channel
and<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:27.869> channel<00:00:28.230> three<00:00:28.529> over<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.849> red

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and then channel three over here the red

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.680 
and then channel three over here the red
channel<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.439> high<00:00:31.679> gain<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.820> 18<00:00:33.270> knobs<00:00:33.510> all

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
channel that's high gain so 18 knobs all

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.350 
channel that's high gain so 18 knobs all
the<00:00:33.780> way<00:00:33.870> across<00:00:34.050> these<00:00:34.500> over<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:34.770> are

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
the way across these over here are

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.459 
the way across these over here are
presence<00:00:36.360> controls<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> they're<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
presence controls and they're all at the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
presence controls and they're all at the
end<00:00:37.500> because<00:00:38.040> they're<00:00:38.219> part<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> them<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
end because they're part of them the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:01:03.250 
end because they're part of them the
power<00:00:39.870> amp<00:00:40.079> section

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.750 

okay<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:04.620> bridge<00:01:05.010> pickup<00:01:05.340> move<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
okay now bridge pickup move to the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:27.340 
okay now bridge pickup move to the
cross-channel

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.200 

okay<00:01:28.350> I've<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> gain<00:01:29.189> high<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.759> volume

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
okay I've got the gain high the volume

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.120 
okay I've got the gain high the volume
low<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:31.229> doing<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.619> bedroom<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
low and just doing in the bedroom of the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.170 
low and just doing in the bedroom of the
house<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:32.759> want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> wake<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
house you don't want to wake the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.840 
house you don't want to wake the
neighbors<00:01:33.330> then<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.530> channel<00:01:34.799> 3<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.700> high

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
neighbors then the channel 3 is the high

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.370 
neighbors then the channel 3 is the high
gain<00:01:36.090> channel<00:01:36.540> I've<00:01:36.690> only<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.110> gain<00:01:37.350> on

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
gain channel I've only got the gain on

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.310 
gain channel I've only got the gain on
five<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.190> this
