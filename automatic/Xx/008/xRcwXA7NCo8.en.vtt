here's the power button and this knob
right<00:00:58.330> here<00:00:58.390> turns<00:00:58.990> out<00:00:59.110> from<00:00:59.260> blowing<00:01:00.030> -

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
right here turns out from blowing -

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.130 
right here turns out from blowing -
sucking<00:01:01.240> up<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.540> leaves

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
sucking up the leaves

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.049 
sucking up the leaves
now<00:01:03.650> I<00:01:03.710> personally<00:01:03.950> don't<00:01:04.520> really<00:01:04.640> like<00:01:04.879> it

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
now I personally don't really like it

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.790 
now I personally don't really like it
for<00:01:05.239> blowing<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.780> leaves<00:01:05.930> we<00:01:06.260> have<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.530> small

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
for blowing the leaves we have the small

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.560 
for blowing the leaves we have the small
leaves<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:07.580> don't<00:01:07.760> feel<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.150> really

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
leaves and so I don't feel it really

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.900 
leaves and so I don't feel it really
works<00:01:08.870> very<00:01:09.110> well<00:01:09.350> for<00:01:09.500> them<00:01:09.770> with<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.700> bigger

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
works very well for them with the bigger

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.400 
works very well for them with the bigger
leaves<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.390> does<00:01:11.540> tend<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.870> blow<00:01:12.080> them<00:01:12.290> up

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
leaves it does tend to blow them up

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.870 
leaves it does tend to blow them up
better<00:01:13.360> but<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:14.510> saves<00:01:15.170> my<00:01:15.560> back<00:01:15.800> from<00:01:16.670> having

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
better but it saves my back from having

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.400 
better but it saves my back from having
to<00:01:17.180> pick<00:01:17.420> up<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.660> leaves<00:01:17.870> and<00:01:18.050> throw<00:01:18.170> them<00:01:18.320> in

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
to pick up the leaves and throw them in

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.870 
to pick up the leaves and throw them in
the<00:01:18.500> garbage<00:01:18.530> can<00:01:19.040> when<00:01:19.370> you<00:01:19.460> can<00:01:19.580> just<00:01:19.729> suck

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
the garbage can when you can just suck

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.120 
the garbage can when you can just suck
them<00:01:20.030> up<00:01:20.150> it<00:01:20.720> bulges<00:01:21.200> them<00:01:21.380> in<00:01:21.560> here<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:21.890> you

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
them up it bulges them in here and you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.340 
them up it bulges them in here and you
just<00:01:22.490> dump<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.790> out<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.690> saves<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:24.110> lot<00:01:24.140> of

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
just dump it out so it saves a lot of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.840 
just dump it out so it saves a lot of
work<00:01:24.979> on<00:01:25.160> that<00:01:25.220> part<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.340> just<00:01:28.550> take<00:01:28.700> your

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
work on that part so you just take your

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.969 
work on that part so you just take your
extension<00:01:29.000> cord<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.720> plug<00:01:29.870> it<00:01:30.050> in<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.590> all

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
extension cord and plug it in and all

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:42.050 
extension cord and plug it in and all
should<00:01:31.340> demonstrate<00:01:31.520> how<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.030> works

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660 

so<00:01:42.600> I'm<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.960> turn<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.650> try<00:01:44.580> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
so I'm going to turn it on and try and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:02:26.449 
so I'm going to turn it on and try and
blow<00:01:45.090> somebody's<00:01:45.630> first<00:01:45.900> hope<00:01:46.200> maybe<00:01:46.409> yes

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.119 

so<00:02:27.459> as<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:28.000> can<00:02:28.150> see<00:02:28.420> when<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.780> use<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.620> blowing

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
so as you can see when I use the blowing

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.190 
so as you can see when I use the blowing
part<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:31.360> kind<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.599> just<00:02:31.810> blows<00:02:32.019> them

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
part it kind of just blows them

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.440 
part it kind of just blows them
everywhere<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.739> doesn't<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:33.450> generalize

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
everywhere it doesn't like generalize

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.410 
everywhere it doesn't like generalize
them<00:02:34.690> into<00:02:34.989> one<00:02:35.170> spot<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.879> me<00:02:37.060> that's<00:02:37.269> not

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
them into one spot so it's me that's not

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.809 
them into one spot so it's me that's not
variable<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.170> want<00:02:38.890> I'd<00:02:39.069> rather<00:02:39.250> break<00:02:39.550> them

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
variable I want I'd rather break them

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.740 
variable I want I'd rather break them
and<00:02:40.090> then<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:43.510> then<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> bag<00:02:45.569> I'm<00:02:46.569> just

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
and then just and then the bag I'm just

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.200 
and then just and then the bag I'm just
going<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:46.989> show<00:02:47.140> you
