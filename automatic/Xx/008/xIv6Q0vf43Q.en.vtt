mainly sports videos because so so in

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.429 
mainly sports videos because so so in
other<00:01:24.270> words<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.110> better

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
other words I think it would be better

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560 
other words I think it would be better
for<00:01:25.560> me<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.159> them<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.210> TBN

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
for me to put them there because on TBN

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.910 
for me to put them there because on TBN
games<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> usually<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:28.710> different

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
games you usually see all different

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
games you usually see all different
types<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.340> games<00:01:29.520> other<00:01:29.790> than<00:01:29.909> sports<00:01:30.420> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
types of games other than sports you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
types of games other than sports you
rarely<00:01:31.320> ever<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.860> sports<00:01:32.310> games<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.210> maybe<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
rarely ever see sports games so maybe I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.090 
rarely ever see sports games so maybe I
was<00:01:33.659> thinking<00:01:33.960> maybe<00:01:34.140> putting<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.680> sports

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100

was thinking maybe putting it on sports
maybe<00:01:35.520> not<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.270> games<00:01:36.540> that's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
maybe not if it's on games that's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
maybe not if it's on games that's
