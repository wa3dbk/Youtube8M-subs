liquid<00:01:53.460> parmesan<00:01:53.999> is<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:55.079> cooler<00:01:55.469> name<00:01:55.590> than

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
liquid parmesan is a cooler name than

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.569 
liquid parmesan is a cooler name than
parmesan<00:01:56.579> sauce<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> anyway<00:01:59.069> it<00:01:59.249> sounds<00:01:59.490> very

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
parmesan sauce so anyway it sounds very

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.940 
parmesan sauce so anyway it sounds very
scientific<00:02:02.359> so<00:02:03.359> you<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.289> we<00:02:04.409> try<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> make

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
scientific so you know we try to make

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.270 
scientific so you know we try to make
things<00:02:05.429> interesting<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.999> fun<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.709> it<00:02:07.709> is<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
things interesting and fun and it is it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.580 
things interesting and fun and it is it
is<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> very<00:02:08.880> unique<00:02:09.420> parmesan<00:02:09.929> sauce<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.440> we

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
is a very unique parmesan sauce and we

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.380 
is a very unique parmesan sauce and we
try<00:02:10.740> to<00:02:10.770> extract<00:02:11.220> all<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.640> flavor<00:02:11.910> from<00:02:12.209> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
try to extract all that flavor from it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.230 
try to extract all that flavor from it
and<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.069> call<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.459> liquid<00:02:14.610> parmesan

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and so we can call it liquid parmesan

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.280 
and so we can call it liquid parmesan
and<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.569> think<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:15.870> half<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.050> fun<00:02:16.170> is

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and I think that's half the fun is

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.050 
and I think that's half the fun is
reading<00:02:16.680> something<00:02:16.970> anticipating<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
reading something anticipating the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.230 
reading something anticipating the
flavor<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.600> then<00:02:18.900> experiencing<00:02:19.590> it

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
flavor and then experiencing it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.750 
flavor and then experiencing it
some<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.050> surprise<00:02:21.410> there<00:02:21.740> speaking<00:02:22.700> of
