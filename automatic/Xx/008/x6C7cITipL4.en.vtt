00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559 
and Jim and generally there's a big

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.259 
and Jim and generally there's a big
misconception<00:00:11.769> of<00:00:12.340> why<00:00:12.549> you<00:00:12.760> can<00:00:12.879> use<00:00:13.000> a<00:00:13.030> belt

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.360 
misconception of why you can use a belt
and<00:00:13.930> the<00:00:14.049> belt<00:00:14.080> basically<00:00:14.740> is<00:00:14.919> used<00:00:15.160> for

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
and the belt basically is used for

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.640 
and the belt basically is used for
safety<00:00:15.580> and<00:00:15.910> tieran<00:00:16.570> stability<00:00:17.080> to<00:00:17.259> your<00:00:17.290> core

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
safety and tieran stability to your core

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.609 
safety and tieran stability to your core
that's<00:00:18.160> not<00:00:18.430> to<00:00:18.700> support<00:00:19.000> you<00:00:19.090> vacuum<00:00:19.539> so<00:00:20.169> you

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
that's not to support you vacuum so you

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.230 
that's not to support you vacuum so you
see<00:00:20.860> a<00:00:20.890> lot<00:00:21.009> of<00:00:21.160> these<00:00:21.250> belts<00:00:21.550> see<00:00:21.849> if<00:00:22.060> I'm

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
see a lot of these belts see if I'm

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.519 
see a lot of these belts see if I'm
entering<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.689> tire<00:00:22.900> or<00:00:23.109> something<00:00:23.140> with<00:00:23.500> a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
entering a tire or something with a

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.210

really<00:00:23.830> wide<00:00:24.269> back<00:00:25.269> support<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:27.130> really

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
really wide back support it's really

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.099 
really wide back support it's really
because<00:00:27.820> it<00:00:27.910> was<00:00:28.000> designed<00:00:28.359> where<00:00:28.750> somebody

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
because it was designed where somebody

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.169 
because it was designed where somebody
really<00:00:29.529> has<00:00:29.920> no<00:00:30.099> idea<00:00:30.400> about<00:00:30.670> weight<00:00:31.150> training

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179

or<00:00:31.599> what<00:00:31.900> it's<00:00:31.990> necessary<00:00:32.500> for<00:00:32.619> so<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:34.600> a

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
or what it's necessary for so just a

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.009 
or what it's necessary for so just a
light<00:00:35.019> that<00:00:36.010> would<00:00:36.640> use<00:00:36.910> something<00:00:37.839> for

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
light that would use something for

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.070 
light that would use something for
everyday<00:00:38.290> training<00:00:39.089> not<00:00:40.089> only<00:00:40.269> heavy<00:00:40.629> squats

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
everyday training not only heavy squats

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.990

or power power dead-looking anything
like<00:00:43.150> that<00:00:43.180> but<00:00:43.900> it's<00:00:44.049> just<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.290> light<00:00:44.500> belt<00:00:44.769> the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
like that but it's just a light belt the

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.439 
like that but it's just a light belt the
purpose<00:00:46.150> is<00:00:46.409> when<00:00:47.409> you<00:00:47.500> put<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.769> belt<00:00:48.010> on<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.560 
purpose is when you put the belt on it
gives<00:00:52.659> you<00:00:52.809> something<00:00:53.260> for<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.280> body<00:00:54.580> so<00:00:55.390> when

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
gives you something for the body so when

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.960 
gives you something for the body so when
you<00:00:55.690> breathe<00:00:55.930> in<00:00:56.339> when<00:00:57.339> you<00:00:57.460> breathe<00:00:57.699> in<00:00:57.850> the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
you breathe in when you breathe in the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.270 
you breathe in when you breathe in the
air<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:59.140> allows<00:00:59.350> you<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.559> push<00:00:59.799> against<00:01:00.100> the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
air it allows you to push against the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.219 
air it allows you to push against the
belt<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:01.119> it<00:01:01.150> gives<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:01.510> stability<00:01:01.720> in<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
belt so it gives you stability in the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.079 
belt so it gives you stability in the
corner<00:01:02.619> when<00:01:03.309> you're<00:01:03.430> doing<00:01:03.670> whether<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.939> do

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
corner when you're doing whether you do

them and watch

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.250 
them and watch
sighs<00:01:06.340> like<00:01:06.550> that<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.210> idea<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.660> read<00:01:08.080> it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
sighs like that the idea is to read it

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.390 
sighs like that the idea is to read it
and<00:01:08.470> like<00:01:08.590> you're<00:01:08.740> saying<00:01:09.040> you're<00:01:09.190> going<00:01:09.340> to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400

hold our breath and you want to push the
air<00:01:11.860> down<00:01:12.130> here<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.790> push<00:01:12.940> against<00:01:13.270> them<00:01:13.510> the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
air down here and push against them the

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.920 
air down here and push against them the
belt<00:01:14.140> here<00:01:14.470> so<00:01:14.950> at<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.190> bottom<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.900> have

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
belt here so at the bottom you have

entire body so it does provide a lot of

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.170 
entire body so it does provide a lot of
safety<00:01:23.320> in<00:01:23.710> that<00:01:23.860> respect<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.700> it<00:01:24.820> allows<00:01:25.000> you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
safety in that respect and it allows you

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.940 
safety in that respect and it allows you
to<00:01:25.240> use<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.720> lot<00:01:25.930> more<00:01:25.990> later<00:01:26.410> more<00:01:26.710> power

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
to use a lot more later more power

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.830
