00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.230
 and that day Jesus leaving home was 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.110
 He sat by the sea and approached him great 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.840
 crowd and entering him on the ship he 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.779
 he sat down and the whole crowd was at 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.839
 shore and spoke to them many things 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.810
 parables saying here's the one 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:28.029
 sowed went out to sow and sow 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.020
 part of the seed fell next to 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.270
 way and the birds came and ate it 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.629
 and part fell on stony places where no 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.420
 I had a lot of land and was born later because 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.789
 it did not have ground depth anymore 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.300
 when the sun came out it burned and dried up 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:49.269
 because it had no root and part fell into 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.780
 three pine trees and the thorns grew and the 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:57.250
 drowned and part fell into good soil and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.440
 fruit one seat and another sixty and 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.190
 another thirty 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.490
 who has ears to hear hear then 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.950
 approaching the disciples told him 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.770
 because you speak to them in parables and the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.900
 responding he said because because of you 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.930
 it is granted to know the mysteries of 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.720
 kingdom of heaven more to them not them 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.330
 is granted because to anyone who 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.990
 has will be given and will have in abundance 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.539
 but who does not have what he has yet 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.200
 will be taken away so I speak to you 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:35.190
 parables because seeing they do not see and hearing 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.260
 they do not hear or understand 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.290
 so that in them the 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.980
 prophecy of Isaiah that says by ear 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.220
 you will hear and you will not understand and seeing you will see 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.800
 and not look 'aces' because the heart of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.860
 this town is thickened and with 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.430
 ears hear heavily and with their eyes 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.830
 they wink so that they see us with their eyes and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.720
 hear with the ears and the heart 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.730
 understand and convert and I will heal 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.540
 more blessed are your eyes because 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.790
 come and your ears because they hear because 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.060
 Truly I say to you that many prophets and 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.860
 just wanted to see what you see and not what 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.140
 they saw and heard what you heard and they did not hear it 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.840
 today, you, to the parable of the one who 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.540
 sowing 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.300
 hearing any word of the kingdom and 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.010
 not understanding the good the bad and 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.860
 snatches what was sown in his 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.620
 heart this is the one that was seeded 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.629
 next to the road and the one that was planted in 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.319
 stony this is the one who hears the word 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:46.760
 and then he receives it with joy but he does not have 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.590
 roots and before it is temporary that the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.069
 affliction or persecution by the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.870
 word is then offended and the one that was 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.480
 sown among thorns this is the one 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.840
 hear the word but the anguish of this 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.620
 century and the deception of riches choke 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.780
 the word and it becomes unfruitful plus the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.450
 that was sown in good soil this is 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.569
 He who hears and understands the word and the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.959
 that bears the fruit and produces a seat 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.200
 and another sixty and another thirty 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.900
 one other parable proposed to them saying 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.970
 the kingdom of heaven is similar to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.910
 man who sows good seed in his 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.370
 more sleeping field the men came their 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.600
 enemy and sowed tares among the wheat and 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.320
 he went 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.930
 and when it came out on grass and it made fruit 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.760
 then the weeds also appeared and 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.910
 approaching the servants of the father of 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.880
 family told him sir you did not sow 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.600
 good seed in your field from where then 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.330
 he has tares and he told them the man 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.330
 enemy has done this and the servants 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.080
 they said you want us to go and the 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.720
 let's take it and he said no because taking the 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.750
 the tares also did not start with her 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.660
 wheat let grow together the one and 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.300
 the other until the harvest and at the time of 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.700
 mow down I'll tell the harvesters to take 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.730
 first the tares and tie the in bundles 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.160
 to burn it more it collects from the wheat in me 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.519
 storehouse 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.470
 another parable proposed to them saying the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.230
 kingdom of heaven is like a 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.960
 mustard grain that taking a man 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.510
 he sowed it in his field which to the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.000
 truth is the smallest of all 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.460
 more seeds when it has grown is the 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.520
 greater of the vegetables and becomes a tree 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.850
 that the birds of the sky come and make 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.130
 nests in their branches another parable 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.670
 said the kingdom of heaven is similar 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.280
 to the leaven that taking the woman the 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.580
 hide three measures of flour up 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.430
 that everything is read of all this talked Jesus 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.920
 by parables to the crowd and nothing 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.450
 he spoke without parables so that he 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.540
 fulfill what was said by the 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.780
 prophet who said open in parables my 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.870
 mouth overflowing and things hidden from the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.840
 foundation of the world then farewell 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.640
 the crowd of jesus came home and 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.640
 approaching him his disciples will be 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.350
 they said we declared the parable of the 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.200
 field tares 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.240
 and answering he told them the one 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.690
 sow the good seed is the son of the 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.090
 man and the field is the world and the good 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.000
 seed are the children of the kingdom and the 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.700
 tares are the children of the bad and the 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.740
 enemy that planted it is the devil and the 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.409
 harvest is the end of the century and 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.019
 reapers are the angels 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.779
 so that as chosen the tares and 

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:46.449
 burned to the fire so it will be in order to 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:49.300
 this century will send the son of man to 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.909
 his angels and they will take from his kingdom all 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.389
 the hindrances and those who do iniquity 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:58.779
 and they will throw them into the furnace of fire there 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.879
 it will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.580
 then tastes will shine like 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:07.190
 the sun in his father's kingdom that 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.930
 have ears to hear hear 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.820
 also the kingdom of heaven is 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.670
 similar to the treasure hidden in the 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.300
 field which has found man what 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:20.080
 cover and joy of it goes and sells 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.280
 everything you have and buy that field 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.860
 also the kingdom of heaven is 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.980
 similar to the man who seeks 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:31.070
 good pearls that finding a beautiful 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:34.310
 pearl went and sold everything I had and 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.440
 the kingdom of heaven also bought it 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:40.160
 is similar to the network that cast in the 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.710
 sea catches all kinds of fish which 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.340
 being full they took it to the shore and 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.770
 sitting they took the good in glasses and what 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:52.039
 bad cast out 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.020
 So it will be at the end of the century 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.389
 angels will turn away from the bad guys 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.539
 among the righteous and they will throw them into the 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:03.470
 fire furnace there will be the weeping and the 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:06.379
 crunching of teeth Jesus said to you 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.139
 understood all these things them 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:12.199
 they answer yes sir 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:14.330
 and I tell you why all write 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:16.550
 adopted in the kingdom of heaven is 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.900
 similar to a parent who takes out 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:22.099
 from his treasure new things and old things 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.009
 it happened that Jesus finished these 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:28.009
 parables passed from there and come to his 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:30.529
 I teach them in the synagogue of 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:33.710
 them in such a way that they were 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:35.949
 out of it and they said where they have 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.770
 this this wisdom and these wonders 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:41.930
 is not this the carpenter's son does not know 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:45.469
 he calls his mother Maria and her brothers 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:48.740
 jacobo and jose and simón and judas are not 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:51.740
 all his sisters with us from where 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.740
 Well, he has all this and he 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.770
 scandalized him more jesus tell them 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.860
 there is no prophet without honor but in his 

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:03.289
 land and in his house and he did not there 

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.879
 many wonders because of the 

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:06.879
 disbelief of them
