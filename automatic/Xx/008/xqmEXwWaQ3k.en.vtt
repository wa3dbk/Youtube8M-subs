essentially<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.039> laminated<00:00:20.880> version<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
essentially a laminated version of that

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.810 
essentially a laminated version of that
versus<00:00:22.199> wood<00:00:22.410> frame<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.980> aluminum<00:00:23.490> skin

construction and it's essentially the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.980 
construction and it's essentially the
smaller<00:00:29.220> little<00:00:29.789> brother<00:00:30.090> counterpart<00:00:30.779> to

the jay feather proper line this is
effectively<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.960> smaller<00:00:37.710> X<00:00:38.100> 17<00:00:39.000> Z<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.079> if

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
effectively a smaller X 17 Z so if

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.619 
effectively a smaller X 17 Z so if
you've<00:00:40.350> been<00:00:40.559> looking<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.190> 17<00:00:41.820> foot<00:00:42.149> hybrid

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
like that 17 Z maybe consider this you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.319 
like that 17 Z maybe consider this you
know<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> said<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:48.180> bit

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
know like I said this is a little bit

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.479 
know like I said this is a little bit
smaller<00:00:48.629> more<00:00:48.870> compact<00:00:49.079> version<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:50.309> it's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
smaller more compact version but it's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.959 
smaller more compact version but it's
also<00:00:51.140> significantly<00:00:52.140> lighter<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.969> less

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
also significantly lighter and less

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
also significantly lighter and less
money<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.719> never<00:00:54.960> seems<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.500> offend<00:00:55.829> anyone

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
money that never seems to offend anyone

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.750 
money that never seems to offend anyone
when<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> say<00:00:56.640> less<00:00:56.910> money<00:00:58.219> if<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.309> step<00:00:59.550> inside

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
when I say less money if you step inside

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.529 
when I say less money if you step inside
just<00:01:00.750> look<00:01:01.020> pretty<00:01:01.230> familiar<00:01:01.670> because<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
just look pretty familiar because like I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
just look pretty familiar because like I
said<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.960> much<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.530> their<00:01:04.799> most<00:01:05.220> popular
