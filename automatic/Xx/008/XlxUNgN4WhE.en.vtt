so<00:01:01.430> long<00:01:01.820> meridian<00:01:02.329> is<00:01:02.600> no<00:01:02.870> outer<00:01:03.199> one<00:01:03.710> third

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
so long meridian is no outer one third

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.200 
so long meridian is no outer one third
running<00:01:04.519> from<00:01:04.760> here<00:01:05.210> go<00:01:05.750> all<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.110> way<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.860> here
