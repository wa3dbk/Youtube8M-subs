00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
how it is it is an awful perk and it's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.830

abused and all these things now while I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.480 
abused and all these things now while I
do<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:09.140> stalker<00:01:10.140> i<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
do think that stalker i think is a is a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
do think that stalker i think is a is a
very<00:01:12.180> powerful<00:01:12.540> perk<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.439> obviously<00:01:13.770> that's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
very powerful perk and obviously that's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.190 
very powerful perk and obviously that's
the<00:01:14.280> that's<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> point<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> video<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.689> I

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the that's the point of this video and I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
the that's the point of this video and I
do<00:01:16.259> personally<00:01:16.799> think<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.759> isn't

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
do personally think that it isn't

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.350 
do personally think that it isn't
slotted<00:01:18.869> properly<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:20.280> how<00:01:20.549> powerful<00:01:21.330> that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
slotted properly for how powerful that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.200 
slotted properly for how powerful that
is<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.350> perk<00:01:22.680> tears<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.340> don't<00:01:23.549> think<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
is in the perk tears I don't think it is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
is in the perk tears I don't think it is
tiered<00:01:24.630> properly<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> rest<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.640> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
playing snd Ninja is probably going to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.050 
playing snd Ninja is probably going to
be<00:02:03.329> your<00:02:03.659> perk<00:02:03.990> du<00:02:04.229> jour<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> most

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
be your perk du jour but for the most

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.990 
be your perk du jour but for the most

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
part stalker still is really really

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360 
part stalker still is really really
really<00:02:09.209> powerful<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:10.020> terms<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.560> when<00:02:11.250> you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
really powerful in terms of when you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.699 
really powerful in terms of when you
enter<00:02:11.790> into<00:02:12.060> battles<00:02:12.810> right<00:02:13.260> because<00:02:13.560> when

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
enter into battles right because when

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.000 
enter into battles right because when
you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.429 
you
when<00:02:14.129> you<00:02:14.250> enter<00:02:14.280> into<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:15.000> battle<00:02:15.540> marksman

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
when you enter into a battle marksman

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.890 
when you enter into a battle marksman
isn't<00:02:16.830> really<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.790> powerful<00:02:18.030> marksman<00:02:18.780> is

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
isn't really that powerful marksman is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.100 
isn't really that powerful marksman is
powerful<00:02:19.379> or<00:02:19.709> marksman<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.459> at<00:02:20.579> its<00:02:20.730> best

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
powerful or marksman is at its best

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.360 
powerful or marksman is at its best
before<00:02:22.110> an<00:02:22.230> engagement<00:02:22.590> when<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.099> aren't

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
before an engagement when you aren't

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.390 
before an engagement when you aren't
when<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.819> are<00:02:24.030> identifying<00:02:24.980> somebody<00:02:25.980> same

when you are identifying somebody same

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.960

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.940 
goes for ninja ninja ninja is best
before<00:02:29.970> or<00:02:30.209> after<00:02:30.450> an<00:02:30.780> engagement<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.590> people

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
before or after an engagement so people

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.860 
before or after an engagement so people
don't<00:02:32.250> know<00:02:32.489> where<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.879> are<00:02:32.909> here<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.629> and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
don't know where you are here you and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.180 
don't know where you are here you and
really<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.230> pro<00:02:34.470> version<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.890> Ninja<00:02:35.159> has

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
really the pro version of Ninja has

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.399 
really the pro version of Ninja has
nothing<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.180> battles<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:37.200> just

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
nothing to do with battles it just

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.110 
nothing to do with battles it just
prevents<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.860> from<00:02:37.890> taking<00:02:38.250> fall<00:02:38.730> damage

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
prevents you from taking fall damage

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.809 
prevents you from taking fall damage
steady<00:02:39.870> aim<00:02:40.109> I<00:02:40.349> think<00:02:40.620> does<00:02:40.890> definitely<00:02:41.250> help

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
steady aim I think does definitely help

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.550 
steady aim I think does definitely help
during<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.269> battle<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.659> course<00:02:43.019> because<00:02:43.409> it

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
during a battle of course because it

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.800 
during a battle of course because it
limits<00:02:43.920> your<00:02:44.159> hipfire<00:02:44.370> spread<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.569> also

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
limits your hipfire spread and it also

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.289 
limits your hipfire spread and it also
decreases<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.250> amount<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.609> time<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:47.970> takes

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
decreases the amount of time it takes

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.849 
decreases the amount of time it takes
for<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.659> to<00:02:48.690> go<00:02:48.959> from<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.379> sprinting

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
for you to go from the sprinting

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.280 
for you to go from the sprinting
animation<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.090> hipfire<00:02:51.299> animation<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:52.170> it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
animation to the hipfire animation so it

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.559 
animation to the hipfire animation so it
does<00:02:52.440> help<00:02:52.680> there<00:02:52.980> my<00:02:53.579> point<00:02:53.909> though<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.180> is

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
does help there my point though is is

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.780 
does help there my point though is is
that<00:02:54.750> stalker<00:02:55.230> i<00:02:55.409> think<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:55.829> more<00:02:56.040> powerful<00:02:56.340> in

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that stalker i think is more powerful in

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.970 
that stalker i think is more powerful in
steady<00:02:57.120> aim<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.450> helps<00:02:57.810> more<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.349> i<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:58.859> it

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
steady aim it helps more and i think it

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.270 
steady aim it helps more and i think it
keeps<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.639> alive<00:03:00.120> better<00:03:00.930> then<00:03:01.650> steady<00:03:02.069> aim

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
keeps you alive better then steady aim

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.729 
keeps you alive better then steady aim
does<00:03:02.519> if<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.420> makes<00:03:03.629> any<00:03:03.750> sense<00:03:03.900> i<00:03:04.260> know<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
does if that makes any sense i know the

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.440 
does if that makes any sense i know the
perk<00:03:04.920> doesn't<00:03:05.220> actually<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.760> anything<00:03:05.790> to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
perk doesn't actually do anything to

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.180 
perk doesn't actually do anything to
alter<00:03:06.750> your<00:03:06.959> health<00:03:07.290> or<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.560> keep<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.859> alive

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
but in terms of implicating it and in

but in terms of implicating it and in
terms<00:03:11.579> of<00:03:11.730> using<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.389> i<00:03:12.599> think<00:03:13.319> stalker<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.430> is

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790

terms of using it i think stalker is is
just<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.209> perk<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.659> people<00:03:16.019> aren't<00:03:16.260> ready<00:03:16.829> for

the<00:03:53.129> left<00:03:53.370> thumbstick<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.709> think<00:03:55.709> it's<00:03:55.799> the

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
the left thumbstick I think it's the

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.770 
the left thumbstick I think it's the
left<00:03:56.069> some<00:03:56.250> thumb<00:03:56.609> stick<00:03:56.849> for<00:03:57.000> ps3<00:03:57.239> too<00:03:57.599> it's

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
left some thumb stick for ps3 too it's

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.110 
left some thumb stick for ps3 too it's
just<00:03:58.019> kind<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:58.829> weird<00:03:58.889> in<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.519> where<00:03:59.819> it<00:03:59.909> is<00:04:00.000> on

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
just kind of weird in the where it is on

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.119 
just kind of weird in the where it is on
the<00:04:00.209> controller<00:04:00.510> but<00:04:00.720> anyway<00:04:00.989> just<00:04:01.769> moving

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
the controller but anyway just moving

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.920 
the controller but anyway just moving
the<00:04:02.220> left<00:04:02.459> thumbstick<00:04:02.699> forward<00:04:03.480> back<00:04:03.690> left

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
the left thumbstick forward back left

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.460 
the left thumbstick forward back left
and<00:04:04.349> right<00:04:04.579> you<00:04:05.579> move<00:04:05.849> faster<00:04:06.569> 80s<00:04:07.199> with

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
and right you move faster 80s with

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.409 
and right you move faster 80s with
stalker<00:04:07.799> than<00:04:08.099> you<00:04:08.220> do<00:04:08.400> normally<00:04:08.909> because

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
stalker than you do normally because

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.300 
stalker than you do normally because
stalker<00:04:10.139> gives<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.709> one<00:04:10.979> hundred<00:04:11.159> percent

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
stalker gives you one hundred percent

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.729 
stalker gives you one hundred percent
run<00:04:11.970> speed<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.720> doesn't<00:04:12.780> give<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.349> one

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
run speed it doesn't give you one

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.439 
run speed it doesn't give you one
hundred<00:04:13.949> percent<00:04:14.099> of<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.760> run<00:04:14.970> speed<00:04:15.269> you

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
hundred percent of the run speed you

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.710 
hundred percent of the run speed you
have<00:04:15.479> with<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.049> weapon<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.889> gives<00:04:17.280> u<00:04:17.489> 100%<00:04:18.209> run

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
have with the weapon it gives u 100% run

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.379 
have with the weapon it gives u 100% run
speed<00:04:19.380> straight<00:04:19.859> away<00:04:20.130> that's<00:04:20.789> what<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.180> get

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
speed straight away that's what you get

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.930 
speed straight away that's what you get
so<00:04:21.690> when<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.289> are<00:04:22.409> 80s<00:04:22.889> with<00:04:23.130> stalker<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.849> are

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
so when you are 80s with stalker you are

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.180 
so when you are 80s with stalker you are
moving<00:04:24.450> as<00:04:24.630> fast<00:04:24.659> as<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.530> can

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
moving as fast as you can

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.760 
moving as fast as you can
in<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.430> game<00:04:26.670> without<00:04:27.390> having<00:04:28.230> something

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
in the game without having something

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.760 
in the game without having something
like<00:04:29.660> lightweight<00:04:30.660> for<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:30.990> LMGs<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.470> think

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
like lightweight for the LMGs I think

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.190 
like lightweight for the LMGs I think
lightweight<00:04:32.190> kind<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.520> messes<00:04:33.480> with<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.900> with

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
lightweight kind of messes with the with

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.480 
lightweight kind of messes with the with
the<00:04:34.320> character<00:04:34.650> movement<00:04:34.890> speed<00:04:35.280> and

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
the character movement speed and

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.310 
the character movement speed and
sprinting<00:04:36.270> that's<00:04:36.480> it<00:04:36.690> those<00:04:36.930> are<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.140> only

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
sprinting that's it those are the only

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.260 
sprinting that's it those are the only
things<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.920> lightweight<00:04:38.370> proficiency<00:04:39.120> for

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
things the lightweight proficiency for

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.290 
things the lightweight proficiency for
LMGs<00:04:40.230> which<00:04:40.530> just<00:04:40.860> decreases<00:04:41.490> movement<00:04:42.060> speed

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
LMGs which just decreases movement speed

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.780 
LMGs which just decreases movement speed
really<00:04:42.540> that's<00:04:42.840> all<00:04:42.990> it<00:04:43.110> does<00:04:43.320> or<00:04:43.790> increases

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
really that's all it does or increases

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.610 
really that's all it does or increases
movement<00:04:45.300> speed<00:04:45.840> increases<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.440> percentage

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
movement speed increases the percentage

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.060 
movement speed increases the percentage
of<00:04:47.130> movement<00:04:47.550> speed<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.140> decreases<00:04:49.830> the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
of movement speed and and decreases the

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.240 
of movement speed and and decreases the
how<00:04:50.790> how<00:04:51.180> much<00:04:51.420> you<00:04:51.540> are<00:04:51.660> held<00:04:51.810> back<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.250> in

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
how how much you are held back and in

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.610 
how how much you are held back and in
sprinting<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:54.120> stalker<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.050> is<00:04:55.200> a<00:04:55.230> very

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
sprinting so stalker is it is a very

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.950 
sprinting so stalker is it is a very
very<00:04:56.040> powerful<00:04:56.460> perk<00:04:57.000> I<00:04:57.120> think<00:04:57.330> it's<00:04:57.450> it's

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
very powerful perk I think it's it's

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.980 
very powerful perk I think it's it's
some<00:04:58.290> things<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:59.670> lot<00:05:00.150> of<00:05:00.450> people<00:05:00.840> are

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
some things that a lot of people are

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.140 
some things that a lot of people are
thrown<00:05:01.380> by<00:05:01.650> it's<00:05:01.920> it's<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.370> new<00:05:02.610> perk<00:05:02.940> it's

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
thrown by it's it's a new perk it's

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.970 
thrown by it's it's a new perk it's
we've<00:05:03.420> never<00:05:03.750> had<00:05:04.050> in<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.320> call<00:05:04.530> of<00:05:04.680> duty

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
we've never had in the call of duty

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.320 
we've never had in the call of duty
cannon<00:05:05.370> up<00:05:05.460> until<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:05.880> point<00:05:05.970> in<00:05:06.240> the

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
cannon up until this point in the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.780 
cannon up until this point in the
multiplayer<00:05:06.720> aspect<00:05:07.230> we've<00:05:07.860> never<00:05:08.280> had<00:05:08.730> a

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
multiplayer aspect we've never had a

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.870 
multiplayer aspect we've never had a
perk<00:05:09.510> that<00:05:10.170> really<00:05:10.650> did<00:05:10.980> anything<00:05:11.280> like<00:05:11.490> this

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
perk that really did anything like this

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.590 
perk that really did anything like this
we've<00:05:12.090> had<00:05:12.300> lightweight<00:05:12.870> yes<00:05:13.370> but

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
we've had lightweight yes but

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.880 
we've had lightweight yes but
lightweight<00:05:15.600> wasn't<00:05:16.230> as<00:05:16.320> powerful

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
lightweight wasn't as powerful

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.720 
lightweight wasn't as powerful
lightweight<00:05:17.130> wasn't<00:05:17.940> is<00:05:19.070> again<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:20.190> was

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
lightweight wasn't is again it was

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.040 
lightweight wasn't is again it was
difficult<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.420> contend<00:05:21.900> with<00:05:22.050> in<00:05:22.700> terms<00:05:23.700> of

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
difficult to contend with in terms of

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.260 
difficult to contend with in terms of
understand<00:05:25.050> you're<00:05:25.200> seeing<00:05:25.530> somebody<00:05:25.830> and

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
understand you're seeing somebody and

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.520 
understand you're seeing somebody and
understanding<00:05:27.270> how<00:05:27.300> they<00:05:27.750> are<00:05:27.870> going<00:05:28.170> to<00:05:28.260> move

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
understanding how they are going to move

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.170 
understanding how they are going to move
and<00:05:28.740> how<00:05:28.830> they<00:05:29.100> are<00:05:29.220> able<00:05:29.430> to<00:05:29.760> move<00:05:29.880> and<00:05:30.090> how

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
and how they are able to move and how

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.030 
and how they are able to move and how

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
they are not able to move because really

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.460 
they are not able to move because really
what<00:05:32.340> what<00:05:32.850> stalker<00:05:33.210> is<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:34.110> reason<00:05:34.260> why

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
what what stalker is and the reason why

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.350 
what what stalker is and the reason why
lightweight<00:05:35.010> was<00:05:35.250> was<00:05:35.610> effective<00:05:36.120> in<00:05:36.210> this

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
lightweight was was effective in this

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.700 
lightweight was was effective in this
area<00:05:36.720> and<00:05:36.810> my<00:05:36.900> stalker<00:05:37.200> is<00:05:37.350> even<00:05:37.560> more

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
area and my stalker is even more

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.070 
area and my stalker is even more
effective<00:05:37.950> is<00:05:38.250> because<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.730> is<00:05:38.850> a<00:05:38.880> trick<00:05:39.419> perk

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
effective is because it is a trick perk

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.750 
effective is because it is a trick perk
it<00:05:40.320> plays<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.590> trick<00:05:40.919> on<00:05:41.070> your<00:05:41.190> brain<00:05:41.490> whether

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
it plays a trick on your brain whether

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.850 
it plays a trick on your brain whether

terms of hundred percent movement speed

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.680 
terms of hundred percent movement speed
and<00:06:23.220> it's<00:06:23.580> something<00:06:23.790> we<00:06:23.940> are<00:06:24.150> not<00:06:24.330> expecting
