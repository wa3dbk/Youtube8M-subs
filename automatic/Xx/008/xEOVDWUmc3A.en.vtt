 in October 1988 the saw below 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.750

 new generation 16 bit machine 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.240
 called mega drive that comes 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.030
 marketed in Japan where however 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.899
 was hampered by the already present fixed 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.460
 engine of the nec in 1989 the car 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.170

 the g9 cowboy juries 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:19.080
 this car tom jones language that already today 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.080
 to chatter a mysterious 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.080
 for me I asked for help 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.080
 ventimiglia 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.439
 in the Christmas of 1990 the mega drive succeeds 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.840
 finally outperforming the competition 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.950
 del nes and in the united states one appears 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.709
 advertising that in a very way 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.260
 aggressive reads verbatim genesis 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.969
 don swat nintendo with the intent of 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.469
 make technical superiority known 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.469
 compared to the s 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:59.420
 Yes No 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.420
 no 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.170
 very well

 ketchum low angel of August in teak e 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.069
 monaco gp fie 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.220
 in 1991 the super light from Nintendo 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.050
 nintendo or super famicom that 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.390
 objectively it has a superior graphic 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.060
 to his direct rival to 16 bits of gas 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.739
 bad luck but that has a speed of 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.230
 much lower calculation than 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.120
 the latter so the silvia exploiting 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.560
 this its advantage from the light the game 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.599
 which more than any other would have 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.760
 emphasized this difference between the 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.760
 two machines namely sonic the hedgehog 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.490
 and Christmas of 1991 makes its appearance 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.860
 mega drive ii saw that differs from 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.020
 first model in the design in the lack 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.040
 of the cable exit for the antenna and is 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.769
 headphone output 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.680
 in the same year he sees the sonic light 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.390
 hedgehog 2 which sells about 6 million 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.280
 copies becoming the major title 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.160
 success for the mega drive 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.930
 in 1994 the saw pushes his car 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.840
 at most by inserting the chip into the 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.240
 siga virtual racing game cartridge 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.870
 which allows the console to manage the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.870
 polygonal graphic 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.669
 the mr megadrive excels up to 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.289
 Christmas of 93 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.630
