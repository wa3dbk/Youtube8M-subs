00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
crackly so I mean you can put a lip balm

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.270 
crackly so I mean you can put a lip balm
on<00:05:28.780> top<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:29.290> doesn't<00:05:29.440> mess<00:05:29.650> up<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.800> color<00:05:29.980> too

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
on top it doesn't mess up the color too

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.150 
on top it doesn't mess up the color too
much<00:05:30.520> but<00:05:31.330> just<00:05:31.720> so<00:05:31.840> you<00:05:31.960> know<00:05:31.990> you<00:05:32.770> have<00:05:32.950> to

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
much but just so you know you have to

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.400 
much but just so you know you have to
use<00:05:33.700> a<00:05:33.730> lip<00:05:33.940> on<00:05:34.120> before<00:05:34.480> probably<00:05:35.050> used<00:05:35.350> to

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
use a lip on before probably used to

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.770 
use a lip on before probably used to
look<00:05:35.620> mom<00:05:35.860> during<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.790> day<00:05:37.000> but<00:05:37.540> it<00:05:37.690> really

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
look mom during the day but it really

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.180 
look mom during the day but it really
shouldn't<00:05:38.110> mess<00:05:38.320> up<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.590> color<00:05:38.740> so<00:05:39.070> that's

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
shouldn't mess up the color so that's

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.630 
shouldn't mess up the color so that's
