the<00:02:00.460> years<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:01.000> that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
the years is that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.900 
the years is that
trackdown<00:02:02.350> oily<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:03.220> want<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.520> look<00:02:03.670> at<00:02:03.790> the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
trackdown oily you want to look at the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.750 
trackdown oily you want to look at the
highest<00:02:04.360> place<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:04.660> elevation<00:02:05.320> first<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.520> yes

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
highest place of elevation first the yes

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.250 
highest place of elevation first the yes
it's<00:02:06.970> down<00:02:07.150> here<00:02:07.510> but<00:02:07.690> let's<00:02:07.810> look<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.140> little

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
it's down here but let's look a little

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.080 
it's down here but let's look a little
higher<00:02:08.590> because<00:02:08.860> gravity<00:02:09.490> is<00:02:09.520> always<00:02:09.940> going

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
higher because gravity is always going

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.270 
higher because gravity is always going
to<00:02:10.150> pull<00:02:10.390> oil<00:02:10.630> down<00:02:10.900> so<00:02:11.440> even<00:02:11.740> though<00:02:11.830> it's<00:02:12.010> all

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
to pull oil down so even though it's all

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.280 
to pull oil down so even though it's all
down<00:02:12.730> here<00:02:13.000> at<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.210> bottom<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.900> could<00:02:14.170> be

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
down here at the bottom it could be

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.530 
down here at the bottom it could be
coming<00:02:14.470> from<00:02:14.620> somewhere<00:02:15.010> further<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:16.060> say<00:02:16.360> we

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
coming from somewhere further and say we

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.710 
coming from somewhere further and say we
can<00:02:16.690> find

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.900 

all<00:02:24.260> right<00:02:24.440> now<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.710> can<00:02:25.100> see<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.700> there<00:02:25.880> is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
all right now you can see that there is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.720 
all right now you can see that there is
a<00:02:26.150> little<00:02:26.690> bit<00:02:26.900> above<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.590> oil<00:02:27.800> pan<00:02:28.100> on<00:02:28.400> the

a little bit above the oil pan on the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.180 
a little bit above the oil pan on the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
block also where the block meets the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.110 
block also where the block meets the
back<00:02:31.340> cylinder<00:02:31.880> head<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.460> look<00:02:37.670> right

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
back cylinder head but if you look right

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.030 
back cylinder head but if you look right
up<00:02:38.330> there<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.750> top<00:02:39.020> corner<00:02:39.530> there's<00:02:39.950> a
