 Like the one where he always had ours 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.509

 I am afraid of doing anything 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 probably not for that mother on that miracle 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.170
 this can be found in the man 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.320
 the questionable lead 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.320
 this year we not only have more mutual cooperation 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.010

 when there will be more or other years 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.210

 at the sports hall the whale 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 my husband michael accent one with psychiatric patient 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.230

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.230
 the pipe from the pile of batteries 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 our entire royal family Hans Meyer 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 more of that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.760
 such a goal 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.760
 again fully negotiated 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.760
 r was not then 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.760

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.819
 the ball rolled assessed 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.819
 day before it became a huge one 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339

 88 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.279
 I only see it now that is it 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.279
 vincent van gogh cap 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.309
 it ruled out that the list would come over to the telephone chrome danny 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.229
 walbeck used to say something 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.649
 they recently sat at the table with members of the royal family 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.469
 I have and then you have at the drawer 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.819
 a gala evening every day in the context of the first stone 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.059
 I say in a customer how can you present with a gala during one 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.059
 planter read more who will be using the name icloud for a long time 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.799
 but as I said 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:52.379
 but oh well it was even as relaxed as it was at a given moment 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.109
 vacation division 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.619
 be a committee 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:58.579
 it is the woman stayed 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.149
 sigh 6 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:02.709
 at the owner 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.859
 I'm in those years 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.389
 I don't think so 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.469
 I'm out 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.469
 have you got up now 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.129
 two years ago 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.129
 furthermore, you thought ach gut what to deliver 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.970
 from april in italy germany and the netherlands from one of our country he was 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.970
 afraid that I came late last year to get light from the hague 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.639
 so two hours early at the destination 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.289
 and then of killing passenger cars in her time with a game at school 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.669
 I can high because he equals it is already just explain that we like on me 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.710
 do you need to leave 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.650
 the ball went as far away as possible 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.020
 so actually burning buildings work loose 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.469
 that's too expensive 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.839
 frank de winne 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.830
 how do you break up his wife 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.830
 head for the afternoon 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.370
 the bicycle bridge is often simplified in all the backs 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.039
 more animals are falling there 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.669
 this is the day and the state by a case even though everything lasts that is what i like 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.669
 left on the role that will pop up 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.999
 a listening device of the parking garage 8 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.999
 I was the first results like the whole of life 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.559
 back in May 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:48.499
 the ball and therefore could not reach the same day later 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:51.499
 joling 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.389
 try calling 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.379
 he is a fighter how that charge 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.789
 that is what you mean by the banks 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.349
 that was a coincidence 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.509
 think of the website it is not with 10 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.759
 who smith coincidence that is not therefore not coincidental 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.080
 coincidence does not exist 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.029
 Jos coincidence does not exist, everything is destined 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:22.029
 committee member vision everything is destined 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:24.379
 years later but the question 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.680
 I live independently and certainly also for the voice 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.680
 it was added that this suspicion does not exist by chance 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:33.449
 they could be coincidental 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.189
 and chance does not exist 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:37.879
 coincidence does indeed exist 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:38.650
 I set tour 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.889
 he is coincidence does not exist I did already exist then d 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.369
 he said chance does not exist, I put coincidence against each other 

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:49.259
 if i have to end this pointless discussion i put my processor eagle on that 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.089
 moment I heard someone say coincidence does not exist is never to none 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.529
 soccer player in the world
