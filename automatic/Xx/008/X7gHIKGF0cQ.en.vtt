how to install HIDs on a 2011 Ford
Fusion<00:00:05.250> se<00:00:05.870> this<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> four-cylinder<00:00:07.649> so

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
Fusion se this is a four-cylinder so

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.400 
Fusion se this is a four-cylinder so
basically<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.630> setup<00:00:09.960> where<00:00:10.290> I've

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
basically this is the setup where I've

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.350 
basically this is the setup where I've
already<00:00:10.769> installed<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.370> I've<00:00:11.550> got<00:00:11.820> my<00:00:11.849> ballast

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
already installed it I've got my ballast

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.320 
already installed it I've got my ballast
right<00:00:12.570> here<00:00:12.840> for<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.170> right<00:00:13.590> headlamp<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.849> on

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
right here for the right headlamp and on

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.939 
right here for the right headlamp and on
the<00:00:15.450> left<00:00:15.690> side<00:00:15.900> which<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.230> more<00:00:16.470> trickier

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the left side which is the more trickier

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.570 
the left side which is the more trickier
one<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.369> actually<00:00:17.670> have<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.510> installed<00:00:19.490> it's<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
one I actually have it installed it's a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.670 
one I actually have it installed it's a
little<00:00:20.820> hard<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:21.900> down<00:00:22.320> in

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
little hard to see but it's down in

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.120 
little hard to see but it's down in
there<00:00:23.330> underneath<00:00:24.330> all<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.630> little<00:00:24.900> wiring

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
there underneath all this little wiring

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
there underneath all this little wiring
so<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.340> easiest<00:00:26.670> way<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.910> get<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:28.080> is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
so the easiest way to get to it here is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.290 
so the easiest way to get to it here is
to<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.429> least<00:00:29.550> we're<00:00:29.849> starting<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
to for at least we're starting with the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.209 
to for at least we're starting with the
left<00:00:30.480> side<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:31.260> want<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.590> go<00:00:31.710> ahead<00:00:31.800> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
bottom there which is hard to remove but

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.789 
bottom there which is hard to remove but
you<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.840> enough<00:01:19.049> space<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.320> pull<00:01:19.650> this

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
you just want enough space to pull this

you just want enough space to pull this
apart<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.540> all<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:22.020> which<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.740> gonna<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
apart and all you do which is gonna be a

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.690 
apart and all you do which is gonna be a
little<00:01:23.159> hard<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.549> see<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
little hard to see here but there is a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.870 
little hard to see here but there is a
cap<00:01:27.170> at<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.250> let's<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> good

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
cap at the let's see if I can get a good

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.069 
cap at the let's see if I can get a good
view<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:30.860> there's<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.299> dust<00:01:33.299> cap<00:01:33.689> right

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
view of it here there's a dust cap right

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.670 
view of it here there's a dust cap right
there<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.560> remove<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:36.140> basically<00:01:37.140> go

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
there which you remove and basically go

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.960 
there which you remove and basically go
ahead<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:37.950> plug<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.189> your<00:01:38.310> new<00:01:38.579> headlights

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
ahead and plug in your new headlights

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.620 
ahead and plug in your new headlights
attach<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> stock<00:01:40.110> headlight<00:01:40.950> wiring

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
attach it to the stock headlight wiring

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
attach it to the stock headlight wiring
and<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.380> should<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.950> pretty<00:01:44.100> much<00:01:44.310> good<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.579> go

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and you should be pretty much good to go

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
and you should be pretty much good to go
this<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.090> assuming<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> already<00:01:45.780> have

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
should be good to go just make sure your

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.440 
should be good to go just make sure your
polarity<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:31.800> wiring<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.310> correct<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:33.210> it

is<00:02:33.600> incorrect<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.380> will<00:02:34.530> actually<00:02:35.540> start

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
is incorrect it will actually start

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.260 
is incorrect it will actually start
flickering<00:02:36.870> things<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.770> nature<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:39.030> just
