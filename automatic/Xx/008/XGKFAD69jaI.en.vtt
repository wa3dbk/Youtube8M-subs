hackers calm and today I'm going to be
demonstrating<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.040> basics<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.609> connecting

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
demonstrating the basics of connecting

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.480 
demonstrating the basics of connecting
your<00:00:06.299> printer<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.960> computer<00:00:07.370> we're<00:00:08.370> going

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
your printer to a computer we're going

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.830 
your printer to a computer we're going
to<00:00:08.550> assume<00:00:08.730> you've<00:00:08.940> never<00:00:09.120> used<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.450> program

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
to assume you've never used this program

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.000 
to assume you've never used this program
before<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.349> you're<00:00:10.440> trying<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.650> connect<00:00:10.920> your

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
before and you're trying to connect your

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.160 
before and you're trying to connect your
printer<00:00:11.099> for<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.429> first<00:00:11.670> time<00:00:11.880> now<00:00:12.840> I'm<00:00:13.049> going

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
printer for the first time now I'm going

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.209 
printer for the first time now I'm going
to<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.320> connecting<00:00:13.679> an<00:00:13.740> error<00:00:13.889> well<00:00:14.009> five

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
to be connecting an error well five

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.620 
to be connecting an error well five
point<00:00:14.429> five<00:00:14.549> minutes<00:00:14.790> video<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.540> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
point five minutes video but it's a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.570 
point five minutes video but it's a
really<00:00:15.780> general<00:00:16.230> process<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:16.949> it'll<00:00:17.130> work<00:00:17.160> for

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
really general process so it'll work for

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.670 
really general process so it'll work for
most<00:00:17.880> printers<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.960> only<00:00:19.140> difference<00:00:19.410> will

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
most printers the only difference will

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.950 
most printers the only difference will
be<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.039> drivers<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:21.270> need<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.539> install<00:00:21.660> if

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
be the drivers you need to install if

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.120 
be the drivers you need to install if
any<00:00:22.850> okay<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.180> here<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.529> program

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
any okay so here we have the program

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.400 
any okay so here we have the program
open<00:00:26.460> we're<00:00:27.330> assuming<00:00:27.510> we've<00:00:27.779> downloaded<00:00:27.990> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
open we're assuming we've downloaded it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.849

you've<00:00:32.009> never<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.340> opened<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:33.380> now<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.440> can

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
you've never really opened it now we can

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.010 
you've never really opened it now we can
see<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.579> different<00:00:35.850> items<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.239> settings<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
see the different items and settings and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.030

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
everything but we're only going to focus

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.740 
everything but we're only going to focus
on<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.430> thing<00:00:38.460> today<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.360> button

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
on one thing today and that's the button

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.130 
on one thing today and that's the button
at<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> top<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.379> Add<00:00:40.620> Printer<00:00:41.899> go<00:00:42.899> ahead<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
at the top here Add Printer go ahead and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.810 
at the top here Add Printer go ahead and
open<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.350> up

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
open that up

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.369 
open that up
this<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:44.969> open<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> printer<00:00:45.899> selection

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
this will open up the printer selection

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.770 
this will open up the printer selection
window<00:00:46.500> normally<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.610> right<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.390> empty

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
window normally but right now it's empty

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.069 
window normally but right now it's empty
so<00:00:49.230> we'll<00:00:49.469> change<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.719> we've<00:00:51.719> only<00:00:51.899> got<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so we'll change that we've only got a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.529 
so we'll change that we've only got a
couple<00:00:52.199> options<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.180> takes<00:00:54.390> us

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
couple options here it just takes us

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.869 
couple options here it just takes us
straight<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> add<00:00:55.079> printer<00:00:55.500> menu<00:00:55.949> which

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
straight to the add printer menu which

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.340 
straight to the add printer menu which
would<00:00:57.030> normally<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.360> down<00:00:57.930> here<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
would normally be down here at the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.069 
would normally be down here at the
bottom<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.390> we'll<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.660> ahead<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.960> name

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

the<00:01:32.520> HDD<00:01:32.909> XL<00:01:33.390> 5.5<00:01:34.079> I'm<00:01:34.320> using<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.740> 5.5<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> can

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the HDD XL 5.5 I'm using a 5.5 so I can

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.539 
the HDD XL 5.5 I'm using a 5.5 so I can
select<00:01:36.210> either<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.600> ABS<00:01:36.990> appealing<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.280> only

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
select either the ABS appealing the only

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.539 
select either the ABS appealing the only
difference<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:40.189> settings<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:42.180> used

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
difference is the settings that are used

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.920 
difference is the settings that are used
when<00:01:44.549> printing<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> ABS<00:01:45.600> will<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
when printing so the ABS will have the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.929 
when printing so the ABS will have the
higher<00:01:46.049> temperature<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.829> everything<00:01:47.040> these

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
higher temperature and everything these

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.609 
higher temperature and everything these
