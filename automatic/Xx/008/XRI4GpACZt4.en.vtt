00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
of dirt like that I would prefer it to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
of dirt like that I would prefer it to
actually<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.619> dirt<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.549> tractor<00:01:15.030> like

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
you're a little high up in the seat for

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.039 
you're a little high up in the seat for
the<00:04:13.500> way<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> seats<00:04:13.980> positioned<00:04:14.580> but<00:04:15.049> that's

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
the way the seats positioned but that's

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.000 
the way the seats positioned but that's
not<00:04:16.620> too<00:04:16.859> bad<00:04:17.040> let's<00:04:17.459> start<00:04:17.880> it

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.880 

now<00:04:23.010> I'm<00:04:23.280> not<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.550> fan<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.060> startup<00:04:24.480> sound

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
now I'm not a fan of the startup sound

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.650 
now I'm not a fan of the startup sound
it<00:04:25.890> literally<00:04:26.370> sounds<00:04:27.000> like<00:04:27.120> they<00:04:27.300> just

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
it literally sounds like they just

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.780 
it literally sounds like they just
copied<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.320> startup<00:04:28.980> sound<00:04:29.160> from<00:04:29.520> the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
copied the startup sound from the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.630 
copied the startup sound from the
regular<00:04:30.390> tractors<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.920> in-game<00:04:32.280> based

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
regular tractors the in-game based

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.830 
regular tractors the in-game based
tractors<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.710> come<00:04:34.710> from<00:04:34.800> Giants<00:04:35.370> in<00:04:35.840> my

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
tractors that come from Giants in my

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.870 
tractors that come from Giants in my
opinion<00:04:37.140> that's<00:04:37.470> what<00:04:37.650> this<00:04:37.800> sounds<00:04:38.250> like<00:04:40.880> it

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
opinion that's what this sounds like it

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.060 
opinion that's what this sounds like it
does<00:04:42.240> not<00:04:42.480> have<00:04:42.720> an<00:04:42.840> adjustable<00:04:43.320> smokestack

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
does not have an adjustable smokestack

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.400 
does not have an adjustable smokestack
it<00:04:44.370> is<00:04:44.580> just<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.300> solid<00:04:47.060> black<00:04:48.060> smoke<00:04:48.510> it

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
it is just a solid black smoke it

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.180 
it is just a solid black smoke it
doesn't<00:04:49.830> stop<00:04:50.160> or<00:04:50.400> lower<00:04:51.740> it<00:04:52.740> does<00:04:52.980> have

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
doesn't stop or lower it does have

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.920

pretty<00:04:53.400> good<00:04:53.640> sound<00:04:54.060> when<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.360> try<00:04:54.540> to<00:04:54.600> use

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
pretty good sound when you try to use

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.610 
pretty good sound when you try to use
the<00:04:55.140> reverse<00:04:55.320> as<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.740> break<00:04:56.040> I<00:04:56.370> do<00:04:57.150> like<00:04:57.450> that

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.260 

but<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.650> just<00:05:02.190> am<00:05:02.280> NOT<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.460> huge<00:05:02.700> fan<00:05:02.970> of<00:05:03.000> the

but I just am NOT a huge fan of the
tractor<00:05:03.720> sound<00:05:04.020> it's<00:05:04.920> probably<00:05:05.490> got<00:05:05.610> 130

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330

liter<00:05:06.570> tank<00:05:06.900> on<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.230> there's<00:05:07.380> only<00:05:07.500> hundred

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
liter tank on it there's only hundred

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.040 
liter tank on it there's only hundred
and<00:05:07.920> twenty-nine<00:05:08.280> in<00:05:08.460> it<00:05:08.580> now<00:05:08.780> but<00:05:09.780> you<00:05:09.900> always

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
and twenty-nine in it now but you always

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.080 
and twenty-nine in it now but you always
lose<00:05:10.260> one<00:05:10.560> liter<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:11.220> it's<00:05:11.760> probably<00:05:12.060> a

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
lose one liter so it's probably a

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.750 
lose one liter so it's probably a
hundred<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.420> thirty<00:05:12.570> liter<00:05:12.810> tank<00:05:13.460> top<00:05:14.460> speed

hour

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.600

I'll<00:05:17.400> run<00:05:17.730> her<00:05:17.820> off<00:05:17.850> to<00:05:18.120> top<00:05:18.330> speed<00:05:18.660> here<00:05:19.610> so

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
I'll run her off to top speed here so

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.450 
I'll run her off to top speed here so
she<00:05:20.670> tops<00:05:21.060> out<00:05:21.270> at<00:05:21.420> 18<00:05:24.740> let's<00:05:25.740> go<00:05:25.920> ahead<00:05:26.010> and

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
she tops out at 18 let's go ahead and

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.410 
she tops out at 18 let's go ahead and
run<00:05:27.120> her<00:05:27.270> back<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.780> other<00:05:27.900> side<00:05:28.230> here<00:05:28.590> and

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
run her back to the other side here and

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.520 
run her back to the other side here and
then<00:05:31.250> we<00:05:32.250> will<00:05:32.460> buy<00:05:32.700> something<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:33.930> make<00:05:34.350> sure

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
then we will buy something and make sure

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.950 
then we will buy something and make sure
the<00:05:36.950> PTO<00:05:37.950> and<00:05:38.040> all<00:05:38.670> that<00:05:38.880> good<00:05:39.090> stuff<00:05:39.120> hooks<00:05:39.660> up

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
the PTO and all that good stuff hooks up

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.200 
the PTO and all that good stuff hooks up
we<00:05:40.890> already<00:05:40.980> got<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.250> fertilizer<00:05:41.730> spreader

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
we already got a fertilizer spreader

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.870 
we already got a fertilizer spreader
here<00:05:42.840> so<00:05:43.140> I<00:05:43.470> guess<00:05:43.950> we<00:05:44.040> could<00:05:44.160> use<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.640> I

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
here so I guess we could use that I

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.990 
here so I guess we could use that I
forgot<00:05:45.390> we<00:05:45.540> have<00:05:45.720> this<00:05:45.960> I<00:05:46.370> think<00:05:47.370> this<00:05:47.700> is<00:05:47.850> the

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
forgot we have this I think this is the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.430 
forgot we have this I think this is the
right<00:05:48.120> sign<00:05:48.480> it<00:05:48.780> should<00:05:49.020> be

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.750 

all<00:05:56.440> right<00:05:56.650> so<00:05:56.830> it's<00:05:56.950> up<00:05:57.100> out<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:57.370> have<00:05:57.520> a<00:05:57.550> look

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
all right so it's up out and have a look

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.330 
all right so it's up out and have a look
PTL<00:06:00.760> looks<00:06:01.000> like<00:06:01.150> it<00:06:01.270> hooks<00:06:01.450> up<00:06:01.630> correctly

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
PTL looks like it hooks up correctly

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.170 
PTL looks like it hooks up correctly
three-point<00:06:03.340> looks<00:06:03.610> like<00:06:03.760> it<00:06:03.880> attaches

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
three-point looks like it attaches

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.760 
three-point looks like it attaches
correctly<00:06:05.280> so<00:06:06.280> that's<00:06:06.400> all<00:06:06.640> good<00:06:06.850> stuff<00:06:07.120> there

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
correctly so that's all good stuff there

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.410 
correctly so that's all good stuff there

f you have front lights rear lights and

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.670 
f you have front lights rear lights and

the<00:06:26.680> 1<00:06:26.860> 2<00:06:27.100> 3<00:06:27.400> 4<00:06:27.880> 5<00:06:28.470> 7<00:06:29.470> 8<00:06:29.680> and<00:06:30.250> 9<00:06:30.310> keys<00:06:30.940> do

the 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 and 9 keys do
absolutely<00:06:31.450> nothing<00:06:32.550> there<00:06:33.550> is<00:06:33.730> a<00:06:33.760> horn<00:06:34.620> there
