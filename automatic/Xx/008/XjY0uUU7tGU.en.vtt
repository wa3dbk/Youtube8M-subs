00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
against the wall and then just use your

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
seconds to a minute

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.160 
seconds to a minute
sometimes<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.460> go<00:00:35.640> back<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.270> I'm<00:00:36.420> feeling

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
sometimes I go back to it if I'm feeling

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:49.040 
sometimes I go back to it if I'm feeling
real<00:00:37.380> tight<00:00:45.050> then<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.140> grab<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> mini<00:00:46.680> band<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:48.050> I

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
real tight then I grab a mini band and I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.950 
real tight then I grab a mini band and I
do<00:00:49.110> pull<00:00:49.739> apart<00:00:50.129> into<00:00:50.610> shoulder<00:00:51.360> dislocates

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
do pull apart into shoulder dislocates

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.729 
do pull apart into shoulder dislocates
you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.070> use<00:00:53.190> PVC<00:00:53.730> pipe<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.930> whatever<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.559> I

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you can use PVC pipe or whatever but I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
you can use PVC pipe or whatever but I
prefer<00:00:56.160> using<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> mini<00:00:56.640> band<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.539> start

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
prefer using the mini band and I start

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.189 
prefer using the mini band and I start
out<00:00:58.109> wide<00:00:59.899> just<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> pull<00:01:01.260> apart<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.080> do

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
out wide just do a pull apart and do

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.070 
out wide just do a pull apart and do
dislocate<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:09.890> keep<00:01:11.570> put<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> tighter<00:01:12.930> with

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
dislocate and I keep put a tighter with

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.690 
dislocate and I keep put a tighter with
more<00:01:13.320> resistance<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.920> prefer<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> mini<00:01:14.490> band

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
more resistance I prefer the mini band

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.380 
more resistance I prefer the mini band
because<00:01:14.939> there's<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.180> resistance<00:01:15.659> against<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
because there's a resistance against it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.050 
because there's a resistance against it
but<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.720> try<00:01:18.930> stretch<00:01:19.229> back<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:20.060> keep

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
but I really try stretch back here keep

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.600 
but I really try stretch back here keep
my<00:01:21.180> shoulders<00:01:21.540> real<00:01:21.720> mobile<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:25.490> usually<00:01:26.490> do

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
my shoulders real mobile I usually do

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.539 
my shoulders real mobile I usually do
about<00:01:26.820> 10<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.150> those<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:28.189> just<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.340> some

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
about 10 of those and then just do some

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.149 
about 10 of those and then just do some
above<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> head<00:01:30.509> pull<00:01:30.840> apart<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.890> kind<00:01:32.100> of

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
above the head pull apart just kind of

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.510 
above the head pull apart just kind of
stretch<00:01:32.369> everything<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.780> feels<00:01:34.520> it's

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
stretch everything out so it feels it's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
stretch everything out so it feels it's
only<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.689> any<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> used

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
only I don't really have any so I used

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
only I don't really have any so I used
to<00:01:37.619> when<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> first<00:01:38.400> started<00:01:38.670> my<00:01:38.790> career<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.299> got

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
to when I first started my career I got

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.149 
to when I first started my career I got
impingements<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> time<00:01:40.680> I'd<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
impingements all the time I'd have to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.850 
impingements all the time I'd have to
get<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.090> RT<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.840> since<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.470> started<00:01:43.530> doing

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
get go to a RT but since I started doing

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.950 
get go to a RT but since I started doing
this<00:01:44.130> doing<00:01:44.790> prehab<00:01:45.299> instead<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.810> worrying

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
this doing prehab instead of worrying

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.620 
this doing prehab instead of worrying
about<00:01:46.049> rehab<00:01:46.560> every<00:01:46.950> time<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.490> haven't<00:01:48.270> had<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
about rehab every time I haven't had a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.530 
about rehab every time I haven't had a
shoulder<00:01:49.229> impingement<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.890> probably<00:01:50.340> about

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
shoulder impingement and probably about

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.920 
shoulder impingement and probably about
four<00:01:51.540> or<00:01:51.570> five<00:01:51.840> years<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.920> they'll<00:01:53.100> do

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
four or five years now and they'll do

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.350 
four or five years now and they'll do
then

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
then

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
then
that's<00:01:57.360> about<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.079> yeah<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.280> just
