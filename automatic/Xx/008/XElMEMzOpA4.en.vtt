00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.940
 try something different 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.950
 I'm going to start from scratch so I'm going to 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.650

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.860
 spontaneous like the one that I have and everything 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.860
 that 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.280
 with the pencil eyeliner in soft wing 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.559
 I'm going to start eye makeup 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.049
 this time I'm going to use it as a 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.360
 creamy base for the shade that comes to 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.880
 so I'm going to apply it in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.799
 all the eyelid mobile and I'll review it 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.180
 how many times is it necessary for 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.180
 it is a very intense color 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.800
 with the same pencil I will outline below 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.800
 of the lower lashes 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.190

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.840
 aquamarine here and I'll put it 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.479
 on top of bergia pencil this combination 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.860
 of these two colors gives us a green 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.860
 precious emerald 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.400

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.920

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.580
 lashes with a brush a little more 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.880
