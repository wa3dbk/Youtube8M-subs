whisker style of rest include hips he
seemed<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.820> put<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.270> plus<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.680> no-brainer

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
seemed to put on plus it's a no-brainer

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.549 
seemed to put on plus it's a no-brainer
to<00:00:41.640> use<00:00:41.850> once<00:00:42.270> your<00:00:42.420> arrow<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.809> trapped<00:00:43.320> in

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to use once your arrow is trapped in

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.459 
to use once your arrow is trapped in
there<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.920> holds<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.850> solidly<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.289> don't

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
there it holds it solidly and you don't

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.869 
there it holds it solidly and you don't
have<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.770> think<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> that's<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.579> good<00:00:47.820> thing

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
have to think and that's a good thing

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.709 
have to think and that's a good thing
when<00:00:48.450> things<00:00:48.719> aren't<00:00:48.899> raveling<00:00:49.530> blowing

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.740 

now<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.710> advantages<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.879> drop<00:00:55.149> away<00:00:55.359> rest

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
now the advantages to a drop away rest

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.250 
now the advantages to a drop away rest
like<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.140> Matthews<00:00:56.590> downforce<00:00:57.129> looks<00:00:57.789> a<00:00:57.940> lot

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
like the Matthews downforce looks a lot

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.889 
like the Matthews downforce looks a lot
one<00:00:59.260> of<00:00:59.289> the<00:00:59.530> best<00:01:00.280> is<00:01:00.609> accuracy

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
one of the best is accuracy

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.380 
one of the best is accuracy
now<00:01:02.379> with<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.680> downforce<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:03.730> actually

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
now with the downforce it actually

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.499 
now with the downforce it actually
guides<00:01:04.750> your<00:01:05.110> arrow<00:01:05.470> along<00:01:06.009> off<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:07.150> prongs

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
guides your arrow along off the prongs

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.710 
guides your arrow along off the prongs
for<00:01:07.960> up<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.259> 13<00:01:08.920> inches<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.790> that's<00:01:10.390> great

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
for up to 13 inches and that's great

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.139 
for up to 13 inches and that's great
because<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:11.080> gives<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:11.500> arrow<00:01:12.149> guidance

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
because that gives you arrow guidance

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.680 
because that gives you arrow guidance
but<00:01:13.960> next<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.649> gets<00:01:15.009> out<00:01:15.280> of<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.610> way<00:01:15.759> super

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
but next it gets out of the way super

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.010 
but next it gets out of the way super
fast<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:17.920> has<00:01:18.040> no<00:01:18.220> contact<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.299> vanes<00:01:19.630> in

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
fast so it has no contact the vanes in

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.859 
fast so it has no contact the vanes in
fact<00:01:20.649> it's<00:01:20.860> up<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.100> five<00:01:21.430> times<00:01:21.909> faster

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
fact it's up to five times faster

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.810 
fact it's up to five times faster
are<00:01:23.170> there<00:01:23.320> any<00:01:23.409> negatives<00:01:23.950> there<00:01:24.460> might<00:01:24.640> be<00:01:24.670> a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
are there any negatives there might be a

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.149 
are there any negatives there might be a
couple<00:01:25.090> one<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:25.869> them<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.470> fact<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:26.860> a

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
couple one of them is the fact that a

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.609 
couple one of them is the fact that a
drop<00:01:27.429> away<00:01:27.670> rest<00:01:28.090> actually<00:01:29.020> has<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.170> few<00:01:29.470> more

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
drop away rest actually has a few more

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.190 
drop away rest actually has a few more
moving<00:01:30.070> parts<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.759> you<00:01:30.819> have<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.450> string<00:01:31.899> tied

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
moving parts and you have a string tied

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.950 
moving parts and you have a string tied
your<00:01:32.409> other<00:01:32.619> string<00:01:33.130> or<00:01:33.369> cable<00:01:33.759> system<00:01:34.300> so<00:01:34.899> if

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
your other string or cable system so if

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.480 
your other string or cable system so if
something<00:01:35.350> goes<00:01:35.500> wrong<00:01:35.710> with<00:01:35.979> your<00:01:36.190> entire
