 12% and the right battery and how much 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.219

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:41.640
 I hope it reaches 10% of the right battery 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.290
 staff who will do this and will pick up 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.789
 Charger is here that the charger x

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.820
 turbo power video supplied only 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.480
 right to compatible devices 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.539
 you can see the power of each 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.150
 and 240 volts for half a year until 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:10.939
 the stand at the exit 5 volts turbo a turbo 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.509
 29 12 volts and beside there the amperes 1.6 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:18.060

 conventional gp motor charger 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:36.600
 outsourcing entry model 02 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:42.060
 amperes were at 240 volts output 5.1.1 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.840
 Volts 700 thousand amps right then this 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.350
 here is what will load the chile the g3 and 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.240
 This is what will load ox play oo 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.159
 computer here the stopwatch attack of the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.740
 side for you to see how long it's going 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 take to load both with your 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.610
 respective loaders will make a 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.159
 time lapse on the camera and you will see the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.530
 progress of each one right I will connect 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.300

 difficult even but come on i will 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:45.410
 turn off cell phones people here in a 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.910
 show to do nothing about 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.540
 loading does not want to do anything 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.030
 Nothing wrong here that fools anyone here. 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.650
 is most interested in knowing which 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.280
 will load more which will load 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:03.470
 except the time is me and you too 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:09.950
 Oh I'm going to start the timer here 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:12.769
 started as the first will call 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.780
 screen a lot of cars here on the side is and 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.610
 My goodness, God, that's a wonder. 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.630
 pass by next to those who do not have 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.160
 We already have a power tube problem. 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.090
 fired right there 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.090
 Let's put it here. 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:39.410
 he says he says that 12% 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:42.920
 Let's try to get it right when I 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.610
 turn on the screen just get here 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.560
 I'm going to give a touch here to see how much 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.880
 when the timer is already running there 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.390
 for you to know when you reach 100% and 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.820
 This is when I get here, I stop. 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.220
 record certain people then you will see 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.220
 Now the lapse team is running, okay? 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.319
 good staff after a little more 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.369
 an hour and a half and thirty 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:52.279
 did you see? 

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:55.279
 is x play and loaded 100% right with the 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:05:01.099
 turbo powerkit xiii nÃ© 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:05:04.189
 and he can talk it would be faster 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.719
 than the s6 to load 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:08.990
 it may even be faster to 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:11.659
 upload your 15 minutes there sorry 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.059
 by the noise from outside here is it up 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.699
 It may be a bit faster as I said 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:19.460
 for you in the first 15 minutes bigger 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:23.899
 capacity in relation to these 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:29.349
 six but in the end 100% he kept on 

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:29.349
 same level of samsung galaxy s six 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.689
 people 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:41.149
 the gp bike in relation to dengue is in 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:42.439
 71% one hour and 37 minutes carrying it 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:45.139
 it will take a little longer to 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:47.749
 should arrive should lead us to 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.839
 that more half an hour or so 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:53.089
 up to two hours charge 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:56.349
 to reach 100% two hours two 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:59.689
 hours and fifteen 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:02.120
 It's the test to show everywhere. 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:05.479
 that the charger of him I see that it is 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:09.259
 a loader is very big and dodo 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:11.120
 motorola ox play ask me hamas 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.819
 tries to charge with this charger in the 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.159
 g20 mode this charger it is 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:19.879
 designed for this device not for 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:21.800
 That's right, let's go, Dawn. 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:26.059
 carry the thing he's going to carry 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:29.059
 only load it so there aa 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:32.449
 battery is ready to receive 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:34.879
 a nominal load is a load and 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:39.860
 example here comes an antenna and a half an 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:42.529
 support there 6,706,700,000 standing and 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.649
 depending on the battery 700 thousand standing and 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:49.209
 you put a load of 1.2 1.5 the skin 

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:52.520
 she will miss yours so we had it 

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:54.919
 How can I tell you guys? 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.840
 Then you will carry a lot of 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:00.620
 fast to the jungle inside 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.379
 they have is I they carry is in 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.080
 charger speed is 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:09.849
 dimensioned for it if you make a 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.900
 cells, they can 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.849
 Loading the same way over only 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.979
 they are not prepared 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:17.780
 for this faster load this is what 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:19.009
 I want to clarify for you why 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.520
 It is important that you have the 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:24.680
 original device charger 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.930
 do not use any more in your 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.630
 leisure or I can not explain at times 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.159
 people put as I told one 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.440
 double decker charger 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:35.900
 it switches on the screen for example from the appliance 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.750
 you expect to spend five percent of 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.610
 when you see that 5% takes the 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.710
 charger and places the 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.050
 original charger that he gives 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.639
 anthem sequence to carry more 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.440
 My cell phone took 10 hours to 

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.509
 then load is in trouble 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.879
 a charger is checked if everything is 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:55.449
 connected right if the car is right 

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:57.830
 if it does not have no x in the battery 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:59.719
 He understood that he would shoot down and 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.550
 means both cellular water as the 

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:04.729
 loader is heating up a lot if it is a 

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.750
 the right technical assistance 

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:06.770
 so this is personal 

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.090
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.889
 video if you like being young is very 

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.580
