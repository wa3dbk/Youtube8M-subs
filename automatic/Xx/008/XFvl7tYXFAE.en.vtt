 welcome to another cooking video 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.570
 step by step today I will show a 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.570
 trick how to separate the yolk and the 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.760
 egg white since there are many recipes 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.300
 that we only have to use the yolks 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.300
 of the clear 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.220
 let's use eggs two bowls and one 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.880
 plastic bottle this is the system 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.620
 Classic to separate the yolk from the white 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.350
 part of the egg in the middle 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.360
 and it separates little by little until 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.710
 we managed to have the yolk on one side and 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.629
 other side the clear 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.149
 and this other system with the bottle of 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.820
 plastic that I find easier about 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.740
 all when we have to separate quite 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.460
 amount of eggs 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.970
 we will put on a plate all the eggs and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.980
 it is clear to me 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.580
 and putting the peak of the bottle on 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.580
 The yolk 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.510
 we will separate it and put it in a bowl 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.680
 in this case I did it with two eggs but 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.800
 Now let's see if we need to separate 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.790
 more eggs 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.950
 for example 4 eggs is the same 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.080
 we position the peak of the bottle 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.630
 we press the bottle a little and 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.630
 we absorb the yolks one by one 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.000
 until you have the 4 buds inside the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.000
 bottle 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.070
 and we will put them in the bowl 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.540
 let's squeeze a bit to get them out 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.130
 the buds and we already have separated the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.469
 yolks of the egg whites 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.610
 I hope you can use a greeting and 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.610
 until the next video
