00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.000 

the<00:00:08.870> garment<00:00:09.230> 430

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.910 

I<00:00:12.040> think<00:00:12.220> a<00:00:12.280> two<00:00:12.490> to<00:00:13.300> four<00:00:13.510> threes<00:00:13.900> about<00:00:14.410> 420

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
I think a two to four threes about 420

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.030 
I think a two to four threes about 420
and<00:00:15.040> a<00:00:15.100> 430<00:00:16.080> that's<00:00:17.080> cool<00:00:17.260> you<00:00:17.410> are<00:00:17.590> you<00:00:17.770> within

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
and a 430 that's cool you are you within

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.040 
and a 430 that's cool you are you within
four<00:00:18.310> miles<00:00:18.520> of<00:00:18.760> tri-cities<00:00:19.450> from<00:00:19.600> here<00:00:19.750> five

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
four miles of tri-cities from here five

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.410 
four miles of tri-cities from here five
and<00:00:20.350> a<00:00:20.380> quarter<00:00:20.560> close<00:00:21.400> I<00:00:23.939> know<00:00:24.939> Alliance<00:00:25.180> we

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
and a quarter close I know Alliance we

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.660 
and a quarter close I know Alliance we
have<00:00:25.450> gauges<00:00:25.840> agree<00:00:26.020> but<00:00:26.200> one<00:00:26.590> of<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:26.800> ten

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
have gauges agree but one of the ten

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.390 
have gauges agree but one of the ten
areas<00:00:28.000> clear<00:00:28.270> with<00:00:28.450> a<00:00:28.480> call<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:30.220> of<00:00:30.250> our

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
areas clear with a call one of our

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.400 
areas clear with a call one of our
takeoffs<00:00:30.970> was<00:00:31.210> take<00:00:31.480> off<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.900> ground<00:00:32.199> which

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
takeoffs was take off the ground which

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.830 
takeoffs was take off the ground which
is<00:00:33.690> really<00:00:34.690> low<00:00:35.790> minimal<00:00:36.790> power<00:00:37.000> usage<00:00:37.629> which

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
is really low minimal power usage which

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.369 
is really low minimal power usage which
you<00:00:38.110> know<00:00:38.199> yeah<00:00:38.559> 22<00:00:39.520> inches<00:00:39.970> and<00:00:40.210> then<00:00:41.110> once

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
you know yeah 22 inches and then once

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.590 
you know yeah 22 inches and then once
you<00:00:41.470> go<00:00:41.590> through<00:00:41.620> ETL<00:00:43.710> go<00:00:44.710> for<00:00:44.979> it<00:00:45.070> then<00:00:45.790> your

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
you go through ETL go for it then your

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.790 
you go through ETL go for it then your
mission<00:00:46.750> is<00:00:46.930> done<00:00:47.110> that<00:00:47.260> they<00:00:47.350> can<00:00:47.470> bring<00:00:47.620> it

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
mission is done that they can bring it

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.490 
mission is done that they can bring it
more<00:00:47.890> power<00:00:48.129> if<00:00:48.339> you<00:00:48.400> want<00:00:48.640> okay<00:00:49.089> that's<00:00:49.780> that

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
more power if you want okay that's that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.469 
more power if you want okay that's that
was<00:00:50.800> textbook<00:00:51.190> right<00:00:51.580> there<00:00:51.820> for<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.269> hot

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
was textbook right there for the hot

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.840 
was textbook right there for the hot
velocity<00:00:52.989> curve<00:00:53.199> pretty<00:00:54.070> much<00:00:54.220> fully<00:00:54.460> I<00:00:54.640> got

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
velocity curve pretty much fully I got

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.850 
velocity curve pretty much fully I got
through<00:00:55.030> ETL<00:00:55.449> you<00:00:56.229> were<00:00:56.350> able<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.559> get<00:00:56.650> your

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
through ETL you were able to get your

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.579 
through ETL you were able to get your
speed<00:00:57.129> immediately<00:00:57.460> yeah<00:00:58.299> but<00:00:58.960> then<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.320> want

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
speed immediately yeah but then you want

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.030 
speed immediately yeah but then you want
control<00:00:59.830> so<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:00.190> have<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:00.430> controls<00:01:00.760> controls

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
control so I have the controls controls

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:15.660 
control so I have the controls controls
the<00:01:03.040> controls<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.110> left

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.120 

little<00:01:16.670> bobble<00:01:17.030> yeah<00:01:17.390> not<00:01:17.840> bad<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:18.380> would<00:01:18.979> just

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
little bobble yeah not bad I would just

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.190 
little bobble yeah not bad I would just
say<00:01:19.340> with<00:01:19.550> this<00:01:19.760> type<00:01:19.970> of<00:01:20.000> takeoff<00:01:20.510> like<00:01:20.870> it

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
say with this type of takeoff like it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.570 
say with this type of takeoff like it
says<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.530> aren't<00:01:21.650> pretty<00:01:21.890> nose<00:01:22.100> low<00:01:22.340> right

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
says you aren't pretty nose low right

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.660 
says you aren't pretty nose low right
now<00:01:23.020> that<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.619> need<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.890> definitely<00:01:25.190> keep<00:01:25.520> it

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
now that you need to definitely keep it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.890 
now that you need to definitely keep it
in<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.790> back<00:01:25.970> your<00:01:26.180> mind<00:01:26.210> if<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.690> were<00:01:26.810> to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
in the back your mind if you were to

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.080 
in the back your mind if you were to
lose<00:01:27.020> an<00:01:27.170> engine<00:01:27.260> you'd<00:01:27.560> have<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.860> really<00:01:28.310> have

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
lose an engine you'd have to really have

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.430 
lose an engine you'd have to really have
a<00:01:29.119> quick<00:01:29.390> response<00:01:29.630> time<00:01:29.990> bringing<00:01:30.290> that

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
a quick response time bringing that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.320 
a quick response time bringing that
though<00:01:30.560> he's<00:01:30.680> gonna<00:01:30.890> keep<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.369> for<00:01:31.610> level<00:01:32.210> I

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
though he's gonna keep that for level I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.420 
though he's gonna keep that for level I
would<00:01:32.509> keep<00:01:32.660> it<00:01:32.810> more<00:01:32.930> level<00:01:33.320> because<00:01:33.619> I'm<00:01:33.860> the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
would keep it more level because I'm the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.460 
would keep it more level because I'm the
poor<00:01:34.610> nose<00:01:34.850> low<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.270> are<00:01:35.300> at<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.810> low<00:01:36.229> altitude

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
poor nose low you are at a low altitude

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.740 
poor nose low you are at a low altitude
okay<00:01:37.340> if<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.880> were<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.060> lose<00:01:38.210> an<00:01:38.390> engine<00:01:38.509> and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
okay if you were to lose an engine and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.630 
okay if you were to lose an engine and
have<00:01:38.840> lots<00:01:39.050> of<00:01:39.200> power<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.950> just<00:01:40.220> die<00:01:40.430> that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
have lots of power you just die that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.880 
have lots of power you just die that
right<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.180> think<00:01:41.720> exactly<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> lot

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
right in the you think exactly a lot

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.430 
right in the you think exactly a lot
yeah<00:01:43.479> but<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.659> know<00:01:44.750> I'm<00:01:44.900> just<00:01:44.930> thinking<00:01:45.380> in

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
yeah but you know I'm just thinking in

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.170 
yeah but you know I'm just thinking in
the<00:01:45.500> back<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.680> my<00:01:45.950> mind<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.729> know<00:01:46.759> you're

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
the back of my mind you know you're

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.840 
the back of my mind you know you're
exactly<00:01:47.270> right<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:48.560> pedal<00:01:48.860> city<00:01:49.310> if<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.670> goes

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
exactly right it's pedal city if it goes

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.120 
exactly right it's pedal city if it goes
wrong<00:01:50.090> right<00:01:50.390> there<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.649> would<00:01:52.009> almost

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
wrong right there in it I would almost

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.040 
wrong right there in it I would almost
sacrifice<00:01:52.789> being<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.180> little<00:01:53.360> higher<00:01:53.630> at<00:01:53.869> that

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
sacrifice being a little higher at that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.620 
sacrifice being a little higher at that
point<00:01:54.320> but<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.920> know<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:56.000> bubble<00:01:56.479> your

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
point but you know the bubble your

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.150 
point but you know the bubble your
attitude<00:01:57.020> is<00:01:57.110> on<00:01:57.200> takeoff<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.770> less<00:01:57.920> power

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
attitude is on takeoff the less power

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.400 
attitude is on takeoff the less power
you're<00:01:58.280> gonna<00:01:58.340> be<00:01:58.490> use<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.789> well<00:01:59.420> possibly

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
you're gonna be use it well possibly

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.840 
you're gonna be use it well possibly
depending<00:02:00.619> on<00:02:00.830> how<00:02:01.009> bad<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:01.399> it<00:02:01.490> be<00:02:01.580> climbing

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
depending on how bad so it be climbing

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.180 
depending on how bad so it be climbing
but<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.420> better<00:02:03.020> position<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.710> better<00:02:03.920> attitude

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
but a better position a better attitude

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.040 
but a better position a better attitude
if<00:02:04.729> something<00:02:05.119> were<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.300> go<00:02:05.450> wrong<00:02:05.570> and

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
if something were to go wrong and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.389 
if something were to go wrong and
exactly<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:07.160> mean<00:02:08.470> if<00:02:09.470> you're<00:02:09.769> not<00:02:09.800> ready<00:02:10.160> for

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
exactly I mean if you're not ready for
