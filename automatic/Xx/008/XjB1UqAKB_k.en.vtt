00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 the channel member that touched here was the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.720
 ju and got my attention recently 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.320
 that this gentleman has an opinion on 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.929
 you consumer ubisoft games and about 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.700
 should be ubisoft in general and the opinion 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.850
 that you are a 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.740
 bunch of complaints curiously I 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:30.179
 I also have an opinion on this 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 citizen to ubisoft its games and soft open 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.200
 softbrasil montreal ubisoft whether 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.780
 will be what you are doing 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.489
 At the moment please listen because 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.570
 apparently you do not know that you 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.629
 they are doing 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.350
 It seems to me that you forgot that the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.200
 unit writes was not released complete 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.270
 it was not released perfect you 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.079
 forget that your game was released 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.750
 so broken so wedge in 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.050
 impossible to play with problems of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.049
 game work glitz visual brake network 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.670
 constantly falling to the point that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.110
 You opened an executive blog. 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.020
 updating their consumers 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.439
 constant updates you had to 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.049
 do in your game to keep the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.990
 play to a standard that is considered 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.680
 acceptable both bysoft was a decision 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 you give the dlc completely free 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.860
 should kings which was initially part of the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.380
 sisu paid paid for assassin's creed unit 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.570
 as an apology to his 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.850
 consumers because of the fact that the game was 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.850
 released below a level that you 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.549
 consider as acceptable so that all 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.070
 The world that you bought should receive a 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.930
 extra free game to compensate the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.280
 fact that they were earning something 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.030
 that you are already changing at all 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.020
 others 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.119
 with the passage of time the situation 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.950
 Improved but until you settle on 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.310
 stumble again when you release 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.950
 a six- day ski patch half of the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.189
 consoles trying to fix the game that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.619
 was not released complete and perfect the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.050
 second error on top of that first mistake 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.000
 was that shit made for you 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.300
 has made all xbox users 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.570
 one 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.800
 download the game again no download of 40 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.780
 gigas 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.480
 This does not sound like quality control. 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.800
 and this does not strike me as something worthy 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.370
 of some whiners and complaints that they spend 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.950
 129 reais in a game of yours plus the bump 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.800
 feet plus the dlcs you throw 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.570
 scattered inside the game outside the game 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.580
 in extra games 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.530
 This is because it was your decision to 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.480
 ubisoft of taking the time 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.140
 needed to make a complete game 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.820
 good technical and fun level 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.210
 you decided to launch a game of 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.060
 franchise every year hurriedly run 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.700
 played outside and not to mention that you 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.770
 always postpone the pc version of their 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.770
 games ahead of console versions 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.340
 ah ah ah 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.659
 I'm sure you guys do not soft 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.090
 obviously you remember the system 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.370
 of drm that you released that required the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.520
 player to always stay online to be able to 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.320
 play your games at 52 to 53 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.910
 they had the system and the justification 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.430
 that you used to put the 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.770
 system in all games was piracy 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.610
 on the pc but then you yourselves were e 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.610
 have taken this system 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.210
 perhaps because you realized that you 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.940
 had no justification for 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.490
 to oblige its legitimate consumers and 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.039
 honest and dedicated to your franchise 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.680
 stay 100% online to play the sima o 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.720
 player of a game in the background favor 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.250
 understand one thing you are not 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.020
 absolutely damn your 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.330
 consumers of you are not 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.060
 damn no 100 creators 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.250
 like us on youtube making videos 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.690
 you until now, now that I am 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.789
 Complaining about you, I 'm giving 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.530
 free advertising for you 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.900
 then it tries to respect the consumer of 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.139
 why do you sell a product that 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.479
 cost more than 100 reais off everyone should 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.370
 being and the little gestures you play 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.889
 above us must be announced 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.229
 before the game if multiple announced 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.180
 versions of the same game exclusive content 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.610
 if you buy this store contents 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.900
 and shop at that ski shop 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.020
 exclusive if you buy 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.849
 advance game is whether to buy worth 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.440
 before the reviews 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.449
 appear people actually had a 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.360
 critical analysis of the game all this 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.830
 practice that you have for years since we 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.780
 we've been watching for a long time 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.070
 respect in your consumer 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.020
 and take a little shame on the face 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.479
 when you put a public figure 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.300
 to speak on your behalf because we 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.310
 we remember that we know when a 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.570
 company is exceeding the limit and 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.750
 You already have your quota 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.000
 Posted a long time ago I'm a fan of the series 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.229
 the secret I'm a ubisoft fan I have 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.210
 almost all the games that you 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.770
 produced but I have no expectation 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.990
 no swallowing the shits that you 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.909
 talk and especially when you 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.250
 treat the consumer 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.969
 you are nothing without a consumer of 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.750
 you 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.820
 so much that you have fallen knee 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.950
 I apologized to the consumer giving 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.080
 content to justify the 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.650
 content that you had already sold and 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.450
 that did not work just a hint of a 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.940
 fan that the same company that produces 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.650
 games of which he is a fan of cray you 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.530
 They did an excellent job though for 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.630
 4 is very similar to far cry 3 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.670
 it's two good games it's two games 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.530
 fun and that for some reason 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.190
 michiko that nobody to this day 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.790
 understand 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.010
 they work fine on the pc wow you 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.840
 have managed to give more work to the 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.160
 team that has the Paraguayan because they 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.030
 apparently knows that he is doing 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.590
 know in produce content or view 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.820
 if any of them are interested in doing 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.220
 video on youtube 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.430
 talking about your game because of 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.580
 suddenly makes a better impression on me. 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.590
 name was today this is the canal axn locke 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:17.690
 For you channel friend I see you 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.690
 in the next video for ubisoft 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.229
 to talk a legal deal we will go 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.789
 consider 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:26.789
 there is no karman
