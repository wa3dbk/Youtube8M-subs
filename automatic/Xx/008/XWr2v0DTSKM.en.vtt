moose<00:01:34.890> feel<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.820> nice<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.210> this

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
moose feel really nice actually this

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.050 
moose feel really nice actually this
first<00:01:36.960> swatch<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.890> prenup<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
first swatch is for prenup this is the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.850 
first swatch is for prenup this is the
color<00:01:39.270> prenup<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.229> actually<00:01:40.409> thought<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
color prenup and I actually thought it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.980 
color prenup and I actually thought it
would<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.400> bit<00:01:41.610> more<00:01:41.790> pigmented<00:01:42.689> but

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
would be a little bit more pigmented but

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
would be a little bit more pigmented but
it<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.320> nice<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.460> these<00:01:44.579> will<00:01:44.759> be

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
it is nice I think that these will be

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.789 
it is nice I think that these will be
definitely<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.360> interesting<00:01:45.600> texture<00:01:46.140> for

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
definitely an interesting texture for

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.980 
definitely an interesting texture for
the<00:01:47.070> face<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.820> haven't<00:01:48.270> tried<00:01:48.390> any<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> their

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the face I haven't tried any of their

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.899 
the face I haven't tried any of their
shadows<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.340> texture<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
shadows but I do know the texture and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.280 
shadows but I do know the texture and
everything<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.659> almost<00:01:51.869> kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
everything this is almost kind of a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.770 
everything this is almost kind of a
creamy<00:01:52.619> product<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.630> will<00:01:54.720> be

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
creamy product and I think that will be

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.170 
creamy product and I think that will be
really<00:01:54.899> interesting<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.979> apply<00:01:56.729> over

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
really interesting to apply over

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.630 
really interesting to apply over
foundation<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:57.960> stuff<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.560> I'm<00:01:59.399> definitely

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
foundation and stuff so I'm definitely

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.179 
foundation and stuff so I'm definitely

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
like not on the fence but I'm intrigued

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.530 
like not on the fence but I'm intrigued
to<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.640> how<00:02:02.909> these<00:02:03.030> are<00:02:03.180> going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> work

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
to see how these are going to work

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.209 
to see how these are going to work
through<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.259> color<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.040> see<00:02:05.189> right

through this color as you can see right

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
through this color as you can see right

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you can't see the difference when

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
you can't see the difference when
they're<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> skin<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.599> happy<00:02:09.989> about
