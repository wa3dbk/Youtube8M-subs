00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.330
 at the test of the world it is guillaume reyel 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.499
 who who like you prefer 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.210
 and today we find ourselves for 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:22.179
 the presentation of a minecraft mode so 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.589
 the fart mode paws so what this mode 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.150
 is going to actually do that will add a 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.349
 system so like the wolves for the 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.470
 bats do not cure this system of 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.699
 companion so we will be able now 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.410
 adopt a little bat that will 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.890
 help us fight who will we 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.710
 follow and who will become our friend then 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.930
 firstly to start doing so 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.420
 this mode there is still in you need 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.980
 pumpkin pie so gold this 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.390
 we're going to do we'll do your little 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.000
 pumpkin pie so for this 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.469
 that they do not know it's like that and 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.789
 so then once you have to 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.160
 the pumpkin pie he'll have to 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.730
 find a bat she is 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.339
 perfect the parties here and then 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.640
 have to do right click on it with the 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:09.040
 spark so it can be a bit of a hassle 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.549
 thank you you are me I tend to swoon 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.549
 to succeed 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.160
 so there is a little bit of difficulty 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 sometimes but hey 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.870
 for her this bar so here it is good 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.979
 so now we have a smile match 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.570
 so Saragossa then the bat goes 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.150
 follow me everywhere and as soon as she can 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.780
 she will hang on to the ceiling 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.690
 like and you lead given to see him the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.850
 bat will also help us to 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.229
 fight so if I type the zombie 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.320
 normally should go there she is 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.300
 do not attack it gossip this meaning if you 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.160
 can do it 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.780
 hopla has white hair howell 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.780
 day and go there 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.360
 so if not otherwise you understand 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.920
 so for there will be several for 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.390
 can lead a little bit between 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.830
 quotation marks bat my 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.690
 name of what you should know is 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.350
 than if we hit it so right click 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.090
 left click by my there is dragos going 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.670
 go into our hands so now 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.420
 with Dragon's Dogma was so beef 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.800
 night vision watch if we take it off hop 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.140
 all black and if we take it it's 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.400
 enlightened and then so if we click 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.020
 right with city ​​theme in hand we're going 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.160
 have access to some parameters but 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.450
 firstly we will be able to rename 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.800
 our bat 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.530
 so it pleased her her name is hi 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.360
 and so there is experience so of 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.820
 experience 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.140
 he's going to have conquered for them and denies 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.150
 experience they have to kill 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.780
 furniture so there cites experience 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.580
 killing the zombie of earlier and he 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.459
 he lacks 18 experience to move to 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.410
 next level which every time 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.450
 that she will pass a level she is going 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.910
 to earn money so that's it 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.380
 heart of life and she's also going to win some 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.580
 attacks damage so there it makes that one 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.010
 damage to each attack 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.150
 a chorus of damage and every time 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.130
 that he will pass a level so she is going 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.720
 gain attac damage so the level 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.100
 max of this bat these levels 3 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.590
 and once it reaches level 3 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.030
 she's going to get a feature in 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.209
 does that will make who buy yakin 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.410
 but it will regenerate 30% of life so in 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.489
 does it'll be very difficult for her 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.170
 to die every time she attacks 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.019
 and will regenerate life so in fact 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.170
 it's going to be a beast your mouse she's going 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.590
 be the ultimate weapon for that for you 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.319
 combat 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.180
 so here is your bat if ever 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.430
 dies she just dies she 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.370
 will go back in your inventory is 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.329
 in fact she will not be able to fly 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.769
 up as they are not fed 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.599
 to feed your bat it's 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.189
 very simple in fact one must have under 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.870
 this form there and in fact we're going to 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:52.780
 combine with pumpkin and it's going 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.040
 give it back that gives it to him is the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.329
 last little remark is that a 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.889
 once you have the bat in 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.840
 your inventory to revolve 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.909
 will just have to jetty and 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.900
 she will start freezing flew by 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.280
 the ons and if we tap it 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.379
 we recover it here that's it so it's 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.090
 everything for this minecraft mode tamed of 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.549

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.139
 he is really cool years he adds late 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.189
 I like it, I felt like it 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.349
 even adds a utility to 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.870

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.590
