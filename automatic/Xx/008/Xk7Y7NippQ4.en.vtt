00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:04.600 
I am one of the only certified

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.019 
I am one of the only certified
instructors<00:00:05.439> teaching<00:00:06.310> at<00:00:06.550> the<00:00:06.640> moment<00:00:06.939> to

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
instructors teaching at the moment to

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.390 
instructors teaching at the moment to
the<00:00:07.149> public<00:00:07.510> the<00:00:08.500> inventors<00:00:08.889> still<00:00:09.040> teaching

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
the public the inventors still teaching

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.890 
the public the inventors still teaching
but<00:00:09.519> he's<00:00:09.639> only<00:00:09.760> doing<00:00:10.000> leadership<00:00:10.660> in<00:00:10.809> the

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
but he's only doing leadership in the

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.289 
but he's only doing leadership in the
moment<00:00:11.259> around<00:00:11.830> he<00:00:12.219> gives<00:00:12.639> all<00:00:12.820> the<00:00:12.940> public

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
moment around he gives all the public

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.529 
moment around he gives all the public
students<00:00:13.870> to<00:00:14.019> me<00:00:15.030> yeah<00:00:16.030> you<00:00:16.209> said<00:00:16.390> you<00:00:16.420> were

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
students to me yeah you said you were

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.270 
students to me yeah you said you were
located<00:00:16.690> in<00:00:16.960> Bakersfield<00:00:17.619> Bakersfield

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
located in Bakersfield Bakersfield

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.400 
located in Bakersfield Bakersfield
California<00:00:19.020> hopefully<00:00:20.020> I<00:00:20.050> might<00:00:20.230> be

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
California hopefully I might be

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.170 
California hopefully I might be
relocating<00:00:21.310> but<00:00:21.460> at<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.640> moment<00:00:21.790> we're<00:00:22.030> in

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
relocating but at the moment we're in

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.570 
relocating but at the moment we're in
Vegas<00:00:22.360> okay<00:00:23.050> now<00:00:23.650> let<00:00:24.070> me<00:00:24.100> take<00:00:24.250> a<00:00:24.310> peek<00:00:24.550> a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
Vegas okay now let me take a peek a

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.570 
Vegas okay now let me take a peek a
couple<00:00:24.940> these<00:00:25.030> engines<00:00:25.450> so<00:00:25.630> you<00:00:25.690> basically

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
couple these engines so you basically

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.580 
couple these engines so you basically
students<00:00:27.580> bring<00:00:27.880> these<00:00:28.090> in<00:00:28.390> and<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.380> you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
students bring these in and and you

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.870 
students bring these in and and you
teach<00:00:29.770> them<00:00:29.920> how<00:00:30.040> to<00:00:30.070> convert<00:00:30.430> these<00:00:30.580> to<00:00:30.790> the

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
teach them how to convert these to the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.790 
teach them how to convert these to the
heat<00:00:31.030> process<00:00:31.540> yes<00:00:31.990> I've<00:00:32.169> had<00:00:32.290> people<00:00:32.469> bring

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
heat process yes I've had people bring

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.900 
heat process yes I've had people bring
in<00:00:32.950> generators

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
in generators

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.569 
in generators
I've<00:00:34.210> had<00:00:34.420> them<00:00:34.480> bring<00:00:34.660> in<00:00:34.780> air<00:00:35.019> compressors<00:00:35.620> I

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
I've had them bring in air compressors I

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.290 
I've had them bring in air compressors I
have<00:00:37.030> done<00:00:37.269> a<00:00:37.300> SR<00:00:37.870> SR<00:00:38.050> 5<00:00:38.679> 1989<00:00:39.339> four-cylinder

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
have done a SR SR 5 1989 four-cylinder

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.959 
have done a SR SR 5 1989 four-cylinder
pickup<00:00:41.249> here<00:00:42.249> are<00:00:42.339> the<00:00:42.429> pictures<00:00:42.609> for<00:00:42.850> that

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
pickup here are the pictures for that

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.410 
pickup here are the pictures for that
one<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:44.559> guess<00:00:45.100> then<00:00:45.219> I<00:00:45.249> bring<00:00:45.429> them<00:00:45.550> in<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.879> we

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
one I guess then I bring them in and we

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.540 
one I guess then I bring them in and we
converted<00:00:46.809> from<00:00:46.989> scratch<00:00:47.769> first<00:00:48.190> we<00:00:48.399> teach

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
converted from scratch first we teach

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.540 
converted from scratch first we teach
the<00:00:48.760> theory<00:00:49.140> why<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.199> works<00:00:50.589> and<00:00:50.859> what<00:00:51.219> we<00:00:51.399> know

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
the theory why it works and what we know

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.399 
the theory why it works and what we know
so<00:00:51.579> far<00:00:51.819> because<00:00:52.329> there's<00:00:52.719> only<00:00:52.839> so<00:00:53.199> much<00:00:53.350> that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
so far because there's only so much that

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.250 
so far because there's only so much that
we<00:00:53.679> learned<00:00:54.069> about<00:00:54.339> it<00:00:54.699> other<00:00:55.690> than<00:00:55.899> that<00:00:55.989> they

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
we learned about it other than that they

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.750 
we learned about it other than that they
want<00:00:56.469> to<00:00:56.530> allow<00:00:56.710> us<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:56.949> put<00:00:57.249> a<00:00:57.280> bunch<00:00:57.489> of<00:00:57.579> stuff

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
want to allow us to put a bunch of stuff

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.209 
want to allow us to put a bunch of stuff
in<00:00:57.969> books<00:00:58.269> yet<00:00:58.569> so<00:00:58.899> well<00:00:59.109> yeah<00:00:59.469> whit<00:00:59.679> from<00:01:00.039> your

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
in books yet so well yeah whit from your

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.069 
in books yet so well yeah whit from your
experiences<00:01:00.999> then<00:01:01.239> how<00:01:01.420> did<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.870> heat

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
experiences then how did the heat

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.479 
experiences then how did the heat
engines<00:01:02.440> perform<00:01:02.889> compared<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.460> a

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
engines perform compared to a

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.640 
engines perform compared to a
conventional<00:01:03.699> engine<00:01:04.390> oh<00:01:04.659> they<00:01:05.080> were<00:01:05.379> much

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
conventional engine oh they were much

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.039 
conventional engine oh they were much
smoother<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.670> got<00:01:06.820> much<00:01:07.090> different<00:01:07.630> RV<00:01:07.869> you

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
smoother you got much different RV you

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.109 
smoother you got much different RV you
can<00:01:08.290> go<00:01:08.590> as<00:01:08.740> low<00:01:08.950> as<00:01:08.979> I've<00:01:09.430> gone<00:01:09.700> down<00:01:09.939> to<00:01:10.090> a

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
can go as low as I've gone down to a

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.310 
can go as low as I've gone down to a
hundred<00:01:10.560> rpms<00:01:11.560> per<00:01:11.860> minute<00:01:12.189> and<00:01:12.610> not<00:01:12.850> have<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
hundred rpms per minute and not have you

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.230 
hundred rpms per minute and not have you
know<00:01:14.380> anything<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:15.009> any<00:01:15.310> crazy<00:01:15.610> vibrations

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
know anything of any crazy vibrations

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.350 
know anything of any crazy vibrations
I've<00:01:16.960> done<00:01:17.259> up<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.799> this<00:01:18.070> motor<00:01:18.670> right<00:01:18.909> here<00:01:18.939> is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
I've done up to this motor right here is

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.350 
I've done up to this motor right here is
rated<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.869> only<00:01:20.049> go<00:01:20.320> 3,000<00:01:21.009> rpms<00:01:21.399> we've<00:01:22.090> gotten

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
rated to only go 3,000 rpms we've gotten

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.899 
rated to only go 3,000 rpms we've gotten
up<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.539> 7,000<00:01:23.320> rpms<00:01:23.710> without<00:01:24.100> blowing<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.670> then

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
up to 7,000 rpms without blowing it then

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:25.980 
up to 7,000 rpms without blowing it then
that's<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.149> odd<00:01:25.390> looks<00:01:25.600> like<00:01:25.719> a<00:01:25.750> lawnmower

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
that's just odd looks like a lawnmower

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.929 
that's just odd looks like a lawnmower
runs<00:01:26.259> this<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.619> three<00:01:26.950> horsepower<00:01:27.579> Briggs

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
runs this is a three horsepower Briggs

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.190 
runs this is a three horsepower Briggs
and<00:01:28.240> strand<00:01:28.509> okay

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and strand okay

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 
and strand okay
so<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> lot<00:01:32.580> of<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.090> depends

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so so a lot of this then just depends

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.200 
so so a lot of this then just depends
just<00:01:34.229> because<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> geet<00:01:35.250> process<00:01:35.909> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
just because of the geet process it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.770 
just because of the geet process it
makes<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.509> burn<00:01:36.750> cleaner<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.909> what<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.060> does<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
makes a burn cleaner or what it does is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
makes a burn cleaner or what it does is
it<00:01:40.080> transmutes<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.310> elements<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.090> an

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it transmutes the elements to an

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.899 
it transmutes the elements to an
elemental<00:01:42.840> gas<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.490> could<00:01:44.640> burn

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
elemental gas so that then it could burn

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.840 
elemental gas so that then it could burn
in<00:01:45.149> cleanly<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.320> also<00:01:46.500> clean<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.009> motors<00:01:47.640> up

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
in cleanly but also clean your motors up

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.149 
in cleanly but also clean your motors up

they've said that it comes out as a
plasma<00:01:53.159> state<00:01:53.750> because<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> does<00:01:55.049> not

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
plasma state because it does not

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.730 
plasma state because it does not
condense<00:01:55.680> back<00:01:56.009> into<00:01:56.340> anything<00:01:56.880> oh<00:01:57.119> okay<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
condense back into anything oh okay it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.320 
condense back into anything oh okay it
stays<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> plasma<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.180> actually

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
stays in the plasma you can actually

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.960 
stays in the plasma you can actually
trap<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.229> plasma<00:02:01.710> gas<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.640> will<00:02:02.789> lower

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
trap the plasma gas so this will lower

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.090 
trap the plasma gas so this will lower
emissions<00:02:03.420> probably<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.869> well<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.770> we

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
emissions probably as well you get we

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.419 
emissions probably as well you get we
have<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.940> guarantee<00:02:06.569> a<00:02:06.899> minimum<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.920> 80%

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
have we guarantee a minimum of 80%

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.059 
have we guarantee a minimum of 80%
reduction<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.390> emissions<00:02:09.509> Wow<00:02:10.440> there<00:02:10.799> are

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
reduction in emissions Wow there are

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.750 
reduction in emissions Wow there are
closed<00:02:11.670> loop<00:02:12.150> systems<00:02:12.780> where<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.380> have

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
closed loop systems where you have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.020 
closed loop systems where you have
self-sustaining<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.930> zero<00:02:15.930> emissions<00:02:17.030> now

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
self-sustaining and zero emissions now

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.000 
self-sustaining and zero emissions now
if<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.569> remember<00:02:18.930> right<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.500> been<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.739> while

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
if I remember right it's been a while

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.160 
if I remember right it's been a while
since<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.370> looked<00:02:20.549> into<00:02:20.760> ki<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.019> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
since I looked into ki but you have the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.199 
since I looked into ki but you have the
bubbler<00:02:22.590> over<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.340> one<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> things

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
bubbler over here and one of the things

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.009 
bubbler over here and one of the things
that<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> liked<00:02:24.870> about<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.290> system<00:02:25.709> was<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
that I liked about the system was in the

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.330 
that I liked about the system was in the
demonstrations<00:02:28.680> I've<00:02:28.920> seen<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.310> past

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
demonstrations I've seen in the past

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.360 
demonstrations I've seen in the past
they've<00:02:30.060> mixed<00:02:30.390> gasoline<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.260> water<00:02:31.560> yes<00:02:32.069> and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
they've mixed gasoline and water yes and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.300 
they've mixed gasoline and water yes and
and<00:02:33.060> it'll<00:02:33.569> it'll<00:02:33.900> actually<00:02:34.319> filter<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:35.040> out

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
and it'll it'll actually filter that out

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.920 
and it'll it'll actually filter that out
can<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.880> tell<00:02:36.090> me<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.269> little<00:02:36.390> bit<00:02:36.510> about<00:02:36.750> that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
can you tell me a little bit about that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.470 
can you tell me a little bit about that
how<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.470> could<00:02:37.590> run<00:02:37.769> on<00:02:37.859> different<00:02:37.950> fuels<00:02:38.450> okay

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
how it could run on different fuels okay

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.690 
how it could run on different fuels okay
for<00:02:40.260> demonstration<00:02:40.500> purposes<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.459> I'll<00:02:41.579> be

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
for demonstration purposes and I'll be

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.030 
for demonstration purposes and I'll be
showing<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.540> weekend<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.079> we<00:02:43.829> set<00:02:44.010> up

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
showing this this weekend is we set up

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.310 
showing this this weekend is we set up
our<00:02:44.250> bubbler<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.359> it's<00:02:45.690> glass<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.230> you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
our bubbler so and it's glass so you

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.530 
our bubbler so and it's glass so you
could<00:02:46.470> see<00:02:46.680> what<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.010> put<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.310> them<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:48.209> set<00:02:48.420> up

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
could see what we put in them you set up

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.810 
could see what we put in them you set up
a<00:02:48.630> mixture<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.019> twenty<00:02:49.440> percent<00:02:49.799> gasoline<00:02:49.950> an

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
a mixture of twenty percent gasoline an

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.030 
a mixture of twenty percent gasoline an
80<00:02:51.120> percent<00:02:51.359> mixture<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.500> soda<00:02:52.950> pop<00:02:53.420> your<00:02:54.420> in

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
80 percent mixture of soda pop your in

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.030 
80 percent mixture of soda pop your in
coffee<00:02:56.040> some

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
coffee some

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.789 
coffee some
when<00:02:57.129> his<00:02:57.280> hot<00:02:57.580> sauce<00:02:58.140> many<00:02:59.140> multiple<00:02:59.620> things

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
when his hot sauce many multiple things

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.020 
when his hot sauce many multiple things
are<00:02:59.950> all<00:03:00.040> depends<00:03:00.489> on<00:03:00.909> how<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.599> tune<00:03:02.019> your<00:03:02.260> rod

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
are all depends on how you tune your rod

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.179 
are all depends on how you tune your rod
this<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.299> very<00:03:04.540> crucial<00:03:04.810> part<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.890> fuels

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
this is a very crucial part to the fuels

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.759 
this is a very crucial part to the fuels
that<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.459> want<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.700> run<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.379> this<00:03:08.379> is<00:03:08.560> just

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
that you want to run and this is just

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.250 
that you want to run and this is just
simply<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.310> buffer<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:10.299> will<00:03:10.450> vaporize<00:03:10.720> the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
simply the buffer that will vaporize the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.770 
simply the buffer that will vaporize the
fuel<00:03:11.530> okay<00:03:12.159> so<00:03:12.519> there's<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.760> vacuum<00:03:13.299> in<00:03:13.420> here<00:03:13.450> a

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
fuel okay so there's a vacuum in here a

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.410 
fuel okay so there's a vacuum in here a
constant<00:03:14.470> vacuum<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.459> will<00:03:15.640> vaporize<00:03:15.819> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
constant vacuum that will vaporize the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.990 
constant vacuum that will vaporize the
fuel<00:03:16.659> or<00:03:16.959> help<00:03:17.230> vaporize<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.280> fuel<00:03:18.489> along

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
fuel or help vaporize the fuel along

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.640 
fuel or help vaporize the fuel along
with<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.360> vortex<00:03:19.810> that's<00:03:19.900> being<00:03:20.140> created

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
with the vortex that's being created

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.699 
with the vortex that's being created
with<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:20.980> spot<00:03:21.280> with<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.670> vacuum<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:23.290> that's

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
with the spot with the vacuum and that's

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.619 
with the spot with the vacuum and that's
how<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:23.980> get<00:03:24.190> that's<00:03:24.819> how<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.000> mix<00:03:25.269> up<00:03:25.599> your

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
how you get that's how you mix up your

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.140 
how you get that's how you mix up your
different<00:03:26.590> liquids<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:27.939> might

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
different liquids so this this might

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.000 
different liquids so this this might
have<00:03:28.329> advantageous<00:03:28.870> then<00:03:29.049> also<00:03:29.319> in<00:03:29.709> in

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
have advantageous then also in in

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.979 
have advantageous then also in in
developing<00:03:30.700> nations<00:03:30.909> right<00:03:31.359> where<00:03:31.569> maybe<00:03:31.810> the

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
developing nations right where maybe the

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.399 
developing nations right where maybe the
gas<00:03:32.170> is<00:03:32.409> in<00:03:32.530> between<00:03:32.829> or<00:03:33.159> at<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.060> moment<00:03:34.409> we

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
gas is in between or at the moment we

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.319 
gas is in between or at the moment we
have<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:35.889> am<00:03:36.129> part<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.459> co-op<00:03:36.670> that's<00:03:37.180> going

their goal is to go green by 2021 and
they<00:03:46.450> don't<00:03:46.599> have<00:03:46.690> no<00:03:46.810> natural<00:03:47.170> resources<00:03:47.290> so

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
they don't have no natural resources so

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.199 
they don't have no natural resources so
I<00:03:47.889> don't<00:03:48.220> think<00:03:48.370> we<00:03:48.430> should<00:03:48.459> run<00:03:48.700> into<00:03:48.849> much

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
I don't think we should run into much

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.920 
I don't think we should run into much

the student this is one of my students
motor<00:04:02.849> he<00:04:03.849> built<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.419> and<00:04:04.629> we<00:04:05.230> he<00:04:05.349> got<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.620> to

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
motor he built it and we he got it to

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.319 
motor he built it and we he got it to
run<00:04:05.889> on<00:04:06.069> fifty<00:04:06.970> percent

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.949 

lack<00:04:11.329> of<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.510> better<00:04:11.629> word<00:04:11.930> again<00:04:12.439> let's<00:04:12.650> say

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
lack of a better word again let's say

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.289 
lack of a better word again let's say
coffee<00:04:15.190> let's<00:04:16.190> say<00:04:16.280> coffee<00:04:17.289> and<00:04:18.579> he's<00:04:19.579> he<00:04:20.150> let

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
coffee let's say coffee and he's he let

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.810 
coffee let's say coffee and he's he let
me<00:04:20.389> borrow<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.810> for<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.049> convention<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:22.190> as

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
me borrow it for the convention and as

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.430 
me borrow it for the convention and as
you<00:04:22.910> can<00:04:23.030> see<00:04:23.090> we<00:04:23.300> got<00:04:23.389> a<00:04:23.449> psych<00:04:23.780> glass<00:04:24.020> in<00:04:24.229> here

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
you can see we got a psych glass in here

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.040 
you can see we got a psych glass in here
so<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.710> could<00:04:24.889> see<00:04:25.070> what<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.430> rod<00:04:25.639> does<00:04:26.050> when

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
so you could see what the rod does when

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.400 
so you could see what the rod does when
you<00:04:27.169> turn<00:04:27.349> it<00:04:27.470> on<00:04:27.560> oh<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:28.340> see<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:28.729> see<00:04:29.410> obviously

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
you turn it on oh I see I see obviously

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.050 
you turn it on oh I see I see obviously
we<00:04:30.500> don't<00:04:30.590> want<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.830> run<00:04:30.979> it<00:04:31.099> in<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.460> hotel<00:04:31.820> I

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
we don't want to run it in the hotel I

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.700 
we don't want to run it in the hotel I
know<00:04:32.120> yeah<00:04:34.419> okay<00:04:35.419> so<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.599> fuel<00:04:35.930> comes<00:04:36.169> out<00:04:36.500> of

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
know yeah okay so the fuel comes out of

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.740 
know yeah okay so the fuel comes out of
the<00:04:36.860> bubbler<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.400> it's<00:04:37.520> vaporized<00:04:38.060> goes

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
the bubbler and it's vaporized goes

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.820 
the bubbler and it's vaporized goes
through<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.620> tube<00:04:40.780> now<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.229> this<00:04:42.500> is<00:04:42.680> the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
through the tube now this is this is the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.189 
through the tube now this is this is the
reactor<00:04:43.340> observer<00:04:43.639> this<00:04:43.880> is<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.300> VN<00:04:44.599> this<00:04:45.050> is

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
reactor observer this is the VN this is

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.260 
reactor observer this is the VN this is
the<00:04:45.320> rial<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.710> this<00:04:45.830> pipe<00:04:46.070> this<00:04:46.789> is<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:46.970> pipe

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
the rial of this pipe this is a pipe

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.490 
the rial of this pipe this is a pipe
within<00:04:47.599> a<00:04:47.690> pipe<00:04:47.870> right

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
within a pipe right

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.529 
within a pipe right
I<00:04:50.169> lost<00:04:51.280> then<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.430> have<00:04:52.580> your<00:04:52.699> reactor<00:04:53.300> pipe

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
I lost then you have your reactor pipe

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.990 
I lost then you have your reactor pipe
and<00:04:53.930> inside<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.979> reactor<00:04:55.280> pipe<00:04:55.610> is<00:04:55.789> where

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
and inside of the reactor pipe is where

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.900 
and inside of the reactor pipe is where
your<00:04:56.180> reactor<00:04:57.139> rod<00:04:57.349> is<00:04:57.590> but<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:58.580> this<00:04:58.729> is

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
your reactor rod is but so this is

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.110 
your reactor rod is but so this is
Saudis<00:04:59.389> riding<00:04:59.930> for<00:05:00.169> right<00:05:00.560> down<00:05:00.770> in<00:05:01.190> here<00:05:01.250> the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
Saudis riding for right down in here the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.730 
Saudis riding for right down in here the
rod<00:05:02.330> is<00:05:02.539> sitting<00:05:02.930> right<00:05:02.960> about<00:05:03.349> here<00:05:03.560> right

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
rod is sitting right about here right

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.150 
rod is sitting right about here right
now

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
now

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.550 
now
but<00:05:04.669> when<00:05:04.789> you<00:05:04.910> start<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.389> motor<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:06.320> rato

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
but when you start the motor the rato

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.670 
but when you start the motor the rato
actually<00:05:07.070> levitate<00:05:07.759> and<00:05:07.970> spindle<00:05:08.930> where<00:05:09.500> it

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
actually levitate and spindle where it

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.790 
actually levitate and spindle where it
wants<00:05:10.009> to<00:05:10.039> be<00:05:10.810> okay<00:05:11.810> so<00:05:12.229> you<00:05:12.289> got<00:05:12.470> to<00:05:12.560> build<00:05:12.650> the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
wants to be okay so you got to build the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.010 
wants to be okay so you got to build the
reactor<00:05:13.220> to<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.430> proper<00:05:14.000> size<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.659> let<00:05:14.840> the

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
reactor to the proper size to let the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.670 
reactor to the proper size to let the
rod<00:05:15.229> find<00:05:16.009> its<00:05:16.190> home<00:05:16.280> oh<00:05:16.990> okay<00:05:17.990> okay<00:05:18.229> so<00:05:18.470> what

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
rod find its home oh okay okay so what

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.640 
rod find its home oh okay okay so what
kind<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:18.860> sets<00:05:19.159> itself<00:05:19.580> yes<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.750> has<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:20.990> has<00:05:21.620> a

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
kind of sets itself yes it has a has a

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.800 
kind of sets itself yes it has a has a
mind<00:05:21.919> of<00:05:21.979> its<00:05:22.070> own<00:05:22.220> almost<00:05:22.580> so<00:05:23.060> well<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.419> finds

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
mind of its own almost so well it finds

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.850 
mind of its own almost so well it finds
the<00:05:23.960> resonance<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.650> whatever<00:05:24.889> material

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
the resonance of whatever material

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.459 
the resonance of whatever material
oh<00:05:27.860> you<00:05:28.610> gotta<00:05:28.789> help<00:05:29.149> it<00:05:29.389> find<00:05:29.599> depending<00:05:30.349> on

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469 
oh you gotta help it find depending on

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:31.659 
oh you gotta help it find depending on
you<00:05:30.709> got<00:05:30.829> to<00:05:30.949> know<00:05:31.039> what<00:05:31.279> you're<00:05:31.399> going<00:05:31.489> to<00:05:31.579> be

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
you got to know what you're going to be

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.809 
you got to know what you're going to be
running<00:05:32.019> first<00:05:33.019> so<00:05:33.860> then<00:05:34.009> you<00:05:34.159> can<00:05:34.309> build<00:05:34.519> your

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
running first so then you can build your

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.029 
running first so then you can build your
reactor<00:05:35.409> because<00:05:36.409> there's<00:05:36.649> different

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
reactor because there's different

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.189 
reactor because there's different
lengths<00:05:37.459> and<00:05:37.849> different<00:05:38.179> setups<00:05:38.689> you<00:05:38.869> can<00:05:39.019> go

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
lengths and different setups you can go

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.319 
lengths and different setups you can go
for<00:05:39.439> resume<00:05:39.739> you<00:05:39.919> can't<00:05:40.189> change<00:05:40.519> the<00:05:40.819> material

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:41.329 
for resume you can't change the material

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:44.289 
for resume you can't change the material
if<00:05:41.419> after<00:05:41.749> you<00:05:41.869> go<00:05:42.079> there<00:05:43.039> it<00:05:43.309> yes<00:05:43.849> you<00:05:43.969> can<00:05:44.149> but

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:44.299 
if after you go there it yes you can but

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:46.659 
if after you go there it yes you can but
your<00:05:44.449> efficiency<00:05:44.899> won't<00:05:45.139> be<00:05:45.319> as<00:05:45.499> great<00:05:46.189> as<00:05:46.399> it

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
your efficiency won't be as great as it

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.969 
your efficiency won't be as great as it
could<00:05:46.849> be<00:05:47.029> when<00:05:47.209> it's<00:05:47.360> properly<00:05:47.989> tuned<00:05:48.199> let's

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
could be when it's properly tuned let's

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.769 
could be when it's properly tuned let's
say<00:05:49.129> this<00:05:49.279> one<00:05:49.519> it's<00:05:50.029> setup<00:05:50.299> where<00:05:50.569> I<00:05:50.599> could

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:50.779 
say this one it's setup where I could

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.479 
say this one it's setup where I could
just<00:05:50.959> replace<00:05:51.169> the<00:05:51.409> rod<00:05:51.619> and<00:05:51.889> run<00:05:52.039> a<00:05:52.069> different

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:52.489 
just replace the rod and run a different

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:56.019 
just replace the rod and run a different
fuel<00:05:52.759> but<00:05:53.509> my<00:05:53.689> efficiency<00:05:54.110> won't<00:05:54.559> be<00:05:54.860> as<00:05:55.189> great

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:56.029

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:58.539 
fuel but my efficiency won't be as great
it<00:05:56.299> will<00:05:56.599> be<00:05:56.749> good<00:05:56.959> but<00:05:57.619> it<00:05:57.739> won't<00:05:57.889> be<00:05:57.979> as<00:05:58.129> what

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:58.549 
it will be good but it won't be as what

00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:00.039 
it will be good but it won't be as what

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:15.799 
that typically what I'm gonna be setting

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:17.889 
that typically what I'm gonna be setting
up<00:06:15.919> for<00:06:15.949> is<00:06:16.309> crude<00:06:16.639> oil<00:06:16.909> because<00:06:17.360> I<00:06:17.479> got<00:06:17.629> a<00:06:17.659> lot

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:17.899 
up for is crude oil because I got a lot

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.259 
up for is crude oil because I got a lot
of<00:06:17.929> connections<00:06:18.439> for<00:06:18.889> crude<00:06:19.189> oil<00:06:19.339> but<00:06:20.149> that

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:20.269 
of connections for crude oil but that

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:22.329 
of connections for crude oil but that
would<00:06:20.360> be<00:06:20.389> for<00:06:20.449> me<00:06:20.659> as<00:06:21.469> far<00:06:21.679> as<00:06:21.799> my<00:06:21.889> students

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:22.339 
would be for me as far as my students

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.219 
would be for me as far as my students
well<00:06:22.459> they<00:06:22.549> can<00:06:22.669> come<00:06:22.909> and<00:06:23.149> they<00:06:23.779> tell<00:06:24.049> me<00:06:24.079> what

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
well they can come and they tell me what

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:25.659 
well they can come and they tell me what
they<00:06:24.439> want<00:06:24.679> to<00:06:24.769> run<00:06:24.860> yeah

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
they want to run yeah

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.559 
they want to run yeah
now<00:06:25.789> then<00:06:26.089> and<00:06:26.769> typically<00:06:27.769> with<00:06:27.919> diesel<00:06:28.569> like

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:29.569 
now then and typically with diesel like

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.149 
now then and typically with diesel like
your<00:06:29.749> spark<00:06:30.019> plugs<00:06:30.259> wouldn't<00:06:30.619> ignite<00:06:30.889> that

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
your spark plugs wouldn't ignite that

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:32.919 
your spark plugs wouldn't ignite that
but<00:06:31.309> in<00:06:31.399> this<00:06:31.489> case<00:06:31.759> the<00:06:31.969> exact<00:06:32.209> vaporizing

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:32.929 
but in this case the exact vaporizing

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:34.869 
but in this case the exact vaporizing
it's<00:06:33.229> probably<00:06:33.860> just<00:06:33.949> to<00:06:34.099> heat<00:06:34.279> the<00:06:34.429> reaction

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:34.879 
it's probably just to heat the reaction

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.429 
it's probably just to heat the reaction
chamber<00:06:34.909> right<00:06:35.419> no<00:06:35.509> longer<00:06:35.809> diesel<00:06:36.199> when<00:06:36.319> it

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:36.439 
chamber right no longer diesel when it

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.429 
chamber right no longer diesel when it
comes<00:06:36.589> out<00:06:36.739> here<00:06:36.949> oh<00:06:37.569> okay<00:06:38.569> yeah<00:06:38.929> if<00:06:39.229> what

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:39.439 
comes out here oh okay yeah if what

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.679 
comes out here oh okay yeah if what
everyone<00:06:39.769> whatever<00:06:40.309> you<00:06:40.429> put<00:06:40.639> in<00:06:40.759> here<00:06:41.089> comes

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:41.689 
everyone whatever you put in here comes

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:43.239 
everyone whatever you put in here comes
out<00:06:41.869> completely<00:06:42.349> different<00:06:42.979> molecular

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:43.249 
out completely different molecular

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.059 
out completely different molecular
structure<00:06:43.909> and<00:06:44.749> it's<00:06:45.110> basically<00:06:45.829> what

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069 
structure and it's basically what

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:48.159 
structure and it's basically what
they've<00:06:46.189> been<00:06:46.399> recorded<00:06:46.939> is<00:06:47.119> when<00:06:47.869> you<00:06:47.989> run

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
they've been recorded is when you run

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.359 
they've been recorded is when you run
crude<00:06:48.439> oil<00:06:48.800> they've<00:06:49.459> gotten<00:06:49.819> helium<00:06:50.389> oxygen

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:51.369 
crude oil they've gotten helium oxygen

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:55.389 
crude oil they've gotten helium oxygen
hydrogen<00:06:52.369> and<00:06:53.119> many<00:06:53.809> other<00:06:54.159> different<00:06:55.159> kinds

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:55.399 
hydrogen and many other different kinds

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.249 
hydrogen and many other different kinds
of<00:06:55.489> us<00:06:55.759> all<00:06:56.089> sorts<00:06:56.539> of<00:06:56.599> constituents

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
of us all sorts of constituents

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.379 
of us all sorts of constituents
elemental<00:06:57.799> gases<00:06:58.069> action<00:06:58.699> yeah

00:06:59.379 --> 00:06:59.389 
elemental gases action yeah

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.719 
elemental gases action yeah
so<00:06:59.809> then<00:07:00.589> you<00:07:00.709> bring<00:07:00.979> them<00:07:01.069> over<00:07:01.189> here<00:07:01.369> and

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
so then you bring them over here and

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.959 
so then you bring them over here and
they<00:07:02.329> burn<00:07:02.539> really<00:07:02.749> good<00:07:03.019> now<00:07:03.979> with<00:07:04.369> converted

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:04.969 
they burn really good now with converted

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:06.929 
they burn really good now with converted
cars<00:07:05.329> and<00:07:05.689> stuff<00:07:05.869> when<00:07:06.110> people<00:07:06.199> convert<00:07:06.619> those

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:06.939 
cars and stuff when people convert those

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:09.459 
cars and stuff when people convert those
have<00:07:07.939> you<00:07:07.969> have<00:07:08.299> you<00:07:08.419> when<00:07:08.809> you<00:07:08.899> drive<00:07:09.199> those

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
have you have you when you drive those

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:12.159 
have you have you when you drive those
how<00:07:09.679> do<00:07:09.739> they<00:07:09.949> typically<00:07:10.309> drive<00:07:10.669> well<00:07:11.629> the<00:07:11.959> one

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:12.169 
how do they typically drive well the one

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.680 
how do they typically drive well the one
vehicle<00:07:12.379> that<00:07:12.619> I've<00:07:12.829> converted<00:07:13.189> so<00:07:13.489> far<00:07:13.759> as

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
vehicle that I've converted so far as

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.900 
vehicle that I've converted so far as
really<00:07:14.990> really<00:07:15.230> smooth<00:07:15.710> idle<00:07:16.130> and<00:07:16.610> it<00:07:16.760> runs

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910 
really really smooth idle and it runs

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.990 
really really smooth idle and it runs
really<00:07:17.240> good<00:07:18.100> only<00:07:19.100> problem<00:07:19.400> we<00:07:19.490> had<00:07:19.760> with<00:07:19.940> it

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
really good only problem we had with it

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.090 
really good only problem we had with it
was<00:07:20.210> getting<00:07:20.810> the<00:07:20.900> proper<00:07:21.200> vaporization

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100 
was getting the proper vaporization

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.180 
was getting the proper vaporization
that's<00:07:22.910> crucial<00:07:23.540> we<00:07:24.320> were<00:07:24.470> actually<00:07:24.770> giving

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190 
that's crucial we were actually giving

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.220 
that's crucial we were actually giving
it<00:07:25.250> a<00:07:25.340> little<00:07:25.550> bit<00:07:25.670> too<00:07:26.030> much<00:07:26.180> fuel<00:07:26.480> using<00:07:26.930> a

it a little bit too much fuel using a

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.380 
it a little bit too much fuel using a

Oh<00:07:31.370> okay<00:07:31.880> let's<00:07:32.090> just<00:07:32.240> imagine<00:07:32.480> that<00:07:32.720> and<00:07:33.110> you

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:33.200 
Oh okay let's just imagine that and you

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.080
