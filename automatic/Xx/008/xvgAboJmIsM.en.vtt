so<00:01:32.530> got<00:01:32.710> on<00:01:32.740> 1187<00:01:33.490> here<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.200> this<00:01:35.320> is<00:01:35.380> going<00:01:35.470> to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
so got on 1187 here so this is going to

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.940 
so got on 1187 here so this is going to
crack<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:36.040> just<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.310> get<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.549> ready<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.850> go<00:01:36.880> and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
then we're going to need a slant here

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.440 
then we're going to need a slant here
that<00:01:41.770> we<00:01:41.890> can<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.280> on<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:45.970> really<00:01:46.150> all

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
that we can get that on to so really all

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.760 
that we can get that on to so really all
we're<00:01:46.630> going<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:46.780> do<00:01:46.990> here<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.440> we're<00:01:47.590> going<00:01:47.680> to

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
we're going to do here is we're going to

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.960 
we're going to do here is we're going to
transfer<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.430> sample<00:01:49.149> least<00:01:49.330> from<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.170> slant

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
transfer a sample least from this slant

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.469 
transfer a sample least from this slant
over<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:53.470> one<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:54.180> let<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.270> grow<00:01:55.360> on

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
over to this one and let it grow on

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.730 
over to this one and let it grow on
there<00:01:55.780> we're<00:01:55.930> going<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.110> incubate<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.590> for<00:01:56.710> a

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
there we're going to incubate it for a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.359 
there we're going to incubate it for a
little<00:01:56.860> bit<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.509> off<00:01:58.509> it<00:01:58.720> goes<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:59.500> this<00:02:00.220> has

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
little bit and off it goes so this has

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.620 
little bit and off it goes so this has
been<00:02:00.490> sitting<00:02:00.729> in<00:02:00.790> alcohol<00:02:01.240> we're<00:02:01.450> going<00:02:01.570> to

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
been sitting in alcohol we're going to

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:10.130 
been sitting in alcohol we're going to
want<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.220> make<00:02:03.220> sure<00:02:03.250> this<00:02:03.550> loop<00:02:03.820> is<00:02:04.000> flamed

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.010 

straighten<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.170> out<00:02:11.319> here

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.220 

let's<00:02:16.620> get<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:16.920> red-hot<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:18.020> it'll<00:02:19.020> kill

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
let's get this red-hot and it'll kill

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:33.230 
let's get this red-hot and it'll kill
any<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> bad<00:02:20.480> stuff<00:02:21.480> that's<00:02:21.630> loaded<00:02:22.050> on<00:02:22.200> it

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.180 

so<00:02:33.810> I'm<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.290> little<00:02:34.320> bit<00:02:34.590> overkill<00:02:34.980> but

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
so I'm going a little bit overkill but

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.950 
so I'm going a little bit overkill but
I'm<00:02:35.280> trying<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.610> exaggerate<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.780> you're

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
I'm trying to exaggerate what you're

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.900 
I'm trying to exaggerate what you're
trying<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.410> here<00:02:37.800> it's<00:02:38.400> gonna<00:02:38.520> be<00:02:38.670> hard<00:02:38.820> to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
trying to do here it's gonna be hard to

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.940 
trying to do here it's gonna be hard to
see<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> video<00:02:39.330> especially<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.650> know<00:02:40.770> not

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
see on a video especially you know not

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.010 
see on a video especially you know not
being<00:02:41.340> here<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.580> seeing<00:02:41.910> everything<00:02:42.870> up

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
being here and seeing everything up

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.100 
being here and seeing everything up
close<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:45.270> area<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.720> we've<00:02:45.840> got<00:02:45.990> this

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
close so this area that we've got this

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.730 
close so this area that we've got this
burner<00:02:46.350> going<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:48.110> letting<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.200> hot<00:02:49.380> air<00:02:49.500> rise

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
burner going is letting the hot air rise

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.110 
burner going is letting the hot air rise
and<00:02:50.100> with<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.490> not<00:02:50.700> allowing<00:02:51.150> any<00:02:51.360> any

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
and with it it's not allowing any any

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.300 
and with it it's not allowing any any
dust<00:02:54.120> particles<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.810> settle<00:02:55.110> down<00:02:55.440> onto<00:02:56.070> our

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
dust particles to settle down onto our

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.040 
dust particles to settle down onto our
work<00:02:56.550> area<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.270> can<00:02:57.480> kind<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.720> assume<00:02:57.990> that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
work area so we can kind of assume that

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.500 
work area so we can kind of assume that
this<00:02:58.350> area<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.680> sterile<00:02:59.610> because<00:03:00.030> I've<00:03:00.360> been

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
this area is sterile because I've been

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.500 
this area is sterile because I've been
waving<00:03:01.430> air<00:03:02.430> around<00:03:02.850> that's<00:03:03.120> probably<00:03:03.390> got

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
waving air around that's probably got

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.790 
waving air around that's probably got
dust<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.050> I'm<00:03:04.200> just<00:03:04.260> going<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.530> go<00:03:04.680> ahead

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
dust on it I'm just going to go ahead

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.020 
dust on it I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:03:05.300> sterilize<00:03:06.300> this<00:03:06.480> one<00:03:06.660> more<00:03:06.810> time<00:03:11.030> but

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
and sterilize this one more time but

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.430 
and sterilize this one more time but
everything<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.480> do<00:03:12.600> at<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.870> point<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.320> got

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
everything you do at this point you got

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.930 
everything you do at this point you got
to<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:13.620> very<00:03:13.770> careful<00:03:14.040> otherwise<00:03:14.490> you're

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
to be very careful otherwise you're

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.140 
to be very careful otherwise you're
going<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.090> contaminate<00:03:15.780> your<00:03:16.140> sample<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:20.150> I'm

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
going to contaminate your sample so I'm

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.210 
going to contaminate your sample so I'm
going<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.480> flame<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.110> outside<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.770> this<00:03:22.920> just

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
going to flame the outside of this just

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.960 
going to flame the outside of this just
to<00:03:23.310> kill<00:03:23.520> any<00:03:23.670> bad<00:03:25.280> bad<00:03:26.280> guys<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.850> are<00:03:26.940> on

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
to kill any bad bad guys that are on

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.350 
to kill any bad bad guys that are on
there<00:03:28.190> I'll<00:03:29.190> just<00:03:29.370> touch<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.940> loop<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.330> the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
there I'll just touch the loop to the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.880 
there I'll just touch the loop to the
agar<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:32.250> that'll<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.790> cool<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.150> down<00:03:33.890> I'm

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
agar and that'll just cool it down I'm

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.560 
agar and that'll just cool it down I'm
going<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.340> take<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.580> sample<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.180> yeast<00:03:36.390> out

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
going to just take a sample of yeast out

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.600 
going to just take a sample of yeast out
of<00:03:36.720> there

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
of there

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.550

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.630 

and<00:04:05.590> I'm<00:04:05.710> just<00:04:05.860> picking<00:04:06.010> up<00:04:06.280> some<00:04:06.490> of<00:04:06.580> the

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
and I'm just picking up some of the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.160 
and I'm just picking up some of the
water<00:04:06.790> that's<00:04:07.090> in<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:07.390> bottom<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.810> this<00:04:07.930> this

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
water that's in the bottom of this this

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.700 
water that's in the bottom of this this
sterile<00:04:08.860> that<00:04:09.010> I'm<00:04:09.130> gonna<00:04:10.350> streak<00:04:11.350> it<00:04:11.500> all<00:04:11.620> the

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
sterile that I'm gonna streak it all the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.760 
sterile that I'm gonna streak it all the
way<00:04:11.830> up<00:04:13.560> point<00:04:14.560> me<00:04:14.680> outside<00:04:14.800> of<00:04:15.040> this<00:04:15.220> again

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
way up point me outside of this again

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.010 
way up point me outside of this again
put<00:04:17.770> our<00:04:17.890> cap<00:04:18.100> on<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:21.570> then<00:04:22.570> we're<00:04:22.810> going<00:04:22.930> to

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
put our cap on and then we're going to

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.550 
put our cap on and then we're going to
burn<00:04:23.260> any<00:04:23.920> of<00:04:24.130> these<00:04:24.220> that's<00:04:25.110> still<00:04:26.110> on<00:04:26.290> here

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
burn any of these that's still on here

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.650 
burn any of these that's still on here
off<00:04:26.710> completely

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
off completely

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.090 
off completely
we'll<00:04:28.660> return<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.200> back<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.680> our<00:04:29.710> bottle<00:04:30.010> of

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
we'll return that back to our bottle of

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.980 
we'll return that back to our bottle of
alcohol<00:04:30.540> so<00:04:31.540> now<00:04:31.990> we<00:04:32.050> have<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> sample<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:33.990> 1187

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
alcohol so now we have a sample of 1187

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.920 
alcohol so now we have a sample of 1187
that's<00:04:35.320> been<00:04:35.500> successfully<00:04:36.250> transferred<00:04:36.930> now

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
that's been successfully transferred now

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:48.220 
that's been successfully transferred now
we're<00:04:38.140> going<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:40.080> throw<00:04:41.080> our<00:04:41.260> label<00:04:41.650> on<00:04:41.770> it

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.800 

and<00:04:48.320> that<00:04:49.070> is<00:04:50.530> essentially<00:04:51.530> all<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:51.950> do

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
and that is essentially all you do

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.030 
and that is essentially all you do
essentially<00:04:53.810> when<00:04:53.930> this<00:04:54.110> has<00:04:54.290> been<00:04:54.500> an<00:04:54.620> ocular

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
essentially when this has been an ocular

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.960 
essentially when this has been an ocular
like<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.550> you<00:04:56.060> can<00:04:57.280> just<00:04:58.280> keep<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.520> cap<00:04:58.760> just

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
like that you can just keep the cap just

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.500 
like that you can just keep the cap just
a<00:04:59.120> little<00:04:59.480> cracked<00:04:59.870> on<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:00.260> not<00:05:01.510> insanely

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
a little cracked on it not insanely

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.960 
a little cracked on it not insanely
loose<00:05:02.810> but<00:05:03.020> just<00:05:03.200> enough<00:05:03.440> for<00:05:03.620> any<00:05:04.160> co2<00:05:04.580> to<00:05:04.850> get

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
loose but just enough for any co2 to get

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.040 
loose but just enough for any co2 to get
out<00:05:05.090> of<00:05:05.210> there<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.450> what<00:05:05.630> we're<00:05:05.750> going<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.900> do

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
out of there and what we're going to do

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.360 
out of there and what we're going to do
is<00:05:06.170> incubate<00:05:06.590> this<00:05:06.740> until<00:05:07.100> we<00:05:07.190> see<00:05:07.340> some

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
is incubate this until we see some

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.100 
is incubate this until we see some
growth<00:05:07.730> on<00:05:07.940> there<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.240> then<00:05:08.720> we<00:05:08.840> can<00:05:08.960> return

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
growth on there and then we can return

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.680 
growth on there and then we can return
it<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.560> fridge<00:05:09.800> where<00:05:10.700> it<00:05:10.820> can<00:05:11.000> live<00:05:11.360> for

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
it to the fridge where it can live for

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.140 
it to the fridge where it can live for
well<00:05:12.320> some<00:05:13.070> people<00:05:13.370> only<00:05:13.490> say<00:05:13.700> a<00:05:13.730> couple<00:05:14.090> of

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
well some people only say a couple of

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.930 
well some people only say a couple of
months<00:05:14.300> but<00:05:14.570> we<00:05:14.870> go<00:05:15.020> up<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.530> a<00:05:15.560> year<00:05:15.740> all<00:05:16.430> right

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
months but we go up to a year all right

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.720 
months but we go up to a year all right
so<00:05:17.270> here's<00:05:17.510> our<00:05:17.780> completed<00:05:18.440> D<00:05:18.680> slants<00:05:19.160> these

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
so here's our completed D slants these

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.370 
so here's our completed D slants these
are<00:05:19.880> going<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.090> get<00:05:20.180> incubated<00:05:20.720> for<00:05:20.750> about<00:05:21.020> 18

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
are going to get incubated for about 18

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.380 
are going to get incubated for about 18
hours<00:05:21.530> once<00:05:22.250> we<00:05:22.460> start<00:05:22.700> seeing<00:05:22.910> some<00:05:23.030> growth

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
hours once we start seeing some growth

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.390 
hours once we start seeing some growth
on<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:24.050> agar<00:05:24.500> here<00:05:24.710> we're<00:05:24.830> going<00:05:24.920> to<00:05:24.980> cap<00:05:25.220> them

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
on the agar here we're going to cap them

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.670 
on the agar here we're going to cap them
up<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.700> they<00:05:26.420> can<00:05:26.660> go<00:05:26.810> into<00:05:27.140> the<00:05:27.230> fridge<00:05:27.410> for
