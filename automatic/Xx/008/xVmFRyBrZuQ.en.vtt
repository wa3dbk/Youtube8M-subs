00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
want to demonstrate was that if I power

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.020 
want to demonstrate was that if I power
off<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.550> unit<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:40.200> say<00:03:40.440> ok<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.920> actually<00:03:41.790> turn

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
off the unit and say ok to actually turn

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:51.280

then I turn and when the power courts
plugged<00:03:54.709> in<00:03:54.890> I<00:03:54.920> don't<00:03:55.069> know<00:03:55.250> if<00:03:55.340> this<00:03:55.459> is

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.089 
plugged in I don't know if this is
normal<00:03:56.000> or<00:03:56.120> not<00:03:56.299> but<00:03:56.629> it<00:03:56.780> just<00:03:57.260> reboots<00:03:57.799> it

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
normal or not but it just reboots it

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.740 
normal or not but it just reboots it
doesn't<00:03:58.430> actually<00:03:58.579> just<00:03:59.000> shut<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.480> stay

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750

off

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.950 

you'll<00:04:21.440> notice<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:22.389> Wi-Fi<00:04:23.389> connection

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
you'll notice that the Wi-Fi connection

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.350 
you'll notice that the Wi-Fi connection
is<00:04:23.990> reestablished<00:04:24.949> it's<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.580> tea<00:04:25.819> connection

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
is reestablished it's a tea connection

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.080 
is reestablished it's a tea connection
and<00:04:26.780> everything<00:04:27.500> appears<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:27.919> be<00:04:28.039> normal<00:04:28.160> and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
and everything appears to be normal and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.670 
and everything appears to be normal and
it'll<00:04:29.360> do<00:04:29.569> that<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.800> next<00:04:31.099> time<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.699> fails

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
it'll do that and the next time it fails

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.159 
it'll do that and the next time it fails
it'll<00:04:33.680> be<00:04:34.220> less<00:04:34.610> than<00:04:34.880> it'll<00:04:35.750> take<00:04:35.900> less<00:04:36.110> time

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
it'll be less than it'll take less time

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.460 
it'll be less than it'll take less time
than<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.680> last<00:04:36.889> time<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.310> fail<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:38.060> so<00:04:38.330> forth

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.919
