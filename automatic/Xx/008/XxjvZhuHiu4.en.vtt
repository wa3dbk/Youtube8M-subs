00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.240
 go out 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.040
 in terms of youtube good friend 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.110
 front 80 another video because I bring you 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.869
 a minecraft tutorial in the sub-19 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.090
 for any console how to make a 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.130
 super tnt bomb that will blow you away 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.720
 from the map to who knows until 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.279
 example that mountain 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.290
 mackay mountain will even be that I'm 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.759
 pointing there is a bomb 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.860
 extremely dangerous is your 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.690
 survival I do not think the survival 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.250
 but you can survive in creative 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.900
 I do not think I can survive it 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.570
 if you put water but I do not know very well 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.960
 how that works and why not talk is 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.120
 I do not know how it works not with water 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.760
 the point is that what do you need from these 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.560
 a rail only one if you're if you're 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.500
 in survival you need several 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.110
 dynamite wagons not just one and for 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.190
 caution pointed out if gentlemen things like that 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.079
 is 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.640
 now what is it that we are going to do what 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.980
 we're going to do is we're going to put what 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.989
 that was the rail on either side of 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.030
 our map we are going to put some slabs 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.700
 preventive because if you know good not 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.530
 I know if you know but this one if you have a 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.450
 van with dynamite on a rail and the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.950
 you push out will explode 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.780
 then the rails are mostly of 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.000
 caution so you do not realize 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.130
 here you will not be able to push and so 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.509
 good also that everything that's why the ships 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.299
 and you already have these two things 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.039
 you are going to put your first king and the 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.259
 me what I like to do good indeed 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.330
 what you have to do is find the 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.159
 outline of what the wagon was not 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.259
 for example is survival because you 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.330
 she realize what I do is , 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.560
 I just had to dig a block or another 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.050
 thing you can do for your comfort 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.580
 is simply to put another one like a 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.710
 slab and in this way you can also 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.869
 see there you realize the outline but 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.360
 Well, I like truth much better 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.770
 with a block and agachadito not then 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.289
 what we are going to do is once 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.479
 let's find the outline of the rail that 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.390
 is more or less out there that does not what 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.000
 he did not grab it there we're going to put the main 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.550
 karts that you want and that you can eye 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.979
 the more main karts the bigger will be a 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.220
 explosion so it's good I think I'm going to 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.920
 put about 10 more 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.900
 we met, they were told, good, be good 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.849
 then once it puts I think a 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.980
 little bit more once you have a lot 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.709
 there the ones that you want me there I did not put 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.980
 so many I have put more what you are going to do 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.810
 is to remove the slabs and you are going to push everything 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.340
 this can not sometimes take until 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.379
 explode you realize how many are 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.629
 I even see myself a little bit and in a 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.160
 you realize that they are a lot and if 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.160
 you are creative I do not recommend flying 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.370
 is that it's the epic thing and we're going to see you 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.200
 I'm going to fall, look, take me to the edge of 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.940
 my map tell me how epic is that was 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.340
 an immense explosion look is a 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.220
 explosion hell tell you that it is 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.590
 one thing louis that is, it's one thing 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.209
 epic was telling you that if you're in creative 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.980
 do not get to fly because if not the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.800
 is the trap I say the explosion do not you 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.840
 will fly flying to the antler 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.850
 It will take you flying, because that's just what 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.250
 you start flying but if you did not 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.310
 Count how much it exploded and how far I 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.840
 sack is something too incredible not 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.610
 unfortunately I do not have much time 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.260
 to make this video I actually had it 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.850
 what to do in the race because in a 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.820
 I am going to come visits and I have 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.110
 to go and so not then this I have to 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.690
 do it very well the race indeed 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.330
 this video is going to be a bit short but 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.790
 I hope you liked it, do not hesitate 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.230
 try as much dynamite as you can 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.360
 oil tells you that he even died 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.730
 I washed myself today everything you need account 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.980
 also from the gigantic hole that I left 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.870
 there 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.489
 I hope you liked the video I hope 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.379
 you like two epic explosions that I 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.700
 I take it up the clouds until 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.769
 Up the clouds is a good way 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.659
 to upload if you want so 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.610
 I hope to see you liked video do not forget 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.010
 give it a like if you like it if it works 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.780
 this as a trick that I brought you comments 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.400
 If you have any doubt or comment what you 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.400
 it seemed the explosion of 110 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.590
 everyone
