phenomenal<00:00:53.230> do<00:00:53.830> I<00:00:53.890> think<00:00:53.980> that<00:00:54.340> on<00:00:54.640> just<00:00:55.270> juice

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810

not be me I'm telling you that right now
we<00:03:05.650> are<00:03:05.860> not<00:03:06.100> having<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.490> now<00:03:06.820> you're<00:03:07.390> going

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
we are not having that now you're going

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.120 
we are not having that now you're going
to<00:03:07.600> have<00:03:07.720> much<00:03:07.930> less<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:08.680> juicing

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
to have much less of that with juicing

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.670 
to have much less of that with juicing
and<00:03:09.310> with<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.730> raw<00:03:09.940> because<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:11.050> nutrients

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
and with going raw because the nutrients

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.610 
and with going raw because the nutrients
are<00:03:11.860> also<00:03:12.720> regenerating<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:13.840> rejuvenating

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
are also regenerating and rejuvenating

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.210 
are also regenerating and rejuvenating
your<00:03:14.830> skin<00:03:15.390> however<00:03:16.650> exercise<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.130> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
your skin however exercise and the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.949 
your skin however exercise and the
muscle<00:03:18.670> development<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:19.330> get<00:03:19.660> through

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
muscle development that you get through

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.810 
muscle development that you get through
that<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.440> only<00:03:20.739> going<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.100> help<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.550> process

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
that is only going to help that process

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.449 
that is only going to help that process
so<00:03:22.750> i<00:03:23.080> will<00:03:23.440> be<00:03:23.470> working<00:03:23.830> out<00:03:24.070> on<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.280> daily

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
so i will be working out on a daily

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.090 
so i will be working out on a daily
