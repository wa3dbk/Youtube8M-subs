showered in the company of gay men

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.390 
showered in the company of gay men
without<00:01:39.080> even<00:01:39.290> realizing<00:01:39.830> well<00:01:40.009> what's<00:01:40.250> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
without even realizing well what's the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.990 
without even realizing well what's the
big<00:01:40.549> deal

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
big deal

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.820 
big deal
if<00:01:41.150> someone<00:01:41.630> has<00:01:41.840> come<00:01:42.170> out<00:01:42.350> as<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.560> homosexual

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.219 
if someone has come out as a homosexual
I<00:01:43.549> think<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:44.150> NFL<00:01:44.299> what<00:01:44.869> this<00:01:45.020> legislation

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
I think the NFL what this legislation

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.530 
I think the NFL what this legislation
would<00:01:45.740> do<00:01:46.040> is<00:01:46.189> one<00:01:46.400> of<00:01:46.549> two<00:01:46.729> things<00:01:46.939> one<00:01:47.270> it

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
would do is one of two things one it

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.850 
would do is one of two things one it
would<00:01:47.689> ban<00:01:47.900> them<00:01:48.110> from<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.470> National

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
would ban them from the National

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.440 
would ban them from the National
Football<00:01:49.009> League<00:01:49.430> two<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:50.060> would<00:01:50.150> give<00:01:50.299> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
Football League two it would give the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.690 
Football League two it would give the
NFL<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.869> choice<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.860> would<00:01:52.100> allow<00:01:52.369> them<00:01:52.670> to

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
NFL a choice it would allow them to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.120 
NFL a choice it would allow them to
create<00:01:53.240> separate<00:01:53.869> facilities<00:01:54.530> completely

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
create separate facilities completely

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.160 
create separate facilities completely
separate<00:01:55.549> facilities<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.840> think<00:01:57.020> it's

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
separate facilities I just think it's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.840 
separate facilities I just think it's
common<00:01:57.590> decency<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:58.130> mean<00:01:58.310> why<00:01:58.430> do<00:01:58.490> we<00:01:58.670> have

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
common decency I mean why do we have

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.730 
common decency I mean why do we have
separate<00:01:59.270> restrooms<00:01:59.630> for<00:01:59.840> men<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.290> women<00:02:00.560> why

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
separate restrooms for men and women why

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.880 
separate restrooms for men and women why
in<00:02:01.250> school<00:02:01.640> do<00:02:01.970> boys<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:03.020> girls<00:02:03.259> shower<00:02:03.590> in

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
in school do boys and girls shower in

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.740 
in school do boys and girls shower in
different<00:02:04.280> areas<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:04.729> mean<00:02:04.970> what<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.240> this<00:02:05.390> area

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
greatest I think what he's doing is

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.759 
greatest I think what he's doing is
positioning<00:02:25.360> himself<00:02:25.780> very<00:02:26.230> shrewdly<00:02:26.650> I
