00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.880
 these creatures live in a high pressure environment and some 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.570
 care in lara 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.960
 that's why they look so different to normal fish woman there is a 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.960
 animal that is the strangest of all 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.989
 when thousands of kilometers below the sea you think 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.280

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 flexible that can swallow prey almost double its size 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 the pejesapo and subtes that goes in search of crisis 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.809
 inside a trap suspended on his forehead 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.809
 the emission is from bacteria that produce light 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.740
 This is the scenario to attract other countries 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.670
 include slim punches that make the frogfish number one in the account 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.450
 regressive 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 only the females come out in search of fish 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.970
 the males are so different that for decades the scientists 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.130
 they thought they were two totally different species 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.260
 the puma company made is 40 times smaller than a female 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.560
 this one possesses thin tints it does not possess it said nor intestines 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.390
 to survive 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.390
 pd catch one of giving him the bite of fashion 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.719
 as soon as taken in summer 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.020
 your body begins to degenerate 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.970
 in their jaws spread over the skin of the female and then they do 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.250
 also his veins 20 that zafÃ³ male is number one 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.780
 because for many years scientists thought that the female 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.870
 He had strange lumps that grew 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.660
 the male was so strange 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.920
 that nobody noticed that before it was a weight 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.349
 it had become an object of reproductive organs 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.269
 ready to fertilize the eggs of the female 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.559
 when it came to her 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.599
 but the pejesapo is not the only one who takes his partner where he goes 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.579
 some committed this in a sport 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.659
 we tried the lounge valley but we were not born for that we were born for this 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.189
 now 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.189
 welcome to the workers cut 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.069
 unlike current crisis 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.069
 here is the man who carries the female on an obstacle course 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.879
 this sport was created in the 19th century 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.319
 when an outbreak at the end of that established that they could only join 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 his group quini zero for nothing a wife 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.299
 today the maidens are a little more willing 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.180
 Although throwing one's wife into the water can have serious repercussions 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.949
 it is hard to imagine what life is like for a small toad 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.809
 as you imagine life would be if your partner will hang over you for 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.809
 always like a parasite that stuck blood 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.909
 but this strange relationship 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.909
 can only have these strange animals 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.769
 so when it comes to strange animals 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.179
 the head of state I expected 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:47.819
 the evil 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.819
 premiere
