in to grew and Jorian are all using this

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.670 
in to grew and Jorian are all using this
concept<00:00:43.850> of<00:00:44.360> bouncing<00:00:44.840> your<00:00:44.960> body<00:00:45.140> around<00:00:45.320> and

next you want to get a nice solid slow
stall<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.720> practice<00:01:23.110> with<00:01:23.320> try<00:01:23.740> coming<00:01:24.040> around

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160

a<00:01:24.280> little<00:01:24.460> bit<00:01:24.610> slower<00:01:24.880> than<00:01:25.120> normal<00:01:25.270> so

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
a little bit slower than normal so

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.640 
a little bit slower than normal so
you're<00:01:25.720> not<00:01:25.810> having<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.170> fight<00:01:26.380> your<00:01:26.500> bike

bike dip back for a split second longer

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.190 
bike dip back for a split second longer
than<00:01:30.640> normal<00:01:30.910> so<00:01:31.540> that<00:01:31.690> when<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.900> hit<00:01:32.020> your
