up<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.620> 30<00:00:49.920> presets<00:00:54.739> not<00:00:55.739> only<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
up to 30 presets not only that we have a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.000 
up to 30 presets not only that we have a
28<00:00:57.420> second<00:00:57.899> looper<00:00:59.600> also<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.410> assign<00:01:01.739> each

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
28 second looper also we can assign each

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.630 
28 second looper also we can assign each
patch<00:01:02.750> with<00:01:03.750> an<00:01:03.870> expression<00:01:04.199> pedal<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.549> I'll

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
patch with an expression pedal so I'll

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.920 
patch with an expression pedal so I'll
give<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.119> sample<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.659> how<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
give you a little sample of how it

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.720 
give you a little sample of how it
sounds<00:01:07.290> like

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.910 

you

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.530 

you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.610 

Oh

you

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:02:18.520 

you

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.059 

I'm<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.790> basic<00:02:20.790> overview<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> delay<00:02:21.690> lab

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
I'm just basic overview of the delay lab

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.150 
I'm just basic overview of the delay lab
as<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.280> could<00:02:23.400> tell<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.670> was<00:02:24.379> phasing<00:02:25.379> putting

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
as you could tell I was phasing putting

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.330 
as you could tell I was phasing putting
in<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.849> expression<00:02:27.330> pedal<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.319> gave<00:02:29.099> me

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
in the expression pedal so it gave me

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.820 
in the expression pedal so it gave me
the<00:02:29.670> heel<00:02:30.030> setting<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:30.690> dry<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.349> then<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
the heel setting was dry and then the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.819 
the heel setting was dry and then the
toe<00:02:32.010> setting<00:02:32.430> would<00:02:32.610> add<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:33.030> more<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.599> my<00:02:34.319> my

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
toe setting would add in more of my my

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.130 
toe setting would add in more of my my
effect<00:02:36.920> next<00:02:37.920> product<00:02:38.220> will<00:02:38.489> be<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.329> hand

wired waa x box kind of a throwback to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.199 
wired waa x box kind of a throwback to
the<00:02:45.209> original<00:02:45.780> wah<00:02:46.049> pedal<00:02:46.790> really<00:02:47.790> warm

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
the original wah pedal really warm

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.400 
the original wah pedal really warm
mid-range<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:50.120> doesn't<00:02:51.120> really<00:02:51.269> squawk<00:02:51.900> as

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
mid-range and doesn't really squawk as

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.550 
mid-range and doesn't really squawk as
much<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.160> high<00:02:53.340> end<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:54.230> check<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.349> guy

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
much on the high end so check this guy

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.150

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:47.780 

really<00:03:38.610> nice<00:03:38.730> range<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:46.460> so<00:03:47.460> here<00:03:47.640> we<00:03:47.760> have

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
really nice range on it so here we have

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.830 
really nice range on it so here we have
the<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.840> AC<00:03:49.110> 1<00:03:49.560> AC<00:03:50.280> for<00:03:50.850> see<00:03:51.390> one<00:03:51.630> in

great<00:04:58.740> recording<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.490> I<00:05:00.470> would<00:05:01.470> say<00:05:01.560> maybe<00:05:01.590> a

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
great recording and I would say maybe a

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
small club with a decent PA and you can

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:28.970 
small club with a decent PA and you can
actually<00:05:05.370> get<00:05:05.640> a<00:05:05.700> little<00:05:06.030> more<00:05:06.150> out<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.390> it

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:36.210 

awesome<00:05:29.980> tone<00:05:30.190> in<00:05:30.370> a<00:05:30.460> small<00:05:30.730> box<00:05:34.950> now<00:05:35.950> we<00:05:36.010> have

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
awesome tone in a small box now we have

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.360 
awesome tone in a small box now we have
the<00:05:36.340> AC<00:05:36.520> for<00:05:37.000> hand<00:05:37.360> wired<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:38.800> obviously<00:05:39.160> it

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
the AC for hand wired and obviously it

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.810 
the AC for hand wired and obviously it
is<00:05:39.490> quite<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.389> few<00:05:41.380> differences<00:05:42.010> obviously<00:05:42.400> the

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
is quite a few differences obviously the

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.390 
is quite a few differences obviously the
size<00:05:43.090> of<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:43.360> box<00:05:43.830> which<00:05:44.830> would<00:05:45.010> allow<00:05:45.220> it<00:05:45.340> to

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
size of the box which would allow it to

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.010 
size of the box which would allow it to
have<00:05:45.610> a<00:05:45.639> 12-inch<00:05:46.650> greenback<00:05:47.650> celestion<00:05:49.020> and

have a 12-inch greenback celestion and

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.230 
have a 12-inch greenback celestion and
in<00:05:50.290> keeping<00:05:50.500> with<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:51.280> style<00:05:51.340> of<00:05:51.850> our<00:05:52.030> hand

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
in keeping with the style of our hand

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.600 
in keeping with the style of our hand
wire<00:05:52.419> two<00:05:52.630> amps<00:05:53.050> obviously<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.590> phone<00:05:53.980> covering

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
wire two amps obviously a phone covering

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.690 
wire two amps obviously a phone covering
and<00:05:55.139> also<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.350> cool<00:05:56.650> hot<00:05:57.040> feature<00:05:59.700> footswitch

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
and also the cool hot feature footswitch

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.960 
and also the cool hot feature footswitch
viable<00:06:01.270> so<00:06:01.600> that<00:06:02.200> adds<00:06:02.440> another<00:06:02.850> part<00:06:03.850> of<00:06:03.910> the

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
viable so that adds another part of the

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.180 
viable so that adds another part of the
12ax7<00:06:04.570> so<00:06:05.080> it<00:06:05.200> gives<00:06:05.320> you<00:06:05.500> a<00:06:05.530> little<00:06:05.680> more<00:06:05.800> gain

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
12ax7 so it gives you a little more gain

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.820 
12ax7 so it gives you a little more gain
it's<00:06:06.910> like<00:06:07.390> almost<00:06:07.600> having<00:06:07.990> like<00:06:08.110> a<00:06:08.140> stomp<00:06:08.560> box

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
it's like almost having like a stomp box

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:42.450 
it's like almost having like a stomp box
pedal<00:06:09.250> so<00:06:10.470> this<00:06:11.470> is<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:11.770> AC<00:06:11.950> for<00:06:12.340> hand<00:06:12.580> wired

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.660 

now<00:06:43.460> with<00:06:43.640> the<00:06:43.760> hot<00:06:43.940> switch<00:06:44.270> engaged
