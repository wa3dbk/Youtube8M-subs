the way up to the pit garage you can
touch<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.570> have<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.750> look<00:03:20.930> at<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.739> cars<00:03:21.980> that

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
touch and have a look at the cars that

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.860 
touch and have a look at the cars that
are<00:03:22.190> racing<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.970> don't<00:03:23.299> get<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.570> at<00:03:23.720> any

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
are racing you don't get that at any

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.240 
are racing you don't get that at any
other<00:03:23.959> motorsport<00:03:24.500> event<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:24.829> I<00:03:24.860> know<00:03:24.980> of

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
other motorsport event that I know of

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.750 
other motorsport event that I know of
and<00:03:25.519> I<00:03:26.829> think<00:03:27.829> that's<00:03:28.010> one<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.459> biggest

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
and I think that's one of the biggest

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.039 
and I think that's one of the biggest
differences<00:03:29.120> between<00:03:29.180> world<00:03:29.780> Time<00:03:29.959> Attack

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
differences between world Time Attack

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.449 
differences between world Time Attack
challenge<00:03:30.530> another<00:03:30.709> mode<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:30.980> support<00:03:31.250> event

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
challenge another mode of support event

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.819 
challenge another mode of support event
ok<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.239> concept<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.720> time<00:03:32.900> attack<00:03:33.170> racing<00:03:33.590> is

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
ok the concept of time attack racing is

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.360 
ok the concept of time attack racing is
simply<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.640> fastest<00:03:35.180> lap<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:37.070> can<00:03:37.220> they

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
simply the fastest lap so you can they

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.030 
simply the fastest lap so you can they
go<00:03:37.519> out<00:03:37.640> for<00:03:37.670> 15<00:03:38.180> minute<00:03:38.450> sessions<00:03:38.739> in<00:03:39.739> which

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
go out for 15 minute sessions in which

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.569 
go out for 15 minute sessions in which
time<00:03:40.310> they<00:03:40.519> have<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.840> time<00:03:42.140> 3<00:03:43.040> sessions<00:03:43.250> per

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
time they have that time 3 sessions per

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.270 
time they have that time 3 sessions per
day<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:44.360> do<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.750> fastest<00:03:45.230> way<00:03:45.380> fastest<00:03:46.100> lap<00:03:46.250> of
