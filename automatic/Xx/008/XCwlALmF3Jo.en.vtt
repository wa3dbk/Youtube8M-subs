00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
you go into system library then you go

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
you go into system library then you go
on<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:08.610> core<00:01:09.610> services<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:12.310> springboard

on to core services then to springboard

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.620 
on to core services then to springboard
then<00:01:14.830> you<00:01:14.950> go<00:01:15.100> scroll<00:01:15.640> all<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.910> way<00:01:16.030> down

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.990 

until<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:21.100> find<00:01:21.810> let<00:01:22.810> me<00:01:23.050> see<00:01:24.490> thing

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.040 

this<00:01:28.000> right<00:01:28.210> here<00:01:28.390> k<00:01:29.050> 48<00:01:29.679> ap<00:01:30.580> it's<00:01:31.179> the<00:01:31.360> only<00:01:31.390> k

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
this right here k 48 ap it's the only k

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.510 
this right here k 48 ap it's the only k
on<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:34.479> page<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.950> shouldn't<00:01:36.190> be<00:01:36.250> hard<00:01:36.399> to

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
on this page so it shouldn't be hard to

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.779 
on this page so it shouldn't be hard to
find<00:01:36.610> in<00:01:36.970> alphabetic<00:01:37.600> order<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.830> once<00:01:39.069> you<00:01:39.610> go

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
find in alphabetic order so once you go

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.580 
find in alphabetic order so once you go
inside<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:41.050> see<00:01:41.229> what<00:01:41.350> capabilities

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
inside and you see what capabilities

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.779 
inside and you see what capabilities
this<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:43.720> what<00:01:44.050> you<00:01:44.200> want<00:01:44.349> to<00:01:44.410> do<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.860> anywhere

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
this now what you want to do is anywhere

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.830 
this now what you want to do is anywhere
in<00:01:46.060> front<00:01:46.509> of<00:01:46.630> true<00:01:47.039> so<00:01:48.039> for<00:01:48.399> example<00:01:48.429> wait<00:01:49.149> tap

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
in front of true so for example wait tap

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.180 
in front of true so for example wait tap
again<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.880> want<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.119> start<00:01:52.300> typing<00:01:52.810> okay<00:01:56.190> wait

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
again you want to start typing okay wait

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.899 
again you want to start typing okay wait
it's<00:01:58.950> kind<00:01:59.950> of<00:02:00.009> difficult<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.700> do<00:02:00.849> this<00:02:01.000> by

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
it's kind of difficult to do this by

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:17.980 
it's kind of difficult to do this by
shoot<00:02:05.490> where<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.640> my

its base it until it reaches the same
thing<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.830> don't<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.220> do<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.490> i<00:03:14.700> mean

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
thing you don't have to do this i mean

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.630 
thing you don't have to do this i mean
just<00:03:15.540> if<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.810> want<00:03:15.960> to<00:03:16.050> make<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.260> look<00:03:16.350> nice

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
just if you want to make it look nice

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.580 
just if you want to make it look nice
and<00:03:17.640> you're<00:03:17.910> done<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.540> save<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.530> then

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and you're done you save it and then

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.160 
and you're done you save it and then
what<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.430> do<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.820> have<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.150> reboot<00:03:22.110> your

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
what you do is you have to reboot your

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.330 
what you do is you have to reboot your
iPad<00:03:24.110> so<00:03:25.110> basically<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.710> turn<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.040> back<00:03:26.190> off

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
iPad so basically just turn it back off

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:35.930 
iPad so basically just turn it back off
and<00:03:26.580> on<00:03:32.360> we'll<00:03:33.360> just<00:03:33.540> wait<00:03:33.690> until<00:03:33.840> them<00:03:34.940> all

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
and on we'll just wait until them all

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.930 
and on we'll just wait until them all
right<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.300> done<00:03:37.070> turn<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.220> back<00:03:38.400> on

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.160 

now<00:03:42.540> i'm<00:03:42.690> assuming<00:03:42.960> that<00:03:43.350> i<00:03:43.940> think<00:03:44.940> like<00:03:45.420> 99<00:03:45.930> to

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
now i'm assuming that i think like 99 to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.360 
now i'm assuming that i think like 99 to
a<00:03:46.200> hundred<00:03:46.500> percent<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.010> already<00:03:47.250> know

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
a hundred percent of you already know

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.420 
a hundred percent of you already know
about<00:03:47.610> jailbreaking<00:03:48.090> stuff<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.160> that's<00:03:50.160> why<00:03:50.400> i

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
about jailbreaking stuff so that's why i

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.950 
about jailbreaking stuff so that's why i
didn't<00:03:50.760> really<00:03:50.850> make<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.090> video<00:03:51.330> on<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.720> since

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
didn't really make a video on this since

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:00.370 
didn't really make a video on this since
the<00:03:52.050> ipad<00:03:52.440> just<00:03:52.650> barely<00:03:52.860> came<00:03:53.070> out<00:03:54.140> just
