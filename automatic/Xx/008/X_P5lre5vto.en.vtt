was<00:03:22.729> a<00:03:22.760> risk<00:03:23.180> but<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.750> think<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.139> works<00:03:24.440> out<00:03:24.650> in

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
was a risk but I think it works out in

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.589 
was a risk but I think it works out in
the<00:03:24.889> end<00:03:24.979> and<00:03:25.430> some<00:03:25.879> of<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.030> beats<00:03:26.209> on<00:03:26.479> this
