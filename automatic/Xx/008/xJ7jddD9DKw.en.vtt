in Oconomowoc we have over 200,000
square<00:00:21.480> feet<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.989> facility<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.980> course<00:00:23.279> we

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
square feet of facility of course we

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.979 
square feet of facility of course we
have<00:00:23.640> our<00:00:23.820> offices<00:00:24.329> where<00:00:24.630> we're<00:00:24.840> doing

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
have our offices where we're doing

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.669 
have our offices where we're doing
customer<00:00:25.890> support<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.750> engineering<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.529> we

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
customer support and engineering but we

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.470 
customer support and engineering but we
also<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.160> all<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> our<00:00:29.550> manufacturing<00:00:29.820> here

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
also have all of our manufacturing here

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.259 
also have all of our manufacturing here
so<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.900> build<00:00:31.169> parts<00:00:31.679> from<00:00:31.859> raw<00:00:32.099> steel<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:33.089> do

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
so we build parts from raw steel we do

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.540 
so we build parts from raw steel we do
cutting<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.260> milling<00:00:34.650> and<00:00:34.890> welding<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
cutting and milling and welding and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.490 
cutting and milling and welding and
grinding<00:00:35.699> and<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.720> it<00:00:36.839> goes<00:00:36.960> over<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.379> our

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
grinding and then it goes over to our

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.860 
grinding and then it goes over to our
assembly<00:00:38.160> plant<00:00:38.460> where<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.210> put<00:00:39.420> our<00:00:39.449> products

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
assembly plant where we put our products

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.080 
assembly plant where we put our products
together<00:00:40.199> so<00:00:40.650> well<00:00:41.309> build<00:00:41.699> our<00:00:41.820> wiring

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
together so well build our wiring

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
together so well build our wiring
harnesses<00:00:42.719> we'll<00:00:42.930> assemble<00:00:43.230> our<00:00:43.500> product<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
harnesses we'll assemble our product and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.400 
harnesses we'll assemble our product and
it'll<00:00:44.309> go<00:00:44.430> through<00:00:44.610> final<00:00:45.090> testing<00:00:45.570> before<00:00:46.110> we

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
it'll go through final testing before we

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.930 
it'll go through final testing before we
package<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.219> ship<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
package it up and ship it out to the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.389 
package it up and ship it out to the
customer<00:00:48.379> well<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:49.739> building<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
customer well here we're building one of

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.510 
customer well here we're building one of
our<00:00:50.870> custom<00:00:51.870> curved<00:00:52.109> rail<00:00:52.350> stair<00:00:52.710> lifts<00:00:53.039> so

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
our custom curved rail stair lifts so

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.520 
our custom curved rail stair lifts so
all<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.760> our<00:00:53.879> curved<00:00:54.210> rail<00:00:54.420> stair<00:00:54.809> lifts<00:00:55.140> are

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
all of our curved rail stair lifts are

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
all of our curved rail stair lifts are
built<00:00:55.890> specifically<00:00:56.609> for<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.600> staircase

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
built specifically for the staircase

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.380 
built specifically for the staircase
that<00:00:58.260> they're<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.769> on<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.640> here<00:00:59.969> he's

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that they're going on so here he's

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.880 
that they're going on so here he's
putting<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.019> pieces<00:01:01.230> together<00:01:01.440> he's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
putting the pieces together he's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.639 
putting the pieces together he's
actually<00:01:02.129> welding<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> grinding<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.470> rail

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
actually welding and grinding the rail

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.700 
actually welding and grinding the rail
system<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.090> we'll<00:01:06.270> take<00:01:06.509> those<00:01:06.710> pictures

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
system and so we'll take those pictures

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.320 
system and so we'll take those pictures
and<00:01:07.740> measurements<00:01:08.039> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> staircase<00:01:09.090> out

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and measurements of the staircase out

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.020 
and measurements of the staircase out
and<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.929> customers<00:01:10.410> home<00:01:10.649> they'll<00:01:11.399> translate

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and the customers home they'll translate

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
and the customers home they'll translate
to<00:01:12.179> our<00:01:12.210> engineering<00:01:12.750> department<00:01:12.840> where

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
to our engineering department where

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.040 
to our engineering department where
we'll<00:01:14.009> lay<00:01:14.250> out<00:01:14.459> their<00:01:14.640> staircase<00:01:15.300> and<00:01:15.630> then

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
we'll lay out their staircase and then

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.990 
we'll lay out their staircase and then
put<00:01:16.289> our<00:01:16.590> rail<00:01:16.830> system<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.369> design<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> rail

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
put our rail system and design a rail

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.419 
put our rail system and design a rail
system<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.959> for<00:01:19.050> that<00:01:19.259> staircase<00:01:19.590> those

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
system just for that staircase those

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:21.830 
system just for that staircase those
drawings<00:01:20.700> will<00:01:20.940> come<00:01:21.090> down<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.569> the<00:01:21.630> shop

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
drawings will come down here to the shop

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.380 
drawings will come down here to the shop
floor<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.410> we'll<00:01:22.920> build<00:01:23.160> that<00:01:23.399> rail<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:24.179> for

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
floor and we'll build that rail just for

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.260 
floor and we'll build that rail just for
that<00:01:24.509> customer<00:01:25.190> but<00:01:26.190> we<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.550> our<00:01:26.580> best<00:01:26.910> to<00:01:27.119> try
