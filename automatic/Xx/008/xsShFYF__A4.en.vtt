00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 in memory of the poor children of 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.649
 ecuador in my country chile at the time of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.599
 the 90s album output was very common 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.000
 and more if it was on the part of the company 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.650
 I leave company which at that time was 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.630
 the vince mcmahon from the albums of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.770
 chromos were excellent quality albums 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.180
 price and prizes for that then 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.220
 unfortunately in my head I thought that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.099
 in the whole world the same thing happened but 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.080
 they know that it was not like that, navigating the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.750
 internet I found that in the country of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 Ecuador about the year 95 is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.829
 released an album of the knights of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.500
 zodiac by a publisher named jp 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.480
 the album was originally just from the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 knights of the zodiac but as 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.440
 they considered that it was not enough 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.350
 massive and pulento put several 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.840
 pages dedicated to power rangers if 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.000
 attack fac for me also in itself the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.280
 story was written again by three 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.289
 pelagatos and a five-year-old boy who 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.930
 perhaps these subnormal did not see the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.910
 series at least they would have put pictures 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.739
 real but some drawings that even my 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.260
 four-year-old nephew paints them better 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.030

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.600

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.319
 by the bronze knights until 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.360
