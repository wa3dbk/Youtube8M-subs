00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.710
 ah 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.190
 Phrase bookstores are overwhelming 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.619
 there are so many books and they are very 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.080
 complete what is not so much is this 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.900
 So Argentinian thing that I love 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.790
 of bookstores with seating tables 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.820
 where one could grab a book and 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.610
 sit down and read it there is no tolerance 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.140
 can sit on the floor the flag is a 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.760
 large chain has some little tables 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.110
 frank general there is no this see 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.100
 books discs and a table to sit 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.100
 ah 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.870
 what happens in Paris bookstores 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.510
 is that 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.149
 such the production of books that 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.519
 news sometimes last a week nothing 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.579
 more the book is exhibited a week 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.320
 the new batch of books and the 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.829
 book is no longer exhibited is already 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.829
 Market Stall 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.980
 with the semi innovations in some shelf 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.870
 and then it disappears or there is no time 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.130
 the criticism comes out and the book is no longer 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.130
 more in the bookstore many times 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.110
 if I had to choose a book that 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.570
 it depends so much on the mood of the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.280
 moment the state is not part of the game 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.280
 of good cheer playing with 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.940
 in some that that law or that by 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.980
 Paris example never ends of life 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.280
 kill him would choose it but to reread 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.280
 for the same as the sling reader that is 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.080
 a book that I loved or do not know there was 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.870
 others that there are here short forms of 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.780
 bible are books that are great books 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.060
 the book I love are just 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.600
 we talked about microfiction and the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600
 short stories 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.420
 these are short or short stories or semi 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.090
 short stories in the palm of your hand 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.619
 like the idea that you can read it 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.619
 they can cover quickly 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.160
 I think he would grab me this 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.160
 I would grab 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.950
 the pentagon of and benedetto that is a 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:30.460
 writer to whom I have not read everything everything 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.230
 that he published but every time I go back to 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.319
 to his work every time they discover a 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.150
 new book 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.189
 I realize that I wanted to say no 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.780
 know when I insisted that I say 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.670
 benedetto was one of the really 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.210
 of Argentine literature or of 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.290
 Literature 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.290
 in Spanish 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.380
 I recently read the financial one that is a 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.140
 novel that also square and something 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.780
 and it is a wonderful book besides 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.540
 different writings and that 's 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.190
 is to be good and different is not easy 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.090
 shortly I will be here as 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.090
 buying things 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.410
 I have to familiarize ourselves 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.410
 tremendously 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.410
 they are questions that I had never asked 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.850
 very thoroughly what is the first book 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.770
 I'm going to give it to my son, I do not know 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.760
 but the little prince is going to give it to him 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.760
 that's clear
