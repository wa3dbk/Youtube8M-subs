 David Jackman dot com 

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.859
 One in high definition we made a promise that we said this week 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.449
 Conversion begins 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.429
 Uh started her ... Hopefully she will be especially painless 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.570
 It may be a bit painful but I have a lot to talk about I want to waste 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.390
 Lewis's time is no longer discussing this hustle happening with high-definition 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.960
 Low definition of any of those things 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.080
 Big news over the weekend and aging Anna seven seven seven seven Boeing 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.480
 Seventy-seven 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.630
 Crashed when landing at San Francisco International Airport and Dei Airport 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.120
 Air in and out several times 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.790
 Uh ... like 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.680
 Logan International Airport Boston Airport in Boston Massachusetts is close to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.060
 Our current studio 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.170
 Uh ... It's an airport that has plenty of water around it 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.870
 As we know now, the next flight from Korea Seoul to San Francisco 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.100
 Was destined for Lowell 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.560
 The next slow down is also flying in and in India 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.940
 In fact falling into the video will look at this video, and it ended up in fact 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.160
 Hit what seems to be landing 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.880
 Maybe on the sea wall 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.050
 Our approach is on 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.760
 The kind of sliding down to the side and onto the runway ended 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.070
 Let's look at the amateur amateur video head that was taken at the site 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.350
 There 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140
 let's go 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.060
 not here 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.600
 All my car or transport 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.260
 All my God is on my God 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.940
 God Almighty 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.990
 God Almighty 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.810
 Well video is so incredible as you can see uh oh ... he just did a lot of 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.010
 Questions about this and 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.280
 And the number one question was this mechanical failure or was this this 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.369
 Air pilot of some kind 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.659
 Our annual report is that nothing was wrong with the plane 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.309
 This does not seem to have been a sort of pilot age now in this particular 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.629
 Crew was not there 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.099
 At the time of landing 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.949
 The pilots are in the cockpit and on our warnings that our aircraft often fly 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.109
 Are flying to slow down on landing 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.989
 So far the real question is 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.529
 Why did not anything do even request a speed increase at a point 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.959
 That time has just missed a lot of questions here Lewis 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.369
 Yeah I mean right off the bat looks like 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.519
 Incompetence coming from the crew 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.469
 But it's hard to say I mean uh ... from the passenger's point of view this should be 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.949
 Be very scary before starting the most terrifying being in in the free fall she knows 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.589
 Thirty thousand feet in the air 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:56.499
 Uh ... you know 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:57.380
 locally 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.040
 It was not as disastrous as you might have been 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.379
 But uh ... yes a lot of questions no doubt about it now uh ... and on that 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.049
 Seventy-seven has a goal landing speed of one hundred and thirty-seven 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.939
 A knot that is one hundred and fifty-seven miles per hour 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.969
 They were much less than that one point for five seconds before there was an effect 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:16.769
 call up 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.729
 For a frustrating drop of course at that point 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:24.859
 It was late for now if you do when you hear seven seven seven incidents 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.289
 I thought a large number of victims 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:28.859
 As we know now 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.989
 The number of injuries including some people who paralyzed rose 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.150
 Only two deaths 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.389
 Some reports say that one of those deaths according to the county investigator 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.200
 It may actually be 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.859
 The victim is run over and killed by the car in an emergency 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.949
 The response to this incident is called secondary accidents 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:57.039
 And again it is incredible that a tragic journey is if true 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.319
 But it also means that only one person was actually killed 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.609
 Of these incidents which may be one of the most surprising aspect of 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.849
 The whole story of Lewis 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.329
 Yes this uh ... 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.349
 Kinda annoying about the emergency car death someone I'm not sure 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.629
 I acted 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.569
 It can happen but uh ... after one death and one of course 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.660
 There was a shame and no one else was in critical condition and this was 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.500
 Uh ... this is very bad so I am even in some cases 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.189
 Um ... that may be better than a situation and some people have been elected yet 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.599
 Incident like this India we are going to keep following the investigation
