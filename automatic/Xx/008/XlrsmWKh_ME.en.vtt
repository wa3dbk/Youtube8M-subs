00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.230
 good afternoon good morning youtube them 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:12.100
 I want to present my detector project 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.170
 of metals based on the colon that 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.320
 as you can see it was drawn from a 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.830
 very economically and the detector is worth 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.380
 worth its construction 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.660
 hollis 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.419
 here we can see the search coil 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.640
 that is made of 30 laps of 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:34.450
 number 22 wire 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.960
 and it consists of roughly a 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.320
 three centimeters are would be ten laps 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.860
 by centimeters 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.860
 and the entire frame was made of pvc 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.010
 each of its breaks was made of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.750
 intentional form 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.750
 so that they have better comfort 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.230
 and be more effective 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.119
 then we have here 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.759
 this part was stuck with what hill 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.600
 he was given enough doors 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.170
 so that it would be well assembled and 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.240
 after to protect it from uvb rays 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.760
 with the same pvc glue l of a 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.410
 layer and as you can see it is very solid 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.410
 the circuit was assembled 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.810
 pvc also for 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.759
 and do it in an easy and light way 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.310
 how can you see 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.030
 here in way 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.600
 It can be used in this way 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.600
 you can see 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.100
 can be used here I have it as 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.800
 icing because it has a balance in 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.470
 the weight now I can use it from this 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.550
 way too 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.550
 how can you see 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.680
 It is perfectly balanced 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.680
 with one finger 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.130
 I do not keep what is 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.040
 sustained 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.370
 this part that comes down from here is so that 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.890
 is not totally rest of the tube and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.430
 provoke vibrations that bother us 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.760
 then with this system we eliminate the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.620
 vibration 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.010
 okay 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.010
 ah 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.329
 the power supply 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.760
 I like to dominate 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.760
 to the back 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.670
 at the moment I have it connected to 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.400
 a return source 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.560
 old pc 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.689
 supposedly this battery was good 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.970
 then this battery lamented in the 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:10.280
 backpack and connected it with this kind of 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.200
 connectors once it works 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.069
 in an example right now we can have a 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.900
 little bit of interference because there's the 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.630
 connected source and logically has 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.350
 noise 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.350
 Turn it on 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.450
 we come to the right frequency 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.450
 we wait 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.400
 a minute or so to be 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.400
 stabilize the frequency 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.170
 this is the thick tuning button here 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.120
 was placed the volume and special 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.020
 final tuning 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.480
 so 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.410
 I do not know if you appreciate good sound up 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.400
 the column we will see 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.400
 we have here 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.290
 in the subway a 20 cent coin 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.069
 we'll see 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.069
 how much is the distance 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.000
 you can see 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.000
 It's pretty good 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.970
 let's use what is a currency 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.460
 How to use the meter for the diameter 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.460
 of the coil 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.880
 the coil walks like a diameter of about 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.880
 18 to 19 centimeters 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.440
 now 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.500
 the breaks were also 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.590
 intentionally made for when 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.249
 we are on a hill not bother us from 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.969
 10 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.969
 we should look 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.400
 and it does not give us problems 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.710
 some kind of 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.710
 annoyance 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.000
 the making 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.470
 can see is totally agile 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.470
 to be circling 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.850
 yes 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.650
 so 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.910
 place myself 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.529
 metal detector and poland 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:23.020
 I have renamed it with thunder is the 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:23.020
 zig zag shape having 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.270
 It is a metal detector that is worth 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.490
 pain 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.490
 thank you very much, a pleasure to introduce yourself
