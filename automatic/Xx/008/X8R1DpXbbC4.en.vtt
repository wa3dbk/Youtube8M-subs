my<00:01:55.229> rendering<00:01:55.649> settings<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.490> i<00:01:56.549> said

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
my rendering settings like i said

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.550 
my rendering settings like i said
probably<00:01:56.969> because<00:01:57.299> i<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> new<00:01:57.840> pc<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.530> i

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
probably because i have a new pc so i

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.130 
probably because i have a new pc so i
gotta<00:01:58.740> adjust<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.820> figure<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.630> what's

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
gotta adjust to it and figure out what's

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.929 
gotta adjust to it and figure out what's
going<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.070> frustrating<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:02.790> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
going on it's frustrating because I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.810 
going on it's frustrating because I
didn't<00:02:03.119> want<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.299> show<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.630> guys<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.469> know

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
it's something that that looks as bad as

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.010 
it's something that that looks as bad as
this<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.700> at<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.820> same<00:02:09.030> time<00:02:09.180> I<00:02:09.240> just<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.630> don't

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
this but at the same time I just I don't

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.770 
this but at the same time I just I don't
know<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.680> mean<00:02:10.860> I'm<00:02:11.100> rendering<00:02:11.430> 720p<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.600> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
know I mean I'm rendering 720p but it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.090 
know I mean I'm rendering 720p but it
looks<00:02:12.990> like<00:02:13.640> 240p<00:02:14.640> or<00:02:14.910> below<00:02:15.450> 360<00:02:16.260> feet<00:02:16.530> you

consequences<00:02:43.830> upgrading<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.640> new<00:02:44.820> pc<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.570> one

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
consequences upgrading a new pc and one

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.460 
consequences upgrading a new pc and one
is<00:02:46.709> not<00:02:47.610> really<00:02:47.820> consequence<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:48.570> i<00:02:48.810> decided

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
is not really consequence but i decided

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.620 
is not really consequence but i decided
to<00:02:49.709> save<00:02:49.920> up<00:02:50.070> for<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.489> rather<00:02:50.940> than<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.209> 3ds

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
to save up for this rather than a 3ds

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.990 
to save up for this rather than a 3ds
capture<00:02:52.200> card<00:02:52.470> which<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:52.980> good<00:02:53.400> idea<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:53.940> me

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
capture card which is good idea for me

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.030 
capture card which is good idea for me
so<00:02:54.390> i<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.480> do<00:02:54.750> everything<00:02:55.050> all<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.680> above

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
so i can do everything all of the above

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.850 
so i can do everything all of the above
rather<00:02:56.400> than<00:02:56.610> 3ds<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.959> know<00:02:58.050> capturing<00:02:58.709> in

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
rather than 3ds you know capturing in

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.850 
rather than 3ds you know capturing in
which<00:02:59.010> i'm<00:02:59.130> doing<00:02:59.430> already<00:02:59.880> with<00:03:00.690> my<00:03:01.020> camera

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440

hopefully you know do the best I can
I've<00:03:06.480> done<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.840> before<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:08.000> that's<00:03:09.000> not<00:03:09.120> really

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
I've done it before so that's not really

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.510 
I've done it before so that's not really
the<00:03:09.420> downside<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.810> big<00:03:10.050> downside<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.770> two<00:03:11.190> games
