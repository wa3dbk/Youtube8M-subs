00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:03.480
 then 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.609
 a project is presented to carry out 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.150
 the guiding of a disorder 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.209
 on a plot 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.739
 this 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:15.549
 it involves a design development installation 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.089
 as much of jaguar as are rooms on an agricultural tractor 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.659
 all as a partner 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.799
 they have been general purpose electronic components 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.770
 On one side 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.090
 an engine has been installed 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.569
 to move the steering wheel 

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:36.420
 through a correct 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.170
 that it has been necessary to install on the front axle and tractor 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.680
 a potentiometer 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.530
 for me 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.650
 at all times the inclination 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 of the rose 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.829
 to be able to count 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.640
 anytime 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 manual against tourists 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 Compton driving 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.720
 by two engines the prison goal 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.230
 acts on the accelerator pedal 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.230
 and on the lever to count them apple 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.010
 through a relay 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.400
 the engine stops 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 and therefore the pact 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.369
 a gps receiver has been installed 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.369
 to know at all times the position and uruguay 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.890
 an electronic compass to have a more precise value course 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.400
 and an accelerometer to know the balance today regarding the show art has been 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.870
 developed an application structured in modules 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.270
 many of these modules where they communicate with each other through their 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 country 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.180
 initially 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.560
 the geometry of the earth's surface must be provided to the system 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.440
 for it 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.729
 the boundaries of the plot are crossed 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.909
 with a bottle that has a GPS receiver and in which a 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.130
 application that we have developed for data acquisition 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.649
 in the case of the child who presents 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.100
 within a large plot the world unlimited buddies 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.589
 the orange color one its plot 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.589
 welfare we will perform spied tone 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:23.789
 then 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.869
 through the trajectory generation application 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:30.919
 we computed the route that the tractor must follow to treat the whole plot 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.190
 in an alternative way 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.849
 if a tractor driver carries out 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.999
 manually an application 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.289
 you can record that trajectory and store it for applications 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:41.119
 later 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.319
 for that year to plots and with that same purpose 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.620
 finally the trajectory is passed to the dialogue module 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.529
 and if the fury of the plot begins 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:54.019
 since actuators have not been installed on the clutch and the lever 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:54.809
 marches 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.969
 It is necessary for a driver to start the deal 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.400
 but once the grass is in motion it can be lowered and the system 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.399
 perform autonomous guidance everywhere 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.009
 it shows on the screen a shot I spoke velocity in which you see that the 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.079
 upset by passing it until you reach the head 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.010
 moment in which it makes a loop and returns leaving an intermediate strip without 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.659
 try 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.659
 that will be worked in a later pass 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.660
 the fact of leaving intermediate fringes and qatar 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.709
 and till later 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.449
 allows us to perform the header rotation in a smaller space 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.829
 as you can appreciate 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.009
 a highly autonomous dialogue is carried out 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.029
 no need for an operator to drive the tractor 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.789
 on the outside of the court 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.049
 the most current art 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.209
 we capture the guiding process from the cabin in transit 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.069
 the speed of response can be observed in a controlled manner 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:22.219
 which is normally able to bring the steering wheel to the desired position in 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:25.219
 tenths of a second 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:34.560
 in the computer 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.259
 who goes aboard the disorder 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.999
 the acting module is running 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.999
 the positioning module and the module d elÃ­a 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.399
 all of them together achieve the autonomous guidance of the tractor by the 

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:49.399
 jail 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.880
 Through the monitoring module you can control the route followed by 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.580
 the tractor remove in the distance 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.749
 this module 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:17.429
 that runs on a computer this was the press everything is communicated at the level 

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:20.749
 physical through webgl listened 102 points at home 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.279
 with the modules that run on the laptop that travel their acts
