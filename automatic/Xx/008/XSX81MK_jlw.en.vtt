00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.700
 hide the noise environment including 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
 esl colleagues when we could 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.600
 see for example the team players 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.950
 ldlc using it is indicated by the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.900
 builder that these little headphones 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.149
 offers a good spatialization of sound 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.350
 like a conventional helmet 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.750

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.810
 nar networks have in the womb 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.399
 as you know I like to put to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.020
 rough test the products that I test 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.120
 to be able to draw an opinion 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.229
 interesting to share the design of the 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.610
 box is really very nice and 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.350
 gives confidence that the product is from 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.330
 good quality including the builder 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.130
 thought to provide us a little box 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.200
 to store headphones and earbuds 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.549
 based on fx base technology 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.049
 networks art allows us to have a sound 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.880
 good quality in games or 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.680
 for music junkies or even 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.030
 during your phone calls 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.430
 it is clear that we have here a 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.750
 multifunction device forward for 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.820

 headphones with the famous technology 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.130
 patented bass and fixed everything is 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.900
 really tidy in the box that 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.880
 the builder took care to design 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.170
 once unpacked we can 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.729
 notice a red color is bright 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.680

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.930
 headphone cable is a flat cable 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.700
 which is very handy because it 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.799
 allows to unravel them very quickly and 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.570
 of course to avoid both more 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.009
 this kind of cables are very resistant 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.189
 usually we have classic at 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.289

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.849
 wheel that adjusts the position 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.530
 of the magnet inside each 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.629
 earpiece this allows us to have two 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.819
 modes are different as explained 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.670
 in the chart on the packaging of 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.860
 weird masses 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.630

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.239
 normal bases a small microphone 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.980
 omnidirectional 360 degree that is 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.989
 thought foremost for gaming which 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.430

 different 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.910

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.340
 we are coming to the end of this video 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.900
 riboud and I think everything is said the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.209

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.420
 nar networks sets the bar a little bit more 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.340

 it's also hygiene that can push back 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.180
 to lend them to others simply and 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.540
 make it a very personal device finally 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.609
