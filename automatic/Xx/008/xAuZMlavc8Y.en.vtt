00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.990
 well we are going to show you how 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.000
 makes the crossing by hand in another 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.309
 side is known as online counter 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.219
 the main thing is to have a good variety 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.180
 comfortable work a good roof container 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.020
 perfectly spotless separate 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.230
 in males 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.450
 we want you to use and the females in this 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.500
 case we are going to use 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:34.510
 anda Mr. Carico knocked out male 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.630
 and a panda aranda 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.030
 an incipient crest but beginning 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.540
 here we have a female purple rank 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.990
 the egg retreat 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:52.270
 they were running for 24 hours 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.160
 they started with the first start of 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.820
 eggs but we want to ensure the 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.890
 greater effectiveness in the course 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.559
 The first thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.170
 delicately take the female we're going to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.200
 take to the tank where we are going to do the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.300
 reproduction 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.790
 we already delicately take the side 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.190
 and we take them up we passed 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.520
 to the tacho and always maintaining the grace 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.740
 inside the water we press lightly and 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.649
 we started doing a massage 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.960
 as there you will notice and start to leave 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.960
 the whole egg chain of the female 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.510
 we are always battling softly 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.300
 from the sides making a slight 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.760
 pressure always keeping the head 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.760
 of the fish in the water to breathe 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.150
 when we consider that you have already taken a 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.150
 good amount of eggs 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.550
 and force a lot we return the female to her 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.640
 container 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.200
 we choose the male we are going to use 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.900
 we also take the mobilized with 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.130
 the hand if we take them and put it 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.130
 on the part of the eggs 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.360
 we make your greeting in focus and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.360
 slightly we also do in same box 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.840
 the tummy massage backwards from the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.439
 two plants and pressing lightly the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.439
 rear 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.430
 today we are making him have the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.430
 sperm in the water 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.300
 always delicately without forcing it 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.630
 letting him drink water 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.150
 right now 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.640
 but we go back to the bin 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.120
 we take the other male who also 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.120
 we want to cross 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.850
 if we perform the same procedure 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.890
 its shaking that it does as well 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.300
 you will see all these shakes there too 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.170
 they serve because it is lengthening 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.170
 my karma 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.860
 always the immersed head 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.790
 if you see there the little line that goes 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.790
 lengthening 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.130
 here we go in this direction down 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.400
 softly I always feel that one with the 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.400
 hand 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.860
 and then we go back to content 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.860
 once effect to this maneuver 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.019
 delicately 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.470
 let's circulate the water in everything 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.470
 the container 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.240
 for a long time 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.410
 and this way we make sure that the 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.850
 most eggs or almost the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.850
 wholeness that makes care 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.480
 sovereignty a simple method is easy is 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.100
 just take a little bit of practice not 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.990
 It has a lot of mystery 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.900
 after this tray is improved with 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.240
 an oxygenating stone to a blue drop of 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.249
 methylene for some fertile egg with the 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.369
 possibility of fungi 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:04.929
 and it is taken to a fish tank where they will be 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:04.929
 conditioning definitions 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:16.409
 good everything 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.179
 I hope you cheer up 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.249
 It's a good way to cross 

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:21.929
 those who really want to have the 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.459
 security that are crossed between them 

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:25.459
 to improve lines 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.229
 nothing else that 's all 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.229
 I hope you enjoyed
