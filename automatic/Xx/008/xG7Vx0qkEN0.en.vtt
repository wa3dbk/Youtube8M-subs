a good thing to do is to set up your

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020 
a good thing to do is to set up your
hand<00:00:52.020> move<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> slowly

no<00:01:09.210> room<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.479> biting<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.740> makes<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
no room for biting and it makes a

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.000 
no room for biting and it makes a
definite<00:01:11.580> cue<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.450> I'm<00:01:12.869> reaching<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.650> for

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.500 
you to the parrot to pick it up and I'm
always<00:01:17.400> doing<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.970> way<00:01:18.030> toward<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
always doing it this way toward the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.510 
always doing it this way toward the
parrot<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.740> becomes<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.400> very

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
parrot not this way so it becomes a very

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.550 
parrot not this way so it becomes a very
standard<00:01:21.030> cue<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.720> parrot<00:01:22.020> doesn't<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.409> any

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
standard cue the parrot doesn't see any

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.469 
standard cue the parrot doesn't see any
other<00:01:22.710> fingers<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.280> grip<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.640> bite<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.420> know

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
just for nipping or playing so this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.120 
just for nipping or playing so this

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
just going to reinforce the nippy nests

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.460 
just going to reinforce the nippy nests
she's<00:03:09.120> not<00:03:09.270> biting<00:03:09.540> she's<00:03:09.900> only<00:03:10.050> nipping

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
she's not biting she's only nipping

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.990 
she's not biting she's only nipping
she's<00:03:10.740> just<00:03:10.950> chewing<00:03:11.310> on<00:03:11.370> my<00:03:11.460> fingers<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:11.910> I'm

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
she's just chewing on my fingers so I'm

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.250 
she's just chewing on my fingers so I'm
like<00:03:12.150> shake<00:03:12.360> her<00:03:12.480> off<00:03:12.510> or<00:03:12.780> something<00:03:13.080> but<00:03:13.200> I'm

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
like shake her off or something but I'm

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.230 
like shake her off or something but I'm
not<00:03:13.320> gonna<00:03:13.620> panic<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.790> start<00:03:15.000> running<00:03:15.180> away

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
not gonna panic and start running away

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.180 
not gonna panic and start running away
because<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.570> only<00:03:15.800> reinforces<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.980> biting

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
because that only reinforces the biting

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.770 
because that only reinforces the biting
and<00:03:17.400> makes<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.640> fight<00:03:17.850> next<00:03:18.090> time<00:03:18.300> even<00:03:18.570> more

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
and makes the fight next time even more

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.320 
and makes the fight next time even more
so<00:03:19.470> once<00:03:19.800> again<00:03:19.950> deliberately<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.030> slowly

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
so once again deliberately and slowly

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.180 
so once again deliberately and slowly
move<00:03:21.630> your<00:03:21.660> finger<00:03:22.020> right<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.380> step<00:03:22.800> up<00:03:22.950> and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
move your finger right in step up and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.980
