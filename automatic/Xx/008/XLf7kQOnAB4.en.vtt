 hello to all and welcome light after 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.670
 h by you are well today we 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.500
 let's study the origin of guira from where he 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.360
 comes from where comes is why he is 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.910
 there in league of legends we are 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.860
 left us erat was designed by volti 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.730
 with rio trudaine and iron russian style 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.170
 vera is expressed by michael mike conway 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.050
 ziraat is one of the most 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.630
 powerful in all valoran he was 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.000
 locked up in a runic prison that 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.010
 prevent him from escaping and having his 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.270
 full power 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.360
 for more information you can 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.550
 go see story 2 and miss there 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.180
 some references between him and will sign 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.360
 because she has the ability and the faculty to 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.310
 and the potential to become divine everything 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.739
 powerful as did spleen however 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.420
 sind rat is severely restricted for the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.040
 moment 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.530
 beard and potentially more powerful 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.430
 that misses however he does not show 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.780
 his power as much as rats 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.299
 when guy ratte dies his body 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.649
 becomes unstable too bright and ends 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.799
 by exploding a little bit like a 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.210
 nuclear propulsion machine 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.939
 the dance 2 and missed known as the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.719
 industrial dance that manifests itself in 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.009
 the song pong lease to 100 fun I you 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.899
 put the link in the description 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.189
 some speculate that was doing rap is 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.109
 ambidextrous and that is to say they 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.179
 use the left hand and the hand 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.280
 right for these different attacks 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.740
 unlike most champions 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.889
 who necessarily use most often 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.650
 the same hand his appearance can be a 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:48.750
 reference to starcraft the archons 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.730
 to finish on his general he may have 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.510
 some reports with doctor xavier 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.300
 missed 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.660
 to simply note x with air and miss 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.570
 so ceyrat this doctor was the one who has 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.140
 given to twisted fate the abilities 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.410
 magic 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.240
 this during an experiment the joke 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.440
 of gerrard refers to Gehenna 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.320
 light night polt 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.430
 I'll read it in the description 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.430
 they also share a quote 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.190
 with a v gard end boss I will you 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.610
 show the true power 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.590
 parra passes and steene the classic skin 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.810
 following a request from the community the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.760
 skin to say so was the classic skin 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.400
 the classic appearance has been reworked 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.750
 twice then interesting things 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.760
 but totally useless when 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.610
 mordekaiser uses his ultimate on guy 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.800
 ratte zerah you die and and he dies 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.200
 he keeps his original color 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.300
 for example if the the original skin the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.130
 ghost skin of desire will be blue then 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.470
 that all the other champions are gray 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.959
 since they are zerrad ghosts 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.690
 convict who can be called also 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.880
 caste battle say he shares this theme 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.300
 with the word cho'gath vergoz victor 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.400
 hugo and skarner the particles of 7.2 this 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.760
 skins are red zerrad from the earth 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.860
 burned 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.360
 it could be a reference to the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.310
 military doctrine of this shed body 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.610
 herth in which all that is judged 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.870
 helpful to the enemy and destroyed his 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.239
 appearance and the army have a 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.860
 resemblance to worse city a species 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.040
 exotic volcanic appearing in the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.800
 fourth round of doctor who 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.680
 he shares this theme with iraq trenton 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.170
 guardian of the sands 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.640
 this skin can represent xz rata 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.799
 fully in his ascent 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.879
 it may also be a reference 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.650
 at this world of warcraft person he 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.980
 share this theme with fiddlestick ramus 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.519
 his carner is almost qs the particles of 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.719
 this skins are gold in color 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.069
