00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.550
 me 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.700
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.700
 Hmm 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.470
 Hmm 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.180
 me 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.170
 I am 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.610
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.630
 Let's break the jerk a little 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.630
 Yes switch on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.210
 Yes it does not take a stranger as there is a certain amount of battery charge now 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.239
 The 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.980
 You notice in this aqua and shift lever 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.850
 It looks like it moves a little with people with a shift lever like an ordinary at car. 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.850
 Or just below 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.339
 That Prius will do it like this with a fingertip 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.420
 It is an a switch, but this is also the contents in fact the switch, but this kind of usual investigation 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.200
 I am an officer 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.910
 I like it well though 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.660
 People who transfer from an ordinary car would handle came discomfort 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:10.990
 If there are a lot of trucks running, it is a road with cheeks 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:14.020
 Born birds comfort is the so-called heavy feel Zushi' as much more feelings passenger cars 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.320
 This may be the biggest feature of Aqua 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.800
 Though not wide enough to rear seat 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.050
 Even if you put some people on it 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.920
 I think this is a car without that rudeness then I turned around now 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.040
 But 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.840
 Of course it is straightforward handling 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:38.170
 It's not like it 's fit, it's reacting like a selfish sparring 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.740
 It 's a type that bends slowly 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.390
 This is not really true today but unfortunately 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.290
 You can see the best from the statistics 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:53.090
 Leaving a margin unlike say the so-called sporty 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:58.710
 It is society that the type that catches the road surface that runs steadily 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:03.200
 Well in that sense I think that the degree of completion as a passenger car is quite high 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.390
 Well then, let's try the highway lightly 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.320
 Hmm 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.539
 Now the engine is 某 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.539
 The sound is made with the king and brother air 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:20.819
 It is not this sporty sound, but I really do not overdo it with enough time 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:24.719
 It is Hagrid's engine that you can only understand well that you are not strong 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.709
 So a kind of evil I'm not just a quiet Gentle 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:32.720
 You can run gtq in 9 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.440
 Its about also there is room in the suspension to cornering the earliest possible 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.450
 It is indeed 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.260
 Truth evil I feel that the universal is thought that I hope When gt is released 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.260
 It's about 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:53.020
 Car in such Fu that kind even though you may be feeling seemed was shaking up and down in the now screen 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:59.050
 The shock that is transmitted even at times is very soft 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:03.330
 That hid the burly key in the back of the upper flexible muscles and soft without'm fluffy 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.330
 It is the softness of the athlete 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:18.300
 I stepped on the accelerator for a moment now 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:23.120
 The motor and the engine worked hard together 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:30.060
 Then it is said that the system output 100 horsepower, but as an actual experience 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:34.150
 The normal gasoline will accelerate almost as good as the 2510 c class car with spin 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.680
 That is not enough for everyday needs 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.110
 Well, it's a very short distance, but let's talk as a sample 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.760
 Just after launching the market 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.360
 The fuel consumption is so far 25.5 k 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.980
 Will he a little that I remember, but I tried to be full acceleration seed 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.470
 Including such things 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.960
 I think it's a pretty good number 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.160
 And Tsu Want better especially look at the fuel economy that appears towards the case of a hybrid to the dashboard 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.120
 High 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.500
 If you say that people will come out by all means in the feeling of seeking a sense of accomplishment 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.590
 So just fuel consumption meter is attached further to It is true that say that fuel economy is improved it 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:18.900
 Because you do not have basically the power it was hybrid vehicles 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.230
 I think it will become easier to drive for the earth more and more 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.070
 Yes 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.810
 Evil of the number one selling is followed up violently 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.110
 Fit hybrid 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:35.020
 How was the law comparison today 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:38.020
 As you listen to my commentary, you struggle to decide which one to listen to, and you can not make up your mind 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.639
 I think whether not it was gone, but of course also it 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.879
 Both are super excellent honors 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:51.930
 How to improve fuel efficiency in the coming era 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:58.129
 It is the main purpose of society how to reduce the emissions of co2 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.129
 It may not be the appropriate choice than to ride in the second floor
