00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.740
 as first stay I wanted 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.770
 show them that in case you have 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.560
 towards the warcraft guru you can do it 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.580
 as more intuitive and do what's best for 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.830
 have a better view of all the 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.230
 map itself then then that you 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.620
 I would recommend is that as first 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.690
 go to where he says I think 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.449
 in resolution with what they will do 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.020
 depending on your monitor at a resolution 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.420
 more or less acceptable 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.790
 this will make them have a better view of 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 all the egg after this you can go 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.810
 the camera interface 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.400
 the distance that moor is put in 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.560
 high 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.130
 this what will allow them will be power 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.130
 do this 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.010
 and so you can see the whole map 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.040
 without so much problem 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.340
 in which the camera is quite far 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.340
 of the character 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.990
 about this for 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 or make quick image changes and that 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.300
 do not miss much the vision 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.330
 it is useful in pf 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.310
 Well, if for some reason they were reached 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.040
 how to work sometimes I recommend them 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.640
 put here the effects put it in 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.820
 low 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.140
 and although they may lose a little 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.470
 details that 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.659
 the warmth and it will make the boulevard more 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.749
 fluid 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.689
 for example 93 fps remains but so 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:07.229
 I'm recording normally I'm going to 40 or 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.229
 fifty 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.090
