00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
there's lots of snow and there and you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.360 
there's lots of snow and there and you
can't<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.780> out<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:18.960> shoot<00:01:19.410> as<00:01:19.680> much<00:01:20.010> as<00:01:20.220> you'd

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
like to and that's where something like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
like to and that's where something like
this<00:01:22.320> will<00:01:22.620> not<00:01:22.740> only<00:01:22.800> keep<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.430> shooting<00:01:23.790> but

colors of the stones that match the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.960 
colors of the stones that match the
tonality<00:01:55.230> of<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.740> elements<00:01:56.730> that<00:01:56.820> I'm

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
tonality of the elements that I'm

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.390 
tonality of the elements that I'm
actually<00:01:57.180> using<00:01:57.540> or<00:01:58.440> that<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.250> use

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
actually using or that I'm going to use

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.000 
actually using or that I'm going to use
in<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.510> photograph<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.560> ultimately

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
in the photograph that we ultimately

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.160 
in the photograph that we ultimately
shoot<00:02:02.400> so<00:02:02.760> what<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.810> want<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.020> pay<00:02:04.140> attention

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
shoot so what you want to pay attention

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.920 
shoot so what you want to pay attention
to<00:02:04.650> are<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.730> density<00:02:06.000> or<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.510> color

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to are the density or the color

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.529 
to are the density or the color
combinations<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.909> know<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.269> going

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
combinations you know when you're going

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.750 
combinations you know when you're going
out<00:02:09.659> and<00:02:09.810> collecting<00:02:09.989> these<00:02:10.470> look<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.430> things

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
out and collecting these look for things

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.030 
out and collecting these look for things
that<00:02:11.940> are<00:02:12.210> actually<00:02:12.390> going<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.780> work<00:02:12.840> together

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
that are actually going to work together

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.550 
that are actually going to work together
from<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.730> tonal<00:02:15.180> standpoint<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.230> color

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
from a tonal standpoint and a color

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.610 
from a tonal standpoint and a color
standpoint<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:18.420> instance<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:18.989> this

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
standpoint so for instance like this

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.710 
standpoint so for instance like this
sprig<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.430> very<00:02:20.640> light<00:02:20.939> where<00:02:21.299> this<00:02:21.540> is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
sprig here is very light where this is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.050 
sprig here is very light where this is
even<00:02:21.989> lighter<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.280> tree<00:02:23.549> limb<00:02:23.790> is

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
even lighter but then the tree limb is

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.720 
even lighter but then the tree limb is
very<00:02:24.599> dark<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.379> you<00:02:25.439> have<00:02:25.650> some<00:02:25.829> contrast

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
very dark so you have some contrast

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.940 
very dark so you have some contrast
levels<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.689> there<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.140> then<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.709> course

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
levels going on there and then of course

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.369 
levels going on there and then of course
we've<00:02:29.159> added<00:02:29.370> some<00:02:29.700> color<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.269> some<00:02:30.379> very

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
we've added some color and some very

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.039 
we've added some color and some very
light<00:02:31.680> items<00:02:32.190> over<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:32.629> that<00:02:33.629> came<00:02:33.810> off<00:02:34.019> of

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
light items over here that came off of

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.660 
light items over here that came off of
different<00:02:34.500> kind<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.739> bush<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.549> just

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
different kind of bush so this is just

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.100 
different kind of bush so this is just
giving<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> an<00:02:36.150> illustration<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
giving you an illustration of the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.839 
giving you an illustration of the
materials<00:02:37.590> we're<00:02:37.709> going<00:02:37.829> to<00:02:37.920> use<00:02:38.099> today<00:02:38.280> okay

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
materials we're going to use today okay

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.440 
materials we're going to use today okay
we<00:02:39.120> are<00:02:39.450> actually<00:02:39.900> setting<00:02:40.319> up<00:02:40.620> our

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
we are actually setting up our

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.520 
we are actually setting up our
background<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.750> we're<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.989> be<00:02:43.140> using

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
background that we're going to be using

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.099 
background that we're going to be using
for<00:02:43.560> our<00:02:43.859> first<00:02:44.159> shot<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.849> what<00:02:45.629> I've<00:02:45.750> done<00:02:45.900> is

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
for our first shot and what I've done is

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.190 
for our first shot and what I've done is
basically<00:02:46.319> just<00:02:46.819> lay<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:48.090> canvas<00:02:48.720> down<00:02:48.900> here

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
basically just lay a canvas down here

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.349 
basically just lay a canvas down here
and<00:02:49.319> I'll<00:02:49.379> actually<00:02:49.709> crunch<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.609> canvas<00:02:51.150> up

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
and I'll actually crunch that canvas up

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.440 
and I'll actually crunch that canvas up
so<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.780> could<00:02:51.959> get<00:02:52.109> all<00:02:52.260> these<00:02:52.530> lines<00:02:52.889> and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
so that I could get all these lines and

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.180 
so that I could get all these lines and
all<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.720> these<00:02:54.840> interesting<00:02:55.349> shadows<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.010> so

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
all of these interesting shadows and so

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.399 
all of these interesting shadows and so
on<00:02:56.430> now<00:02:56.819> our<00:02:57.150> background<00:02:57.659> obviously<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.349> a

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
on now our background obviously in a

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.710 
on now our background obviously in a
still<00:02:58.680> life<00:02:58.889> is<00:02:59.700> pretty<00:02:59.970> important<00:03:00.599> because

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
still life is pretty important because

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.199 
still life is pretty important because
if<00:03:01.620> you're<00:03:01.889> going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.099> use<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.519> as<00:03:02.639> part<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
if you're going to use it as part of the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.660 
if you're going to use it as part of the
image<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.750> not<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.319> static<00:03:04.620> color<00:03:05.310> or

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
image and not just a static color or

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.960 
image and not just a static color or
tonality<00:03:06.829> you<00:03:07.829> want<00:03:08.129> it<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.280> become<00:03:08.579> part<00:03:08.879> of

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
tonality you want it to become part of

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.399 
tonality you want it to become part of
the<00:03:09.060> photograph<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.959> first<00:03:10.170> thing<00:03:10.379> that

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
the photograph so the first thing that

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.869 
the photograph so the first thing that
we<00:03:10.680> want<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:10.920> do<00:03:11.069> is<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.549> want<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.760> start

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
we want to do is we want to start

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.050 
we want to do is we want to start
bringing<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:12.629> our<00:03:12.810> elements<00:03:13.769> into<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.819> shot

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
bringing in our elements into the shot

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.119 
bringing in our elements into the shot
and<00:03:15.329> I'm<00:03:15.930> just<00:03:16.200> going<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.349> basically<00:03:16.530> start

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
and I'm just going to basically start

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.009 
and I'm just going to basically start
laying<00:03:17.340> some<00:03:17.639> things<00:03:17.909> into<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.419> shot<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.989> that

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
laying some things into the shot so that

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.409 
laying some things into the shot so that
you<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.440> see<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:20.819> elements<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.269> we're

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
you can see the elements that we're

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.900 
you can see the elements that we're
going<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.599> initially<00:03:21.840> use<00:03:22.340> now<00:03:23.340> what<00:03:23.819> I'm

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
going to initially use now what I'm

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.360 
going to initially use now what I'm
going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.150> try<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.389> do<00:03:24.660> at<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.049> point<00:03:25.169> is<00:03:25.769> look

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
going to try to do at this point is look

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.900 
going to try to do at this point is look
at<00:03:26.750> not<00:03:27.750> only<00:03:27.780> tonality<00:03:28.199> but<00:03:28.769> color<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.310> want<00:03:29.819> to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
at not only tonality but color I want to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.849 
at not only tonality but color I want to
look<00:03:30.090> at<00:03:30.239> all<00:03:30.449> the<00:03:30.690> different<00:03:31.139> things<00:03:31.199> that<00:03:31.680> I

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
look at all the different things that I

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.210 
look at all the different things that I
can<00:03:31.919> use<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.970> make<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.389> shot<00:03:33.769> interesting<00:03:34.769> so

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
can use to make this shot interesting so

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.009 
can use to make this shot interesting so
I'm<00:03:35.609> going<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.000> find<00:03:36.239> different<00:03:36.569> ways<00:03:36.840> to

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
I'm going to find different ways to

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.809 
I'm going to find different ways to
place<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.859> now<00:03:38.069> we're<00:03:38.250> not<00:03:38.400> going<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.609> do<00:03:38.699> the

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
place this now we're not going to do the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.400 
place this now we're not going to do the
final<00:03:39.030> composition<00:03:39.540> right<00:03:39.989> at<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.230> moment

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
final composition right at the moment

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.640 
final composition right at the moment
but<00:03:40.739> what<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> want<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.669> show<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:41.940> are<00:03:42.650> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
but what I want to show you are the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.869 
but what I want to show you are the
different<00:03:44.040> elements<00:03:44.250> I'm<00:03:44.459> going<00:03:44.609> to<00:03:44.669> actually

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
different elements I'm going to actually

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.970 
different elements I'm going to actually
try<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:45.359> use<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.989> shot<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.590> may<00:03:46.739> add

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
try to use in the shot and I may add

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.430 
try to use in the shot and I may add
other<00:03:47.340> things<00:03:47.669> too<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.299> idea<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.139> just

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
other things too the idea here is just

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.710 
other things too the idea here is just
to<00:03:49.769> illustrate<00:03:50.370> what<00:03:50.940> we're<00:03:51.120> choosing<00:03:51.569> and

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
to illustrate what we're choosing and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.629 
to illustrate what we're choosing and
how<00:03:51.870> we're<00:03:52.079> choosing<00:03:52.349> it<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.799> why<00:03:53.400> we're

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
how we're choosing it and why we're

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.759 
how we're choosing it and why we're
choosing<00:03:53.879> I<00:03:54.239> mean<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.780> whole<00:03:54.959> idea<00:03:54.989> here<00:03:55.680> is

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
choosing I mean the whole idea here is

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.680 
choosing I mean the whole idea here is
to<00:03:55.799> get<00:03:56.010> an<00:03:56.160> interesting<00:03:56.489> composition<00:03:57.090> going

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
to get an interesting composition going

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.619 
to get an interesting composition going
so<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.230> can<00:03:58.409> create<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:59.129> pleasing<00:04:00.120> image

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
so that you can create a pleasing image

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.809 
so that you can create a pleasing image
now<00:04:00.870> let's<00:04:01.709> talk<00:04:01.889> about<00:04:02.190> lighting<00:04:02.459> for<00:04:02.609> a

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
now let's talk about lighting for a

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.550 
now let's talk about lighting for a
second<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.690> lighting<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.109> we're<00:04:04.379> actually

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
second the lighting that we're actually

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.589 
second the lighting that we're actually
using<00:04:04.919> here<00:04:05.280> is<00:04:05.400> simply<00:04:05.940> light<00:04:06.239> coming

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
using here is simply light coming

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.599 
using here is simply light coming
through<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.810> door<00:04:07.169> that<00:04:07.470> goes<00:04:07.980> out<00:04:08.190> onto<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
through a door that goes out onto the

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.059 
through a door that goes out onto the
deck<00:04:08.790> now<00:04:09.480> it's<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.840> really<00:04:10.169> nice<00:04:10.379> side<00:04:10.799> light

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
deck now it's a really nice side light

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.280 
deck now it's a really nice side light
as<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.340> can<00:04:11.489> see<00:04:11.729> it's<00:04:12.180> really<00:04:12.510> soft<00:04:12.930> it's

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
as you can see it's really soft it's

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.770 
as you can see it's really soft it's
like<00:04:13.379> a<00:04:13.470> big<00:04:13.709> soft<00:04:14.010> box<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:15.359> have<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.540> nice

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
like a big soft box and you have a nice

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.899 
like a big soft box and you have a nice
shadow<00:04:16.139> line<00:04:16.500> here<00:04:16.799> what<00:04:17.370> we<00:04:17.489> want<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.729> be<00:04:17.820> able

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
shadow line here what we want to be able

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.000 
shadow line here what we want to be able
to<00:04:18.060> do<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.359> still<00:04:18.630> see<00:04:18.870> detail<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:19.440> our<00:04:19.530> shadows

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
to do is still see detail in our shadows

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.879 
to do is still see detail in our shadows
here<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.699> we're<00:04:21.269> going<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.479> focus<00:04:21.750> on<00:04:22.139> making

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
here so we're going to focus on making

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.670 
here so we're going to focus on making
sure<00:04:23.099> that<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.789> light<00:04:24.090> stays<00:04:24.960> consistent

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
sure that that light stays consistent

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.220 
sure that that light stays consistent
across

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
across

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.290 
across
image<00:04:26.500> now<00:04:26.680> we<00:04:26.740> may<00:04:27.070> have<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.460> come<00:04:27.700> in<00:04:28.030> because

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
image now we may have to come in because

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.420 
image now we may have to come in because
of<00:04:28.660> exposure<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.350> actually<00:04:30.100> block<00:04:30.400> that

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
of exposure and actually block that

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.940 
of exposure and actually block that
light<00:04:30.850> down<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.180> little<00:04:31.420> bit<00:04:31.660> by<00:04:32.200> dropping<00:04:32.860> a

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
light down a little bit by dropping a

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.860 
light down a little bit by dropping a
card<00:04:33.280> or<00:04:33.610> something<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.300> nature<00:04:34.450> in

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
card or something of that nature in

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.810 
card or something of that nature in
front<00:04:35.200> of<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.380> light<00:04:35.590> just<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.520> kind<00:04:36.760> of

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
front of the light just to kind of

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.730 
front of the light just to kind of
soften<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.420> and<00:04:37.630> direct<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.260> light<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.620> way

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
soften it and direct the light the way

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.680 
soften it and direct the light the way
we<00:04:38.890> want<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:41.340> okay<00:04:42.340> what<00:04:42.820> I'm<00:04:42.910> using<00:04:43.180> here<00:04:43.330> is<00:04:43.660> a

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
we want it okay what I'm using here is a

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.530 
we want it okay what I'm using here is a
pair<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.080> tweezers<00:04:44.550> once<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.670> get<00:04:45.880> your<00:04:46.090> your

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
pair of tweezers once you get your your

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.080 
pair of tweezers once you get your your
still-life<00:04:47.110> set<00:04:47.440> up<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:48.310> can<00:04:48.490> basically<00:04:48.700> use

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
still-life set up you can basically use

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.970 
still-life set up you can basically use
the<00:04:49.300> tweezers<00:04:49.540> just<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:50.230> move<00:04:50.410> things<00:04:50.770> around

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
the tweezers just to move things around

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.130 
the tweezers just to move things around
so<00:04:51.430> if<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.670> just<00:04:51.850> need<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.210> tweak<00:04:52.540> something<00:04:52.930> a

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
so if you just need to tweak something a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.920 
so if you just need to tweak something a
little<00:04:53.350> bit<00:04:53.530> or<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.850> know<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.540> know<00:04:55.630> pull

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
little bit or you know you know pull

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.810 
little bit or you know you know pull
something<00:04:56.380> in<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:57.070> can<00:04:57.250> do<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:57.520> with<00:04:57.700> the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
something in you can do it with the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.520 
something in you can do it with the
tweezers<00:04:58.300> rather<00:04:58.540> than<00:04:58.750> your<00:04:58.870> fingers<00:04:59.320> and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
tweezers rather than your fingers and

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.680 
tweezers rather than your fingers and
that'll<00:05:00.430> allow<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.730> to<00:05:00.910> fine-tune<00:05:01.660> the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
that'll allow you to fine-tune the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.200 
that'll allow you to fine-tune the
composition<00:05:02.650> as<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.460> go<00:05:03.640> through<00:05:04.030> the

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
composition as you go through the

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.460 
composition as you go through the
process<00:05:04.780> of<00:05:04.960> actually<00:05:05.170> building<00:05:05.890> your<00:05:06.100> shot

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
process of actually building your shot

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.530 
process of actually building your shot
the<00:05:08.470> next<00:05:08.620> four<00:05:08.920> images<00:05:09.460> represent<00:05:10.180> the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
the next four images represent the

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.180 
the next four images represent the
images<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:10.990> we<00:05:11.200> created<00:05:11.740> using<00:05:11.920> the

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
images that we created using the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.950 
images that we created using the
elements<00:05:12.760> that<00:05:12.880> we<00:05:13.030> had<00:05:13.150> chosen<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:13.840> the

elements that we had chosen and the
backgrounds<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.800> we<00:05:14.950> chose<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.930> few<00:05:16.930> things

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140
