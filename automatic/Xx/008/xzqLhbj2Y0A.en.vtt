back<00:01:23.240> when<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.570> went<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.110> high<00:01:24.259> school<00:01:24.290> here<00:01:24.860> in

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
back when I went to high school here in

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.859 
back when I went to high school here in
92<00:01:26.930> 93<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.770> used<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.759> go<00:01:28.909> practice<00:01:29.180> to<00:01:29.570> three

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
92 93 I used to go practice to three

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.920 
92 93 I used to go practice to three
hours<00:01:30.200> football<00:01:30.650> every<00:01:31.009> day<00:01:31.130> on<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.460> grass

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
hours football every day on this grass

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.410 
hours football every day on this grass
so<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.259> is<00:01:33.409> quite<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.680> fun<00:01:34.460> side<00:01:34.759> to<00:01:35.000> see<00:01:35.180> again

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
so this is quite a fun side to see again

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.850 
so this is quite a fun side to see again
I<00:01:36.040> remember<00:01:37.040> it<00:01:37.130> as<00:01:37.250> being<00:01:37.280> much<00:01:37.759> bigger<00:01:38.860> well

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
I remember it as being much bigger well

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.260 
I remember it as being much bigger well
I<00:01:39.920> guess<00:01:40.070> everything<00:01:40.430> was<00:01:40.700> bigger<00:01:41.000> when<00:01:41.149> you

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
I guess everything was bigger when you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.050 
I guess everything was bigger when you
were<00:01:41.390> smaller<00:01:42.100> well<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:43.220> remember<00:01:43.640> sitting<00:01:43.820> an

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
were smaller well I remember sitting an

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.499 
were smaller well I remember sitting an
account<00:01:44.329> right<00:01:45.140> here<00:01:45.560> on<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:45.920> parking<00:01:46.310> lot

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
account right here on this parking lot

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.880 
account right here on this parking lot
with<00:01:47.509> tears<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.840> my<00:01:47.960> eyes<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.439> last<00:01:48.649> day<00:01:48.860> of

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890

with tears in my eyes the last day of
football<00:01:49.310> practice<00:01:49.970> because<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.450> knew<00:01:50.719> it

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
football practice because I knew it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.050 
football practice because I knew it

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.780
