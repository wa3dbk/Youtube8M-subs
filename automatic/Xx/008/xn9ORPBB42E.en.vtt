the nice thing is is it sits in the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.400 
the nice thing is is it sits in the
periphery<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.270> said<00:02:54.330> I'm<00:02:54.660> right<00:02:55.290> now

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
periphery but as I said I'm right now

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.300 
periphery but as I said I'm right now
running<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.250> automatic<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:58.890> course<00:02:59.100> there<00:02:59.250> are

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
running in automatic of course there are

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.280 
running in automatic of course there are
tons<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.520> options<00:02:59.640> in<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.120> game<00:03:00.300> yes<00:03:01.080> this

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
tons of options in the game yes this

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.990 
tons of options in the game yes this
video<00:03:01.620> isn't<00:03:01.860> necessarily<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.670> about<00:03:02.850> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
video isn't necessarily just about the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.140 
video isn't necessarily just about the
game<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.390> it's<00:03:03.540> about<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.990> entire<00:03:05.150> eyefinity

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
game but it's about the entire eyefinity

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.740 
game but it's about the entire eyefinity
setup<00:03:10.790> seriously<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.210> three

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
setup seriously like this is three

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.230

screens but the operating system and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.570 
screens but the operating system and
specifically<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.990> game<00:03:16.230> sees<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.860> as<00:03:16.980> one

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
specifically this game sees it as one

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.510 
specifically this game sees it as one
screen<00:03:18.030> eight<00:03:18.270> single<00:03:19.050> large<00:03:19.260> surface<00:03:22.520> sorry

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
nice thing is that eyefinity works with

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.390 
nice thing is that eyefinity works with
a<00:03:31.200> variety<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.710> games<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.160> course
