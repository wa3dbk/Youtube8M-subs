00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.100 

right<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:31.670> if<00:00:31.910> you<00:00:32.060> have<00:00:32.240> the<00:00:32.390> polarizing

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
right so if you have the polarizing

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.260 
right so if you have the polarizing
filter<00:00:33.560> and<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:33.980> try<00:00:34.430> flipping<00:00:34.670> in<00:00:34.970> the<00:00:35.060> Sun

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
filter and the try flipping in the Sun

00:00:35.270 --> 00:01:14.370 
filter and the try flipping in the Sun
with<00:00:35.510> you

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.279 

here<00:01:15.380> we<00:01:15.470> see<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.829> filter<00:01:16.189> going<00:01:16.399> over

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289

this<00:01:23.289> is<00:01:23.499> Houston<00:01:24.039> looks<00:01:24.399> like<00:01:24.549> we<00:01:24.729> have<00:01:24.850> too

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
this is Houston looks like we have too

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.120 
this is Houston looks like we have too
much<00:01:25.210> light<00:01:25.539> the<00:01:26.109> polarizing<00:01:26.740> filters

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
much light the polarizing filters

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.349 
much light the polarizing filters
doesn't<00:01:27.609> help<00:01:27.789> Bunch

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
doesn't help Bunch

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:57.450 
doesn't help Bunch
go<00:01:28.539> ahead<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:28.929> remove<00:01:29.079> it<00:01:29.350> again

picture still about the same though it's

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.500 
picture still about the same though it's
the<00:04:15.190> terrain<00:04:15.610> pretty<00:04:15.909> bright<00:04:16.180> we're<00:04:16.389> not

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
the terrain pretty bright we're not

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.879 
the terrain pretty bright we're not
getting<00:04:16.810> much<00:04:16.930> definition<00:04:17.530> at<00:04:17.650> all

this picture now is much better I guess

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.570 
this picture now is much better I guess
the<00:04:34.939> light<00:04:35.119> levels<00:04:35.479> are<00:04:35.629> decreasing<00:04:36.019> now

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580
