00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.450 

you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.850 

and<00:02:37.000> if<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.300> think<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:37.750> hard<00:02:38.110> wait<00:02:38.530> so

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
and if you think this is hard wait so

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.270 
and if you think this is hard wait so
later<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:40.090> only<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.660> get<00:02:40.780> hard<00:02:41.280> trust

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
later it's only going to get hard trust

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.530 
later it's only going to get hard trust
me<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.550> our<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:44.520> hate<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.700> say<00:02:45.910> those<00:02:46.180> kind<00:02:46.480> of

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
me on our I hate to say those kind of

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.120 
me on our I hate to say those kind of
things<00:02:46.690> but<00:02:46.930> that's<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.200> truth<00:02:49.470> big<00:02:50.470> piece<00:02:51.100> of

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
things but that's the truth big piece of

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:06.230 
things but that's the truth big piece of
uh<00:02:56.160> huh<00:02:57.160> one<00:02:57.550> more<00:02:57.670> time

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.800 

I<00:03:07.490> really<00:03:08.490> thought<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.880> volcano<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.390> really

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
I really thought the volcano is really

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.380 
I really thought the volcano is really
the<00:03:09.930> hardest<00:03:10.140> part<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.890> sea<00:03:11.550> levels<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.090> kind

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
the hardest part the sea levels I kind

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.390 
the hardest part the sea levels I kind
of<00:03:12.450> go<00:03:12.600> through<00:03:12.630> fairly<00:03:13.260> easily<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:15.390> ghost

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
of go through fairly easily the ghost

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.030 
of go through fairly easily the ghost
island<00:03:17.400> ghost<00:03:18.060> island<00:03:18.470> it's<00:03:19.470> kind<00:03:19.740> of<00:03:19.800> tough

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
island ghost island it's kind of tough

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.900 
island ghost island it's kind of tough
kind<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:21.000> i<00:03:21.240> say<00:03:23.420> down<00:03:25.460> it's<00:03:26.460> kind<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.730> tough

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
kind of i say down it's kind of tough

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.580 
kind of i say down it's kind of tough
but<00:03:27.740> especially<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.100> third<00:03:29.370> level<00:03:30.350> why<00:03:31.350> don't

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
but especially the third level why don't

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.020 
but especially the third level why don't
you<00:03:31.680> think<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:31.980> book<00:03:32.160> could<00:03:32.340> volcano<00:03:32.940> is

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
you think the book could volcano is

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.420 
you think the book could volcano is
really<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.360> hardest<00:03:33.600> or<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.950> fact<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.310> i

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
really the hardest or the fact that i

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.620 
really the hardest or the fact that i
got<00:03:35.550> gave<00:03:35.850> over<00:03:36.060> aero-subs<00:03:37.190> every<00:03:38.190> sucks

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.660 

hey

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.200 

the<00:03:48.670> vulnerability

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:07.300 

it<00:03:53.720> all<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:53.960> let's<00:03:54.140> just<00:03:54.260> walk

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:24.879

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:05:14.040 

I<00:04:38.990> need<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.110> switch<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.560> move<00:04:40.710> on<00:04:40.920> that

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:23.780 

well<00:05:14.680> how<00:05:14.800> about<00:05:14.889> that

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:38.270 

no<00:05:25.580> stop<00:05:26.580> switch<00:05:28.310> that's<00:05:29.310> okay

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.030 

look<00:05:39.060> so
