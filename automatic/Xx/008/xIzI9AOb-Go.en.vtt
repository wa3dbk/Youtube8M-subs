 result of the project of this apartment 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.860
 that what was to be a residence of

 weekend beach is now the house 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.420

 medeiros now accompany the mission case 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.520
 i 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.330
 the apartment initially for the end of 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.340
 week and vacation that would be a couple more 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.259
 two children studying outside only 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.850
 would be only temporarily 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.179
 periods here in the apartment 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.729
 the project was in such a way that they 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.490
 They liked it so much that they ended up wanting 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.039
 stay and really decide to live here for 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.690
 it is not that they lived before 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.119
 It was also flat as it was 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.500
 transition is an apartment practically 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.899
 the same size as this one in coconut palms and 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.060
 he felt the need for even space 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.110
 to accommodate the personal things that the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.750
 apartment that lacked space pro day to 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.880
 their day then the essence of this 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.450
 apartment was the carpentry as well 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.450
 planned 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.000
 a film a requirements of the documentary 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.219
 because you already have a long experience of 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.280
 change was not this is the first and 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.549
 second apartment of the couple 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.260
 so with this she already had some 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:34.189
 experiences she knew she needed 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.049
 that it would not be necessary, then the schemes 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.959
 of the cabinet kitchen that has serious 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.329
 cabinet high cabinet low what could 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.730
 being called the kitchen mirror was a 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.739
 great discussion even about what I 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.019
 I wanted to bring this line more horizontally 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.730
 lower is a trend and enjoy 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.159
 I will not do higher said no 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.769
 Let's do it in such a way that you will see that 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.150
 with the same closet that I'm subject to 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.280
 will be able to accommodate in the same way 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:05.629
 that you have in the other apartment and really 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:07.549
 happened the great marking of the 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.260
 room apartment really in that 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.909
 property here right 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.980
 an apartment that did not have large 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.970
 structural modifications or 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.810
 finishing 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.430
 we wanted to make faster 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.530
 and succinctly possible 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.389
 the great modification that was 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.819
 part of one of a wall that existed 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.579
 between the living room and the kitchen that 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.169
 integrated more partially to people 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.109
 increased this opening of the 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:35.870
 wall to stay more integrated and 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.979
 with this win no room for a 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.019
 create a shipyard that is 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:41.690
 behind me this Thursday has a 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.290
 double bottom that does not give the kitchen and 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.030
 to save 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.919
 this was possible with the withdrawal of 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.139
 kitchen wall large balcony is here 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:52.280
 that it is important to note that the marking 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:56.540
 comes from the lobby a makes ones and here 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.879
 and descend all with the same material will have 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.299
 finally there with that is an islamic one 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.609
 that looks this way more 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.560
 only a natural gray color comes in 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.919
 my victory has no texture 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.949
 most natural experiment only is an fpf 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:16.759
 wood tone close ups appear prominently 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:18.970
 on the property is in bright lacquer and in blue 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.409
 Punctuated turquoise in the garden city 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.739
 contrasting the woody tones of 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.739
 blades 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.160
 the project modified only one of the 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.320
 finishes delivered by the builder 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.090
 exactly this made all the difference in 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.280
 integrated social area 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.639
 We went to a finished shop 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.680
 that this pottery and was delighted 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.860
 had everything to do with this fashion thing 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.650
 this mixture almost a nebben patchwork 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.840
 and I think it came in very well. 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.000
 with this one from the kitchen and gave 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.820
 special highlight for her is because 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.940
 the fully integrated convincing as 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.849
 is she who becomes more sophisticated in 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.660
 choice of equipment finishes 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.160
 also ne 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.139
 why it is very integrated and 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.970
 in who's here is cool right 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.039
 It has been a while that we repeated the 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.530
 top door with mirror the mirror 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.000
 Do not smoke, we have other parts here. 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.610
 of the room we repeated normal upper 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.130
 the kitchen also the entrance also 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.710
 referring to the question of finishing 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.510
 of the coating in this case, né 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.610
 also since the impact as soon as I opened the 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.889
 more of a nature element that 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.960
 on the beach so work with color 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.440
 yellow color that is a predominant color 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.750
 in the room but December 10 leaves one 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.810
 thing more organic I think that 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.479
 closed well with with is the element 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.099
 surprise at the entrance and then complete 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.199
 with the rest of Sunday 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.560
 the floor plan of the apartment was modified 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.570
 to meet the couple's need 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.789
 corridor of the intimate area mino agent 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.099
 of the history of the rooms that became a 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.800
 home office closet and we managed to 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.880
 make a pilgrimage to me the 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.440
 apartment that we can do 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.690
 a clothes and it makes all the difference 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.699
 the housewife is not the dream that gives 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.650
 the great majority then stayed a pilgrimage 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.870
 that are mirror doors of 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.830
 running but they accommodate a good part of 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.080
 house service 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.710
 in the suite of the couple that we presume 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.020
 a nice bed the cool space to 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.120
 She and we are looking at the bed then because 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.490
 there existed the dressing room the closet 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.080
 with a home office when they want 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.080
 work at home have enough space 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:46.490
 the kids room also had it was more 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:48.680
 them as children who come from 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.869
 At the end of the week, we mean 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.490
 a space for them that likes videogame 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:57.139
 movie and a bed a large bed and more 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.599
 an aid to be able to use them in the 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:01.789
 same space 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:04.249
 the balcony was closed with glass for the 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:06.680
 better use of space for me 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:08.930
 the good idea is the two high benches 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.009
 which serve as a support in serving the 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.279
 barbecue 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:15.469
 thank you right who was doing time that 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:19.059
 people did not record here in the program 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:19.059
 Congratulations to the project 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:36.110
 how to use colors in the same environment 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.600
 is the doubt of a consumer and will be 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:42.760
 answered after the break and see 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.760
