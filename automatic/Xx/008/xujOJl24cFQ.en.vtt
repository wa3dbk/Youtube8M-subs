00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 I had these rose-shaped cookies 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.139
 seen a while ago wandering around 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.990
 internet and I immediately liked them and there 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.150
 made a lady that not only does 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.770
 these cookies but do other things 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 wonderful 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.769
 and in any case I put the link in the box 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.880
 information so you can go to 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.740
 to watch 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.119
 she did that color biscuits 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.340
 different 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.949
 but I liked these colors a little 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.350
 more spring and I hope you like them 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.469
 you too 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:42.030
 in a bowl we work 200 g of butter 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.520
 and 100 grams of granulated sugar until 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.329
 when we obtain a homogeneous compound e 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.329
 frothy 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.770
 we also add a new one 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:06.080
 half a teaspoon of vanillin and per 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.080
 finish between 100 g of double-zero flour 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.840
 we divide the braided compound lines 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.930
 and then we go to color with dyes 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.810
 food in gel or those in 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.380
 dust we take some baking paper 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.610
 of the size of our pan 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.150
 we draw circles with a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.040
 tagliapasta couple giamo the sheet in 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.990
 so that the circles are seen there 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.479
 same, however, the pencil and on the other side 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.479
 to get the cookies in the shape of a rose 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.050
 the spout we need is this one 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.990
 here to a star shape from not 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.020
 get confused with this because it is always 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.210
 in a sense, however, star is not 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.070
 they would come in the same way 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.070
 start from the center 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.870
 and slowly slowly 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.090
 in this way and now we go to them 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.890
 put in the oven at 180 degrees for about 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.650
 a 10 minutes when the cookies are 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.690
 ready and cooled you can fill 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.630
 with very good cream 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.470
 I stuffed them with some cream 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.410
 mascarpone cheese 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.790
 but of course you can also put the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.120
 nutella chocolate nose and if you want 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.300
 even ice cream maybe on the most days 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.300
 hot
