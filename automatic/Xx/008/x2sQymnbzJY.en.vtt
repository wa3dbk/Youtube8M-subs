00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.770 
it in fact one stripe on each side
and<00:02:45.590> that's<00:02:46.190> pretty<00:02:46.400> much<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.640> for<00:02:46.790> colors<00:02:47.300> it

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
and that's pretty much it for colors it

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.600 
and that's pretty much it for colors it
does<00:02:47.990> have<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.230> couple<00:02:48.560> moving<00:02:48.710> parts<00:02:49.070> mostly

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
does have a couple moving parts mostly

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.630 
does have a couple moving parts mostly
for<00:02:49.850> transformation<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:51.650> can<00:02:51.830> open<00:02:52.460> this

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
for transformation but you can open this

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.870 
for transformation but you can open this
back<00:02:53.090> part<00:02:53.330> up<00:02:53.710> like<00:02:54.710> that<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.100> this

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
back part up like that and this

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.680 
back part up like that and this
attachment<00:02:56.590> goes<00:02:57.590> up<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.430> down<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:02.120> can<00:03:02.480> open

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
attachment goes up and down you can open

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.080 
attachment goes up and down you can open
these<00:03:03.020> little<00:03:03.350> doors<00:03:03.650> on<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.220> bottom<00:03:04.750> there

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
these little doors on the bottom there

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.850 
these little doors on the bottom there
anyway<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.390> can<00:03:08.450> open<00:03:08.780> them<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.080> plug<00:03:09.710> in

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
anyway so you can open them to plug in

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.590 
anyway so you can open them to plug in
landing<00:03:10.310> here<00:03:10.550> for<00:03:11.270> its<00:03:11.930> flight<00:03:12.290> mode<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:14.330> you

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
landing here for its flight mode and you

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.390 
landing here for its flight mode and you
can<00:03:14.810> lift<00:03:15.380> this<00:03:15.890> part<00:03:16.220> up<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:18.170> reveal<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.830> small

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
can lift this part up to reveal a small

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.600 
can lift this part up to reveal a small
handle<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.650> can<00:03:21.890> hold<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.250> gun<00:03:22.400> with<00:03:22.580> two

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
handle so you can hold the gun with two

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.550 
handle so you can hold the gun with two
ends<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:25.510> that's<00:03:26.510> pretty<00:03:26.990> much<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.230> for<00:03:27.380> this

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
ends and that's pretty much it for this

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.440 
ends and that's pretty much it for this
gun<00:03:28.510> now<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.930> do<00:03:30.080> get<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.770> beam<00:03:31.580> sabers<00:03:32.120> which

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
gun now you do get to beam sabers which

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.670 
gun now you do get to beam sabers which
are<00:03:32.660> located<00:03:32.780> in<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.500> side<00:03:34.220> skirts<00:03:35.110> lift<00:03:36.110> this

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
are located in the side skirts lift this

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.480 
are located in the side skirts lift this
small<00:03:37.220> gray<00:03:37.580> part<00:03:37.850> up<00:03:38.650> like<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.100> now<00:03:40.430> you

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
small gray part up like that and now you

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.260 
small gray part up like that and now you
can<00:03:40.790> pull<00:03:41.030> out<00:03:41.410> beam<00:03:42.410> sabers<00:03:42.890> they're<00:03:43.670> pretty

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
can pull out beam sabers they're pretty

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.040 
can pull out beam sabers they're pretty
big<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.200> they<00:03:45.770> don't<00:03:46.310> fit<00:03:46.610> very<00:03:47.270> well<00:03:47.390> in<00:03:47.959> the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
big so they don't fit very well in the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.920 
big so they don't fit very well in the
hands<00:03:48.260> but<00:03:49.300> it's<00:03:50.300> not<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.540> big<00:03:50.720> deal<00:03:50.830> and<00:03:52.930> I'm

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
hands but it's not a big deal and I'm

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.840 
hands but it's not a big deal and I'm
gonna<00:03:54.170> say<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.410> now<00:03:54.560> everything<00:03:55.250> on<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.459> kid

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
gonna say it now everything on this kid

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.640 
gonna say it now everything on this kid
is<00:03:56.030> insanely<00:03:56.840> tight<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.790> have<00:03:58.790> no<00:03:59.060> idea<00:03:59.090> why<00:03:59.650> but

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
is insanely tight I have no idea why but

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.509 
is insanely tight I have no idea why but
if<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.430> try<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:01.640> rotate<00:04:01.910> let<00:04:02.239> Sadie<00:04:02.420> hand<00:04:03.519> so

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
if I try to rotate let Sadie hand so

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.650 
if I try to rotate let Sadie hand so
tight<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:05.269> or<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.950> arms<00:04:07.220> goes<00:04:07.400> up<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:07.850> don't

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
tight that or the arms goes up I don't

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.259 
tight that or the arms goes up I don't
know<00:04:08.780> it's<00:04:09.260> insanely<00:04:10.160> tight<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.670> feel<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.150> going

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
know it's insanely tight I feel it going

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.509 
know it's insanely tight I feel it going
to<00:04:11.330> break<00:04:11.800> but<00:04:12.800> it<00:04:13.040> looks<00:04:13.310> pretty<00:04:13.430> solid<00:04:13.970> so

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
to break but it looks pretty solid so

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.849 
to break but it looks pretty solid so
anyways<00:04:16.519> beam<00:04:16.700> sabers<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.570> do<00:04:17.780> get<00:04:18.019> two<00:04:18.560> of

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
anyways beam sabers you do get two of

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.370 
anyways beam sabers you do get two of
these<00:04:19.100> beam<00:04:19.280> sabers<00:04:19.640> and<00:04:19.790> you<00:04:20.660> get<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:21.049> clear

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
these beam sabers and you get to clear

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.370 
these beam sabers and you get to clear
blue<00:04:21.739> beams<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.250> there<00:04:22.810> it's<00:04:23.810> a<00:04:23.900> pretty<00:04:24.080> light

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
blue beams and there it's a pretty light

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.800 
blue beams and there it's a pretty light
blue<00:04:24.710> I'm<00:04:25.490> going<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.729> bring<00:04:25.850> in<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.180> high<00:04:26.510> news

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
blue I'm going to bring in a high news

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.620 
blue I'm going to bring in a high news
beam<00:04:27.169> sabers<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:28.880> don't<00:04:29.180> know<00:04:29.330> if<00:04:29.390> you<00:04:29.479> can

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
beam sabers and I don't know if you can

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.310 
beam sabers and I don't know if you can
tell<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.050> difference<00:04:30.290> but<00:04:30.860> now<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:32.540> big<00:04:32.720> gun

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
tell the difference but now the big gun

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.140 
tell the difference but now the big gun
cannon<00:04:33.950> things<00:04:34.310> /<00:04:35.030> whatever<00:04:35.479> I<00:04:35.930> can<00:04:36.919> mount<00:04:37.880> on

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
cannon things / whatever I can mount on

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.950 
cannon things / whatever I can mount on
either<00:04:39.110> arm

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
either arm

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.450 
either arm
there's<00:04:41.770> a<00:04:41.919> hole<00:04:42.280> right<00:04:42.699> there<00:04:43.449> and<00:04:44.310> all<00:04:45.310> you

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
there's a hole right there and all you

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.070 
there's a hole right there and all you
do<00:04:45.580> is<00:04:45.780> plug<00:04:46.780> this<00:04:47.410> big<00:04:47.680> in<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:49.050> slide<00:04:50.050> it

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
do is plug this big in and slide it

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.870 
do is plug this big in and slide it
forward<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.900> as<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.919> said<00:04:53.979> everything<00:04:54.580> is

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
forward and as I said everything is

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.740 
forward and as I said everything is
insanely<00:04:55.360> tight<00:04:56.970> so<00:04:57.970> there<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.330> go<00:04:59.669> and<00:05:00.750> now

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
insanely tight so there you go and now

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.820 
insanely tight so there you go and now
you<00:05:02.650> have<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.919> big<00:05:03.310> gun<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.289> its<00:05:05.289> back<00:05:05.560> heavy

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
you have a big gun and its back heavy

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.589 
you have a big gun and its back heavy
but<00:05:06.099> the<00:05:06.220> gun<00:05:06.400> kind<00:05:06.729> of<00:05:06.910> balance<00:05:07.300> everything

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
but the gun kind of balance everything

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.080 
but the gun kind of balance everything
is<00:05:07.780> out<00:05:07.900> so<00:05:08.530> it's<00:05:08.919> not<00:05:09.340> going<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.610> fall<00:05:09.759> or

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
is out so it's not going to fall or

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.270 
is out so it's not going to fall or
anything<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:11.190> apparently<00:05:12.190> if<00:05:12.699> you<00:05:12.970> rotate

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
anything and apparently if you rotate

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.770 
anything and apparently if you rotate
this<00:05:15.280> piece<00:05:15.880> right<00:05:16.090> there<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:18.250> gun<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:18.789> stored

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
this piece right there the gun is stored

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.860 
this piece right there the gun is stored
kinda<00:05:20.590> hard<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:21.220> old<00:05:23.820> no<00:05:24.820> no<00:05:25.090> its<00:05:25.270> stance<00:05:25.539> but

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
kinda hard to old no no its stance but

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.710 
kinda hard to old no no its stance but
it's<00:05:26.229> no<00:05:26.949> it's<00:05:27.310> very<00:05:27.400> back<00:05:27.789> heavy<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:28.360> if<00:05:28.599> you

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
it's no it's very back heavy and if you
