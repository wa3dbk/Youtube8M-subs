00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.280
 merciless warrior to anyone and never 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.150
 famous business 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.150
 who is well without his army just 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.570
 jacked up side without name 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.349
 home and family being just a close by 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.540
 death and madness she was looking for a new home and 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.640
 shelter not 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.600
 wandering for months on endless 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.840
 open spaces of the earth 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.510
 the road led her to the outskirts of silver 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.379
 weights 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.159
 it's not just a forest it was rumored that he 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.340
 bewitched as if alive he lets in 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:56.890
 all but no one got out 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:00.309
 but for her it was the last chance to survive 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.190
 great for hunting as well as possible 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.930
 make a place to sleep 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.110
 did not have time to enter the forest 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.850
 but I already felt someone 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.420
 heavy gaze 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.180
 like the forest itself looked right in the soul but 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.880
 fear and retreat 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.240
 it's not her prince 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 she always walked to the end to victory 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.789
 the end 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.780
 dragging already and so exhausted and her legs 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:33.409
 walking along the path which 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.020
 plant and deep into the forest where there is no 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.470
 no sunbeam slipped 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.070
 where are the most dangerous and terrible 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.850
 beasts 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.630
 she lived in her hand a battle-hardened dagger 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.460
 on having done a bit of rusting already 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 a long time did not wash it 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.100
 nobody's blood 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.090
 in the forest and I was surrounded only by silence and around 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.600
 there was not a soul 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.610
 when suddenly she saw eyes that 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.370
 watched her from the dark 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.970
 and it only pissed her off and she 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.690
 rushed to the beast but how close is he 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.850
 cancellation 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.230
 relied 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.190
 he always slipped into darkness 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.420
 of time 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.260
 full moon and lit up everything around and she 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.950
 saw the beast on top of a hill 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.340
 it was a huge panther 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.700
 but it was not so easy 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.460
 the panther with her paw pulled out the dagger and without touching 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.800
 and and hid in the forest 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.050
 again she missed the chance to meet 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.480
 by death 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.200
 after a moment, people appeared from the forest 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.400
 in the hoods 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.850
 and told that she was chosen by the goddess of power 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.330
 mena 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.690
 as her warrior and she 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.230
 passed the test itself without knowing it 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.790
 performed the sacred ritual of the dark moon 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.790
 warriors of silver forests she was offered 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.860
 the choice to join the dark moon and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.700
 vowed to serve the power of Maine and 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.060
 shore to go and never return 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.550
 she did not hesitate 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.790
 accepting her release she 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:26.620
 abandoned the bloody past since 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.950
