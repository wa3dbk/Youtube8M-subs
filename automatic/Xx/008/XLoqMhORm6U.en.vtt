00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.670 
that's pretty big size little restaurant
that<00:02:33.579> built<00:02:33.969> I<00:02:34.239> decided<00:02:35.109> to<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.349> with<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.590> little

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
that built I decided to go with a little

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.399 
that built I decided to go with a little
different<00:02:36.090> theme<00:02:37.090> on<00:02:37.389> the<00:02:37.569> ceiling

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
different theme on the ceiling

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.069 
different theme on the ceiling
I<00:02:39.389> used<00:02:40.389> the<00:02:40.889> tan<00:02:42.090> clay<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.389> the<00:02:43.480> roof<00:02:43.719> and

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
I used the tan clay for the roof and

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.280 
I used the tan clay for the roof and
then<00:02:44.379> I<00:02:44.560> used<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.950> dark<00:02:45.219> oak<00:02:45.790> wood<00:02:45.870> planks<00:02:46.870> for

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
then I used the dark oak wood planks for

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.869 
then I used the dark oak wood planks for
the<00:02:47.469> little<00:02:48.129> pattern<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.829> I<00:02:51.310> guess<00:02:51.519> we'll<00:02:51.730> go

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
the little pattern and I guess we'll go

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.839 
the little pattern and I guess we'll go
outside<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.919> as<00:02:53.919> you<00:02:54.129> can<00:02:54.219> tell<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.489> put<00:02:54.790> a

drive through I did not put the
drive-through<00:02:59.620> menu<00:02:59.799> that<00:03:00.159> I<00:03:00.219> always<00:03:00.489> forget
