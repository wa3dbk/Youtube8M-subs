00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.519
 the flat carbon z yak 54 3x is one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.160
 further development of the known and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.150
 successful carbon z jack from the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.400
 home for rich hobby the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.340
 improvements in the detail, especially 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.529
 hull of the serb outfit and the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.989
 new regulator with the reinforced bc 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.890
 are always positive 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.710
 but in particular the new receiver r 63 5 with 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 the known of the triangle 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.539
 stabilization system is a real one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.660
 plus point for the new chambers z hunting 54 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.850
 3x the asx works in the hidden 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.579
 and communicates that at any time 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.390
 feel the model at 100 percent below 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.390
 to have control 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.010
 especially in adverse weather conditions 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.010
 is the positive influence to notice 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.500
 through the stabilization system 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 The model conveys a much quieter 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.150
 flight felt like you would otherwise only from 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.150
 clearly larger models knows 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.830
 We mainly have our test flights 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.810
 strong and gusty wind and 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.790
 were of the flow characteristics of the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.790
 carbon z jack excited 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.939
 the model is an ideal aerobatic and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.939
 3d coach 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.460
 the drive is designed and more 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.830
 as sufficient for the model 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.410
 dimensioned thereby is the 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.140
 Power consumption amazingly low and 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.540
 allowed with the included 2800 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.970
 milli-hour flight battery one 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:07.290
 Flight time up to seven minutes depending on 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:11.550
 flight because I have the full
