possibilities<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.880> these<00:00:30.000> guys<00:00:30.269> they<00:00:31.230> range

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
possibilities with these guys they range

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.330 
possibilities with these guys they range
in<00:00:31.710> size<00:00:31.769> from<00:00:32.009> very<00:00:32.880> small<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.649> size<00:00:35.190> of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340

this<00:00:35.460> whole<00:00:35.640> pad<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.940> paper<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.450> had<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.079> that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
this whole pad of paper I had one that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.790 
this whole pad of paper I had one that
big<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.860> know<00:00:38.309> they<00:00:38.430> don't<00:00:38.550> last<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
big but you know they don't last a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.959 
big but you know they don't last a
terribly<00:00:40.800> long<00:00:41.010> time<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.520> tend<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.790> break

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
terribly long time they tend to break

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
terribly long time they tend to break
apart<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> nature<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> fibers

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
apart it's just the nature of the fibers

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
apart it's just the nature of the fibers
so<00:00:44.940> let's<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.329> dive<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.020> start<00:00:46.200> seeing

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
so let's just dive in and start seeing

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.970 
so let's just dive in and start seeing
what<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.129> come<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:51.440> great<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.739> dabbing

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
what we come up with great for dabbing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.220 
what we come up with great for dabbing
you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.460> also<00:00:53.610> roll<00:00:54.059> them<00:00:56.989> again<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.020> can

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you can also roll them again you can

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
you can also roll them again you can
wear<00:00:58.379> gloves<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.430> really<00:01:00.300> don't

mind getting my hands messy so each

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.929 
mind getting my hands messy so each
surface<00:01:05.330> will<00:01:06.330> create<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> different<00:01:07.670> pattern

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.080

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
you can also tear these or cut them into

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.820 
you can also tear these or cut them into
certain<00:01:15.600> shapes<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> specific

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
need you can use the same side over and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.179 
need you can use the same side over and
over<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.479> create<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.750> stamped<00:01:22.170> effect<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
over to create a stamped effect or you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.760 
over to create a stamped effect or you
can<00:01:23.340> rotate<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.880> constantly<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.840> you'll<00:01:25.590> get

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770

can rotate it constantly and you'll get
a<00:01:25.830> new<00:01:26.100> impression<00:01:26.640> every<00:01:27.060> single<00:01:27.360> time<00:01:31.579> it's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
a new impression every single time it's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:41.780 
a new impression every single time it's
just<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.030> nice<00:01:33.470> random<00:01:36.110> texturizer<00:01:40.790> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
just a really nice random texturizer you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:50.230 
just a really nice random texturizer you
can<00:01:41.970> also<00:01:42.119> drag

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.430 

these<00:01:51.240> are<00:01:51.360> actually<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.900> favorite<00:01:52.140> tool

for<00:01:52.740> wood<00:01:52.980> graining<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:54.630> load<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.110> with

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
for wood graining you load it up with

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.270 
for wood graining you load it up with
color<00:01:56.210> obviously<00:01:57.620> if<00:01:58.620> I<00:01:58.770> were<00:01:58.890> doing<00:01:59.130> this

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
color obviously if I were doing this

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100 
color obviously if I were doing this
with<00:01:59.730> an<00:01:59.850> actual<00:02:00.210> project<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.720> would<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.990> be

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
with an actual project I would not be

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.520 
with an actual project I would not be

position<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.050> your<00:02:13.230> fingers<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.780> create

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
position of your fingers you can create

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.300 
position of your fingers you can create
nice<00:02:17.550> veining<00:02:18.420> patterns<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.130> right

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
nice veining patterns that in the right

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.340 
nice veining patterns that in the right
colors<00:02:20.990> will<00:02:21.990> mimic<00:02:22.200> would<00:02:22.860> work<00:02:23.070> very<00:02:23.310> nicely

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.580 

and<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:28.560> go<00:02:28.710> in<00:02:28.860> later<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> brush<00:02:29.550> and

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
and you can go in later with a brush and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.470 
and you can go in later with a brush and
maybe<00:02:31.590> paint<00:02:32.360> I'm<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:33.570> whole<00:02:33.810> or<00:02:34.050> two<00:02:35.480> again

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
maybe paint I'm not whole or two again

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.110 
maybe paint I'm not whole or two again
