soon<00:04:08.219> as<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.430> break<00:04:08.610> something<00:04:08.939> like<00:04:09.750> this

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
soon as you break something like this

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.550 
soon as you break something like this
table<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:11.370> lose<00:04:11.610> do<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.269> see<00:04:12.480> game<00:04:12.810> over<00:04:13.230> okay
