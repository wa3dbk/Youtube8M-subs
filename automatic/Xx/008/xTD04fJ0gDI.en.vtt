questions Jason my nutrition teacher in

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.769 
questions Jason my nutrition teacher in
college<00:00:19.640> said<00:00:20.640> her<00:00:20.820> friend<00:00:21.240> or<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.570> right

college said her friend or the right

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.689 
college said her friend or the right
amount<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.230> calories<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.949> due<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.400> food

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
amount of calories that due to the food

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.400 
amount of calories that due to the food
they<00:00:24.060> were<00:00:24.119> eating<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.810> caused<00:00:25.050> inflammation

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
they were eating it caused inflammation

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.470 
they were eating it caused inflammation
and<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:25.949> couldn't<00:00:26.220> lose<00:00:26.369> any<00:00:26.550> fat<00:00:26.849> at<00:00:26.880> all

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and they couldn't lose any fat at all

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.769 
and they couldn't lose any fat at all
is<00:00:27.590> this<00:00:28.590> valid<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.730> diet<00:00:29.939> adherence

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
is this valid or just a diet adherence

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
is this valid or just a diet adherence
issue<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.859> clearly<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.250> diet<00:00:32.520> adherence

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
issue this is clearly a diet adherence

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.650 
issue this is clearly a diet adherence
issue<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.510> no<00:00:34.790> biological<00:00:35.790> explanation

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
issue there is no biological explanation

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.860 
issue there is no biological explanation
why<00:00:37.590> having<00:00:38.010> inflammation<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:39.059> foods<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
why having inflammation from foods and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.080 
why having inflammation from foods and
like<00:00:40.200> food<00:00:40.469> intolerances<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:41.489> some<00:00:41.730> sort<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
like food intolerances or some sort of

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.220 
like food intolerances or some sort of
excessive<00:00:43.070> inflammatory<00:00:44.149> prostaglandins

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
excessive inflammatory prostaglandins

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.799 
excessive inflammatory prostaglandins
due<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> ultra<00:00:46.800> high<00:00:46.980> omega-6<00:00:47.879> intake<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.719> not

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
due to ultra high omega-6 intake and not

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.330 
due to ultra high omega-6 intake and not
enough<00:00:49.020> omega-3<00:00:49.440> there's<00:00:49.800> there's<00:00:49.980> nothing

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
enough omega-3 there's there's nothing

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.040 
enough omega-3 there's there's nothing
like<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.910> could<00:00:51.000> actually<00:00:51.059> explain

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
like that that could actually explain

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.299 
like that that could actually explain
the<00:00:52.379> thermodynamics<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:54.199> would<00:00:55.199> still<00:00:55.559> lose

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the thermodynamics you would still lose

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.610 
the thermodynamics you would still lose
fat<00:00:57.180> even<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.870> stuff<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.230> causing

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
fat even if this stuff was causing

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.349 
fat even if this stuff was causing
massive<00:00:58.829> amount<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.309> water<00:00:59.640> retention<00:00:59.879> that

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
massive amount of water retention that

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.180 
massive amount of water retention that
made<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.719> gain<00:01:00.960> 20<00:01:01.410> pounds<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.829> water<00:01:02.070> weight

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
made you gain 20 pounds of water weight

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.690 
made you gain 20 pounds of water weight
you<00:01:02.579> would<00:01:02.850> still<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.270> losing<00:01:03.420> fat<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
you would still be losing fat and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.859 
you would still be losing fat and
eventually<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.850> would<00:01:06.000> lose<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.360> water<00:01:06.600> on

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
eventually you would lose the water on

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.770 
eventually you would lose the water on
top<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:07.650> point<00:01:07.680> also<00:01:08.780> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
top of that at some point also it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.929 
top of that at some point also it
doesn't<00:01:10.080> work<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.500> way<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.130> inflammation

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
doesn't work that way now inflammation

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
doesn't work that way now inflammation
can<00:01:12.119> cause<00:01:12.150> problems<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.990> could<00:01:13.170> possibly<00:01:13.530> in

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
can cause problems it could possibly in

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.740 
can cause problems it could possibly in
some<00:01:14.070> ways<00:01:14.640> lead<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> slightly<00:01:15.479> slower

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
some ways lead to a slightly slower

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.730 
some ways lead to a slightly slower
metabolism<00:01:17.390> but<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> wouldn't<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.900> dramatic

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
metabolism but it wouldn't be dramatic

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
metabolism but it wouldn't be dramatic
and<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.130> might<00:01:20.310> lead<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> losing<00:01:21.270> muscle

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and it might lead to losing muscle

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950 
and it might lead to losing muscle
tissue<00:01:22.740> easier<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.939> might<00:01:24.180> lead<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.659> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
tissue easier it might lead to you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.770 
tissue easier it might lead to you
feeling<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.890> crap<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.090> being<00:01:27.299> active

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
feeling like crap and not being active

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
feeling like crap and not being active
and<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.020> you're<00:01:28.140> burning<00:01:28.560> less<00:01:28.710> calories<00:01:29.220> but

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and in you're burning less calories but

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.039 
and in you're burning less calories but
that<00:01:29.640> goes<00:01:29.850> back<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.329> your<00:01:30.570> putting<00:01:30.810> less

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
that goes back to your putting less

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.330 
that goes back to your putting less
calories<00:01:31.470> out<00:01:31.590> because<00:01:31.950> you're<00:01:32.100> laying

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
calories out because you're laying

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
calories out because you're laying
around<00:01:32.490> feeling<00:01:33.000> sick<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.450> time<00:01:33.750> that

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
around feeling sick all the time that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.190 
around feeling sick all the time that
doesn't<00:01:34.799> mean<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.450> calorie<00:01:36.780> deficit

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
doesn't mean that the calorie deficit

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
doesn't mean that the calorie deficit
wouldn't<00:01:37.530> take<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.950> off<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.090> no

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
wouldn't take that off with you so no

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
wouldn't take that off with you so no
that's<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.509> complete<00:01:41.070> answer<00:01:41.250> I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that's a complete answer I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
that's a complete answer I
don't<00:01:41.520> buy<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.850> they're<00:01:42.390> trying<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> take

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
don't buy that they're trying to take

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.999 
don't buy that they're trying to take
secondary<00:01:44.299> things<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.659> feeling<00:01:46.530> bad<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
secondary things like feeling bad and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.630 
secondary things like feeling bad and
low<00:01:47.130> activity<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.770> mean<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.369> stopping

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
low activity to to mean it's stopping

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.100 
low activity to to mean it's stopping
you<00:01:50.850> from<00:01:50.970> losing<00:01:51.360> fat<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
you from losing fat and that's not the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.929 
you from losing fat and that's not the
case<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.470> will<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.649> directly<00:01:53.189> stop<00:01:53.759> you

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
case it will not directly stop you

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.639 
case it will not directly stop you
losing<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.930> any<00:01:55.079> we're<00:01:55.290> talking<00:01:55.560> about

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
losing that so any we're talking about

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.639 
losing that so any we're talking about
dietary<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.810> tolerances<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.079> inflammation

dietary in tolerances and inflammation

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.289 
dietary in tolerances and inflammation
and<00:01:59.040> thing<00:01:59.189> stopping<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> from<00:01:59.790> losing<00:02:00.000> fats

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and thing stopping you from losing fats

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.639 
and thing stopping you from losing fats
full<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.079> don't<00:02:01.140> care<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.439> they're<00:02:01.619> a

question

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.410 
question
Jason<00:02:08.160> why<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.550> only<00:02:08.700> get<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> fail<00:02:09.179> away

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
Jason why do you only get to fail away

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
Jason why do you only get to fail away
twice<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> novice<00:02:10.500> program<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.009> opposed

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
twice on the novice program as opposed

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.940 
twice on the novice program as opposed
to<00:02:11.610> the

to the

time's on strong lifts and starting

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.710 
time's on strong lifts and starting
strength<00:02:15.160> because<00:02:16.120> it's<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.330> different

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
strength because it's a different

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.580 
strength because it's a different
program

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
program

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.920 
program
it's<00:02:17.980> my<00:02:18.310> program<00:02:18.849> it<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.269> bit<00:02:19.540> different

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
it's my program it is a bit different

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.600 
it's my program it is a bit different
and<00:02:20.080> some<00:02:20.290> people<00:02:20.530> say<00:02:20.680> well<00:02:20.860> use<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.250> complete

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
and some people say well use a complete

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.520 
and some people say well use a complete
copy<00:02:21.819> of<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.360> strongest<00:02:22.989> note<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.319> quite<00:02:23.500> a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
copy of the strongest note it's quite a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.900 
copy of the strongest note it's quite a
bit<00:02:23.680> different<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.040> took<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.459> original

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
bit different I took the original

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.750 
bit different I took the original
material<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.599> strong<00:02:25.840> listen<00:02:26.200> was<00:02:26.760> taken

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
material that strong listen was taken

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.890 
material that strong listen was taken
from<00:02:27.910> because<00:02:28.209> it's<00:02:28.360> not<00:02:28.510> an<00:02:28.630> original

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
from because it's not an original

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.759 
from because it's not an original
program<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:30.750> ivory<00:02:31.750> added<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.200> lot<00:02:32.349> of<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.590> back

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
program and ivory added a lot of it back

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.920 
program and ivory added a lot of it back
in<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.310> stuff<00:02:33.519> that<00:02:33.670> he<00:02:33.880> took<00:02:34.120> out<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.660> added

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
in the stuff that he took out and added

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.680 
in the stuff that he took out and added
my<00:02:35.019> own<00:02:35.050> twist<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.800> it's<00:02:36.580> all<00:02:36.760> these<00:02:36.970> 5x5

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
my own twist to it it's all these 5x5

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.539 
my own twist to it it's all these 5x5
three-day<00:02:38.380> week<00:02:38.560> full-body<00:02:38.950> programs<00:02:39.370> are

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
three-day week full-body programs are

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.280 
three-day week full-body programs are
like<00:02:39.700> 60<00:02:40.120> years<00:02:40.330> old<00:02:40.480> as<00:02:40.750> strong<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.140> is

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
like 60 years old as strong this is

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.440 
like 60 years old as strong this is
nothing<00:02:41.650> new<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:42.150> chose<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> different

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
nothing new I chose a different

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.210 
nothing new I chose a different
progression<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.380> reason<00:02:44.709> for<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:44.950> is

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
progression and the reason for that is

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.039 
progression and the reason for that is
that<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.400> want<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.819> get<00:02:45.970> people<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.540> they<00:02:46.780> need

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
that I want to get people if they need

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.990 
that I want to get people if they need
to<00:02:47.080> reset<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.830> want<00:02:48.040> them<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.250> reset<00:02:48.610> as<00:02:48.760> quickly

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
to reset I want them to reset as quickly

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.210 
to reset I want them to reset as quickly
as<00:02:49.209> possible

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
as possible

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.350 
as possible
recover<00:02:51.220> adapt<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.970> start<00:02:52.150> progressing

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
recover adapt and start progressing

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.199 
recover adapt and start progressing
again<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.349> I<00:02:53.440> feel<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.920> sometimes<00:02:54.700> if<00:02:55.120> I

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
again and I feel like sometimes if I

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.259 
again and I feel like sometimes if I
give<00:02:55.480> him<00:02:55.599> just<00:02:55.750> one<00:02:55.840> fail<00:02:56.970> they<00:02:57.970> could<00:02:58.180> be

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
give him just one fail they could be

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.880 
give him just one fail they could be
having<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.599> bad<00:02:58.780> day<00:02:59.019> they<00:02:59.260> could<00:02:59.319> be<00:02:59.530> feeling

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
having a bad day they could be feeling

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.809 
having a bad day they could be feeling
sick<00:03:00.099> maybe<00:03:00.310> they<00:03:00.430> didn't<00:03:00.579> get<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> good

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
sick maybe they didn't get a good

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.339 
sick maybe they didn't get a good
night's<00:03:01.060> sleep<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.569> now<00:03:01.660> I'm<00:03:01.810> setting<00:03:02.230> them

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
night's sleep and now I'm setting them

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.080 
night's sleep and now I'm setting them
back<00:03:02.380> ten<00:03:02.769> percent<00:03:03.130> or<00:03:03.220> possibly<00:03:03.640> everything

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
back ten percent or possibly everything

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.610 
back ten percent or possibly everything
because<00:03:04.450> they<00:03:04.540> had<00:03:04.690> one<00:03:04.930> bad<00:03:05.140> day<00:03:05.349> at<00:03:05.470> all

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
because they had one bad day at all

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.250 
because they had one bad day at all
their<00:03:05.799> lifts<00:03:06.040> stalled<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.730> I'm<00:03:07.720> costing

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
their lifts stalled and I'm costing

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.380 
their lifts stalled and I'm costing
someone<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.890> week<00:03:09.220> or<00:03:09.400> two<00:03:09.549> worth<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.940> progress

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
someone a week or two worth of progress

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.670 
someone a week or two worth of progress
when<00:03:10.569> they<00:03:10.690> should<00:03:10.870> be<00:03:10.989> making<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.410> linear

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
when they should be making a linear

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.220 
when they should be making a linear
progression<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.430> linear<00:03:12.700> gains<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:13.930> don't

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
progression and linear gains so I don't

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.099 
progression and linear gains so I don't
want<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.440> do<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.650> off<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:15.010> single<00:03:15.220> fail<00:03:15.579> I

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
want to do it off of a single fail I

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.900 
want to do it off of a single fail I
feel<00:03:17.109> like<00:03:17.319> two<00:03:17.680> gives<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.250> decent<00:03:18.459> enough

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
feel like two gives a decent enough

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.940 
feel like two gives a decent enough
margin<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.750> don't<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:20.139> people<00:03:20.319> wasting

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
margin and I don't have people wasting

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.210 
margin and I don't have people wasting
time<00:03:21.160> with<00:03:21.370> another<00:03:21.760> session<00:03:22.799> still<00:03:23.799> hitting

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
time with another session still hitting

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.030 
time with another session still hitting
failures<00:03:24.970> like<00:03:25.780> these<00:03:26.019> systems<00:03:26.470> do<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.680> just

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
failures like these systems do I just

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.160 
failures like these systems do I just
feel<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:27.430> for<00:03:28.030> most<00:03:28.269> people<00:03:28.389> statistically

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
feel that for most people statistically

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.720 
feel that for most people statistically
it's<00:03:29.260> gonna<00:03:29.410> allow<00:03:29.530> for<00:03:29.680> better<00:03:30.040> progression

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
it's gonna allow for better progression

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.949 
it's gonna allow for better progression
that's<00:03:30.940> just<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.180> way<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.359> programmed<00:03:31.810> it

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
that's just the way I programmed it

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.110 
that's just the way I programmed it
accordingly<00:03:32.430> nothing<00:03:33.430> wrong<00:03:33.609> with<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.970> other

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
accordingly nothing wrong with the other

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.440 
accordingly nothing wrong with the other
two<00:03:34.359> I<00:03:34.600> just<00:03:34.630> feel<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.200> doing<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:35.920> way

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
two I just feel that doing it that way

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.170 
two I just feel that doing it that way
it's<00:03:37.450> more<00:03:37.780> likely<00:03:38.319> to<00:03:38.500> get<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:38.769> right<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.310> get

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
it's more likely to get it right and get

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.030 
it's more likely to get it right and get
and<00:03:40.420> keep<00:03:40.660> most<00:03:41.049> people<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.650> majority<00:03:41.859> of

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.479 
do this and I'm not agreeing with him

have been doing for decades it works and
it<00:04:28.200> works<00:04:28.230> because<00:04:28.980> we<00:04:29.340> know<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:30.030> squat

it works because we know that the squat

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.910 
it works because we know that the squat
and<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.570> deadlift<00:04:30.960> use<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.320> majority<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.800> the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
on the other lift so much the lift that

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.610 
on the other lift so much the lift that
you're<00:04:51.030> specializing<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:51.870> if<00:04:52.140> it<00:04:52.440> is

you're specializing in if it is

you're specializing in if it is
progressing<00:04:53.190> enough<00:04:53.520> it<00:04:54.150> should<00:04:54.690> progress

progressing enough it should progress

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
the other lift with it just because of

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.880 
the other lift with it just because of
the<00:04:57.360> massive<00:04:57.750> amount<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.050> overlapping<00:04:58.560> and

the massive amount of overlapping and

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.130 
the massive amount of overlapping and
muscle<00:04:59.370> involved<00:04:59.760> and<00:04:59.970> even<00:05:00.720> on<00:05:00.810> something

muscle involved and even on something

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.770 
muscle involved and even on something
like<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.440> deadlift<00:05:01.890> it<00:05:02.160> can<00:05:02.550> be<00:05:02.790> possible<00:05:03.120> to

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
like the deadlift it can be possible to

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.300 
like the deadlift it can be possible to
increase<00:05:04.230> your<00:05:04.410> deadlift<00:05:04.830> without<00:05:05.070> training

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
increase your deadlift without training

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.620 
increase your deadlift without training
the<00:05:05.550> deadlift<00:05:05.880> but<00:05:06.030> I'm<00:05:06.120> not<00:05:06.270> going<00:05:06.480> to<00:05:06.540> go

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
the deadlift but I'm not going to go

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.300 
the deadlift but I'm not going to go
