my stanky MERS and welcome so today
we're<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.480> space<00:00:12.809> engineers<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.530> we're<00:00:13.740> gonna

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
we're in space engineers and we're gonna

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.220 
we're in space engineers and we're gonna
be<00:00:13.980> having<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.250> look<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:15.059> new<00:00:15.450> weapon<00:00:15.780> system

be having a look at a new weapon system

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.900 
be having a look at a new weapon system
that<00:00:16.770> I've<00:00:16.949> been<00:00:17.070> working<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.580> something<00:00:17.820> I

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
that I've been working on something I

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.769 
that I've been working on something I
call<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.449> star<00:00:19.170> streak<00:00:19.740> most<00:00:20.580> pull<00:00:20.880> missile

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
call the star streak most pull missile

call the star streak most pull missile
battery<00:00:22.529> system<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.160> lot<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.939> words<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.359> it's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
battery system a lot of words that it's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.929 
battery system a lot of words that it's
a<00:00:24.600> rather<00:00:24.779> complicated<00:00:25.109> device<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> idea

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
a rather complicated device but the idea

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.349 
a rather complicated device but the idea
is<00:00:27.000> mass<00:00:27.750> target<00:00:28.470> saturation<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.490> trying<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
is mass target saturation and trying to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
is mass target saturation and trying to
compact<00:00:30.810> all<00:00:31.109> these<00:00:31.320> rocket<00:00:31.619> launches<00:00:31.949> into<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
compact all these rocket launches into a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.709 
compact all these rocket launches into a
small<00:00:32.460> package<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.239> launched<00:00:33.660> from

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
small package so it can be launched from

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.930 
small package so it can be launched from
the<00:00:33.930> hole<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> ship<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.550> see<00:00:35.730> is

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the hole of a ship as you can see is

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.630 
the hole of a ship as you can see is
still<00:00:36.360> quite<00:00:36.989> large<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.800> every<00:00:38.160> time<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.370> try

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
still quite large but every time I try

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.950 
still quite large but every time I try
to<00:00:38.670> refine<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.300> make<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.750> bit

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
to refine it to make it a little bit

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.990 
to refine it to make it a little bit
smaller<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.860> situation<00:00:41.399> happens<00:00:41.700> where<00:00:41.910> it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
smaller the situation happens where it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.850 
smaller the situation happens where it
just<00:00:42.120> shakes<00:00:42.420> itself<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.989> part<00:00:43.260> because<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
just shakes itself to part because it is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.850 
just shakes itself to part because it is
quite<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> complex<00:00:44.879> little<00:00:45.629> contraption<00:00:46.320> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
quite a complex little contraption so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.940 
quite a complex little contraption so
the<00:00:46.980> idea<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.600> two<00:00:49.110> rocket<00:00:49.680> pods

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the idea here is we have two rocket pods

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.520 
the idea here is we have two rocket pods
per<00:00:50.610> cylinder<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.809> idea<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
per cylinder and the idea is that the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.290 
per cylinder and the idea is that the
second<00:00:52.980> rocket<00:00:53.160> pod<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> fold<00:00:54.059> out

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
second rocket pod is going to fold out

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.479 
second rocket pod is going to fold out
and<00:00:54.539> engage<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.530> tie<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.070> goes<00:00:56.219> um<00:00:56.309> tire

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and engage the tie so it goes um tire

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.430 
and engage the tie so it goes um tire
yourself<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> I've<00:00:57.719> got<00:00:57.870> some<00:00:58.050> earlier

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
yourself there and I've got some earlier

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.660 
yourself there and I've got some earlier
prototypes<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.280> we've<00:00:59.399> got<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
prototypes so we've got the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.180 
prototypes so we've got the
single-engine<00:01:00.350> pod<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> can

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
single-engine pod here as you can

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.070 
single-engine pod here as you can
actually<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.719> what's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
actually see so you can see what's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.000 
actually see so you can see what's
actually<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> happen

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
actually going to happen

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010 
actually going to happen
is<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.519> part<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.119> rotate<00:01:06.299> over<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
is that part is going to rotate over the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
is that part is going to rotate over the
other<00:01:07.110> put<00:01:07.710> some<00:01:07.860> other<00:01:08.040> prototypes<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
other put some other prototypes here and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.990 
other put some other prototypes here and
this<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.380> multi<00:01:10.770> battery<00:01:11.130> version<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.820> as

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this was the multi battery version so as

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.630 
this was the multi battery version so as
it<00:01:12.180> folds<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.810> you've<00:01:13.290> got<00:01:13.500> maximum<00:01:14.189> amount

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it folds out you've got maximum amount

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.719 
it folds out you've got maximum amount
of<00:01:14.820> firepower<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.630> target<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.799> ideally<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
of firepower on target so ideally you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.450 
of firepower on target so ideally you
can<00:01:18.060> engage<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:19.770> rocket<00:01:20.220> pods

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
can engage it with all them rocket pods

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.120 
can engage it with all them rocket pods
and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.390> ruin<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.200> ships<00:01:22.560> day

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and you can just ruin that ships day

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
and you can just ruin that ships day
so<00:01:23.549> let's<00:01:23.729> actually<00:01:23.820> take<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.360> look<00:01:24.570> how<00:01:24.840> it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
so let's actually take a look how it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.600 
so let's actually take a look how it
works<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.710> works<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> simple<00:01:26.250> little

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
works so it works on a simple little

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.090 
works so it works on a simple little
system<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.720> find<00:01:28.200> ourselves<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.829> little

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
system and if we find ourselves a little

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
system and if we find ourselves a little
control<00:01:29.610> block<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.030> here

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
control block on here

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.719 
control block on here
we<00:01:30.689> should<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.110> able<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> reverse<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.430> actual

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
we should be able to reverse the actual

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.450 
we should be able to reverse the actual
function<00:01:33.180> itself<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:34.979> here<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.369> we

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
function itself so if we go here and we

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.600 
function itself so if we go here and we
go<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.390> right<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.170> hit<00:01:37.350> reverse<00:01:37.610> you'll

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
go on right and we hit reverse you'll

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.340 
go on right and we hit reverse you'll
notice<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.060> happens<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> rocket<00:01:40.110> pods

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
notice what happens is the rocket pods

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920 
notice what happens is the rocket pods
are<00:01:40.500> actually<00:01:40.829> closing<00:01:41.400> down<00:01:42.000> into<00:01:42.750> their

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
are actually closing down into their

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.260 
are actually closing down into their
individual<00:01:43.590> cells<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:44.610> folding<00:01:45.030> back

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
individual cells and they folding back

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.109 
individual cells and they folding back
away<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.950> launched<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.549> repeats<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
away so as it is launched it repeats the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.969 
away so as it is launched it repeats the
process<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.840> Reverse<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.860> can

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
process but in Reverse and as you can

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.649 
process but in Reverse and as you can
see<00:01:50.130> we've<00:01:50.280> got<00:01:50.310> some<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.850> shake<00:01:51.119> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
see we've got some of the shake that

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.050 
see we've got some of the shake that
only<00:01:51.960> happens<00:01:52.350> when<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.829> reassemble<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.610> but

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
only happens when you reassemble it but

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
only happens when you reassemble it but
there<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> go<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.509> stable<00:01:54.930> itself<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
there you go is stable itself out and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010 
there you go is stable itself out and
will<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.280> ever<00:01:56.520> got<00:01:56.729> firing<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.689> one

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
will actually ever got firing one at one

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.600 
will actually ever got firing one at one
of<00:01:58.110> these<00:01:58.229> targets<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.890> I've<00:01:58.979> got<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.280> prepped

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
of these targets so I've got one prepped

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.120 
of these targets so I've got one prepped
up<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.780> white<00:02:01.020> ship<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.619> recently

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
up here for this white ship and recently

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.230 
up here for this white ship and recently
give<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> little<00:02:02.640> bit<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> launch

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
give it a little bit of a launch

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450 
give it a little bit of a launch
procedure<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.649> we're<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> aim<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.280> at

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
procedure so we're going to aim it at

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.130 
procedure so we're going to aim it at
that<00:02:05.490> thing<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.180> usually<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.899> would<00:02:07.020> be

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that thing and usually this would be

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.380 
that thing and usually this would be
fired<00:02:07.350> from<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> hull<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.310> ship<00:02:08.340> I'll<00:02:09.209> just

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
fired from the hull of a ship I'll just

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.969 
fired from the hull of a ship I'll just
show<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.569> exactly<00:02:09.959> what<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.709> without

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
show you exactly what you can do without

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
show you exactly what you can do without
it<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.580> an<00:02:11.730> accelerate<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> little<00:02:12.420> bit

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
it so just an accelerate a little bit

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.430 
it so just an accelerate a little bit
speed

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
speed

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.140 
speed
we're<00:02:13.680> going<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> release<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.640> you're

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
we're going to release it and you're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.640 
we're going to release it and you're
going<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.330> notice<00:02:15.480> how<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.810> system<00:02:16.260> actually

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
going to notice how the system actually

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.050 
going to notice how the system actually
takes<00:02:16.860> over<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.640> start<00:02:17.850> on<00:02:18.030> a

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
takes over so it's going to start on a

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.630 
takes over so it's going to start on a
timer<00:02:18.390> block<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.200> ten<00:02:19.500> seconds<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.250> then<00:02:20.550> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
timer block so ten seconds and then it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.120 
timer block so ten seconds and then it
will<00:02:20.670> pop<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.510> actual<00:02:21.900> cells<00:02:22.260> out<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
will pop the actual cells out of the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.740 
will pop the actual cells out of the
rocket<00:02:23.400> launchers<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.000> see<00:02:24.180> how<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
rocket launchers you can see how the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.420 
rocket launchers you can see how the
cells<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> rocket<00:02:25.740> system<00:02:26.010> are<00:02:26.100> popping

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
cells of the rocket system are popping

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.550 
cells of the rocket system are popping
out<00:02:26.550> then<00:02:27.000> three<00:02:27.360> seconds<00:02:27.720> after<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.140> it'll

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
out then three seconds after that it'll

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.740 
out then three seconds after that it'll
start<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.950> engage<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.270> see<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> side

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
start to engage and you can see the side

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.300 
start to engage and you can see the side
rocket<00:02:31.170> launches<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.560> actually<00:02:31.770> firing<00:02:32.010> up

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
rocket launches are actually firing up

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.740 
rocket launches are actually firing up
and<00:02:32.520> down<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.880> these<00:02:32.970> start<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.450> correct

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
and down and these start to correct

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.050 
and down and these start to correct
themselves<00:02:34.320> as<00:02:34.410> they<00:02:34.980> move<00:02:35.520> further<00:02:35.760> towards

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
themselves as they move further towards

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.850 
themselves as they move further towards
the<00:02:36.330> target<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:37.020> get<00:02:37.110> tighter<00:02:37.500> and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the target so they get tighter and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.130 
the target so they get tighter and
tighter<00:02:38.430> grouping<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.690> idea<00:02:40.020> is

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
tighter grouping and the idea is

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.020 
tighter grouping and the idea is
engaging<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.680> at<00:02:40.830> 500<00:02:41.340> meters<00:02:41.460> that<00:02:41.850> this

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
engaging this at 500 meters that this

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.970 
engaging this at 500 meters that this
continues<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.600> hit<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> target<00:02:43.170> it's<00:02:43.860> an

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
continues to hit a target it's an

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.730 
continues to hit a target it's an
absolutely<00:02:44.640> devastated<00:02:45.540> realistically<00:02:46.470> low

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
absolutely devastated realistically low

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.320 
absolutely devastated realistically low
as<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.280> got<00:02:47.430> closer<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.210> you'd

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
as it got closer like this you'd

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.790 
as it got closer like this you'd
probably<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.720> eliminated<00:02:48.870> by<00:02:49.530> its

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
probably be eliminated by its

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.890 
probably be eliminated by its
counterbattery<00:02:50.490> weapons<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.690> I'll<00:02:51.810> actually

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
counterbattery weapons so I'll actually

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.510 
counterbattery weapons so I'll actually
going<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.260> show<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.440> one<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.770> these<00:02:52.890> from<00:02:53.340> a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
going to show you one of these from a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.340 
going to show you one of these from a
little<00:02:53.790> bit<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.090> longer<00:02:54.330> range<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.320> a

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
little bit of a longer range so for a

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.410 
little bit of a longer range so for a
long<00:02:55.530> time<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.220> large<00:02:56.490> missile<00:02:56.940> pots<00:02:57.240> have

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
long time the large missile pots have

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.810 
long time the large missile pots have
been<00:02:57.450> known<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.870> do<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> lot<00:02:58.710> of<00:02:58.920> damage<00:02:59.280> but

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
been known to do a lot of damage but

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.960 
been known to do a lot of damage but
attaching<00:03:00.390> them<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.020> large<00:03:01.440> ship<00:03:01.890> can<00:03:02.640> kind

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
attaching them to a large ship can kind

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.540 
attaching them to a large ship can kind
of<00:03:03.060> cause<00:03:03.300> some<00:03:03.660> issues<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.650> regards<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.340> you

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
of cause some issues in regards to you

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.370 
of cause some issues in regards to you
have<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.880> point<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.450> shoot<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.170> whole

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
have to point and shoot with the whole

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.650 
have to point and shoot with the whole
of<00:03:07.590> your<00:03:07.680> ship<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.550> attaching<00:03:08.970> them<00:03:09.120> into<00:03:09.630> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
of your ship so attaching them into a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.390 
of your ship so attaching them into a
smaller<00:03:10.110> configuration<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.250> a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
smaller configuration like this in a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.390 
smaller configuration like this in a
rocket<00:03:11.880> or<00:03:12.050> an<00:03:13.050> unguided<00:03:13.440> sort<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.950> torpedo

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
rocket or an unguided sort of torpedo

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.340 
rocket or an unguided sort of torpedo
can<00:03:14.700> cause<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> lot<00:03:15.210> more<00:03:15.240> damage<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:16.200> at<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
can cause a lot more damage but at the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.710 
can cause a lot more damage but at the
same<00:03:16.590> time<00:03:16.920> you've<00:03:17.490> got<00:03:17.730> them<00:03:17.910> devastating

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
same time you've got them devastating

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.830 
same time you've got them devastating
missiles<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.560> each<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.459> these<00:03:20.730> wide<00:03:21.240> case<00:03:21.630> it

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
missiles in each of these wide case it

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.390 
missiles in each of these wide case it
is<00:03:21.930> one<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.260> weapons<00:03:22.590> where<00:03:22.860> it's<00:03:23.160> going

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
is one of the weapons where it's going

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.220 
is one of the weapons where it's going
to<00:03:23.430> be<00:03:23.550> disposable<00:03:24.060> after<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.660> fired<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.020> once

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
to be disposable after you fired it once

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.720 
to be disposable after you fired it once
that's<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.770> so<00:03:26.100> you've<00:03:26.220> got<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.430> take<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.670> in

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
that's it so you've got to take that in

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.010 
that's it so you've got to take that in
consideration<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:27.540> you're<00:03:27.630> gonna<00:03:27.720> try<00:03:27.959> to

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
consideration if you're gonna try to

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.900 
consideration if you're gonna try to
build<00:03:28.260> something<00:03:28.530> like<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.830> but<00:03:29.550> on<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
build something like this but on the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.730 
build something like this but on the
other<00:03:29.970> upside<00:03:30.540> we're<00:03:31.050> going<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.260> take<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.440> look

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
other upside we're going to take a look

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.430 
other upside we're going to take a look
at<00:03:31.980> some<00:03:32.640> more<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.450> intense<00:03:33.810> damage<00:03:34.230> that

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
at some more of the intense damage that

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.320 
at some more of the intense damage that
this<00:03:34.590> thing<00:03:34.770> can<00:03:34.950> do<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.640> hopefully<00:03:36.000> I'll

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
this thing can do and hopefully I'll

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.690 
this thing can do and hopefully I'll
travel<00:03:36.600> towards<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.200> target<00:03:37.470> engage<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
travel towards the target engage the

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.610 
travel towards the target engage the
outer<00:03:38.850> pods<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.570> then<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.840> will<00:03:39.930> start<00:03:40.140> firing

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
outer pods and then it will start firing

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.140 
outer pods and then it will start firing
so<00:03:40.709> that's<00:03:40.860> just<00:03:40.950> my<00:03:41.070> favorite<00:03:41.400> part<00:03:41.640> look<00:03:42.030> how

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
so that's just my favorite part look how

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.640 
so that's just my favorite part look how
cool<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.480> looks<00:03:42.690> when<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.230> starts<00:03:43.560> to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
cool that looks when that starts to

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.350 
cool that looks when that starts to
happen<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.070> then<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.670> starts<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.940> launch<00:03:45.180> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
happen and then it starts to launch the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.420 
happen and then it starts to launch the
missiles<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.989> larger<00:03:46.470> battery<00:03:46.770> you<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.280> see

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
missiles in a larger battery you can see

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.560 
missiles in a larger battery you can see
how<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.580> battery<00:03:47.970> is<00:03:48.030> actually<00:03:48.270> spreading

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
how the battery is actually spreading

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.420 
how the battery is actually spreading
out<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.810> it's<00:03:49.020> starting<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.560> twist<00:03:49.860> because

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
out and it's starting to twist because

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.550 
out and it's starting to twist because
of<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.820> rotors<00:03:51.209> then<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.959> actually<00:03:52.260> battery

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
of the rotors then the actually battery

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.710 
of the rotors then the actually battery
actually<00:03:52.770> gets<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.190> lot<00:03:53.370> tighter<00:03:53.640> together<00:03:54.150> so

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
actually gets a lot tighter together so

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.350 
actually gets a lot tighter together so
it<00:03:54.840> tightens<00:03:55.350> towards<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.010> target<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:57.000> as<00:03:57.209> we

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
it tightens towards the target so as we

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.150 
it tightens towards the target so as we
get<00:03:57.480> closer<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.350> battery<00:03:58.739> is<00:03:58.860> actually

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
get closer the battery is actually

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.710 
get closer the battery is actually
getting<00:03:59.340> much<00:03:59.550> more<00:03:59.820> intense<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.480> that

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
getting much more intense in that

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.690 
getting much more intense in that
direction<00:04:00.930> around<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.739> ship<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.520> see<00:04:02.670> I

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
direction around the ship you can see I

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.160 
direction around the ship you can see I
was<00:04:02.850> punching<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.270> nice<00:04:03.450> tight<00:04:03.780> hole<00:04:04.020> around

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
was punching a nice tight hole around

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.470 
was punching a nice tight hole around
there<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.860> it's<00:04:05.370> pretty<00:04:05.610> much<00:04:05.790> cut<00:04:06.090> off<00:04:06.300> the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
there and it's pretty much cut off the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.110 
there and it's pretty much cut off the
whole<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:07.080> rear<00:04:07.320> of<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.470> ship<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.910> there<00:04:09.030> you

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
whole the rear of the ship and there you

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.630 
whole the rear of the ship and there you
go<00:04:09.270> it's<00:04:09.600> even<00:04:09.810> impacted<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.530> we've<00:04:11.459> got<00:04:11.610> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
go it's even impacted and we've got a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.910 
go it's even impacted and we've got a
few<00:04:11.820> rockets<00:04:12.209> left<00:04:12.390> but<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.320> is<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> really

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
few rockets left but it is a really

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.229 
few rockets left but it is a really
devastating<00:04:14.100> weapon<00:04:14.820> something<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.150> I'm

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
devastating weapon something that I'm

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.300 
devastating weapon something that I'm
quite<00:04:15.480> proud<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:16.020> making<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.440> work<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.890> it

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
quite proud of making it work and it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.099 
quite proud of making it work and it
would<00:04:17.430> get<00:04:17.640> engaged<00:04:17.970> by<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.330> countermeasures

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
would get engaged by the countermeasures

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.990 
would get engaged by the countermeasures
of<00:04:19.320> all<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.650> ships<00:04:19.919> but<00:04:20.250> imagine<00:04:20.640> launching

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
of all the ships but imagine launching

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.180 
of all the ships but imagine launching
three<00:04:21.270> or<00:04:21.359> four<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.690> these<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.109> even<00:04:22.590> hooking

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
three or four of these and even hooking

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.320 
three or four of these and even hooking
them<00:04:23.310> up<00:04:23.430> with<00:04:23.550> some<00:04:23.669> sense<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.030> locks<00:04:24.240> that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
them up with some sense of locks that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.600 
them up with some sense of locks that
could<00:04:24.600> be<00:04:24.720> absolutely<00:04:25.440> devastating<00:04:26.220> let's

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
could be absolutely devastating let's

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.540 
could be absolutely devastating let's
fire<00:04:26.820> one<00:04:26.850> more

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
fire one more

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.309 
fire one more
that<00:04:27.789> white<00:04:27.970> ship<00:04:28.240> over<00:04:28.479> there<00:04:28.659> will<00:04:29.169> take

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
that white ship over there will take

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.990 
that white ship over there will take
this<00:04:29.409> one<00:04:29.560> in<00:04:29.710> really<00:04:30.190> slowly<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:30.669> we<00:04:30.879> can

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
this one in really slowly so we can

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.969 
this one in really slowly so we can
actually<00:04:31.090> get<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.360> nice<00:04:31.539> line<00:04:31.870> up<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:32.860> we'll

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
actually get a nice line up so we'll

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.920 
actually get a nice line up so we'll
bring<00:04:33.159> that<00:04:33.220> in<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.699> there<00:04:34.389> we<00:04:34.509> go<00:04:34.690> with<00:04:34.840> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
bring that in and there we go with the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.439 
bring that in and there we go with the
slight<00:04:35.139> send-off<00:04:35.800> into<00:04:36.099> that<00:04:36.759> let<00:04:37.300> them

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
slight send-off into that let them

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.960 
slight send-off into that let them
missile<00:04:37.810> pods<00:04:38.080> deploy<00:04:38.620> from<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.460> hole<00:04:39.669> in

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
missile pods deploy from the hole in

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.330 
missile pods deploy from the hole in
about<00:04:40.180> two<00:04:40.449> seconds<00:04:40.990> there<00:04:41.319> we<00:04:41.470> go<00:04:41.650> let<00:04:42.220> them

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
about two seconds there we go let them

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.430 
about two seconds there we go let them
push<00:04:42.669> up<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.180> form<00:04:43.840> into<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.110> battery

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
push up and form into the battery

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.309 
push up and form into the battery
position<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.970> there<00:04:46.270> we<00:04:46.389> go<00:04:46.569> so<00:04:47.050> what<00:04:47.289> I

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
position and there we go so what I

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.960 
position and there we go so what I
really<00:04:47.560> like<00:04:47.710> about<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:48.099> is<00:04:48.159> how<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.610> starts

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
really like about this is how it starts

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.610 
really like about this is how it starts
off<00:04:49.090> with<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.270> wide<00:04:49.539> target<00:04:50.139> orbit<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.590> it

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
off with a wide target orbit so it

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.170 
off with a wide target orbit so it
spreads<00:04:51.009> the<00:04:51.039> damage<00:04:51.310> across<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.789> ship<00:04:51.970> and

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
spreads the damage across the ship and

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.670 
spreads the damage across the ship and
then<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:52.509> closer<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:53.020> gets<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.379> more<00:04:53.620> it

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
then the closer it gets the more it

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.010 
then the closer it gets the more it
focuses<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.490> sort<00:04:54.970> of<00:04:55.030> damage<00:04:55.240> on<00:04:55.569> that<00:04:55.780> one

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
focuses the sort of damage on that one

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.899 
focuses the sort of damage on that one
area<00:04:56.440> of<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.560> ship<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:56.889> you've<00:04:57.099> got<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.580> really

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909 
area of the ship so you've got a really

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.420 
area of the ship so you've got a really
high<00:04:58.270> area<00:04:58.690> penetration<00:04:59.319> and<00:04:59.440> damage<00:04:59.500> in<00:05:00.219> that

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
high area penetration and damage in that

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.029 
high area penetration and damage in that
target<00:05:00.729> area<00:05:01.300> so<00:05:02.229> you<00:05:02.319> can<00:05:02.440> see<00:05:02.560> even<00:05:02.740> here

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
target area so you can see even here

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.219 
target area so you can see even here
it's<00:05:03.340> got<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.520> bit<00:05:03.699> stuck<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.569> started<00:05:05.020> locking

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
it's got a bit stuck and started locking

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.320 
it's got a bit stuck and started locking
on<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.949> just<00:05:06.099> devastating<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.759> rest<00:05:07.030> of<00:05:07.210> the

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
on and just devastating the rest of the

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.300 
on and just devastating the rest of the
cockpit<00:05:07.569> these<00:05:08.199> parts<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:08.770> did<00:05:08.979> bits<00:05:09.159> of

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
cockpit these parts and did bits of

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.860 
cockpit these parts and did bits of
assemblers<00:05:09.759> go<00:05:09.909> in<00:05:10.030> absolutely<00:05:10.120> everywhere

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
assemblers go in absolutely everywhere

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.659 
assemblers go in absolutely everywhere
just<00:05:11.469> really<00:05:11.800> cool<00:05:11.949> anyway<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.340> thought<00:05:12.550> I'd

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
just really cool anyway I thought I'd

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:13.830 
just really cool anyway I thought I'd
share<00:05:12.819> that<00:05:13.060> with<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.330> today<00:05:13.360> I'm<00:05:13.719> gonna

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
share that with you today I'm gonna

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.059 
share that with you today I'm gonna
whack<00:05:13.960> this<00:05:14.080> upon<00:05:14.319> the<00:05:14.379> workshop<00:05:14.770> so<00:05:14.889> you<00:05:14.949> can

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
whack this upon the workshop so you can

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.740 
whack this upon the workshop so you can
have<00:05:15.159> an<00:05:15.250> experiment<00:05:16.030> around<00:05:16.120> with<00:05:16.449> if<00:05:16.629> you

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
have an experiment around with if you

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.180 
have an experiment around with if you
wish<00:05:16.960> let's<00:05:17.620> think<00:05:17.740> you<00:05:17.860> guys<00:05:17.979> for<00:05:18.069> watching
