00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 Computer translation studio ENPY Studio presents 

00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:12.396
 It's time to act. 

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:13.871
 They are already here. 

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:17.142
 The ancient Scrolls predicted their return. 

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:22.146
 Defeat for them was only a delay 

00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:27.429
 until the gates of Oblivion opened, 

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:34.820
 and the sons of Skyrim did not shed their blood. 

00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:42.746
 But no one wanted to believe in it, 

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:46.323
 believe even that they exist. 

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:49.796
 But the truth soon lit up all. 

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.500
 Illuminated in the fire. 

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.830
 But ... there is one 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.485
 who are they afraid of. 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.713
 In their language is called Dovak'iin. 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.333
 Dragonborn!
