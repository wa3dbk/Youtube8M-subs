training I know that I'm a hundred

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.529 
training I know that I'm a hundred
percent<00:01:15.779> better<00:01:16.319> than<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.100> was<00:01:17.310> six<00:01:18.209> weeks<00:01:18.359> ago

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539

percent better than I was six weeks ago
I<00:01:18.929> would<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.679> see<00:01:19.829> most<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.549> go

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
I would like to see most of them go

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.399 
I would like to see most of them go
through<00:01:21.209> the<00:01:21.299> level<00:01:21.539> to<00:01:21.569> it<00:01:21.719> because<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
through the level to it because it's a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.399 
through the level to it because it's a
it's<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.709> good<00:01:22.889> course<00:01:23.569> as<00:01:24.569> for<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.899> pass<00:01:25.109> rate

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it's a good course as for the pass rate

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.739 
it's a good course as for the pass rate
as<00:01:25.560> many<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.369> possible<00:01:26.639> I<00:01:27.029> think<00:01:27.450> we've<00:01:27.539> got

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
as many as possible I think we've got

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:29.539 
as many as possible I think we've got
good<00:01:27.929> potential<00:01:28.349> after<00:01:28.950> doing<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.279> level

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
good potential after doing the level

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
good potential after doing the level
ones<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.119> their<00:01:30.479> progress<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.049> accelerating

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
ones and their progress is accelerating

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
ones and their progress is accelerating
so<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.429> stands<00:01:32.759> us<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:32.939> good<00:01:33.060> stead<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.389> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so it stands us in good stead for the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.940 
so it stands us in good stead for the
level<00:01:33.869> twos<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.229> hopefully<00:01:34.679> we'll<00:01:34.799> see<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
level twos and hopefully we'll see a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.800 
level twos and hopefully we'll see a
very<00:01:35.219> very<00:01:35.459> good<00:01:35.609> pass<00:01:35.819> rate<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.539> know<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
very very good pass rate you know the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.059 
very very good pass rate you know the
middle<00:01:37.049> two<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.349> little<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.709> little<00:01:37.740> more

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
middle two is a little a little more

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.469 
middle two is a little a little more
demanding<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.029> they're<00:01:39.389> getting

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
demanding but you know they're getting

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.899 
demanding but you know they're getting
so<00:01:39.779> much<00:01:39.899> time<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.560> snow<00:01:40.889> so<00:01:41.429> much<00:01:41.579> mileage
