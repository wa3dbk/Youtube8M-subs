00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.660 
it's been great to have them there no
not<00:01:37.049> yet<00:01:37.229> no<00:01:37.470> no<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.250> fun<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.490> games

right<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.360> no<00:01:40.290> definitely<00:01:40.680> we're

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
right now but no definitely we're

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
right now but no definitely we're
looking<00:01:40.979> forward<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.369> draft<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.939> we're

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
looking forward to the draft and we're

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.000 
looking forward to the draft and we're
definitely<00:01:42.659> coming<00:01:43.409> back<00:01:43.560> after<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
definitely coming back after the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.950 
definitely coming back after the
under-18<00:01:44.580> where<00:01:44.790> he<00:01:44.880> played<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.390> well<00:01:45.420> over<00:01:45.780> in

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
under-18 where he played so well over in

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.410 
under-18 where he played so well over in
Slovakia<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.820> brought<00:01:48.180> him

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
Slovakia I think that really brought him

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
Slovakia I think that really brought him
into<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.229> know<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.500> consideration<00:01:50.070> for

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
into the you know that consideration for

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.340 
into the you know that consideration for
the<00:01:50.520> first<00:01:50.729> defenseman<00:01:51.180> drafted<00:01:51.540> having<00:01:52.110> said

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the first defenseman drafted having said

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.700 
the first defenseman drafted having said
that<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.970> coach<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.049> GM<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.290> jr.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that you know as a coach and GM and jr.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.499 
that you know as a coach and GM and jr.
you<00:01:55.860> think<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> there's<00:01:56.670> lots<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.090> things<00:01:57.240> he

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you think that there's lots of things he

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
you think that there's lots of things he
still<00:01:57.750> has<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:58.049> learn<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:59.009> know<00:01:59.130> pretty

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
still has to learn and you know pretty

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.710 
still has to learn and you know pretty
much<00:01:59.400> every<00:01:59.700> player<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.390> still<00:02:00.600> has

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
much every player we have here still has

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.810 
much every player we have here still has
lots<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.079> learn<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:02.009> look<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> fact<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
lots and learn and look at the fact that

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.310 
lots and learn and look at the fact that
there<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.150> I<00:02:03.299> think<00:02:03.390> five<00:02:03.720> eighteen<00:02:04.110> year<00:02:04.200> old

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
there was I think five eighteen year old

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.510 
there was I think five eighteen year old
offense<00:02:04.560> when<00:02:04.740> they<00:02:04.829> played<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> National

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
offense when they played the National

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.859 
offense when they played the National
Hockey<00:02:05.610> League<00:02:05.729> last<00:02:06.000> year

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
Hockey League last year

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.440 
Hockey League last year
I<00:02:06.900> think<00:02:07.770> he's<00:02:07.890> close<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.820> being<00:02:08.970> ready<00:02:09.239> I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
I think he's close to to being ready I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.210 
I think he's close to to being ready I
don't<00:02:09.600> know<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:09.989> he<00:02:10.079> is<00:02:10.110> ready<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:10.739> just

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
don't know if he is ready but just

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.009 
don't know if he is ready but just
knowing<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.519> economics<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> new<00:02:12.329> NHL<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
knowing the economics of the new NHL I

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.090 
knowing the economics of the new NHL I
think<00:02:13.470> he's<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.739> get<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> real<00:02:14.070> good

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
think he's going to get a real good

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.250 
think he's going to get a real good
opportunity
