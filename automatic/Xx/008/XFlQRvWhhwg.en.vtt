some economists and ecologist rated the

support systems not too long ago the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.120 
support systems not too long ago the
terrestrial<00:00:14.219> are<00:00:14.550> land<00:00:15.090> based<00:00:15.150> systems

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
terrestrial are land based systems

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.220 
terrestrial are land based systems
freshwater<00:00:17.130> wetlands<00:00:18.000> came<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.449> number<00:00:18.930> one

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
freshwater wetlands came out number one

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.340 
freshwater wetlands came out number one
the<00:00:19.619> most<00:00:19.830> valuable<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.090> land<00:00:22.080> based

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the most valuable of the land based

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.470 
the most valuable of the land based
systems<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.190> it's<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.550> only<00:00:23.880> because<00:00:24.300> they

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
systems and it's not only because they

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.620 
systems and it's not only because they
provide<00:00:24.900> habitat<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.560> fish<00:00:26.340> ducks<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.510> know

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
provide habitat for fish ducks you know

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.170 
provide habitat for fish ducks you know
so<00:00:27.960> many<00:00:28.140> different<00:00:28.890> animals<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.640> plants

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
so many different animals and plants

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.379 
so many different animals and plants
it's<00:00:31.170> also<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:32.369> there's<00:00:32.669> an<00:00:32.820> important

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:33.389 
it's also because there's an important

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:36.529 
it's also because there's an important
water<00:00:33.690> cleansing<00:00:34.409> effect<00:00:34.859> on<00:00:35.069> wetlands<00:00:35.539> and

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
water cleansing effect on wetlands and

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.469 
water cleansing effect on wetlands and
this<00:00:36.809> works<00:00:37.050> two<00:00:37.440> ways<00:00:37.609> with<00:00:38.609> beaver<00:00:38.969> dams<00:00:39.299> for

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:39.479 
this works two ways with beaver dams for

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.619 
this works two ways with beaver dams for
example<00:00:40.109> if<00:00:40.199> we<00:00:40.319> stand<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.889> dam<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:42.329> water

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
example if we stand on the dam the water

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.899 
example if we stand on the dam the water
coming<00:00:43.170> over<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.589> dam<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.219> always<00:00:44.549> cleaner

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
coming over the dam is always cleaner

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.879 
coming over the dam is always cleaner
than<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> water<00:00:45.510> upstream<00:00:45.989> because<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.709> dam

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:46.889 
than the water upstream because the dam

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:49.759 
than the water upstream because the dam
acts<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> filter<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.600> takes<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.109> that<00:00:49.440> dirt

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
acts as a filter it takes out that dirt

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.250 
acts as a filter it takes out that dirt
and<00:00:49.799> soap<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:50.969> otherwise<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.989> down

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and soap that would otherwise go on down

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.099 
and soap that would otherwise go on down
the<00:00:52.440> stream<00:00:53.510> people<00:00:54.510> would<00:00:54.629> need<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.929> remove

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
the stream people would need to remove

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.829 
the stream people would need to remove
it<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.739> their<00:00:56.129> water<00:00:56.999> plants<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.809> have

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
it at their water plants we have

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.259 
it at their water plants we have
drinking<00:00:58.379> water<00:00:58.639> that's<00:00:59.639> an<00:00:59.819> important

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
drinking water that's an important

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.449 
drinking water that's an important
function<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.779> beaver<00:01:01.019> dam<00:01:01.409> can<00:01:01.799> take<00:01:02.069> out<00:01:02.279> as

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:02.459 
function a beaver dam can take out as

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:06.080 
function a beaver dam can take out as
much<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.879> 80<00:01:03.119> to<00:01:03.420> 90%<00:01:03.779> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> dirt<00:01:05.280> silt<00:01:05.939> from

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
much as 80 to 90% of the dirt silt from

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.590 
much as 80 to 90% of the dirt silt from
the<00:01:06.240> water

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the water

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.319 
the water

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
and cloudiness in the water has been

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.740 
and cloudiness in the water has been
rated<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> most<00:01:11.340> important<00:01:12.030> limiting

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
rated as the most important limiting

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
factor for aquatic life so wetlands

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.459

clean<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> water<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.390> two<00:01:18.600> ways<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:18.840> way<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
clean the water in two ways one way is

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.319 
clean the water in two ways one way is
by<00:01:19.710> removing<00:01:20.429> the<00:01:20.579> dirt<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.210> other

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
by removing the dirt the other

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.539 
by removing the dirt the other
settlements<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> water<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.070> other<00:01:23.100> way

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
settlements on the water the other way

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.620 
settlements on the water the other way
is<00:01:24.479> by<00:01:24.960> breaking<00:01:25.619> down<00:01:26.240> toxic<00:01:27.240> slike

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
is by breaking down toxic slike

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.139 
is by breaking down toxic slike
pesticides<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> water<00:01:29.460> this

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
pesticides that are in the water this

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.290 
pesticides that are in the water this
occurs<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:31.159> microorganisms<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
occurs with microorganisms and

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.040 
occurs with microorganisms and
and<00:01:34.230> for<00:01:35.070> example<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.670> pesticide<00:01:36.300> act<00:01:36.600> Racine

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
and for example the pesticide act Racine

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.080 
and for example the pesticide act Racine
that's<00:01:37.440> been<00:01:37.680> involved<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.820> fraud

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that's been involved in the fraud

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
that's been involved in the fraud
deformities<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.200> broken<00:01:40.590> down<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.190> gonna<00:01:41.460> be

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
deformities is broken down with gonna be

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.610 
deformities is broken down with gonna be
Burt<00:01:41.820> Rutan<00:01:41.970> hands<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:43.320> quite<00:01:43.590> a

Burt Rutan hands so that's quite a

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.240 
Burt Rutan hands so that's quite a
benefit<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:45.090> other<00:01:45.270> benefits<00:01:45.900> include<00:01:46.620> blood
