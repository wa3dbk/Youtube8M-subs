00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.790
 very good all call me legendary of 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.320
 promoting smells coordinates crisis 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.390
 in the legendary hyperion del del 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.640
 plastic club shaft we have already known 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.599
 like 'the longest yard this laser goes to 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.910
 to be able to come out in the four elements 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.970
 available then he chose corrosive gene 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.439
 electric or igneous and will not release the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.869
 Worm an enemy of a vision 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.420
 secondary of the dlc that to me what 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.340
 released in a live stream 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.720
 and suddenly it turned out so the clip 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.140
 that I will leave you will be a part of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.140
 direct 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.680
 here come let's see if not the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.680
 result seems not to 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.980
 if the photo 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.400
 just green that we had seeing the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.470
 micro and all two legendary 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.110
 effect on the cryogenic result 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.210
 holy god and good what is it that has 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.340
 of special this this laser 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.510
 this laser is going to have 160 a year 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.580
 critical will have a criticized damage 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.860
 quite increased and may reach 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.350
 coming out with a knife or not depends on the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.790
 lucky you have the only pérez is that 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.740
 you can get out the only access of 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.140
 neck you have the good knife 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.570
 what is going to do this laser itself 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.820
 it's just going to be a normal laser not 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.140
 is going to have nothing special the only thing that goes 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.260
 to have is that that has an increase 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.970
 of the critical year and that's pretty good 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.800
 let's see for the bulería 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.330
 example looks pretty good because the 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.229
 critical damage that it already has in itself is 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.460
 quite high and with the cryogenic damage 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.110
 for example how it came out here now 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.490
 himself will destroy any enemy 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.320
 that there is ahead while we leave in 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.200
 the head if we do not hit him in the head 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.450
 well, we will not hurt you so much, but if 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.950
 we give in the critic even with the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.840
 skill is recovering life from 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.490
 aurelia we will recover it all the life 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.409
 when we hit the head 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.930
 let's try it a bit with the 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.770
 enemies that are up there and already 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.420
 you surely with that either 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.159
 have a lot of complication this laser 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.649
 You will see more or less if I get to 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.149
 be worth not this laser can 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.640
 get to combine very well with both 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.019
 aurelia like with billion but that 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.410
 could also get to combine well 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.170
 by the abilities of lasers even 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.120
 also with the thin one could reach 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.940
 combine quite well with the mestre if 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.370
 it does not come out of the game the only bad thing is that 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.080
 as it has rather little cadence 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.700
 minister what accumulates we would do very 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.250
 slowly so what would serve us 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.750
 is to shoot after shooting in 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.150
 the critic after accumulating already 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.130
 Many accountants put an end to the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.630
 other characters with nice can reach 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.690
 come well but as it has so little 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.790
 cadence I do not think it would come to him 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.400
 well, I would prefer at least with 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.370
 anise I would prefer a continuous laser and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.930
 with the club trap put in the club drop 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.060
 I prefer less explosive weapons 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.310
 from my point of view the club also 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.650
 better with the most explosive is that with 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.500
 with laser itself and with the macro jaén and case 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.810
 of fire of any element so 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.880
 nothing this has been everything I think that I have 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.860
 liked the video if it has served you 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.040
 something is good to support first 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.510
 kill this one so do not read so that it ends 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.400
 the video always in conditions worth 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.750
 I hope you liked the video if 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.220
 has served you well since you know then 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.690
 dale like comment if you have any 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.250
 suggestion and subscribe for more than 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.250
 have a good day and until next time 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.680
 information about the legendary I 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.630
 I said that until May 14 there was 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.790
 an increase of legendaries in return 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.610
 two important 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.420
 it's totally like that if it's been like that but not 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.420
 100%
