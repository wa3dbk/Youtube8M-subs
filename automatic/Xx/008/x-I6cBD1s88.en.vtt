00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.769 
interiors but all of these furniture
fabrics<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.550> one<00:00:23.820> thing<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.090> common<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
fabrics have one thing in common and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.769 
fabrics have one thing in common and
that<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.949> they<00:00:26.130> are<00:00:26.279> super<00:00:27.090> easy<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
that is is that they are super easy to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.030 
that is is that they are super easy to
clean<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:29.240> they<00:00:30.240> don't<00:00:30.449> fade<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.740> color

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
clean and they don't fade and the color

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.130 
clean and they don't fade and the color
is<00:00:32.130> saturated<00:00:33.000> all<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.420> way<00:00:33.570> through<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
is saturated all the way through the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.959 
is saturated all the way through the
material<00:00:34.230> they're<00:00:34.739> 100%<00:00:35.489> solution-dyed

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
material they're 100% solution-dyed

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
material they're 100% solution-dyed
which<00:00:36.390> means<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> dyeing<00:00:37.440> process<00:00:37.590> is

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
which means that the dyeing process is

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.790 
which means that the dyeing process is
carried<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.379> before<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:41.420> substance<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
carried out before the substance is

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.799 
carried out before the substance is
actually<00:00:43.800> turned<00:00:44.070> into<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.760> yarn<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.629> is

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
actually turned into the yarn that is

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.520 
actually turned into the yarn that is
used<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.350> weave<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.920> material<00:00:47.399> so

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
used to weave the material so

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.479 
used to weave the material so
essentially<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> guess<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.920> I'm<00:00:50.039> saying<00:00:50.340> in

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
essentially I guess what I'm saying in

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.069 
essentially I guess what I'm saying in
layman's<00:00:50.879> terms<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
layman's terms is that you get a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.810 
layman's terms is that you get a
material<00:00:52.469> where<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.860> colors<00:00:53.309> will<00:00:53.579> stay

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
material where the colors will stay

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
material where the colors will stay
bright<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.539> vibrant<00:00:54.870> throughout<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.860> life

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
bright and vibrant throughout the life

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.720 
bright and vibrant throughout the life
of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> material<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.440> if<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.800> gets<00:00:58.980> dirty<00:00:59.280> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of the material and if it gets dirty you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.279 
of the material and if it gets dirty you
can<00:00:59.910> clean<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.329> that's<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:00.989> we're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
can clean it that's what we're going to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.709 
can clean it that's what we're going to
talk<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.359> could<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.539> into

great detail about cleaning Sunbrella

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.539 
great detail about cleaning Sunbrella
fabric<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:07.619> when<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> comes<00:01:08.280> right

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
fabric but really when it comes right

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.570 
fabric but really when it comes right
down<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.979> little<00:01:10.979> more<00:01:11.010> than<00:01:11.189> just

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
down to it it's little more than just

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
down to it it's little more than just
common<00:01:12.000> sense<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.570> clean<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.049> material<00:01:13.590> the

common sense to clean this material the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.679 
common sense to clean this material the
material<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.520> rugged<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.420> there<00:01:15.570> really

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
material is so rugged that there really

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.990 
material is so rugged that there really
isn't<00:01:15.960> anything<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.759> will

- I want to caution you on is that the
bleach<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.740> cause<00:01:35.100> problems<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
bleach can cause problems with the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
bleach can cause problems with the
stitching<00:01:36.600> thread<00:01:36.930> depending<00:01:37.770> upon<00:01:37.890> what

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
stitching thread depending upon what

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.510 
stitching thread depending upon what
type<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.549> thread<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.210> used<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:41.070> you've<00:01:41.310> got

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
type of thread was used so if you've got

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.910 
type of thread was used so if you've got
a<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:41.790> bad<00:01:42.060> stain<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.190 
a really bad stain have at it with the
bleach<00:01:44.159> otherwise<00:01:44.970> what<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.329> suggest<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
bleach otherwise what I suggest is that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.830 
bleach otherwise what I suggest is that
