00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.080
 plays somewhere tourist Folkerts elections 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.459
 on the green grass 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.729
 as you can easily see twenties 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:17.859
 Gold Rostocker though overseas and 2000 points 90 + me and 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.199
 you will and will be 2000 or 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.159
 Moscow RPO 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.159
 for the first time in their history of leadership 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.470
 graphically and in that is not enough 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.880
 not good 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.470
 1990 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.470
 yet we were not 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.410
 and the game to 1 1-endstand 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.800
 no problem 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 we want children with the game 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.150
 Sarah Connor 7 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.890
 There is no tactic 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.110
 up to 7000 meters you can play for example two minutes that is 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.840
 stupid 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.270
 pulled through because the system could secondly increased under two minutes 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.800
 there value 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.780
 on the computer in the call 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.780
 sda 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.260
 that does not apply to my game 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.400
 However, I would also have to because of which protested 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.730
 I already have the world 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.880
 with around 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 that are clear 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.040
 Do not hesitate 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.040
 it could not be 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.909
 but I think you can see what it's all about, that's what Chanel does 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.899
 I've got the impression that they can defend if you let them in estimated 5 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.840
 seconds 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.100
 Cheers 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100
 yes that's really difficult who was like that 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.549
 big trees 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.249
 Christians find where you can throw in money to play that one gave it in so 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.249
 a time when not everyone confirmed with 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.719
 I think that will be very nice 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.909
 maybe that helps too 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.909
 Everyone is looking for a team in Munich a man against each other 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.379
 this is a tough game in between so I do not mind 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.929
 saves 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:43.879
 I find 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.609
 said the graphic is and 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.269
 Giffords is new 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.269
 in us and looked pale 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.849
 but as I said that she finally flows 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.469
 bought 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.849
 that's not true 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.849
 Football that is Austria 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.179
 because with the cast has 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.599
 and maybe that will come to play here 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.719
 I can recommend that 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.719
 that's nothing, of course 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.369
 No Â«Der SpiegelÂ» 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.989
 I like it 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.989
 or looks bad it goes on penalties 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.129
 I never could 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:33.939
 this one has 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.849
 I enjoy it 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.909
 we will test a few other football games soon 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.289
 for example 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.139
 and sugar for the sector 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.009
 You compare what the graphics are about 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.839
 until then 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:51.409
 have fun and stay booked
