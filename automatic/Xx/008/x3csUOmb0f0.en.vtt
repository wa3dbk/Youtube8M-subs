00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello very good that of subscribers here 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.790
 we are with this new video of gta 5 and 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.280
 it was here with brackets you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.960
 we were researching here in this area 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.880
 lost at sea as you are seeing 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.080
 I 'm going to put the location and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.490
 for those who do not know in this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.350
 location is a boat 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.760
 sunk well it turns out that brass 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.380
 We were so bored that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
 So we decided to investigate a little bit 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.789
 this boat is worth this boat that has a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.670
 very curious thing is that in this 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.189
 boat is written two words is worth 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.619
 translated into Spanish they would say something 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.690
 Well, security is not the first thing 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.520
 what are you going to see now when diving is worth 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.800
 you'll see that there are the letters and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 they put the security is first ole 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 eggs ole your eggs that put that in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.530
 a ship that is sunk and made a 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.340
 fucking but good not only is that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.120
 but what you are going to see 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 continuation 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.700
 there you see that we snuck inside 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.500
 inside this boat is worth it is also a 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.050
 click ok it came out we went without 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.610
 more we were reading those letters and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.289
 just then I got too close 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.000
 get too close and I went straight 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.350
 inside the boat is a git then 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.539
 logically that is not worth even to take 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.799
 for ass because if you get in here 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.060
 and you stay inside you are going to drown 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.850
 because life is still low 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.710
 do you lose the air and then 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.689
 what comes next is that they fuck you 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.399
 alive we're going to die but good to 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.399
 we were excited because good 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.810
 we had not found that is a cliché 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.490
 whether you like it or not and we had 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.470
 found we had gone like this without further 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.119
 so yes because we do 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.799
 these things when we get bored like 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.780
 I say then we start to investigate things 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.250
 of this kind those are the letters that you 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.619
 I said it's worth translating into Spanish 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.179
 it would be like how security is what 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.610
 First, safety is the first and 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.350
 the ship is sunk and basically 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 done a fucking shit is worth it 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.100
 a lot of security would not be worth it is very 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.509
 curious to put that on a boat 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.069
 sunk but good is fine 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.350
 alright so nothing basically just 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.030
 I wanted to show you this to me 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.679
 it seemed quite curious enough 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.330
 about everything about colarnos inside this 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.369
 boat because you want me not to say 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.349
 It's a cliché that did not work like that 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.849
 more and we would have had to show what 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.439
 we go basically so if you have 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.390
 liked do not hesitate to give him the one that 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.890
 give you favorites to the video and subscribe 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.149

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.220
 been a pleasure to be here with you and 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.640
 see you in the next video until the 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.179
 next

 goodbye
