that front of the guide and I cut it a

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.880 
that front of the guide and I cut it a
90<00:02:24.400> degree<00:02:24.520> angle<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.620> top<00:02:29.830> is

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
90 degree angle so that the top is

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:41.740 
90 degree angle so that the top is
pretty<00:02:30.550> much<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.730> same<00:02:31.120> length<00:02:31.480> as<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.200> front

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.190 

pivot<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.340> comb<00:02:50.670> from<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.360> crown<00:02:51.629> over<00:02:52.079> to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
pivot the comb from the crown over to

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.940 
pivot the comb from the crown over to
here<00:02:55.099> pardon<00:02:57.349> again<00:02:58.349> about<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.650> one<00:02:58.920> inch

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
here pardon again about a one inch

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.300 
here pardon again about a one inch
section<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:01.079> I<00:03:01.230> follow<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.799> up<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.189> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
section and I follow that up to the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.470

crown

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.630 

and<00:03:10.050> then<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.319> pivot<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.800> cone<00:03:11.010> from<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.370> crown

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and then I pivot the cone from the crown

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.520 
and then I pivot the cone from the crown
over<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.150> here<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.580> do<00:03:15.140> still<00:03:16.140> using<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
over to here and do still using the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:25.830 
over to here and do still using the
front<00:03:16.769> as<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> guide

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.120 

are<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:26.860> doing<00:03:27.129> this

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.860 

and<00:03:31.130> then<00:03:31.370> it's<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.730> same<00:03:31.970> i<00:03:32.270> visit<00:03:32.599> the<00:03:32.630> comb

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
and then it's the same i visit the comb

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.110 
and then it's the same i visit the comb
over<00:03:33.200> here<00:03:33.650> on<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:34.640> side<00:03:36.610> in<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.730> front<00:03:38.000> of

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
over here on this side in the front of

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:48.320 
over here on this side in the front of
the<00:03:38.270> guy

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:59.670 

I'm<00:03:48.900> down<00:03:49.200> here

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.209 

and<00:04:00.040> then<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.549> check<00:04:00.939> my<00:04:01.180> work<00:04:01.469> and<00:04:02.469> I<00:04:02.859> need<00:04:03.040> the

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:08.200 
and then I check my work and I need the
great<00:04:03.459> angle

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.120 

it's<00:04:08.630> pretty<00:04:08.870> much<00:04:08.990> guarantees<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.650> this

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
it's pretty much guarantees that this

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.090 
it's pretty much guarantees that this
site<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.670> same<00:04:10.910> length<00:04:11.180> as<00:04:11.360> this<00:04:11.540> side

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
site is the same length as this side

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.590 
site is the same length as this side
