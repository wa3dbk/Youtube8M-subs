00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 until for a few assassins who is currently busy the who prevents that 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.019
 it is a super nice mix of the Belgian police says they don't know 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.019
 Yes 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.370
 the market is formed for music 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.020
 a man from his account and young people vzw who and submitted to the young 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.260
 artists who promote in the music awards and design 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.690
 how wonderfully able to calculate the congress comes to us and specifically 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.370
 contrast is a whole day she sees her exhibition and we want to 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.540
 street art 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.830
 in the b series and so we want to offer young artists the opportunity to participate 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.490
 nevertheless it is good to tell the murderers that in Antwerp a little more about it 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.500
 this exhibition country it is new the leak on nineteen points it is whole 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 eclectic it is a very nice opportunity to exhibit more 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.700
 and rd i score is kind of the sign of europe russia it's up here 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.250
 with counted katerina prospect exhibition 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.380
 and we go a little further down the exhibition 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.180
 invite Russian artists with fifteen young people and then those 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.180
 let Paul Jansen work together 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 those are unattractive people with open arms received by certain 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.290
 who are very creative should think what she is not in nl so she has 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.980
 taken into a space 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.040
 r in this exhibition and is cooperating a bit 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.030
 nonsense they have their own and interpretation of contrast is a belly and russia 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.499
 washington shoots next then i think it's a nice idea but this is total 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:23.749
 something else 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.749
 no see that i thought i got initially 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.239
 but i see it choice i see it as art it is it is it more than one 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.679
 pure graffiti 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.629
 they are no longer on the mat black only so I save him busy with it too 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.199
 busy with systems with hanging up with the crates it hurt in it 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.769
 their village 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.129
 anp this is just it is too much to mention but it is free 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.880
 go one step further than the rest 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.010
 that falls on women have also been with psv for a long time but it is one 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.349
 a matter of time 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.349
 this one itself 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.619
 however, it is also itself 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.619
 Did you know that the city was still in Russia for five to six years 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.919
 and for them this has been an incredible source of inspiration and is according to 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.209
 we believe discussed with ideas 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.349
 what 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.230
 now we are of course also to blame, certainly certainly 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:22.279
 we can't complain about what they made but the ball is a step further 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.279
 to go 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.590
 when they can situate a quote to a 2005 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.229
 that came from 2005 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.489
 a blend 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.699
 of different doctors who inspire young people 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.839
 And then I am not talking about the contemporary art that is in the sea and 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:46.449
 beach but am I talking about art 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.760
 the boy about young people who see everywhere in magazines 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.359
 the margins in the soup or television 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.039
 on the street 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:58.799
 And the combination of all that for one that is Grafiti that is that is the chance 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.209
 heart 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.579
 that is what his doctors are choking on that combination of that institute 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.579
 2010 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.219
 that also something that very nice message that the message 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.019
 you can get 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.650
 but I get your accidents with fireworks and the very nice enthusiastic aex 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:19.900
 hamilton from mclaren 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.900
 saved life 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.960
 in short, a groin injury mother sees 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.960
 lucky for that 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.629
 utrecht on sunday 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.919
