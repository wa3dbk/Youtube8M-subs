this when I was watching up so if you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.320 
this when I was watching up so if you
know<00:02:15.890> that's<00:02:16.160> movie<00:02:16.520> then<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.210> is<00:02:17.300> just

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
know that's movie then this is just

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.050

so it's supposed to actually look like
this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.840

know my camera is being weird um then
here's<00:04:00.540> an<00:04:00.690> apple<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.170> know<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.470> paint<00:04:01.709> didn't

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
here's an apple I know the paint didn't

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.830 
here's an apple I know the paint didn't
really<00:04:02.280> turn<00:04:02.430> out<00:04:02.640> very<00:04:02.700> nicely<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.420> color<00:04:03.660> is

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
really turn out very nicely the color is

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.240 
really turn out very nicely the color is
really<00:04:03.959> off<00:04:04.230> as<00:04:04.380> well<00:04:04.560> what's<00:04:04.830> wrong<00:04:05.070> with

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
really off as well what's wrong with

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.120 
really off as well what's wrong with
this<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.640> know<00:04:06.540> but<00:04:07.140> yeah<00:04:07.350> The<00:04:07.650> Painted<00:04:07.830> I'm

this I know but yeah The Painted I'm
elite<00:04:08.370> are<00:04:08.550> not<00:04:08.670> very<00:04:08.820> good<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:10.200> guess<00:04:10.380> I'll

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
elite are not very good so I guess I'll

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.960 
elite are not very good so I guess I'll
have<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.709> improve<00:04:11.010> on<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.190> then<00:04:11.670> there's

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
have to improve on that then there's

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.860 
have to improve on that then there's
this<00:04:12.410> this<00:04:13.410> grape<00:04:13.770> one<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.850> grape<00:04:15.150> candy<00:04:15.390> and

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
crackly and stuff I really don't know

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.949 
crackly and stuff I really don't know
how<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> improve<00:04:20.430> on<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:20.850> like<00:04:21.299> it's<00:04:21.600> just

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
how to improve on that like it's just

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.290 
how to improve on that like it's just
normal<00:04:22.169> for<00:04:22.560> translucent<00:04:23.160> clay<00:04:23.280> then<00:04:24.030> there's

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
normal for translucent clay then there's

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
flavors and last but not least I made

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.530 
flavors and last but not least I made
this<00:04:28.770> little<00:04:29.040> bottle<00:04:29.250> charm<00:04:29.669> called<00:04:29.970> culture

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
this little bottle charm called culture

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.860 
this little bottle charm called culture
in<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.810> bottle<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.740> there's<00:04:31.919> actually<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.669> a

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870

and Chinese coins but a couple of them
and<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:47.700> made<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.090> bottle<00:04:48.450> with<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.810> Chinese

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
and I made the bottle with a Chinese

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.600 
and I made the bottle with a Chinese
Green<00:04:50.449> Dragon<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.050> wrapped<00:04:51.440> around<00:04:51.620> it<00:04:51.949> so

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
Green Dragon the wrapped around it so

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.040 
Green Dragon the wrapped around it so
it's<00:04:52.729> kind<00:04:52.910> of<00:04:52.940> like<00:04:53.090> basically<00:04:53.479> i<00:04:53.660> don't<00:04:53.960> know

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
it's kind of like basically i don't know

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.629 
it's kind of like basically i don't know
like<00:04:54.229> protecting<00:04:54.710> its<00:04:54.860> culture<00:04:55.190> or<00:04:55.310> something

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
like protecting its culture or something

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.210 
like protecting its culture or something
i<00:04:55.759> don't<00:04:55.819> know<00:04:55.940> it's<00:04:56.630> weird<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.410> guess<00:04:57.650> the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
i don't know it's weird I guess the

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.800 
i don't know it's weird I guess the
dragon<00:04:58.610> didn't<00:04:58.910> really<00:04:59.150> turn<00:04:59.330> out<00:04:59.509> like<00:04:59.720> I

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
dragon didn't really turn out like I

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.879 
dragon didn't really turn out like I
expected<00:04:59.840> it<00:05:00.380> a<00:05:00.710> little<00:05:01.699> bit<00:05:01.880> more<00:05:02.000> ugly<00:05:02.560> but<00:05:03.560> I

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
expected it a little bit more ugly but I

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.249 
expected it a little bit more ugly but I
do<00:05:04.099> hope<00:05:04.490> you<00:05:04.669> guys<00:05:04.789> like<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.090> so<00:05:06.050> i'll<00:05:06.169> be

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
making more of these cultures in a

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.809 
making more of these cultures in a
bottle<00:05:08.210> I'm<00:05:08.449> gonna<00:05:08.990> attempting<00:05:09.620> france<00:05:10.460> next

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
bottle I'm gonna attempting france next

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.620 
bottle I'm gonna attempting france next
and<00:05:11.210> um<00:05:12.220> probably<00:05:13.220> going<00:05:13.819> to<00:05:13.880> be<00:05:13.970> doing<00:05:14.120> like

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
and um probably going to be doing like

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.140 
and um probably going to be doing like
oh<00:05:15.220> hell<00:05:16.220> no<00:05:16.280> i<00:05:16.430> don't<00:05:16.669> really<00:05:16.759> know<00:05:16.880> it'd<00:05:17.120> be

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
oh hell no i don't really know it'd be

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.360 
oh hell no i don't really know it'd be
india<00:05:17.630> or<00:05:18.020> something<00:05:18.530> just<00:05:18.919> leave<00:05:19.250> your

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
india or something just leave your

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.980 
india or something just leave your
comments<00:05:19.699> below<00:05:19.729> what<00:05:20.090> kind<00:05:20.389> of<00:05:20.419> culture<00:05:20.690> in<00:05:20.930> a

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
comments below what kind of culture in a

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.480 
comments below what kind of culture in a
bottle<00:05:21.289> should<00:05:21.440> make<00:05:21.770> like<00:05:21.800> what<00:05:22.130> country<00:05:22.460> are

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
bottle should make like what country are

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.879 
bottle should make like what country are
you<00:05:22.580> form<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:23.289> just<00:05:24.289> let<00:05:24.440> me<00:05:24.530> know<00:05:24.680> what<00:05:24.830> kind

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
you form and just let me know what kind

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.070 
you form and just let me know what kind
of<00:05:25.070> cultures<00:05:25.520> so<00:05:26.180> i<00:05:26.210> probably<00:05:26.539> will<00:05:26.750> make<00:05:26.900> more

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
of cultures so i probably will make more

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.659 
of cultures so i probably will make more
of<00:05:27.110> these<00:05:27.349> and<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:27.770> thought<00:05:27.919> will<00:05:28.280> be<00:05:28.310> really

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
of these and I thought will be really

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.370 
of these and I thought will be really
cool<00:05:28.880> then<00:05:29.120> maybe<00:05:29.270> I'll<00:05:29.419> put<00:05:29.570> more<00:05:29.870> different

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
cool then maybe I'll put more different

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.650 
cool then maybe I'll put more different
stuff<00:05:30.650> inside<00:05:31.039> so<00:05:31.699> that<00:05:31.789> will<00:05:31.970> let<00:05:32.509> you<00:05:32.630> know

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
stuff inside so that will let you know

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.360 
stuff inside so that will let you know
resemble<00:05:33.199> it<00:05:33.289> more<00:05:33.500> but<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:33.740> guess<00:05:34.039> this<00:05:34.250> is

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
resemble it more but I guess this is

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.950 
resemble it more but I guess this is
quite<00:05:34.550> obvious<00:05:34.699> that<00:05:34.970> it's<00:05:35.210> from<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.539> Chinese

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
quite obvious that it's from a Chinese
