which<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> cards<00:01:18.780> features<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.310> shape

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
which the cards features which are shape

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.200 
which the cards features which are shape
color<00:01:21.390> number<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:22.530> shading<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.280> either<00:01:23.880> all

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
color number or shading are either all

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.050 
color number or shading are either all
the<00:01:24.420> same<00:01:24.720> or<00:01:25.020> all<00:01:25.409> different<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:26.549> example<00:01:26.970> in

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the same or all different for example in

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
the same or all different for example in
this<00:01:27.210> set<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.960> cards<00:01:28.350> share<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> same

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
this set all the cards share the same

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.859 
this set all the cards share the same
color<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.880> different<00:01:30.329> shape<00:01:30.570> different

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
color have different shape different

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.890 
color have different shape different
shade<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.950> different<00:01:32.640> numbers<00:01:33.000> therefore

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
shade and different numbers therefore

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.069 
shade and different numbers therefore
it's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> set<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.759> example<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.780> not

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it's a set in this example it is not

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.800 
it's a set in this example it is not
because<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.040> two<00:01:38.100> cards<00:01:38.700> share<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.540> same

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
because now two cards share the same

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.980 
because now two cards share the same
shade<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.700> combination<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> set

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
shade or this combination here is a set

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.440 
shade or this combination here is a set
as<00:01:43.110> well<00:01:43.350> even<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> doesn't<00:01:44.729> look<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.210> one

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
as well even if it doesn't look like one

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.109 
as well even if it doesn't look like one
why<00:01:46.110> because<00:01:47.009> all<00:01:47.220> their<00:01:47.460> features<00:01:47.700> are

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
why because all their features are

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.899 
why because all their features are
different<00:01:48.420> number<00:01:49.350> shade<00:01:49.740> shape<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.549> color

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
different number shade shape and color

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.630 
different number shade shape and color
once<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.810> set<00:01:52.049> has<00:01:52.200> been<00:01:52.350> announced<00:01:52.619> player<00:01:53.340> see
