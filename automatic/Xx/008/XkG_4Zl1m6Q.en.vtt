00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.740
 my diplomas are the only country boilermaker at the base 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.889
 and the seasoned vocational baccalaureate that is followed by internship training 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.750
 of assault to become% cell until then we believe it would last 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.339
 six months internally 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.230
 on the Argenteuil website 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.409
 the low boots and six months we were offered a cdd no hiring 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.410
 that touring seniority club at dassault I worked two years and 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.949
 half on their floor 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.850
 and then I have been involved in civil work 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.950
 the falcon 900 for a first time and j which is the interior of the health 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.070
 the agent worker in robotics on falcone 900 

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:47.639
 it's this 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.340
 I am a fitter 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.580
 so build it 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.920
 in particular part of the plane my job is to 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.730
 to do here the seam between the skeleton and the skin of the city is 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.730
 true that Paris is safe they have right away 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.370
 it's something more banal we say it's still a job 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.990
 not very well-known 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.189
 but that's true right after the training be put right now 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.380
 like that on the plane it's something 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.860
 exciting help 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.590
 individuals say it is rewarding for the person in itself to say 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.870
 yes I participated art 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.220
 to the construction of a plane in fact there are so many hours of work m 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.600
 study 2 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.240
 that it's his hand five years ending somewhere we participate 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.650
 to a huge project it's the responsibility of purpose to validate a 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.310
 work in standards and 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.860
 it's a plane that flies so we can not afford to 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 to do anything and everything 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.710
 so we are brought to move 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.380
 on the same site 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.010
 and even afterwards depending on the skills 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.050
 on the sites in the provinces 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.400
 or abroad m to do so called building sites 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.190
 or repair yards or yards on modifications we do not 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.220
 you will currently leave a young player places his supervisor 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.220
 we are not here 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.519
 I take care of the score I take care of 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.969
 opening of my work 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.999
 my ass to manage a little bit the job too my supervisor 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.189
 how to get information super 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.879
 on this future post 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.129
 which may be that will open for me later 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.189
