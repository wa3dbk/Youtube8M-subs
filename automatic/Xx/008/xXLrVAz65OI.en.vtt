00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
is impossible to have even in nature sir

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.550 
is impossible to have even in nature sir
yes<00:01:22.220> my<00:01:22.430> slightly<00:01:22.820> imperfect<00:01:23.479> circle<00:01:24.200> it's

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
yes my slightly imperfect circle it's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.469 
yes my slightly imperfect circle it's
actually<00:01:24.979> bucketing<00:01:25.580> down<00:01:25.610> at<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.060> moment

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
actually bucketing down at the moment

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.700 
actually bucketing down at the moment
that<00:01:26.600> reminds<00:01:26.930> me<00:01:27.020> we<00:01:27.229> should<00:01:27.259> get<00:01:27.470> some<00:01:27.680> more

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
that reminds me we should get some more

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.949 
the final step the closeby gadget thingy
we've<00:02:43.310> got<00:02:43.490> very<00:02:43.760> technical<00:02:44.360> turns<00:02:44.569> on<00:02:44.840> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
we've got very technical turns on the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.410 
we've got very technical turns on the
perfect<00:02:47.500> Bowl<00:02:48.500> yeah<00:02:48.920> we<00:02:49.430> know<00:02:49.610> exactly<00:02:50.030> what

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
perfect Bowl yeah we know exactly what

perfect Bowl yeah we know exactly what
it's<00:02:50.600> called<00:02:50.900> it's<00:02:51.380> ossification<00:02:52.190> holder

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
it's called it's ossification holder

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.590 
it's called it's ossification holder
thingy<00:02:53.120> cover<00:02:53.540> cover<00:02:53.989> sink<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.530> that

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
thingy cover cover sink and that

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.580 
thingy cover cover sink and that
completes<00:02:56.600> step<00:02:56.989> 4

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
completes step 4

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:15.280 
completes step 4
let's<00:02:57.920> see<00:02:58.130> where<00:02:58.310> we<00:02:58.430> go
