in theory it sounds simple there are
three<00:01:44.640> steps<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.420> first<00:01:45.570> one<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
three steps the first one is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.760 
three steps the first one is
electrolysis

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
electrolysis

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.289 
electrolysis
that's<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> water<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.790> split<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:48.090> into

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that's when the water is split up into

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.810 
that's when the water is split up into
hydrogen<00:01:48.869> oxygen<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.530> conversion<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
hydrogen oxygen at conversion is the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
hydrogen oxygen at conversion is the
second<00:01:51.149> step<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:52.049> when<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> carbon

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
second step that is when the carbon

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.620 
second step that is when the carbon
dioxide<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.369> turned<00:01:53.610> into<00:01:53.759> carbon<00:01:54.149> monoxide
