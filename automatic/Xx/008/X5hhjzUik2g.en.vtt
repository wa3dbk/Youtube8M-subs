squirrels of course they are adapted to
life<00:01:22.220> underground<00:01:22.640> right<00:01:23.120> so<00:01:23.330> they<00:01:23.480> all<00:01:23.540> have

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
life underground right so they all have

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.300 
life underground right so they all have
tunnels<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.290> burrows<00:01:24.590> underground<00:01:24.920> they

tunnels and burrows underground they

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.310 
tunnels and burrows underground they
collect<00:01:25.670> food<00:01:25.910> bring<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:26.810> down<00:01:26.990> underground

on<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:28.160> store<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.820> they<00:01:28.970> also<00:01:29.150> have<00:01:29.510> their

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
on to store and they also have their

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.810 
on to store and they also have their
colonies<00:01:30.560> with<00:01:30.830> young<00:01:31.100> men<00:01:31.400> to<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.610> ground

flying<00:01:35.330> squirrels<00:01:35.660> they<00:01:36.500> actually<00:01:37.190> will<00:01:37.790> use

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
flying squirrels they actually will use

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.900 
flying squirrels they actually will use
the<00:01:38.960> trees<00:01:39.260> for<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:39.860> number<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.640> different

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
the trees for a number of different

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.970 
the trees for a number of different
things<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.660> big<00:01:41.840> trees<00:01:42.110> sort<00:01:42.410> of<00:01:42.500> offer<00:01:42.620> them

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
things the big trees sort of offer them

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.260 
things the big trees sort of offer them
protection<00:01:43.960> they<00:01:44.960> are<00:01:45.050> from<00:01:45.230> shelter<00:01:46.270> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
protection they are from shelter the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.400 
protection they are from shelter the
tree<00:01:47.480> and<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.660> squirrel<00:01:47.900> started<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.290> each

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
tree and the squirrel started to each

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.410 
tree and the squirrel started to each
other<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.650> job<00:01:49.220> if<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.640> will<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.210> tree

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
other a job if you will so the tree

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.050 
other a job if you will so the tree
provides<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:51.110> home<00:01:51.460> habitat<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.730> provides

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
provides that home habitat it provides

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.540 
provides that home habitat it provides
food<00:01:53.390> etc<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.380> then<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.710> squirrel<00:01:54.980> in<00:01:55.250> turn

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
food etc and then the squirrel in turn

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.970 
food etc and then the squirrel in turn
actually<00:01:56.210> utilizes<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.260> seeds<00:01:57.560> from<00:01:57.860> the

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
actually utilizes the seeds from the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.610 
actually utilizes the seeds from the
trees<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.640> moves<00:01:59.060> them<00:01:59.270> around<00:02:00.020> away<00:02:00.380> from

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
trees and moves them around away from

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.560 
trees and moves them around away from
the<00:02:00.710> mother<00:02:00.890> tree<00:02:01.130> which<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.370> very<00:02:02.120> good<00:02:02.390> from

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
the mother tree which is very good from

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:13.630 
the mother tree which is very good from
a<00:02:02.690> plant's<00:02:02.990> perspective

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.430 

you<00:02:14.030> might<00:02:14.240> see<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> squirrel<00:02:14.900> running<00:02:15.319> around

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
you might see a squirrel running around

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.620 
you might see a squirrel running around
chasing<00:02:15.890> each<00:02:16.190> other<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.700> people<00:02:17.420> might

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
chasing each other and people might

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.510 
chasing each other and people might
think<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:17.990> just<00:02:18.080> play<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:18.920> usually<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.250> lot

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
think it's just play it's usually a lot

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.820 
think it's just play it's usually a lot
more<00:02:19.580> than<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.600> mammals<00:02:21.020> are<00:02:21.170> really

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
more than that and mammals are really

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.610 
more than that and mammals are really
complicated<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.700> squirrels<00:02:23.170> have<00:02:24.170> very

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
complicated in squirrels have very

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.770 
complicated in squirrels have very
complex<00:02:25.040> behaviors<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.730> might<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.480> food

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
complex behaviors it might have food

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.750 
complex behaviors it might have food
resources<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:27.530> too<00:02:27.709> so<00:02:27.920> they'll<00:02:28.069> have<00:02:28.100> sort

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
resources there too so they'll have sort

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.750 
resources there too so they'll have sort
of<00:02:28.819> squabbling<00:02:29.420> sort<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.110> over<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:31.070> certain

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
of squabbling sort of over a certain

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.430 
of squabbling sort of over a certain
trees<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.300> territories<00:02:32.840> around<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.260> tree

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
trees and territories around that tree

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.170 
trees and territories around that tree
so<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.680> might<00:02:33.830> be<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.010> territorial<00:02:34.670> behavior

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
so it might be a territorial behavior

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.650 
so it might be a territorial behavior
they're<00:02:35.660> seeing<00:02:35.930> other<00:02:36.860> times<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.660> getting

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
they're seeing other times it's getting

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.300 
they're seeing other times it's getting
to<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:38.810> breeding<00:02:39.110> season<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.070> there'll<00:02:40.280> be

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
to be breeding season and so there'll be

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.340 
to be breeding season and so there'll be
what<00:02:40.910> appears<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.360> be<00:02:41.480> written<00:02:41.870> playful

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
what appears to be written playful

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.170 
what appears to be written playful
behavior<00:02:42.500> among<00:02:43.160> among<00:02:43.640> adults<00:02:43.880> when

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
behavior among among adults when

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.580 
behavior among among adults when
actually<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.600> might<00:02:44.750> be<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.170> beginning

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
actually it might be just the beginning
