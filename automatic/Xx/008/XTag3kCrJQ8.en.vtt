00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:42.080 

you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.770 

all<00:00:43.090> right<00:00:43.379> doing<00:00:44.379> a<00:00:44.469> video<00:00:44.620> today<00:00:44.890> on<00:00:45.010> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
all right doing a video today on the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.970 
all right doing a video today on the
harmonic<00:00:46.780> minor<00:00:47.019> scale<00:00:47.909> so<00:00:48.909> I<00:00:49.829> thought<00:00:50.829> it's

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
harmonic minor scale so I thought it's

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.849 
harmonic minor scale so I thought it's
pretty<00:00:51.250> cool<00:00:51.489> because<00:00:52.480> it<00:00:53.260> gives<00:00:53.649> it<00:00:53.829> that

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
pretty cool because it gives it that

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.560 
pretty cool because it gives it that
kind<00:00:54.399> of<00:00:54.550> spooky<00:00:55.239> metal<00:00:56.640> guitar<00:00:57.640> solo<00:00:58.239> sound

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
kind of spooky metal guitar solo sound

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.380 
kind of spooky metal guitar solo sound
and<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.510> it's<00:01:01.839> the<00:01:01.960> minor<00:01:02.409> scale<00:01:03.390> if

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
and what it is it's the minor scale if

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.520 
and what it is it's the minor scale if
you<00:01:04.809> know<00:01:04.930> what<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.140> is

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
you know what that is

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.800 
you know what that is
with<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> major<00:01:06.460> seventh<00:01:07.149> instead<00:01:07.570> of<00:01:07.659> the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
with a major seventh instead of the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.210 
with a major seventh instead of the
minor<00:01:08.049> seventh<00:01:08.500> so<00:01:10.110> here's<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.320> 4e<00:01:11.860> here's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
minor seventh so here's the 4e here's

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.779 
minor seventh so here's the 4e here's
what<00:01:12.399> it<00:01:12.490> is

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
what it is

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:18.330 
what it is
e<00:01:12.940> f-sharp<00:01:13.590> G<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.729> B<00:01:15.729> C<00:01:15.759> D<00:01:16.539> sharp<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:17.920> D<00:01:18.039> sharp

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
e f-sharp G a B C D sharp so the D sharp

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.210 
e f-sharp G a B C D sharp so the D sharp
is<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.610> difference<00:01:19.140> between<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.770> harmonic

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
is the difference between the harmonic

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.919 
is the difference between the harmonic
minor<00:01:21.340> scale<00:01:21.700> in<00:01:21.819> the<00:01:21.909> minor<00:01:22.119> scale<00:01:22.360> normally

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
minor scale in the minor scale normally

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.590 
minor scale in the minor scale normally
for<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.560> minor<00:01:23.740> scale<00:01:23.920> would<00:01:24.130> be<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> deep<00:01:24.670> but

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
for the minor scale would be a deep but

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.450 
for the minor scale would be a deep but
in<00:01:25.720> this<00:01:25.810> case<00:01:26.050> it's<00:01:26.259> got<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.649> major<00:01:26.920> seventh

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
in this case it's got the major seventh

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.450 
in this case it's got the major seventh
of<00:01:27.670> these<00:01:27.789> sharp<00:01:28.770> here's<00:01:29.770> what<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.009> looks<00:01:30.250> like

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
of these sharp here's what it looks like

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.010 
of these sharp here's what it looks like
on<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.729> fretboard<00:01:31.500> hey<00:01:32.500> by<00:01:32.679> the<00:01:32.710> way<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.810> is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
on the fretboard hey by the way this is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.430 
on the fretboard hey by the way this is
the<00:01:35.490> guitar<00:01:36.490> aerobics<00:01:37.360> book<00:01:37.659> by<00:01:37.899> Troy<00:01:38.200> Nelson

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
the guitar aerobics book by Troy Nelson

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.330 
the guitar aerobics book by Troy Nelson
I<00:01:39.429> picked<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.240> up<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.690> was<00:01:41.350> very<00:01:41.860> pleasantly

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
I picked it up and was very pleasantly

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.029 
I picked it up and was very pleasantly
surprised<00:01:42.729> with<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.780> it's<00:01:43.990> got<00:01:44.170> lots<00:01:44.590> finger

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
surprised with it it's got lots finger

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.429 
surprised with it it's got lots finger
exercises<00:01:45.640> which<00:01:46.090> are<00:01:46.240> great<00:01:46.509> but<00:01:47.170> then<00:01:47.320> it's

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
exercises which are great but then it's

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.170 
exercises which are great but then it's
got<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:47.829> got<00:01:47.979> some<00:01:48.130> music<00:01:48.430> theory<00:01:48.700> like<00:01:49.030> this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
got so got some music theory like this

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:59.600 
got so got some music theory like this
harmonica<00:01:49.509> minor<00:01:49.840> scale<00:01:50.969> okay<00:01:54.509> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.810 

II<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.770> fifth<00:02:02.010> string<00:02:02.250> there<00:02:02.670> on

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
II so that's the fifth string there on

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:17.510 
II so that's the fifth string there on
the<00:02:03.030> seventh<00:02:03.540> fret<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:06.920> f-sharp<00:02:08.690> G<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:12.530> B<00:02:13.530> C<00:02:16.520> D

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the seventh fret the f-sharp G a B C D

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.190 
the seventh fret the f-sharp G a B C D
sharp<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.990> back<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.350> e<00:02:19.380> e<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.750> again<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.080> was

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
sharp and back to e e so again that was

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:49.510 
sharp and back to e e so again that was
the<00:02:22.770> F<00:02:23.520> sharp<00:02:23.940> G<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:25.070> B<00:02:26.070> C<00:02:26.900> D<00:02:27.900> sharp<00:02:28.230> E

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.620 

and<00:02:50.520> then<00:02:50.910> if<00:02:51.660> if<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.500> know<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.850> notes<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
and then if if you know the notes on the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.840 
and then if if you know the notes on the
on<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.230> fretboard<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.890> then<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.580> you

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
on the fretboard and then you can you

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.450 
on the fretboard and then you can you
can<00:02:57.030> move<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.600> scale<00:02:58.020> all<00:02:58.500> around<00:02:58.860> so

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
can move that scale all around so

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.850 
can move that scale all around so
remember<00:02:59.760> we<00:02:59.910> ended<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.270> wanting<00:03:00.480> him<00:03:00.860> well

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
remember we ended up wanting him well

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.220 
remember we ended up wanting him well
here<00:03:02.100> here<00:03:02.520> here's<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.180> scale<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.990> further

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
here here here's the scale going further

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.970 
here here here's the scale going further
than<00:03:04.920> that

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.600 

or<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.129> can<00:03:13.280> do<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.459> here<00:03:18.099> well<00:03:19.099> you<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.489> do<00:03:19.580> it

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
or you can do it here well you can do it

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:53.240 
or you can do it here well you can do it
just<00:03:19.940> on<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.090> first<00:03:20.360> string

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.570 

so<00:03:54.250> that's<00:03:54.400> been<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.930> harmonic<00:03:55.930> minor<00:03:56.110> scale

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
so that's been the harmonic minor scale

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.330 
so that's been the harmonic minor scale
hope<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:57.760> guys<00:03:57.910> like<00:03:58.120> that
