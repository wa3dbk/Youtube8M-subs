00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
today I'm going to explain what a brain

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.600 
today I'm going to explain what a brain
freeze<00:00:14.990> is<00:00:15.170> all<00:00:15.410> about<00:00:15.680> and<00:00:15.950> most<00:00:16.160> importantly

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
freeze is all about and most importantly

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.250 
freeze is all about and most importantly
how<00:00:16.760> to<00:00:16.790> prevent<00:00:17.060> it<00:00:17.240> ok<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:17.630> we've<00:00:17.840> all<00:00:18.020> been

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
how to prevent it ok so we've all been

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.020 
how to prevent it ok so we've all been
there<00:00:18.290> yeah<00:00:18.830> wolfing<00:00:19.280> down<00:00:19.310> your<00:00:19.610> ice<00:00:19.730> cream

drinking a milkshake and bam you get
that<00:00:21.980> robbing<00:00:22.640> headache<00:00:23.060> what<00:00:23.660> causes<00:00:24.020> it

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
that robbing headache what causes it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.179 
that robbing headache what causes it
yeah<00:00:24.290> you<00:00:24.470> know<00:00:24.560> well<00:00:24.680> this<00:00:24.800> is<00:00:24.920> something

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
yeah you know well this is something

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.530 
yeah you know well this is something
really<00:00:25.340> common<00:00:25.820> that<00:00:25.970> happens<00:00:26.270> when<00:00:26.420> you<00:00:26.510> eat

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
really common that happens when you eat

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.120 
really common that happens when you eat
something<00:00:26.840> cold<00:00:27.200> very<00:00:27.470> quickly<00:00:27.770> and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
something cold very quickly and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.290 
something cold very quickly and
technically<00:00:28.550> what's<00:00:28.760> happening<00:00:29.150> is<00:00:29.270> that

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
technically what's happening is that

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.090 
technically what's happening is that
when<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:29.570> cold<00:00:29.780> food<00:00:30.140> or<00:00:30.380> drink<00:00:30.619> touches<00:00:30.980> the

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
when a cold food or drink touches the

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.040 
when a cold food or drink touches the
roof<00:00:31.280> of<00:00:31.400> your<00:00:31.430> mouth<00:00:31.550> it<00:00:31.970> sets<00:00:32.480> off<00:00:32.570> an<00:00:32.750> alert

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
roof of your mouth it sets off an alert

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.660 
roof of your mouth it sets off an alert
to<00:00:33.230> your<00:00:33.260> brain<00:00:33.650> that<00:00:33.890> says<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.340> temperature

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
to your brain that says the temperature

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.979 
to your brain that says the temperature
in<00:00:34.760> your<00:00:34.790> mouth<00:00:35.000> is<00:00:35.180> changing<00:00:35.629> and<00:00:35.720> so<00:00:35.840> the

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
in your mouth is changing and so the

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.100 
in your mouth is changing and so the
body<00:00:36.430> accommodates<00:00:37.430> ok<00:00:38.330> that<00:00:38.600> causes<00:00:38.960> all<00:00:39.080> the

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
body accommodates ok that causes all the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.330 
body accommodates ok that causes all the
pain<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:39.379> pressure<00:00:39.559> but<00:00:39.800> nothing<00:00:40.070> dangerous

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
pain and pressure but nothing dangerous

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.890 
pain and pressure but nothing dangerous
is<00:00:40.699> happening<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:41.180> usually<00:00:41.449> it's<00:00:41.540> quick<00:00:41.750> you

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
is happening it usually it's quick you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.810 
is happening it usually it's quick you

done what causes that sort of aching
behind<00:00:46.220> your<00:00:46.339> eyes<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.729> in<00:00:46.820> your<00:00:46.850> forehead

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
behind your eyes and in your forehead

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
that you can get to yeah that's a really

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:49.960 
that you can get to yeah that's a really
good<00:00:48.830> question<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.370> blood<00:00:49.550> is<00:00:49.670> actually

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
good question the blood is actually

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.549 
good question the blood is actually
rushing<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:50.570> front<00:00:50.870> of<00:00:50.989> our<00:00:51.110> brain<00:00:51.379> to

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
rushing to the front of our brain to

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.320 
rushing to the front of our brain to
protect<00:00:51.979> it<00:00:52.159> when<00:00:52.280> it<00:00:52.430> kind<00:00:52.790> of<00:00:52.879> signals<00:00:53.210> this

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
protect it when it kind of signals this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.520 
protect it when it kind of signals this
temperature<00:00:53.720> change<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.199> that's<00:00:54.379> how<00:00:54.470> you

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
temperature change so that's how you

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.229 
temperature change so that's how you
feel<00:00:54.830> it<00:00:54.949> kind<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.159> in<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.370> front<00:00:55.610> of<00:00:55.820> your

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
feel it kind of in the front of your

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.240 
feel it kind of in the front of your
brain<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:56.540> behind<00:00:56.780> your<00:00:56.900> eyes<00:00:56.930> ok<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:57.830> what

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
brain and behind your eyes ok so what

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.360 
brain and behind your eyes ok so what
can<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.580> do<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:58.850> prevent<00:00:59.659> this<00:00:59.930> well<00:01:00.530> what<00:01:01.250> you

your tongue a little bit to kind of it
before<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.060> touches<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.450> roof<00:01:08.600> your<00:01:08.780> mouth

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
before it touches the roof your mouth

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.750 
before it touches the roof your mouth
technically<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.950> alert<00:01:10.159> set<00:01:10.370> off<00:01:10.460> when<00:01:10.670> it

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
technically the alert set off when it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.890 
technically the alert set off when it
touches<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.119> roof<00:01:11.210> your<00:01:11.360> mouth<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:11.630> kind<00:01:11.810> of

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
touches the roof your mouth so kind of

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.690 
touches the roof your mouth so kind of
warm<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.229> let<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:12.440> sit<00:01:12.650> for<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.890> minute<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.310> then

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
warm it let it sit for a minute and then

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.310 
warm it let it sit for a minute and then
you<00:01:13.820> can<00:01:13.940> also<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:14.299> eat<00:01:14.510> more<00:01:14.690> slowly<00:01:14.869> let

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
you can also just eat more slowly let

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.200 
you can also just eat more slowly let
your<00:01:15.470> let<00:01:15.920> your<00:01:16.040> mouth<00:01:16.159> I'm<00:01:16.340> just<00:01:16.580> easier<00:01:16.940> said

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
your let your mouth I'm just easier said

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.090 
your let your mouth I'm just easier said
than<00:01:17.330> done<00:01:17.390> talking<00:01:18.110> about<00:01:18.320> ice<00:01:18.500> cream<00:01:18.860> but

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
than done talking about ice cream but

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.410 
than done talking about ice cream but
the<00:01:19.190> idea<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.550> to<00:01:19.640> kind<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:19.940> let<00:01:20.090> your<00:01:20.270> mouth

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
the idea is to kind of let your mouth

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.390 
the idea is to kind of let your mouth
adjust<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.140> temperature<00:01:21.440> changes<00:01:21.920> ok<00:01:22.340> so

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
adjust to the temperature changes ok so

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.100 
adjust to the temperature changes ok so
those<00:01:22.610> are<00:01:22.760> all<00:01:22.880> great<00:01:23.060> preventive<00:01:23.720> measures

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
those are all great preventive measures

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.750 
those are all great preventive measures
