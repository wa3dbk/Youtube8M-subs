00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
you sell 10000 then all of a sudden you

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.070 
you sell 10000 then all of a sudden you
have<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> passive<00:02:09.090> income<00:02:09.420> model<00:02:09.570> and<00:02:09.899> that

have a passive income model and that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.860 
have a passive income model and that
radically<00:02:10.560> changes<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.070> economy<00:02:12.000> usually<00:02:12.780> to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
radically changes the economy usually to

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.870 
radically changes the economy usually to
bring<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.140> product<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.560> market<00:02:13.650> takes<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.520> year

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
bring a product to market takes a year

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
bring a product to market takes a year
and<00:02:15.060> then<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.300> have<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.540> find<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and then you have to find the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.199 
and then you have to find the
manufacturer<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.740> investor<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.820> it's

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
manufacturer and investor and so it's

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.670 
manufacturer and investor and so it's
going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> force<00:02:18.750> us<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.020> change<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.440> way<00:02:19.530> we

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
going to force us to change the way we

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.100 
going to force us to change the way we
think<00:02:19.830> about<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.490> only<00:02:20.820> buying<00:02:21.300> products<00:02:21.930> but

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
think about not only buying products but

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.630 
think about not only buying products but
how<00:02:22.260> they're<00:02:22.500> made<00:02:22.709> one<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.280> our<00:02:23.370> colleagues

something like $250 to get that part in

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.990 
something like $250 to get that part in

this<00:02:40.590> could<00:02:40.770> be<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> scary<00:02:41.190> technology<00:02:41.820> for

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
this could be a scary technology for

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.610 
this could be a scary technology for
some<00:02:42.150> companies<00:02:42.600> because<00:02:43.050> what<00:02:43.500> does<00:02:43.560> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
some companies because what does that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.770 
some companies because what does that
mean<00:02:43.920> for<00:02:44.220> seasons<00:02:44.670> now<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.360> have<00:02:45.510> infinite

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
mean for seasons now you have infinite

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.930 
mean for seasons now you have infinite
inventory<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.890> what<00:02:47.100> does<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.220> mean<00:02:47.519> for

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
inventory and what does it mean for

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.670 
inventory and what does it mean for
scarcity<00:02:48.780> which<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.470> core

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
scarcity which is one of the core

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.949 
scarcity which is one of the core
tenants<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.550> many<00:02:50.760> industries<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.570> think

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
tenants of so many industries I think

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.020 
tenants of so many industries I think
it's<00:02:52.110> very<00:02:52.440> similar<00:02:53.040> though<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.310> social<00:02:53.760> media

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
it's very similar though to social media

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.729 
it's very similar though to social media
or<00:02:54.209> other<00:02:54.239> tools<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.080> engagement<00:02:55.230> where

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
or other tools of engagement where

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.560 
or other tools of engagement where
you're<00:02:56.100> afraid<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.760> see<00:02:57.150> what<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.420> would

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
you're afraid to see what that would

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.509 
you're afraid to see what that would
mean<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.959> let<00:02:58.110> consumers<00:02:58.290> co-create<00:02:59.190> with<00:02:59.220> you

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
mean to let consumers co-create with you

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.000 
mean to let consumers co-create with you
or<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.390> really<00:03:00.660> rethink<00:03:00.930> your<00:03:01.530> traditional

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
or to really rethink your traditional

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.530 
or to really rethink your traditional
manufacturing<00:03:02.610> process<00:03:03.090> because<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.510> have

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
manufacturing process because you have

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.570 
manufacturing process because you have
so<00:03:03.780> many<00:03:03.900> middlemen<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.620> think<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.430> have

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
so many middlemen I think we just have

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.310 
so many middlemen I think we just have
to<00:03:05.700> stop<00:03:05.910> thinking<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.720> need<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.110> reach

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
to stop thinking that you need to reach

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.620 
to stop thinking that you need to reach
100,000<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.370> million<00:03:08.580> people<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.360> something

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
100,000 a million people for something

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.110 
100,000 a million people for something
to<00:03:09.780> be<00:03:09.870> successful<00:03:10.519> customizations<00:03:11.519> really

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
to be successful customizations really

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.520 
to be successful customizations really
changing<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.720> way<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.019> we<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.260> think

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
changing the way that we have to think

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.050 
changing the way that we have to think
about<00:03:13.769> design<00:03:14.220> and

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
about design and

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.360 
about design and
option<00:03:15.300> as<00:03:15.420> well

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.430 

people<00:03:19.370> who<00:03:19.670> make<00:03:20.120> money<00:03:20.300> by<00:03:20.570> selling<00:03:20.600> things

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
people who make money by selling things

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.080 
people who make money by selling things
that<00:03:21.830> are<00:03:21.950> all<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.220> sudden<00:03:22.460> easily<00:03:22.850> copy

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
that are all of a sudden easily copy

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.880 
that are all of a sudden easily copy
with<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.450> 3d<00:03:23.810> printer<00:03:24.200> are<00:03:24.380> going<00:03:24.710> to<00:03:24.770> be

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
with a 3d printer are going to be

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.350 
with a 3d printer are going to be
worried<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.280> people<00:03:25.580> are<00:03:25.760> gonna<00:03:25.880> be<00:03:26.000> making

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
worried that people are gonna be making

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.390 
worried that people are gonna be making
unauthorized<00:03:26.690> copies<00:03:27.560> with<00:03:27.980> those<00:03:28.160> 3d

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
unauthorized copies with those 3d

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.680 
unauthorized copies with those 3d
printers<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:29.000> think<00:03:29.240> one<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
printers and I think one of the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.140 
printers and I think one of the
challenges<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.950> them<00:03:31.100> is<00:03:31.280> going<00:03:31.490> to<00:03:31.580> be<00:03:31.700> how

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
challenges for them is going to be how

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.180 
challenges for them is going to be how
do<00:03:32.210> I<00:03:32.300> react<00:03:32.660> objects<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:33.710> are<00:03:33.830> artistic

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
do I react objects that are artistic

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.710 
do I react objects that are artistic
objects<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:34.820> are<00:03:34.940> objects<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.600> would

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
objects that are objects that you would

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.390 
objects that are objects that you would
hire<00:03:35.900> an<00:03:36.170> artist<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.590> make<00:03:36.620> those<00:03:37.070> things<00:03:37.280> are

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
hire an artist to make those things are

3d<00:04:00.470> printing<00:04:00.860> right<00:04:01.040> now<00:04:01.220> is<00:04:01.459> it's<00:04:01.940> very

3d printing right now is it's very

3d printing right now is it's very

things decided the best thing to do

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.330 
things decided the best thing to do
would<00:04:26.960> take<00:04:27.230> their<00:04:27.470> time<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:27.740> their<00:04:28.100> money

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
would take their time and their money

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.460 
would take their time and their money
and<00:04:28.580> invest<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.240> in<00:04:29.390> suing<00:04:29.900> everyone<00:04:30.230> they

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
and invest it in suing everyone they

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.380 
and invest it in suing everyone they
could<00:04:30.530> find<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.160> try<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.550> stop<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:32.000> progress

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
could find and try and stop the progress

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.060 
could find and try and stop the progress
of<00:04:32.479> technology<00:04:33.110> that<00:04:33.410> didn't<00:04:33.590> work<00:04:33.740> very<00:04:33.770> well

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
of technology that didn't work very well

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.219 
of technology that didn't work very well
and<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.700> hope<00:04:34.940> is<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.510> these<00:04:35.810> creators

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
and so the hope is that these creators

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.020 
and so the hope is that these creators
when<00:04:36.530> they<00:04:36.620> see<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:36.950> new<00:04:37.010> technology<00:04:37.790> they

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
when they see this new technology they

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.490 
when they see this new technology they
capture<00:04:38.479> some<00:04:38.600> of<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.750> upside<00:04:39.110> they<00:04:39.320> say<00:04:39.470> oh

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
capture some of the upside they say oh

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.260 
capture some of the upside they say oh
wait<00:04:39.860> this<00:04:40.070> can<00:04:40.280> change<00:04:40.310> my<00:04:40.700> business<00:04:41.030> for<00:04:41.210> the

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
wait this can change my business for the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.180 
wait this can change my business for the
better<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:41.720> they<00:04:42.020> do<00:04:42.080> that<00:04:42.440> it's<00:04:42.830> a<00:04:42.919> hard

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
better and they do that it's a hard

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.040

in Japan there's a company that's taking
sonogram<00:05:33.810> day<00:05:34.020> so<00:05:34.470> they<00:05:34.590> scan<00:05:34.919> a<00:05:34.950> pregnant

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
sonogram day so they scan a pregnant

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.740 
sonogram day so they scan a pregnant
woman's<00:05:35.610> belly<00:05:35.729> and<00:05:36.270> they're<00:05:36.360> able<00:05:36.479> to

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
woman's belly and they're able to

years to build but what these scientists

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.629 
years to build but what these scientists
do<00:06:00.900> is<00:06:01.110> they<00:06:01.260> find<00:06:01.620> areas<00:06:02.039> that<00:06:02.070> are<00:06:02.250> damaged

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
do is they find areas that are damaged

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.580 
do is they find areas that are damaged
they<00:06:02.880> make<00:06:03.060> CAD<00:06:03.360> replicas<00:06:03.930> of<00:06:04.050> those<00:06:04.169> damaged

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
they make CAD replicas of those damaged

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.440 
they make CAD replicas of those damaged
areas<00:06:04.889> and<00:06:05.130> they<00:06:05.190> print<00:06:05.490> them<00:06:05.639> in<00:06:05.729> concrete<00:06:05.970> so

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
areas and they print them in concrete so
