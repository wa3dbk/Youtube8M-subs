00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
remember it was my workshop floor with

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.890 
remember it was my workshop floor with
the<00:00:07.740> recalcitrant<00:00:08.639> head<00:00:09.210> fastened<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.780> place

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
the recalcitrant head fastened in place

the recalcitrant head fastened in place
it<00:00:10.559> just<00:00:10.679> would<00:00:10.889> not<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.450> you'd<00:00:12.450> be<00:00:12.630> well

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230

delighted to tell these finally separate
you<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.039> actually<00:00:17.220> see<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.609> head<00:00:17.760> there<00:00:19.400> with

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
you can actually see the head there with

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.810 
you can actually see the head there with
a<00:00:21.000> little<00:00:21.270> persuasion<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.519> gas

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
a little persuasion from the the gas

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.179 
a little persuasion from the the gas
blowtorch<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.510> see<00:00:24.660> there<00:00:24.949> what<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> did

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
blowtorch you can see there what I did

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.330 
blowtorch you can see there what I did
was<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.460> warmed<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> head<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:28.070> to<00:00:29.070> get<00:00:29.189> some

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
was I warmed the head up to get some

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
was I warmed the head up to get some
differential<00:00:29.760> movement<00:00:30.359> between<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.140> stubs

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
differential movement between the stubs

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.810 
differential movement between the stubs
there<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:33.390> top<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.290> head<00:00:34.920> now<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
taking penetrating fluid is going

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.930 
taking penetrating fluid is going
through<00:00:48.270> nicely<00:00:48.510> coming<00:00:48.960> down<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> stems<00:00:49.950> but

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
through nicely coming down the stems but

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.020 
through nicely coming down the stems but
these<00:00:51.210> 3<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.350> say<00:00:52.559> were<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.789> what<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> did

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
these 3 as I say were not so what I did

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.139 
these 3 as I say were not so what I did
was<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.390> took<00:00:54.539> they<00:00:54.870> will<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.039> head<00:00:56.250> as

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
was I took they will see the head as

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.459 
was I took they will see the head as
 carpals<00:00:58.980> next<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.969> their<00:01:00.260> outside<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
 carpals next to their outside and

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
 carpals next to their outside and
there's<00:01:01.590> two<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.980> same<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> other<00:01:02.370> side

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
there's two the same on the other side

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.840 
there's two the same on the other side
and<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.359> connect<00:01:03.719> obviously<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.850> Inlet

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and they connect obviously that Inlet

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.359 
and they connect obviously that Inlet
there<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.020> did<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.320> blew<00:01:07.560> hot<00:01:08.159> air

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
there so what I did was I blew hot air

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.399 
there so what I did was I blew hot air
into<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.830> their<00:01:10.830> assembly<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
into there and their assembly of the to

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.100 
into there and their assembly of the to
doing<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.710> rotation<00:01:14.630> make<00:01:15.630> sure<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
doing this in rotation make sure I got a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.660 
doing this in rotation make sure I got a
nice<00:01:16.290> steady<00:01:16.590> temperature<00:01:17.100> throughout<00:01:17.340> so

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
nice steady temperature throughout so

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
nice steady temperature throughout so
we've<00:01:17.759> got<00:01:17.930> reasonably<00:01:18.930> steady<00:01:19.439> expansion

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
we've got reasonably steady expansion

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.940 
we've got reasonably steady expansion
what<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> did<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.390> plugged<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> hole<00:01:22.020> with

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
what I did was I plugged this hole with

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.609 
what I did was I plugged this hole with
the<00:01:23.070> end<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.840> mallet<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.439> just

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the end of a mallet that I have I just

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.810 
the end of a mallet that I have I just
set<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.799> mother<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.130> there<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.580> keep<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
set the mother in there just to keep the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.940 
set the mother in there just to keep the
heat<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> head<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.170> finally<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.619> won

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
heat in the head and I finally just won

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.190 
heat in the head and I finally just won
these<00:01:29.189> three<00:01:29.460> studs<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.630> try<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:31.020> them

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
these three studs up to try and get them

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.010 
these three studs up to try and get them
to<00:01:31.350> let<00:01:31.439> go<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> did<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.150> as

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to let go right what I did then as

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.429 
to let go right what I did then as
you'll<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> front<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.549> is

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
you'll see from the front of this is

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
you'll see from the front of this is
there's<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> bracket<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.280> rather<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.329> point

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
there's a bracket just rather the point

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.200 
there's a bracket just rather the point
here<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.110> bracket<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.729> that's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
here for a bracket to go on that's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.580 
here for a bracket to go on that's
actually<00:01:42.360> retaining<00:01:42.810> bracket<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.470> the

some penetrating fluid you stand to go

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.569 
some penetrating fluid you stand to go
through<00:01:51.840> nicely<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.070> took<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
through nicely what I do is I took and I

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.730 
through nicely what I do is I took and I
own<00:01:53.729> face<00:01:54.000> mullet<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.720> tapped<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.560> their

own face mullet and just tapped on their

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.530 
own face mullet and just tapped on their
here<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.759> actually<00:01:57.030> stands<00:01:57.270> proud

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.209 
here because that actually stands proud
at<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> front<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.990> engine<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.159> were

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
at the front of the engine and that were

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.289 
at the front of the engine and that were
just<00:01:59.250> stood<00:01:59.759> about<00:01:59.969> here

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
just stood about here

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.660 
just stood about here
so<00:02:00.990> I've<00:02:01.110> tapped<00:02:01.290> into<00:02:01.409> there<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.860> lifted<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
so I've tapped into there and lifted it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.490 
so I've tapped into there and lifted it
slightly<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.329> what<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> did<00:02:04.079> then

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
slightly so what I did then

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.210 
slightly so what I did then
whereas<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.579> took<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> Fox<00:02:06.960> wedges<00:02:07.320> some

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
whereas I took so on Fox wedges some

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.669 
whereas I took so on Fox wedges some
plastic<00:02:08.580> Fox<00:02:08.789> ledges<00:02:09.119> by<00:02:09.810> these<00:02:10.050> see<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
plastic Fox ledges by these see the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.070 
plastic Fox ledges by these see the
ridged<00:02:10.970> quite<00:02:11.970> flat<00:02:12.209> quite<00:02:12.629> soft

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
ridged quite flat quite soft

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.559 
ridged quite flat quite soft
quite

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
quite

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.759 
quite
breakable<00:02:14.159> very<00:02:15.159> very<00:02:15.760> malleable<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.650> the

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
breakable very very malleable so the

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.220 
breakable very very malleable so the
idea<00:02:18.040> here<00:02:18.129> these<00:02:19.060> are<00:02:19.299> for<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.810> laminate

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
idea here these are for a laminate

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.140 
idea here these are for a laminate
laminate<00:02:20.890> floor<00:02:21.159> kit<00:02:21.430> where<00:02:21.549> you<00:02:21.579> put<00:02:22.030> these

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
laminate floor kit where you put these

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.550 
laminate floor kit where you put these
against<00:02:22.359> the<00:02:22.510> wall<00:02:22.689> between<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.200> laminate

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
against the wall between the laminate

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.670 
against the wall between the laminate
and<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.739> floor<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:25.140> they're<00:02:26.140> quite<00:02:26.290> gentle

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
and the floor and they're quite gentle

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.920 
and the floor and they're quite gentle
so<00:02:27.519> once<00:02:27.790> I've<00:02:27.909> got<00:02:27.939> a<00:02:28.060> bit<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.390> gap<00:02:28.599> what<00:02:28.900> I

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
so once I've got a bit of a gap what I

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.890 
so once I've got a bit of a gap what I
did<00:02:29.079> was<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.260> set<00:02:29.530> these<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:31.060> Chapman<00:02:31.659> them<00:02:31.810> in

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
did was I set these in Chapman them in

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.949 
did was I set these in Chapman them in
slightly<00:02:32.109> all<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.620> way<00:02:32.709> around<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.159> head

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
slightly all the way around the head

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.309 
slightly all the way around the head
forcing<00:02:34.959> my<00:02:35.590> way<00:02:35.769> along<00:02:36.159> here<00:02:36.329> with<00:02:37.329> a<00:02:37.359> model

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
forcing my way along here with a model

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.399 
forcing my way along here with a model
several<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.340> these<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.269> then<00:02:40.540> tap<00:02:40.810> them<00:02:40.959> more

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
several of these and then tap them more

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.929 
several of these and then tap them more
and<00:02:41.530> more<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.799> more<00:02:41.889> I<00:02:42.099> lift<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.489> lift<00:02:42.670> lift

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
and more and more I lift and lift lift

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.580 
and more and more I lift and lift lift
lid<00:02:43.180> lifted<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.840> up<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.139> then<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.379> could<00:02:44.500> get

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
lid lifted it up and then I could get

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.960 
lid lifted it up and then I could get
the<00:02:44.650> fingers<00:02:44.889> underneath<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.700> kiss<00:02:45.819> of

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
the fingers underneath it just a kiss of

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.149 
the fingers underneath it just a kiss of
pulling<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.269> off<00:02:46.389> which<00:02:47.379> was<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.620> bit<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.099> a

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
pulling it off which was a bit of a

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.879 
pulling it off which was a bit of a
relief<00:02:48.489> no<00:02:48.700> brute<00:02:49.030> force<00:02:49.780> required<00:02:50.139> it<00:02:50.560> has

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
relief no brute force required it has

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.429 
relief no brute force required it has
obviously<00:02:51.129> wrecked<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.970> very<00:02:52.780> soft<00:02:53.079> copper

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
obviously wrecked the very soft copper

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.039 
obviously wrecked the very soft copper
head<00:02:54.010> gasket<00:02:54.579> but<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.239> done<00:02:55.359> absolutely<00:02:55.900> no

digging the core count I'm decoding it
you<00:03:42.909> can<00:03:43.180> see<00:03:43.419> a<00:03:43.449> little<00:03:43.750> bit<00:03:44.019> stale<00:03:44.650> whoop

I only to get in there with the little

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.219 
I only to get in there with the little
wire<00:03:56.199> brush<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.500> cleaning<00:03:57.129> that<00:03:57.159> through

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
wire brush and cleaning that through

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:03.719 
wire brush and cleaning that through
similarly<00:04:00.030> all<00:04:01.030> these<00:04:01.299> chambers<00:04:01.780> here<00:04:02.699> what<00:04:03.699> I

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:03.729 
similarly all these chambers here what I

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.330 
similarly all these chambers here what I
did<00:04:03.909> was<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.090> blew<00:04:04.269> those<00:04:04.449> through<00:04:04.810> were<00:04:04.959> there

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
did was I blew those through were there

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.869 
did was I blew those through were there
to<00:04:06.340> try<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:07.419> get<00:04:07.569> rid<00:04:07.599> of<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.870> rust<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:09.370> you

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
to try and get rid of the rust and you

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.429 
to try and get rid of the rust and you
can<00:04:10.030> actually<00:04:10.540> see<00:04:10.780> if<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:10.930> just<00:04:11.139> spin<00:04:11.319> this

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
can actually see if I just spin this

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.229 
can actually see if I just spin this
round<00:04:11.709> slightly<00:04:12.040> will<00:04:12.400> be<00:04:12.579> that<00:04:13.000> we<00:04:13.090> do

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
round slightly will be that we do

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.130 
round slightly will be that we do
expense<00:04:13.509> nicely<00:04:13.780> on<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.930> bench

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140

and then it just lifted the rest myself

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.510 
and then it just lifted the rest myself
which<00:06:08.630> was<00:06:08.900> just<00:06:09.380> me<00:06:09.530> not<00:06:10.100> something<00:06:10.430> I'd

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
which was just me not something I'd

you can see timing chest now you got the

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.540 
you can see timing chest now you got the
valve<00:06:24.540> stems<00:06:24.810> and<00:06:24.930> count<00:06:25.140> followers<00:06:25.550> I'll

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.640 
emulsified oil and as you can see cleans
off<00:06:35.820> reasonably<00:06:36.660> readily<00:06:37.050> but<00:06:37.260> it<00:06:37.350> needs

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
off reasonably readily but it needs

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.820 
off reasonably readily but it needs
cleaning<00:06:38.580> out<00:06:38.940> thoroughly<00:06:39.470> before<00:06:40.470> I<00:06:40.650> put

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
cleaning out thoroughly before I put

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.850 
cleaning out thoroughly before I put
this<00:06:40.890> back<00:06:41.100> together<00:06:41.250> and<00:06:41.940> the<00:06:42.810> old<00:06:42.960> oil<00:06:43.170> is<00:06:43.470> is

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
this back together and the old oil is is

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.190 
this back together and the old oil is is
very<00:06:44.520> much<00:06:44.790> like<00:06:45.060> sludge

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
very much like sludge

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.380 
very much like sludge
there's<00:06:46.950> no<00:06:47.040> two<00:06:47.220> ways<00:06:47.340> around<00:06:47.550> about<00:06:48.000> -<00:06:48.180> it's

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
there's no two ways around about - it's

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.340 
there's no two ways around about - it's
pretty<00:06:48.750> foul<00:06:49.080> stuff<00:06:50.510> so<00:06:51.510> that's<00:06:51.870> where<00:06:52.140> we're

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
pretty foul stuff so that's where we're

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.950 
pretty foul stuff so that's where we're
at<00:06:52.380> I<00:06:52.860> just<00:06:53.580> gone<00:06:53.850> around<00:06:53.970> with<00:06:54.360> us<00:06:54.510> see<00:06:54.780> what
