00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
oh hey guys today I'm going to show you

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.510 
oh hey guys today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:10.969> to<00:00:11.059> make<00:00:12.020> the<00:00:12.879> mechanism<00:00:13.879> of<00:00:14.180> my<00:00:14.570> opinions

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
how to make the mechanism of my opinions

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.120 
how to make the mechanism of my opinions
or<00:00:16.520> at<00:00:16.790> least<00:00:17.000> version<00:00:17.390> to<00:00:17.570> one-up<00:00:17.869> ever<00:00:18.590> into

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
or at least version to one-up ever into

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.130 
or at least version to one-up ever into
to<00:00:19.250> version<00:00:19.400> 4<00:00:19.700> so<00:00:19.939> far<00:00:20.119> is<00:00:20.509> basically<00:00:20.900> not

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
to version 4 so far is basically not

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.130 
to version 4 so far is basically not
work<00:00:21.349> I've<00:00:22.040> made<00:00:22.340> a<00:00:22.369> mini<00:00:22.580> prototype<00:00:23.149> you<00:00:24.110> can

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
work I've made a mini prototype you can

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.030 
work I've made a mini prototype you can
extend<00:00:24.649> these<00:00:24.890> button<00:00:25.279> up<00:00:25.399> and<00:00:25.610> show<00:00:26.890> so<00:00:27.890> much

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
extend these button up and show so much

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.979 
extend these button up and show so much
how<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.279> works

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
how it works

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:34.780 
how it works
and<00:00:29.989> so<00:00:30.529> let's<00:00:31.309> get<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.540> tutorial<00:00:33.790> first

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
and so let's get to the tutorial first

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.580 
and so let's get to the tutorial first
you<00:00:35.000> build<00:00:35.600> this<00:00:35.780> main<00:00:36.020> part<00:00:36.290> of<00:00:36.440> the

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
you build this main part of the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.040 
you build this main part of the
mechanism<00:00:36.850> here's<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.030> flipper<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.600> here's

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
mechanism here's the flipper and here's

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.920 
mechanism here's the flipper and here's
the<00:00:39.170> back<00:00:39.610> so<00:00:40.610> if<00:00:40.880> you<00:00:41.000> can<00:00:41.150> make<00:00:41.330> this<00:00:41.540> without

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
the back so if you can make this without

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.450 
the back so if you can make this without
me<00:00:42.080> showing<00:00:42.290> you<00:00:42.410> how<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.620> piece<00:00:43.250> by<00:00:43.430> piece

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
me showing you how to piece by piece

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.320 
me showing you how to piece by piece
then<00:00:43.940> go<00:00:44.240> ahead<00:00:46.930> first<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.230> will<00:00:48.440> need<00:00:49.330> two

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
then go ahead first you will need two

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.660 
then go ahead first you will need two
layers<00:00:50.630> of<00:00:50.840> bricks<00:00:51.380> well<00:00:51.920> depending<00:00:52.400> on<00:00:52.550> how

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
layers of bricks well depending on how

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.480 
layers of bricks well depending on how
big<00:00:52.910> your<00:00:53.090> pinball<00:00:53.480> machine<00:00:53.810> is<00:00:54.070> that's<00:00:55.070> how

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
big your pinball machine is that's how

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.479 
big your pinball machine is that's how
long<00:00:55.700> you'll<00:00:55.910> make<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:57.110> then<00:00:57.530> what<00:00:58.340> you

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
long you'll make it and then what you

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.370 
long you'll make it and then what you
need<00:00:58.730> is<00:01:00.250> I<00:01:04.420> at<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.689> beginning<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.350> a

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
need is I at the beginning of it a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.889 
need is I at the beginning of it a
technic<00:01:07.280> piece<00:01:07.520> with<00:01:07.880> holes<00:01:08.329> in<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.750> and

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
technic piece with holes in it and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.980 
technic piece with holes in it and
you'll<00:01:09.710> need<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.009> middle<00:01:10.220> one<00:01:10.690> just<00:01:11.690> put<00:01:11.840> it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
you'll need the middle one just put it

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.060 
you'll need the middle one just put it
there<00:01:12.700> then<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:14.030> will<00:01:14.150> need<00:01:14.740> another<00:01:15.740> layer

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
there then you will need another layer

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.440 
there then you will need another layer
of<00:01:16.280> bricks<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:18.580> then<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:20.030> will<00:01:20.420> need<00:01:22.450> another

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
of bricks and then you will need another

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.620 
of bricks and then you will need another
Technic<00:01:24.200> piece<00:01:24.440> one<00:01:25.430> before<00:01:25.760> but<00:01:26.000> with<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> hole

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
Technic piece one before but with a hole

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.370 
Technic piece one before but with a hole
in<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:26.930> I<00:01:27.110> mean<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:28.270> Technic<00:01:29.270> peg<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:29.960> end<00:01:30.260> of

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
in it I mean a Technic peg in the end of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.380 
in it I mean a Technic peg in the end of
it<00:01:30.500> like<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.130> then<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.000> will<00:01:32.090> put<00:01:32.150> that

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
it like that and then you will put that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.050 
it like that and then you will put that
right<00:01:32.570> there<00:01:32.799> so<00:01:33.799> and<00:01:34.159> then<00:01:34.280> make<00:01:34.460> it<00:01:34.490> long<00:01:34.790> as

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
right there so and then make it long as

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.969 
right there so and then make it long as
you<00:01:35.180> want<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.630> put<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.470> flipper<00:01:36.740> on<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
you want and put the flipper on the

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.440 
you want and put the flipper on the
other<00:01:37.100> side<00:01:37.310> too<00:01:37.520> but<00:01:37.700> just<00:01:37.850> praise<00:01:38.299> it

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
other side too but just praise it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.630 
other side too but just praise it
basically<00:01:38.780> do<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.080> mirror<00:01:39.380> or<00:01:39.560> will<00:01:40.310> flip

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
basically do the mirror or will flip

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.880 
basically do the mirror or will flip
this<00:01:40.909> piece<00:01:41.210> around<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.590> should<00:01:42.740> have

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
this piece around so you should have

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.260 
this piece around so you should have
that<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:45.070> keep<00:01:46.070> them<00:01:46.190> building<00:01:46.549> up<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:46.970> I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
that and keep them building up but I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.090 
that and keep them building up but I
have<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.720> put<00:01:47.869> this<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.350> end<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.650> stop<00:01:48.920> it

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
have to put this on the end to stop it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.240 
have to put this on the end to stop it
from<00:01:49.340> like<00:01:50.110> jamming<00:01:51.110> or<00:01:51.229> anything<00:01:51.439> then

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
from like jamming or anything then

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.039 
from like jamming or anything then
depending<00:01:52.850> on<00:01:52.970> how<00:01:53.150> big<00:01:53.570> your<00:01:53.689> pinball

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
depending on how big your pinball

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.120 
depending on how big your pinball
machine<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:54.470> again<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.950> need<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.369> technical<00:01:56.360> a

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
machine is again you need a technical a

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.380 
machine is again you need a technical a
hashtag<00:01:58.130> that's<00:01:58.220> crossing<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.060> can<00:01:59.210> be

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
hashtag that's crossing it but it can be

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:08.139 
hashtag that's crossing it but it can be
like<00:02:00.130> can<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.159> use<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:01.790> or<00:02:03.250> like<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:07.149> long

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
like can you use this or like this long

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.580 
like can you use this or like this long
or<00:02:08.929> whatever<00:02:09.819> another<00:02:10.819> tip<00:02:11.209> is<00:02:11.480> if<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:11.870> have

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
something with that in it and you can

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.180 
something with that in it and you can
just<00:02:15.499> you<00:02:15.560> see<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.799> something

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
like that you can just connect it like

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.230 
like that you can just connect it like
that<00:02:18.050> that's<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.470> do<00:02:18.590> I'm<00:02:19.460> just<00:02:19.700> making<00:02:20.180> up

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
that that's what I do I'm just making up

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.030 
that that's what I do I'm just making up
road<00:02:20.480> type<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.020> I'm<00:02:21.080> just<00:02:21.230> using<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
road type so I'm just using this and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.870 
road type so I'm just using this and
then<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.240> will<00:02:23.390> take<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:25.240> 1<00:02:26.240> by<00:02:26.450> 3<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:27.670> mean<00:02:28.670> just

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
then you will take a 1 by 3 I mean just

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.460 
then you will take a 1 by 3 I mean just
a<00:02:29.000> 3<00:02:29.270> stud<00:02:29.920> axle<00:02:30.920> piece<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:32.300> will<00:02:32.450> need<00:02:32.720> a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.990 

piece<00:02:36.470> like<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:37.010> with<00:02:37.220> axle<00:02:37.700> right<00:02:37.790> there

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
piece like this with axle right there

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
piece like this with axle right there
and<00:02:38.240> right<00:02:38.600> there

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
and right there

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.080 
and right there
just<00:02:39.320> looks<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.770> put<00:02:40.430> up<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.760> on<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
just looks like that put up that on the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.440 
just looks like that put up that on the
end<00:02:41.180> then<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.110> will<00:02:42.260> need<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.500> piece<00:02:42.920> with<00:02:43.450> an

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
end then you will need a piece with an

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.510 
end then you will need a piece with an
axle<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:44.840> one<00:02:45.110> end<00:02:45.290> peg<00:02:45.740> on<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> other<00:02:46.190> put

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
axle on one end peg on the other put

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.340 
axle on one end peg on the other put
that<00:02:46.640> on<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.850> bottom<00:02:47.050> so<00:02:48.050> you<00:02:48.140> should<00:02:48.230> have

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
that on the bottom so you should have

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.710 
that on the bottom so you should have
that<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.370> then<00:02:49.460> you<00:02:49.820> will<00:02:49.970> put<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.270> on<00:02:50.420> there

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
that and then you will put it on there

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.080 
that and then you will put it on there
like<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.990> 45<00:02:51.440> degree<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.130> 90<00:02:52.520> degree<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:52.970> go

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
like a 45 degree and a 90 degree and go

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.060 
like a 45 degree and a 90 degree and go
away<00:02:53.210> but<00:02:53.540> first<00:02:54.350> you're<00:02:54.530> going<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.680> put<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:54.950> in

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
away but first you're going to put it in

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.400 
away but first you're going to put it in
the<00:02:55.190> middle<00:02:55.340> peg<00:02:55.790> I'm<00:02:56.150> going<00:02:56.720> hole<00:02:56.960> in<00:02:57.320> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
the middle peg I'm going hole in the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.920 
the middle peg I'm going hole in the
back<00:02:57.560> there<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:58.520> should<00:02:58.670> have<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.030> then

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
back there so you should have that then

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.580 
back there so you should have that then
you<00:03:00.200> will<00:03:00.380> put<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.890> right<00:03:00.950> there<00:03:01.960> then<00:03:02.960> you

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
you will put this right there then you

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.830 
you will put this right there then you
will<00:03:03.770> have<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:07.240> now<00:03:08.240> we're<00:03:08.510> going<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.690> build

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
will have that now we're going to build

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.830 
will have that now we're going to build
the<00:03:08.990> base<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.610> depending<00:03:11.300> on<00:03:11.420> how<00:03:11.540> big<00:03:11.750> your

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
the base so of depending on how big your

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.180 
the base so of depending on how big your
pinball<00:03:12.170> machine<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.680> again<00:03:12.980> you're<00:03:13.160> just

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
pinball machine is again you're just

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.010 
pinball machine is again you're just
going<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.460> build<00:03:13.670> around<00:03:13.820> but<00:03:14.630> here's<00:03:14.870> the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
going to build around but here's the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.130 
going to build around but here's the
part<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.590> need<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:16.700> need<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:17.060> take<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.630> 1

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
part that you need you need to take a 1

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.400 
part that you need you need to take a 1
by<00:03:18.170> 2<00:03:18.380> with<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:18.800> hole<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.520> then<00:03:20.080> make<00:03:21.080> two

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
by 2 with a hole in it and then make two

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.610 
by 2 with a hole in it and then make two
studs<00:03:21.890> ahead<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:22.820> then<00:03:22.940> put<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.330> right<00:03:23.480> there

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
studs ahead and then put it right there

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.650 
studs ahead and then put it right there
just<00:03:24.620> have<00:03:24.800> that<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:25.310> then<00:03:25.940> next<00:03:26.300> you<00:03:26.540> will

just have that and then next you will

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.140 
just have that and then next you will
need<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.959> four<00:03:27.650> stud<00:03:28.810> piece<00:03:29.810> with<00:03:30.400> or<00:03:31.400> just<00:03:32.090> a

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
need a four stud piece with or just a

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150 
need a four stud piece with or just a
force<00:03:32.420> dead<00:03:32.630> axle<00:03:32.810> piece<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:33.650> get<00:03:33.830> something

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
force dead axle piece you get something

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.979 
force dead axle piece you get something
like<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.310> or<00:03:34.640> just<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.970> stopper<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.630> put<00:03:35.840> that

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
like this or just a stopper and put that

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.229 
like this or just a stopper and put that
on<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.290> end<00:03:36.520> next<00:03:37.520> you'll<00:03:37.670> need<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.880> gear

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
on the end next you'll need a gear

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.750 
on the end next you'll need a gear
stopper<00:03:38.750> just<00:03:38.780> tiny<00:03:39.230> one<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.730> put<00:03:40.730> it

beautiful and then put that on the end

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.070 
beautiful and then put that on the end
and<00:03:44.320> then<00:03:45.320> that<00:03:45.769> will<00:03:46.010> be<00:03:46.040> your<00:03:46.780> basic<00:03:47.780> slipper

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
and then that will be your basic slipper

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.990 
and then that will be your basic slipper
that<00:03:48.290> will<00:03:48.560> hit<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.010> mechanism<00:03:49.519> which<00:03:49.700> is<00:03:49.730> on

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
that will hit the mechanism which is on

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.030 
that will hit the mechanism which is on
here<00:03:50.830> and<00:03:52.269> then<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:54.739> will<00:03:54.860> just

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
here and then you you will just

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.820 
here and then you you will just
basically<00:03:55.690> build<00:03:56.690> around<00:03:56.900> your<00:03:57.410> pinball

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
basically build around your pinball

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.300 
basically build around your pinball
machine

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
machine

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.699 
machine
I'm<00:03:59.209> just<00:03:59.510> feeling<00:03:59.660> small<00:04:00.170> one<00:04:00.410> like<00:04:00.440> you

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
I'm just feeling small one like you

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:08.410 
I'm just feeling small one like you
already<00:04:00.980> saw<00:04:05.890> so<00:04:06.890> I'm<00:04:06.980> just<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.580> can<00:04:07.760> yeah<00:04:08.209> you

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
already saw so I'm just you can yeah you

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.290 
already saw so I'm just you can yeah you
to<00:04:08.630> build<00:04:08.840> all<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.680> way<00:04:09.800> around<00:04:10.070> it<00:04:10.280> but<00:04:10.489> I'm

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
to build all the way around it but I'm

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.190 
to build all the way around it but I'm
not<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.180> can<00:04:17.209> just<00:04:17.480> build<00:04:17.660> around<00:04:17.870> it

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
not so so you can just build around it

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.220 
not so so you can just build around it
like<00:04:18.320> that<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.739> that<00:04:18.890> will<00:04:19.100> fit<00:04:19.459> in<00:04:20.230> here

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
like that and that will fit in here

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:29.010 
like that and that will fit in here
right<00:04:21.650> now

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.020 

I'll<00:04:30.020> be<00:04:30.229> like<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.770> but<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.639> don't<00:04:31.729> have<00:04:31.850> to

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
I'll be like that but you don't have to

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.990 
I'll be like that but you don't have to
do<00:04:32.150> that<00:04:32.300> but<00:04:32.570> just<00:04:32.600> figure<00:04:33.259> out<00:04:33.320> how<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.880> will

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
do that but just figure out how you will

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.360 
do that but just figure out how you will
put<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.330> on<00:04:35.419> there<00:04:35.770> well<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:36.889> will<00:04:37.039> actually

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
put it on there well you will actually

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.879 
put it on there well you will actually
build<00:04:37.550> up<00:04:37.759> but<00:04:38.120> I<00:04:38.360> don't<00:04:39.169> but<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.410> don't<00:04:39.620> have<00:04:39.740> to

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
build up but I don't but I don't have to

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.520 
build up but I don't but I don't have to
since<00:04:40.100> I'm<00:04:40.250> just<00:04:40.280> making<00:04:40.729> a<00:04:40.759> prototype<00:04:41.050> yeah

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.330 

then<00:04:45.530> you<00:04:46.009> will<00:04:46.840> basically<00:04:47.840> get<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.919> rubber

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
then you will basically get a rubber

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.999 
then you will basically get a rubber
band<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:50.030> be<00:04:51.020> careful<00:04:51.410> because<00:04:51.560> it<00:04:51.740> can<00:04:51.830> like

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
band and be careful because it can like

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.010 
band and be careful because it can like
fly<00:04:52.310> out<00:04:52.520> but<00:04:52.789> you<00:04:53.240> might<00:04:53.419> have<00:04:53.509> to<00:04:53.630> double<00:04:53.780> it

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
fly out but you might have to double it

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.400 
fly out but you might have to double it
whatever<00:04:54.380> but<00:04:54.740> I<00:04:54.889> have<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.130> smaller<00:04:55.430> band<00:04:55.820> and

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
whatever but I have a smaller band and

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.900 
whatever but I have a smaller band and
you<00:04:57.410> basically<00:04:57.949> attach<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.400> on<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.639> end<00:04:58.789> of

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
you basically attach it on the end of

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.020 
you basically attach it on the end of
this<00:04:59.090> and<00:04:59.470> then<00:05:00.470> put<00:05:00.740> it<00:05:00.830> on<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.010> peg<00:05:01.460> up<00:05:01.729> there

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
this and then put it on the peg up there

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.430 
this and then put it on the peg up there
so<00:05:02.720> then<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:03.020> have<00:05:03.199> tension<00:05:03.500> and<00:05:04.720> then<00:05:05.720> if<00:05:06.350> you

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
so then you have tension and then if you

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.750 
so then you have tension and then if you
want<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:06.650> make<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:06.889> be<00:05:06.979> like<00:05:07.130> harder<00:05:07.430> to<00:05:07.460> push

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
want to make it be like harder to push

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.080 
want to make it be like harder to push
then<00:05:08.419> add<00:05:08.690> more<00:05:08.930> rubber<00:05:09.139> bands<00:05:09.410> but<00:05:10.090> doesn't

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
then add more rubber bands but doesn't

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.029 
then add more rubber bands but doesn't
matter<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.660> just<00:05:11.720> make<00:05:12.050> it<00:05:12.199> however<00:05:12.590> you<00:05:12.710> want

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
matter you just make it however you want

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.400 
matter you just make it however you want
so<00:05:13.310> it<00:05:13.460> has<00:05:13.610> tension<00:05:14.139> then<00:05:15.139> you<00:05:15.289> will

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
so it has tension then you will

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.589 
so it has tension then you will
basically<00:05:15.740> push<00:05:15.979> it<00:05:16.099> in<00:05:16.280> pull<00:05:17.090> this<00:05:17.210> all<00:05:17.449> the

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
basically push it in pull this all the

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:28.300 
basically push it in pull this all the
way<00:05:17.690> out<00:05:25.060> so<00:05:26.060> just<00:05:26.300> build<00:05:26.570> around<00:05:26.690> it<00:05:27.310> like

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
way out so just build around it like

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:38.200 
way out so just build around it like
this<00:05:28.550> like<00:05:28.849> both<00:05:29.120> another<00:05:29.449> layer<00:05:29.780> up<00:05:36.970> so<00:05:37.970> I've

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
this like both another layer up so I've

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.950 
this like both another layer up so I've
already<00:05:38.419> done<00:05:38.570> it<00:05:40.030> pull<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.180> rubber<00:05:41.570> band

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
already done it pull the rubber band
