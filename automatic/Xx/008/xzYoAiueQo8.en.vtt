 Trevor Paglin: Power and Perspective 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.880
 Gryffindor version, photo studio 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 We can put them there if you... 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.500
 no problem 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.000
 It was very dramatic when taking this photo. 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.160
 We called the National Security Agency and told them 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.390
 "We have to fly a helicopter to fly over your headquarters to take pictures." 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.309
 This matter is legal 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.629
 They said, "We don't want you to do this kind of thing." 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.390
 We retorted, "Oh, we don't need your consent." 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 "We just let you know in advance, we have to take a photo - don't shoot us when we get there." 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.899
 Later, the National Security Agency sent a few guys, about seven. 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.019
 Put them in different places at the airport to monitor the flight 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.440
 I think they always called the headquarters. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.329
 There are always specific lights on or off 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.010
 The lady who drove the helicopter baked some brownies. 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.859
 She drove around the small airport with a helicopter. 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.179
 For example, use lights to take pictures of the National Security Bureau, such as giving them a brownie cake. 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.860
 One of the reasons why I canâ€™t see the headquarters of the US National Security Bureau in this photo is 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.070
 It is surrounded by woods 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.360
 National Security Agency headquarters, public domain screen 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.480
 There are only a few photos that everyone can use. 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.300
 I took this off 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.980
 Ok 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.240
 Usually I hate the so-called "bird's eye view" or "God view top view" 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.960
 Those diagrams show proficiency in something 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.200
 It means maybe you can see these 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.420
 It is transparent, so we can understand it 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.500
 And it's a matter of insignificance, just like at our feet. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.380
 McVary, senior retoucher 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.790
 Wow 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.100
 This is what I want to try to do... 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.910
 Where did you get it! ? 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.990
 So the red frequency is really bright. 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.460
 So I just mix the blue frequency into it. 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.060
 Blue frequency is the same 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.450
 The blue frequency is a bit thick, so I dimmed it and looked at it again. 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.980
 Then I brighten it again 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.600
 The next picture is the outline 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.120
 That's right 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.880
 This is the outline... 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.620
 Now it is a contour map 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.930
 This is different from what we saw at the mall. 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.909
 It looks like a very normal place. 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.569
 Then I argue with it because on the one hand 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.560
 The plants of the National Security Agency exist in our daily lives, 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.680
 Maybe perspective makes them a bit strange. 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.569
 But in this illustration I like the part of the perspective 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.239
 Because it makes you immersive 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.109
 In a way, maybe you can think of it as a civil institution. 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.299
 Then you are part of the public 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.900
 Should contribute the same power to this organization 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.560
 By letting the lens record from this perspective, we can do this symbolically. 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.620
 Cool, so we can save some changes for the next time 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.980
 Let's take a look here 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.260
 Oh, ok. 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.380
 Do you want to be higher there? 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.120
 This is a bit big for me. 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.420
 This is some of the things I did according to this size. 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.640
 So, I just took it and shot it directly in the sun with a camera with four or five zooms. 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.020
 This idea actually comes from the painting of Tuna, "The Angle of the Sun" 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.680
 These drones are called harvesters, so it is called "harvester in the sun" 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.360
 Cool. This is what we see... 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.230
 One of the advantages of using traditional movies is that 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.930
 In that case, you can complete some whimsy 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.099
 For example, overexposed a photo and photographed directly in the sun 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.200
 Then you can still keep some swirl space 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.599
 To make sure that something can exist at the same time 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.379
 Like, I am curious if a magenta circle surrounds there 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.200
 Or it is like my eyes 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.680
 Can you understand what I mean? 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.439
 can. 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.920
 Yes, it will be very different. 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.720
 We did a lot of things, where we placed two imprints side by side. 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.389
 Then we can see "one on the right, one more cool" 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.650
 We exchange them and then we can see 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.139
 "Oh, that is on the right again." 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.879
 That's right. Said it right. 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.560
 Even put a white magnet on the opposite side of the black magnet 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.539
 I just think so, "If we can make fewer changes" 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.680
 "Like, we can focus on what is changing and focus on how to deal with these things." 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.780
 In the air, there is generally an agreement, like an open 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.200
 Or a freedom 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.040
 But the sky itself is facing us 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.040
 Drones are like punctuation 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.460
 The drone looks very good. 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.240
 correct.
