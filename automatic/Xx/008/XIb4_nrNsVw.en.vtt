00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
this is easy as that so you're just

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.150 
this is easy as that so you're just
going<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.420> let<00:01:34.570> it<00:01:34.600> basically<00:01:35.500> sit<00:01:35.770> there<00:01:35.800> for

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160

going to let it basically sit there for
a<00:01:36.190> while<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:37.420> know<00:01:37.480> maybe<00:01:37.660> give<00:01:37.870> it<00:01:37.900> five

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
a while you know maybe give it five

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.540 
a while you know maybe give it five
minutes<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.680> then<00:01:38.770> come<00:01:38.920> back<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.220> rinse<00:01:39.400> it
