played<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.420> hadn't<00:00:48.690> played<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.989> before<00:00:49.080> this

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
played it I hadn't played it before this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.479 
played it I hadn't played it before this
I<00:00:50.690> had<00:00:51.690> really<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.260> looked<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.070> how<00:00:53.220> to<00:00:53.250> get

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
I had really just looked up how to get

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.240 
I had really just looked up how to get
it<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.450> did<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.690> myself<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.500> wanted

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
it and kind of did it myself and wanted

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.740 
it and kind of did it myself and wanted
to<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:56.940> about<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.570> could

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to see what it was all about so I could

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.889 
to see what it was all about so I could
kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> compare<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.570> to<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.690> honest

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
kind of compare the two and to be honest

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.990

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
whole lot better like I really really

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.490 
whole lot better like I really really
enjoy<00:01:05.460> playing<00:01:05.520> Minecraft<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.509> I<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
enjoy playing Minecraft and I know that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.639 
enjoy playing Minecraft and I know that
it's<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.340> probably<00:01:08.790> isn't<00:01:08.970> done<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.690> you

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
it's this probably isn't done and you

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.830 
it's this probably isn't done and you
know<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.729> beta<00:01:12.060> stages<00:01:12.390> or

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
know it's just in the beta stages or

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.440 
know it's just in the beta stages or
whatever<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.710> want<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.950> call<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.190> but<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.790> just

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
whatever you want to call it but I just

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.180 
whatever you want to call it but I just
think<00:01:15.660> that<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.899> feel<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.289> minecraft<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.160> so

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
think that the feel of minecraft is so

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.940 
think that the feel of minecraft is so
much<00:01:17.490> better<00:01:17.700> um<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:19.020> might<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.289> a<00:01:19.410> fun<00:01:19.710> game

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
much better um this might be a fun game

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
much better um this might be a fun game
to<00:01:19.979> kind<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.490> mess<00:01:20.940> around<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.510> but<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
to kind of just mess around on but I

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600 
to kind of just mess around on but I
honestly<00:01:22.290> don't<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.369> pay

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
honestly don't think that I would pay

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.280 
honestly don't think that I would pay
money<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.840> um<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.869> seems<00:01:28.080> kind

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
money for this one um it just seems kind

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.719 
money for this one um it just seems kind
of<00:01:28.350> awkward<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> buttons<00:01:29.369> are<00:01:29.520> like

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
of awkward like the buttons are like

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
of awkward like the buttons are like
when<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> first<00:01:30.720> started<00:01:30.900> playing<00:01:31.260> I<00:01:31.500> thought

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
when I first started playing I thought

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.120 
when I first started playing I thought
that<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> triggers<00:01:32.689> would<00:01:33.689> actually<00:01:34.380> trigger

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that the triggers would actually trigger

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.350 
that the triggers would actually trigger
like<00:01:36.860> when<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.950> dig<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.310> dirt<00:01:38.640> or<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.090> place

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
like when you dig out dirt or like place

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.359 
like when you dig out dirt or like place
a<00:01:39.390> block<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.229> actually<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.650> bumper<00:01:40.830> so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
a block but it's actually the bumper so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.480 
a block but it's actually the bumper so
it's<00:01:41.580> just<00:01:41.700> kind<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.030> awkward<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.570> me<00:01:43.490> some

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it's just kind of awkward for me some

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
it's just kind of awkward for me some
upcoming<00:01:44.820> things<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:45.930> now<00:01:45.960> i'm

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
upcoming things as of right now i'm

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.350 
upcoming things as of right now i'm
working<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> community<00:01:47.369> montage<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:48.299> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
during the beginning of the game

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660
