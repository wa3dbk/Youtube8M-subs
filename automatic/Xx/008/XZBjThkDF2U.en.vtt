00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
the bolts that go in through the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.259 
the bolts that go in through the
transmission<00:01:03.339> right<00:01:04.339> here<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.790> need<00:01:04.940> this<00:01:05.089> to

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
transmission right here you need this to

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.630 
transmission right here you need this to
get<00:01:05.390> on<00:01:05.540> there<00:01:05.690> but<00:01:05.840> more<00:01:05.990> for<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:06.290> later

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
get on there but more for that later

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
don't want the chance of stripping or

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.630 
don't want the chance of stripping or

so<00:02:19.910> much<00:02:19.940> harder<00:02:20.330> if<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.569> have<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.840> get<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.019> 10

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
so much harder if you have to get a 10

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.250 
so much harder if you have to get a 10
mil<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.739> snake<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.550> 10<00:02:22.760> mil<00:02:22.940> up<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.330> there<00:02:23.540> to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
mil and snake the 10 mil up in there to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.470 
mil and snake the 10 mil up in there to
get<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.500> oil<00:02:24.530> pan<00:02:24.860> down

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
get the oil pan down

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.240 
get the oil pan down
now<00:02:25.900> I'm<00:02:25.959> going<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.260> transition<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.920> cutaway

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
now I'm going to transition to a cutaway

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.580 
now I'm going to transition to a cutaway
to<00:02:28.090> give<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.480> an<00:02:28.780> idea<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.140> what<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.379> looks

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
to give you an idea of what it looks

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.420 
to give you an idea of what it looks
like<00:02:30.569> better<00:02:31.569> on<00:02:31.870> camera<00:02:32.140> here<00:02:33.129> we<00:02:33.250> have<00:02:33.400> a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
like better on camera here we have a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.130 
like better on camera here we have a
motor<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.879> has<00:02:33.910> been<00:02:34.180> removed<00:02:34.510> from<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.870> car

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
motor that has been removed from the car

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.199 
motor that has been removed from the car
it<00:02:35.769> is<00:02:35.830> one<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.190> my<00:02:36.400> mini<00:02:36.670> motor<00:02:36.910> sitting

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
it is one of my mini motor sitting

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.259 
it is one of my mini motor sitting
around<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.470> can<00:02:38.620> see<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.950> four<00:02:39.280> access

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
around and you can see the four access

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.199 
around and you can see the four access
holes<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.900> get<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.260> these<00:02:41.440> four<00:02:41.769> bolts<00:02:42.209> you

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
holes to get to these four bolts you

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.900 
holes to get to these four bolts you
just<00:02:43.450> simply<00:02:43.750> slide<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.140> up<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.410> there<00:02:44.620> and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
just simply slide it up in there and

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.009 
just simply slide it up in there and
break<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.060> free<00:02:46.300> now<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.590> car<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.840> lot

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
break it free now in a car it is a lot

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.449 
break it free now in a car it is a lot
harder<00:02:50.290> because<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.680> transmissions<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
harder because the transmissions in the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.699 
harder because the transmissions in the
way<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:51.940> dark<00:02:52.209> but<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.049> allows<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:53.530> to

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
way and it's dark but this allows you to

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.300 
way and it's dark but this allows you to
see<00:02:54.010> where<00:02:54.940> these<00:02:55.120> bolts<00:02:55.510> are<00:02:55.660> at<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.250> how<00:02:57.250> you

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
see where these bolts are at and how you

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.539 
see where these bolts are at and how you
gain<00:02:57.849> access<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.510> them<00:02:59.069> and<00:03:00.069> we<00:03:00.190> are<00:03:00.220> going<00:03:00.459> to

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
gain access to them and we are going to

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.920 
gain access to them and we are going to
remove<00:03:00.849> these<00:03:01.060> three<00:03:01.530> 16<00:03:02.530> millimeter<00:03:03.010> bolts

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
remove these three 16 millimeter bolts

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.870 
remove these three 16 millimeter bolts
from<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.110> transmission<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.130> motor<00:03:06.310> now

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
from the transmission to the motor now

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.870 
from the transmission to the motor now
sometimes<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.599> hard<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.840> get<00:03:08.049> in<00:03:08.200> with<00:03:08.410> your

sometimes it's hard to get in with your

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.539 
sometimes it's hard to get in with your
ratchet<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.390> that's<00:03:10.599> what<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.549> open-ended

ratchet so that's what the open-ended
wrenches<00:03:12.849> for<00:03:13.920> will<00:03:14.920> simply<00:03:15.280> break<00:03:15.430> these

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
wrenches for will simply break these

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
slight dead blow hammer and we're going

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.890 
slight dead blow hammer and we're going
to<00:03:47.590> work<00:03:49.410> lightly<00:03:50.410> tapping<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:52.420> break<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
to work lightly tapping it to break the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.030 
to work lightly tapping it to break the
seal<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:54.459> then<00:03:55.269> we<00:03:55.450> will<00:03:55.660> lower<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.560> oil<00:03:56.799> pan

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.259 
seal and then we will lower the oil pan
down<00:03:57.340> if<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:59.549> don't<00:04:00.549> have<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.850> dead<00:04:01.090> blow

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
down if you don't have a dead blow

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.170 
down if you don't have a dead blow
hammer<00:04:01.299> like<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.350> can<00:04:02.530> use<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:03.180> normal

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
hammer like this you can use a normal

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.520 
hammer like this you can use a normal
hammer<00:04:04.389> and<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.720> piece<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.079> wood<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.350> cushion

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
hammer and a piece of wood to cushion

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.300 
hammer and a piece of wood to cushion
the<00:04:05.829> metal<00:04:07.380> but<00:04:08.380> honestly<00:04:08.709> I<00:04:08.769> guess<00:04:09.010> if<00:04:09.220> you're

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
the metal but honestly I guess if you're

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.129 
the metal but honestly I guess if you're
changing<00:04:09.519> this<00:04:09.819> out<00:04:10.030> it's<00:04:10.329> a<00:04:10.420> broken<00:04:10.660> old<00:04:10.870> pan

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
changing this out it's a broken old pan

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.330 
changing this out it's a broken old pan
so<00:04:11.349> it<00:04:11.440> really<00:04:11.590> does<00:04:11.769> about<00:04:12.040> oh<00:04:12.069> you<00:04:12.220> don't

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340
