00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
you can mash it out but you were

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.780 
you can mash it out but you were
explaining<00:02:42.080> with<00:02:42.290> pro<00:02:42.440> mode<00:02:42.650> sorry<00:02:43.220> yes

your special inputs manually but you can

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.690 
your special inputs manually but you can
still<00:02:48.380> map<00:02:48.560> button<00:02:48.890> combination<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.580> for

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
still map button combination so for

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.070 
still map button combination so for
instance<00:02:50.000> like<00:02:50.180> Zangief<00:02:50.600> spinning<00:02:50.930> pile

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
instance like Zangief spinning pile

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.229 
instance like Zangief spinning pile
driver<00:02:51.110> is<00:02:51.890> done<00:02:52.160> with<00:02:52.340> all<00:02:52.580> three<00:02:52.820> punches<00:02:53.150> or

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
driver is done with all three punches or

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.760 
driver is done with all three punches or
all<00:02:53.330> three<00:02:53.480> kicks<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:54.230> can<00:02:54.380> be<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> little

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
all three kicks it can be a little

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.699 
all three kicks it can be a little
tricky<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.220> hit<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.550> on<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.270> previous

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
tricky that hit that on the previous

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.410 
tricky that hit that on the previous
setup<00:02:57.709> here<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.550> could<00:02:58.730> map<00:02:58.940> for<00:02:59.150> instance

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
setup here so you could map for instance

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.490 
setup here so you could map for instance
all<00:02:59.540> three<00:02:59.750> punches<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.230> one<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.410> these

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
all three punches to one of these

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.229 
all three punches to one of these
buttons<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:01.280> it's<00:03:01.400> completely<00:03:01.550> configurable

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
buttons but it's completely configurable

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.060 
buttons but it's completely configurable
so<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:03.110> can<00:03:03.230> put<00:03:03.350> whatever<00:03:03.500> specials<00:03:03.980> you

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
so you can put whatever specials you

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.710 
so you can put whatever specials you
want<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:04.520> if<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.670> play<00:03:04.820> like<00:03:04.850> Ryu<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.600> can

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
want so if you play like Ryu and you can

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.510 
want so if you play like Ryu and you can
throw<00:03:05.870> fireballs<00:03:06.110> no<00:03:06.500> problem<00:03:06.920> but<00:03:07.430> you've

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
throw fireballs no problem but you've

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.320 
throw fireballs no problem but you've
