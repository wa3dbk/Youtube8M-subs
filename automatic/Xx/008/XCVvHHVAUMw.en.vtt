00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.060
 o o 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.870
 South 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.120
 greetings and welcome to said 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.820
 offer historia today we are studying 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.250
 a titan of the depths called 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.640
 nautilus characterized as being a 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.430
 secondary tank fight about 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.289
 his skills we have crushing blow 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.039
 angry boarding of the titan replica and 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.089
 grenade 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.920
 asm his story so I emitted 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:02.119
 the assumption that it was perhaps him 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.409
 who destroyed the lost city facing city 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.899
 lost in quotes the city two 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.520
 girls I realize that it was 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.880
 maybe an error what I said 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.800
 we will see that once nautilus 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.240
 and is a sailor sent by the institute of 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.840
 the war to explore the confines 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.580
 unexplored of the guardian's sea this 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.830
 expedition led him to waters 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.229
 unknowns or his crew and him 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.780
 discover a large covered area 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.270
 of a black wave that they could not 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.100
 identify although their task was 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.649
 to investigate all discoveries 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.920
 that he would do no man on board wanted 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.200
 brave this molasses apart from nautilus to 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.289
 hardly had he donned his combination of 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.789
 diving and stepping over the rail of the 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.819
 ship a carpet thing in the 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.190
 black substance the hatch 1 he clings 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.679
 to water by ap but the thing shoot with 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.470
 such violence that the ship threatened 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.619
 to capsize the other scared sailors 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.509
 then made a terrible decision 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.970
 while nautilus begging them to 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.599
 help him he took her hand and he 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.819
 threw the railings he thomas 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:11.230
 in blackish water grabbing throwing at 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.269
 passage in a desperate gesture 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.940
 the trunks ombles envelopes air and the 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.250
 dark mass of his opinion 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.310
 a little bit of his field of vision then 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.960
 all 20 months 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.840
 when our illustrious wine him and was 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.340
 become different 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.870
 the heavy combination of iron was 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.150
 become a kind of under shell 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.300
 which to hide a horrible 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.580
 truth these memories were unclear but 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.680
 a detail remains clear however he 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.870
 had been left for dead in the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.120
 darkness from the depths he was holding 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.340
 always in his hands throwing that 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.730
 belonged to the men who had it 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.700
 sentenced nautilus then left a step 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.700
 weighing in search of answers too heavy 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.940
 to swim or run he wanders to without 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.910
 be aware of the time that passes and 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.680
 everything seemed like an endless dream 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.290
 the day it resurfaced on the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.420
 shores of bill gates hours it was left 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.540
 plus the slightest trace of the man he 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.260
 was more home more families 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.300
 more life nothing was waiting for him 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.040
 scared sailors who had listened to her 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.080
 history adicare the direction of 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.580
 the institute at nautilus 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.560
 but the summoners refused to 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.830
 reveal the names of their other 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.260
 employees despite everything nautilus heard 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.260
 talk about the league of legends and there 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.590
 lives a chance to discover and punish 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.170
 those responsible for his situation consumed 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.360
 by the darkest darkness we do not 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.360
 can go ahead nautilus 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.800
 that's the story of nautilus 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.350
 so here I stay a little bit 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.700
 stunned because I thought he was 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.470
 still bound to nothingness 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.060
 I thought he was tied to the nose in 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.860
 did they get out of the void verica 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.340
 holds and that they had forced into 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.430
 the ocean 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.490
 following that in fact it would have been so 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.800
 in the ocean and would have destroyed the city 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.090
 so after that we do not know if he has 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.680
 destroyed the plug city I do not know of 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.890
 but in any case all the time that the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.630
 steps he walked he was a teenager 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.010
 forget all your life in quotation marks 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.500
 gifts he has marinated remained fairly 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.620
 long at the bottom of the abyss then the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.680
 the blackish substance that binds to on the 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.380
 I sea no idea what that little 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.460
 to be there frankly I'm in it's 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.410
 the first time in all 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.480
 stories we got this stuff 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.280
 so that already proves that in the 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.680
 oceans so the oceans around the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.160
 the mother is the keeper is not 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.590
 not empty 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.890
 there is a lot of stuff in it after 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.900
 what I do not know but then we can 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.470
 to say to each other and we can know that she is not 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.470
 not deserted 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.830
 so of course compared to nautilus the 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.320
 only ambition he has for the moment 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.919
 so his life totally destroyed is 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.320
 get revenge 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.050
 so he has the delicate ones the djeuns I know 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.340
 not why he wants maybe 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.780
 meet sight working at 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.009
 the institute of war the institute of the 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.509
 war marches with the league of legends 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.970
 sure that maybe they want and 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.919
 cross I do not know then for the 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.660
 details we have two rivals we 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.110
 have a friend who is the rival of 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.610
 nautilus and fise in my opinion fise believe 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.039
 that it is nautilus who destroyed his city 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.410
 so we do not really know this coffee 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:31.010
 nautilus in the ocean in the sea ​​forgiveness 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.199
 but we can believe that he still 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.970
 caused a lot of damage I hope we 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.010
 will learn more with the story of the 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.780
 mid or thereafter so others 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.340
 aquatic champions are going out 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.169
 in the meantime I wish you a good 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.729
 day I invite you to go answer 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.770
 to the survey on my website for 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.770
 Define the next champion salute lease 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.270
 I make you crazy 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.620
 m 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:39.220
 the body times Russia 7 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:41.919
 but it's really good actually no 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.250
 yeah the principle is not the same in 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.610
 made 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.770
 finally the base when we take care of 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.840
 years of monster animals that's 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.840
 the same but there before cons
