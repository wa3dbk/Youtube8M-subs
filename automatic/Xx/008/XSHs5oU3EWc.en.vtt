selling<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.539> eBay<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.730> I've<00:00:53.730> seen<00:00:53.789> them<00:00:54.120> go

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
selling on eBay for I've seen them go

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.470 
selling on eBay for I've seen them go
for<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.570> 70<00:00:55.110> pounds

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.060 

I'm<00:01:01.930> watching<00:01:02.380> this<00:01:02.559> through<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.920> camera

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
I'm watching this through the camera

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.770 
I'm watching this through the camera
viewfinder<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:04.000> I'll<00:01:04.059> probably<00:01:04.300> do<00:01:04.600> very

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
viewfinder so I'll probably do very

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.000 
viewfinder so I'll probably do very
badly<00:01:05.130> and<00:01:06.130> there's<00:01:06.310> not<00:01:06.400> much<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.790> show<00:01:07.030> here

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
badly and there's not much to show here

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.380 
badly and there's not much to show here
very<00:01:10.770> simplistic<00:01:11.770> but<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:13.060> thought<00:01:13.210> I'd

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
very simplistic but I just thought I'd

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.660 
very simplistic but I just thought I'd
record<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.680> show<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:14.950> just<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.550> can

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
record it and show you just so you can

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.440 
record it and show you just so you can
see<00:01:16.650> well<00:01:17.650> what<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.490> first<00:01:18.700> handheld<00:01:19.060> games

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
see well what the first handheld games

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:30.350 
see well what the first handheld games
were<00:01:19.660> like

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.000 

look

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.380 

timing<00:01:34.790> is<00:01:34.940> absolutely<00:01:35.090> critical<00:01:35.660> on<00:01:36.050> this

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.620

00:01:41.630 --> 00:02:54.780 
left buttons a bit unresponsive at all
as<00:01:42.630> well<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.200> doesn't<00:01:43.530> help

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.179

I've<00:03:06.909> got<00:03:07.180> one<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.510> them<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:07.989> really<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:09.189> don't

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
I've got one of them that really I don't

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.380 
I've got one of them that really I don't
rate<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.939> because<00:03:10.329> they<00:03:10.480> didn't<00:03:10.780> really<00:03:12.390> catch

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
rate it because they didn't really catch

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.479 
rate it because they didn't really catch
the<00:03:13.420> feel<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.170> graphics<00:03:14.680> they<00:03:15.099> kind<00:03:15.370> of

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
the feel of the graphics they kind of

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.490 
the feel of the graphics they kind of
suit<00:03:15.730> them<00:03:15.909> up<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.150> bit<00:03:16.180> made<00:03:16.569> them<00:03:16.750> look<00:03:16.900> more

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.670 

advanced<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.689> think<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.019> lost<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.409> lot<00:03:23.560> of

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
advanced and I think that lost a lot of

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:43.550 
advanced and I think that lost a lot of
the<00:03:23.769> charm

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.590 

oh<00:03:43.910> there<00:03:44.910> we<00:03:45.030> go<00:03:46.340> yeah<00:03:47.340> very<00:03:47.850> simplistic<00:03:48.569> but

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
oh there we go yeah very simplistic but

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.680 
oh there we go yeah very simplistic but
very<00:03:48.990> pliable<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.740> did<00:03:50.459> back<00:03:50.970> in<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.270> eighties

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
very pliable I did back in the eighties

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.900 
very pliable I did back in the eighties
when<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.959> played<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.650> managed<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> complete

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
when I played this I managed to complete

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.740 
when I played this I managed to complete
it<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.360> goes<00:03:54.540> up<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.370> 999<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.910> then<00:03:57.330> it's<00:03:57.540> like

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
it it goes up to 999 and then it's like

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.400 
it it goes up to 999 and then it's like
game<00:03:58.110> over<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.740> just<00:03:59.040> stops<00:04:00.080> don't<00:04:01.080> think<00:04:01.319> I

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
game over it just stops don't think I

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.050 
game over it just stops don't think I
could<00:04:01.590> do<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:01.890> now<00:04:02.100> not<00:04:02.459> playing<00:04:02.700> like<00:04:02.850> this

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
could do that now not playing like this

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.680 
could do that now not playing like this
I<00:04:03.300> would<00:04:03.450> definitely<00:04:03.959> have<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.230> practice

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
I would definitely have to practice

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.870 
I would definitely have to practice
