00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
little front with the bumper right there
it's<00:01:01.170> almost<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.649> same<00:01:01.800> design<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> lego

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
it's almost the same design as the lego

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.539 
it's almost the same design as the lego
city<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.589> came<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> couple<00:01:05.220> sets

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549

think it also came in like a couple
other<00:01:08.430> ones<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> smart<00:01:09.510> car<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:10.170> I

other ones it was like a smart car but I

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.719 
other ones it was like a smart car but I
kind<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.439> made<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.619> into<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> small<00:01:11.220> cop<00:01:11.430> cars

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
kind of made it into the small cop cars

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.190 
kind of made it into the small cop cars
that<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> cops<00:01:12.210> drive<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> show<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.049> looks

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that the cops drive in the show it looks

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.140 
that the cops drive in the show it looks
like<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.590> -<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.400> see<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> red<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> light

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
like it - you can see the red and light

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.440 
like it - you can see the red and light
red<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:15.990> blue<00:01:16.670> lights<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> top<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
red and blue lights on the top and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.940 
red and blue lights on the top and
basically<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.049> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.290> lifts<00:01:19.560> off<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
basically just kind of lifts off and you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.410 
basically just kind of lifts off and you
can<00:01:20.070> take<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> cop<00:01:20.580> out<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.270> just

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
can take the cop out just you just

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.880 
can take the cop out just you just
basically<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> cop<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.740> put

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
basically get a cop in there I just put

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.380 
basically get a cop in there I just put
like<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.130> city<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.240> there's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
like a city one in there so there's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.609 
like a city one in there so there's
nothing<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.689> too<00:01:24.900> special<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.409> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
nothing really too special about this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.320 
nothing really too special about this
obviously<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.369> almost<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> same<00:01:26.939> design<00:01:27.210> as

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
obviously it's almost the same design as

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.649 
obviously it's almost the same design as
the<00:01:27.420> other<00:01:27.540> ones<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> main<00:01:30.060> model<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the other ones so the main model of the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.880 
the other ones so the main model of the
set<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:31.020> definitely<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> Royal

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
set would definitely be the Royal

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.160 
set would definitely be the Royal
blacksmiths<00:01:32.430> car<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> race<00:01:33.780> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
blacksmiths car which is in the race and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.929 
blacksmiths car which is in the race and
I<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> best<00:01:35.310> design<00:01:35.729> it's

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I know it's not the best design it's

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
I know it's not the best design it's
just<00:01:36.000> an<00:01:36.210> okay<00:01:36.570> design<00:01:36.930> overall<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.890> can

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
just an okay design overall but you can

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
just an okay design overall but you can
see<00:01:38.189> you'd<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> driver<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> car

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
see you'd get like a driver for the car

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
see you'd get like a driver for the car
which<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.680> basically<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.189> random<00:01:41.400> guy

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
which is just basically a random guy

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.399 
which is just basically a random guy
didn't<00:01:42.060> even<00:01:42.240> specify<00:01:42.720> who<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
didn't even specify who it was in the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.660 
didn't even specify who it was in the
show<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.090> once<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:46.670> but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
show so once if I can get them out but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.710 
show so once if I can get them out but
you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.450> just

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you can see right here you just

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.170 
you can see right here you just
basically<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.200> could<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> tuxedo<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
basically I could do with a tuxedo on it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.370 
basically I could do with a tuxedo on it
kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.420> makes<00:01:51.540> sense<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.290> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
kind of makes sense I just get one of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.960 
kind of makes sense I just get one of
those<00:01:52.470> stupid<00:01:52.710> smiley<00:01:53.159> face<00:01:53.340> heads<00:01:53.549> from<00:01:53.729> city

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
those stupid smiley face heads from city

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.030 
those stupid smiley face heads from city
but<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> use<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.200> big<00:01:55.470> gold

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
but you can see I use this big gold

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.740 
but you can see I use this big gold
piece<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> microphone<00:01:57.360> thing<00:01:57.570> that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
piece as like the microphone thing that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.209 
piece as like the microphone thing that
they<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> show<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.920> thought<00:01:59.070> that

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
they have in the show and I thought that

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.740 
they have in the show and I thought that
was<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> pretty<00:01:59.520> cool<00:01:59.759> representation<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
was a pretty cool representation of it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.999 
was a pretty cool representation of it
and<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.439> how<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and you can see like how it's like the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.889 
and you can see like how it's like the
open<00:02:02.280> cockpit<00:02:02.520> type<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.030> thing<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.780> see

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
open cockpit type of thing you can see

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
open cockpit type of thing you can see
the<00:02:04.020> front<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.500> actually<00:02:04.890> very<00:02:05.040> anchored<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the front it's actually very anchored to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.800 
the front it's actually very anchored to
the<00:02:05.670> show<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> made<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.240> accurate<00:02:06.659> as

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
the show I made it as accurate as

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.070 
the show I made it as accurate as
possible<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.500> mean<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.670> does<00:02:08.819> look<00:02:08.849> old<00:02:09.119> not

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
possible I mean it does look old not

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.320 
possible I mean it does look old not
really<00:02:10.440> crazy<00:02:11.250> detailed<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> front<00:02:12.239> but

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
really crazy detailed on the front but

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.550 
really crazy detailed on the front but
it<00:02:12.420> was<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> show

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it was like that in the show

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.040 
it was like that in the show
very<00:02:13.860> detailed<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.819> sides<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.840> these

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
very detailed on the sides you get these

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.080 
very detailed on the sides you get these
blue<00:02:16.440> doors<00:02:16.739> which<00:02:17.040> open<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.520> each<00:02:17.670> side<00:02:18.060> so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
blue doors which open up on each side so

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.940 
blue doors which open up on each side so
you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.480> look<00:02:18.599> at<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> guys<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.739> on<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
you can look at the guys in that on the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.770 
you can look at the guys in that on the
on<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.489> back<00:02:20.640> obviously<00:02:20.910> are<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.330> singers

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
on the back obviously are the singers

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.720 
on the back obviously are the singers
you<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.260> basically<00:02:22.410> get<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:22.950> two<00:02:23.310> or<00:02:23.489> three

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
you just basically get like two or three

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.280 
you just basically get like two or three
of<00:02:23.849> these<00:02:23.940> singers<00:02:24.420> guys<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.690> didn't<00:02:25.110> really

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
of these singers guys I didn't really

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.870 
of these singers guys I didn't really
make<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.470> bunch<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.459> see<00:02:26.640> they<00:02:26.849> just

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
make a bunch but you can see they just

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.550 
make a bunch but you can see they just
be<00:02:27.150> random<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.630> then<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.110> guy's<00:02:28.290> actually

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
be random and then this guy's actually

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.610 
be random and then this guy's actually
Cole's<00:02:29.010> dad<00:02:29.340> right<00:02:30.269> here<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.989> black<00:02:31.200> ninjas

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
dad and you can see right here it's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.790 
dad and you can see right here it's
actually<00:02:33.120> very<00:02:33.360> cool<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.690> gave<00:02:34.349> him<00:02:34.440> probably

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
actually very cool I gave him probably

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.710 
actually very cool I gave him probably
the<00:02:34.980> best<00:02:35.160> talks<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:36.450> see<00:02:36.569> his<00:02:36.690> a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.240 
the best talks and you can see his a
mustache<00:02:37.319> right<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.680> looks<00:02:37.860> pretty<00:02:38.010> cool

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.270 
and he has that hair right there which
is<00:02:39.870> pretty<00:02:40.050> cool<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.349> wish<00:02:40.530> his<00:02:40.680> eyes<00:02:40.890> weren't

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160 
is pretty cool I wish his eyes weren't
just<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.580> black<00:02:41.760> dots<00:02:42.000> obviously<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.900> an

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
just the black dots obviously this is an

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.199 
just the black dots obviously this is an
old<00:02:43.530> head<00:02:43.830> though<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.610> overall<00:02:44.790> it's<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.090> nice

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
old head though but overall it's a nice

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.280 
old head though but overall it's a nice
little<00:02:45.480> vehicle<00:02:45.630> doesn't<00:02:46.019> really<00:02:46.140> do

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
little vehicle doesn't really do

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.630 
little vehicle doesn't really do
anything<00:02:46.560> that's<00:02:46.980> kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> flaw<00:02:47.610> about

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
anything that's kind of the flaw about

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.729 
anything that's kind of the flaw about
the<00:02:47.970> set<00:02:48.180> doesn't<00:02:48.540> really<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.870> much<00:02:49.049> well<00:02:49.709> I

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
the set doesn't really do much well I

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.530 
the set doesn't really do much well I
mean<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.489> move<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:50.910> around<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.360> guess

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
mean you can move this around I guess

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.820 
mean you can move this around I guess
but<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:51.870> not<00:02:52.140> really<00:02:52.350> much<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.650> feature

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
but it's not really much of a feature
