kind of interesting picture which I will
pull<00:00:26.099> up<00:00:26.189> right<00:00:26.369> now<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.619> basically<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.099> is

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
pull up right now so basically this is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.330 
pull up right now so basically this is
um<00:00:30.119> well<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> looks<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.500> me<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.040> leaked

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
um well it looks to me like a leaked

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.139 
um well it looks to me like a leaked
photo<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.000> new<00:00:33.180> trading<00:00:33.719> system<00:00:33.950> so<00:00:34.969> here<00:00:35.969> we

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
photo of a new trading system so here we

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.660 
photo of a new trading system so here we
have<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.750> four<00:00:37.020> regular<00:00:37.260> plus<00:00:37.710> buttons<00:00:38.010> but

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
have the four regular plus buttons but

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.750 
have the four regular plus buttons but
there<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:38.969> also<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.660> plus<00:00:40.050> button<00:00:40.320> down<00:00:40.590> here

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
there is also a plus button down here

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.670 
there is also a plus button down here
which<00:00:41.760> looks<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.020> might<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.440> able<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
which looks like you might be able to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
which looks like you might be able to
add<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.219> more<00:00:44.489> item<00:00:44.820> slots<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.300> maybe<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
add like more item slots so maybe you

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.060 
add like more item slots so maybe you
could<00:00:45.750> trade<00:00:45.960> more<00:00:46.200> than<00:00:46.379> four<00:00:46.590> items<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
could trade more than four items at a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.180 
could trade more than four items at a
time<00:00:47.210> but<00:00:48.210> also<00:00:48.570> there's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> plus<00:00:49.800> button<00:00:50.160> here

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
time but also there's a plus button here

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.630 
time but also there's a plus button here
so<00:00:50.850> maybe<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.960> could<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.770> three<00:00:53.370> for

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so maybe you could do like a three for

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.049 
so maybe you could do like a three for
two<00:00:53.820> item<00:00:54.149> trade<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.960> an<00:00:55.670> eight<00:00:56.670> for

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
two item trade or like an eight for

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.639 
two item trade or like an eight for
three<00:00:57.390> item<00:00:57.660> trade<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.079> don't<00:00:58.260> know<00:00:58.320> something

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
three item trade I don't know something

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.959 
three item trade I don't know something
like<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.550> add<00:00:59.640> more<00:00:59.820> items

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
like that so like you can add more items

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.819 
like that so like you can add more items
here<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.930> add<00:01:01.020> more<00:01:01.199> items<00:01:01.559> here

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
here and you can add more items here

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.509 
here and you can add more items here
this<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.879> um<00:01:03.500> an<00:01:04.500> update<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> training

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
this is um an update to the training

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.340 
this is um an update to the training
system<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.540> lot<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.900> people<00:01:07.200> have

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
system that I think a lot of people have

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
system that I think a lot of people have
been<00:01:07.439> looking<00:01:07.500> forward<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.520> would

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
been looking forward to it would

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.609 
been looking forward to it would
certainly<00:01:09.210> prevent<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.869> lot<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> scamming

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
certainly prevent a lot of scamming

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070 
certainly prevent a lot of scamming
because<00:01:10.950> right<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.850> since<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.780> only<00:01:12.900> do

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
because right now since you can only do

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.289 
because right now since you can only do
four<00:01:13.350> four<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.590> trades<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.939> really

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
four four one trades like it's really

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.620 
four four one trades like it's really
easy<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.930> scammed<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.670> I'm<00:01:17.670> personally

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
easy to get scammed and I'm personally

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.210 
easy to get scammed and I'm personally
really<00:01:18.659> excited<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.740> update<00:01:19.950> because

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
really excited about this update because

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.190 
really excited about this update because
it<00:01:20.340> would<00:01:20.460> definitely<00:01:21.060> um<00:01:21.330> prevent<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.020> lot<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it would definitely um prevent a lot of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.789 
it would definitely um prevent a lot of
scamming<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.970> guess<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> be

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
scamming but I guess that we have to be

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.060 
scamming but I guess that we have to be
a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.040> bit<00:01:26.250> cautious<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:27.829> there's<00:01:28.829> no

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
a little bit cautious because there's no

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.499 
a little bit cautious because there's no
proof<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:31.049> an<00:01:31.229> actual<00:01:31.590> update

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
proof that this is like an actual update

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.170 
proof that this is like an actual update
according<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.659> Kat<00:01:33.869> Kat<00:01:34.110> Kat<00:01:34.350> um<00:01:34.820> this<00:01:35.820> was

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
according to Kat Kat Kat um this was

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.690 
according to Kat Kat Kat um this was
from<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> screenshot<00:01:37.979> taken<00:01:38.430> from<00:01:38.549> an

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
from this is a screenshot taken from an

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
from this is a screenshot taken from an
account<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.150> she<00:01:39.299> logged<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.110> this

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
account that she logged into and this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
account that she logged into and this
popped<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.240> after<00:01:42.659> she<00:01:42.689> took<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
popped up but then after she took the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.109 
popped up but then after she took the
picture<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.500> didn't<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:43.890> pop<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.310> again<00:01:44.430> so

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
picture it didn't really pop up again so

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.639 
picture it didn't really pop up again so
there<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> slight<00:01:45.960> chance<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> could

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
there is a slight chance that it could

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.889 
there is a slight chance that it could
be<00:01:46.740> an<00:01:46.860> editor<00:01:47.159> or<00:01:47.189> something<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.149> had<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
be an editor or something and I had to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.289 
be an editor or something and I had to
blur<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> username<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.040> because<00:01:50.939> she

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
blur out the username here because she

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.340 
blur out the username here because she
don't<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.600> me<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> include<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
don't want me to include that in the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.120 
don't want me to include that in the
video<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:53.549> anyway<00:01:53.850> um<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.200> am<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.860> sure<00:01:56.100> if

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
video but anyway um so I am not sure if

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920 
video but anyway um so I am not sure if
this<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.369> real<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.390> maybe<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.780> was<00:01:57.899> just

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
this is real or not or maybe it was just

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.630

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
some kind of weird testing thing maybe

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.209 
some kind of weird testing thing maybe
it<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.270> was<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> weird<00:02:01.350> leaked<00:02:01.950> thing

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
like the jammer wall but if this is

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.580 
like the jammer wall but if this is
legitimate<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.659> pretty<00:02:07.049> cool<00:02:07.320> at

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
legitimate that would be pretty cool at

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.369 
legitimate that would be pretty cool at
least<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:08.009> my<00:02:08.160> opinion<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.090> tell<00:02:10.020> me<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.259> you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
enjoyed this a lot like I think this is

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.310 
enjoyed this a lot like I think this is
a<00:02:48.090> really<00:02:48.390> cool<00:02:48.570> way<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.840> get<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.170> touch<00:02:49.290> with

a really cool way to get in touch with

a really cool way to get in touch with
fans<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:50.160> only<00:02:50.370> thing<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.760> think<00:02:50.970> it's

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
fans the only thing that I think it's

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.090 
fans the only thing that I think it's
lacking<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.140> don't<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:52.830> kind

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
lacking is like I don't know it's kind

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.620 
lacking is like I don't know it's kind
of<00:02:53.220> hard<00:02:53.460> because<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.790> can't<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.210> reply<00:02:54.570> to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
of hard because you can't like reply to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.420 
of hard because you can't like reply to
individual<00:02:55.230> people<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:56.130> would<00:02:56.310> be

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
individual people it would be

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.130 
individual people it would be
interesting<00:02:56.940> if<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> could<00:02:57.210> reply<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.840> way

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.530 
but I guess you could just click on them
in<00:03:01.560> JAMA<00:03:01.770> gram<00:03:02.040> then<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.430> would<00:03:02.550> be<00:03:02.730> that

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
in JAMA gram then that would be that
