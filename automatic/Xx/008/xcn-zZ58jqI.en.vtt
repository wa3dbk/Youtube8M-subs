00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
change in ann arbor Harbaugh is a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.840

natural<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.450> job<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.460> think

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
natural for that job and and I think

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.130 
natural for that job and and I think
it's<00:01:32.970> fair<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> say<00:01:33.240> Michigan<00:01:33.659> has<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> money

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it's fair to say Michigan has the money

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
it's fair to say Michigan has the money
to<00:01:34.369> attract<00:01:35.369> them<00:01:35.520> okay<00:01:35.790> they'll<00:01:35.970> spend

to attract them okay they'll spend

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
and I think that's accurate so I'm not

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
game two recommendations one is the full

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.229 
game two recommendations one is the full
game<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.170> 49ers<00:04:07.790> but<00:04:08.790> based<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.180> what

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
game of the 49ers but based on what

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.729 
game of the 49ers but based on what
we've<00:04:09.510> seen<00:04:09.540> out<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.080> teams<00:04:10.320> in<00:04:10.560> their

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
we've seen out of the teams in their

we've seen out of the teams in their
approaches<00:04:11.100> over<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.090> first<00:04:12.330> few<00:04:12.510> weeks<00:04:12.630> of

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
approaches over the first few weeks of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.780 
approaches over the first few weeks of
NFL<00:04:13.170> action<00:04:13.350> I<00:04:13.709> think<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.400> make<00:04:14.520> a<00:04:14.550> good

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
NFL action I think you can make a good

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.729 
NFL action I think you can make a good
case<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.060> may<00:04:15.810> be<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.959> better<00:04:16.230> bet<00:04:16.470> in<00:04:16.620> this

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
case that may be the better bet in this

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.199 
case that may be the better bet in this
game<00:04:16.950> but<00:04:17.430> certainly<00:04:17.730> one<00:04:17.880> that's<00:04:18.060> worth

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
game but certainly one that's worth

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.479 
game but certainly one that's worth
considering<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.320> 49ers<00:04:19.950> minus<00:04:20.370> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
considering is the 49ers minus the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.219 
considering is the 49ers minus the
points<00:04:20.820> in<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.940> first<00:04:21.180> half<00:04:21.330> I<00:04:21.720> haven't<00:04:22.049> seen

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
points in the first half I haven't seen

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.110 
points in the first half I haven't seen
that<00:04:22.410> number<00:04:22.590> yet<00:04:22.890> but<00:04:23.070> will<00:04:23.550> estimate<00:04:23.880> it's

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
that number yet but will estimate it's

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.310 
that number yet but will estimate it's
going<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.330> be<00:04:24.419> probably<00:04:24.750> in<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.020> three

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
going to be probably in the three

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.090 
going to be probably in the three
neighborhood

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
neighborhood

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.250 
neighborhood
I<00:04:26.520> think<00:04:27.300> it's<00:04:27.390> going<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.570> be<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> shade<00:04:27.990> higher

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
I think it's going to be a shade higher

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.960 
I think it's going to be a shade higher
you<00:04:28.590> know<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.770> game<00:04:28.920> is<00:04:28.950> four<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.370> half<00:04:29.400> so

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
you know the game is four and a half so

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.920 
you know the game is four and a half so
you<00:04:30.030> can<00:04:30.120> say<00:04:30.210> well<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.420> going<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.630> be<00:04:30.690> two<00:04:30.810> or

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
you can say well it's going to be two or

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.690 
you can say well it's going to be two or
two<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.230> half<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.590> think<00:04:32.070> based<00:04:32.490> on<00:04:32.640> what

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
two and a half I think based on what

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.190 
two and a half I think based on what
we've<00:04:32.940> seen<00:04:32.970> we<00:04:33.330> might<00:04:33.540> see<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.810> little<00:04:34.020> bit<00:04:34.140> of

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
we've seen we might see a little bit of

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.470 
we've seen we might see a little bit of
a<00:04:34.320> shade<00:04:34.590> on<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.130> 49ers<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.850> first<00:04:36.180> half<00:04:36.330> so

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
a shade on the 49ers the first half so

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.780 
a shade on the 49ers the first half so
i'll<00:04:36.570> call<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.960> 49ers<00:04:37.560> minus<00:04:38.250> 3<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.550> if<00:04:38.670> it's

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
i'll call it 49ers minus 3 and if it's

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.690 
i'll call it 49ers minus 3 and if it's
less<00:04:38.970> than<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.270> good<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:41.070> 49ers<00:04:41.400> have

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
less than that good the 49ers have

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.580 
less than that good the 49ers have
another<00:04:41.940> problem<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.390> first<00:04:42.420> half<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:43.320> eagle

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
another problem the first half the eagle

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.720 
another problem the first half the eagle
is<00:04:43.620> about<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.830> lot<00:04:43.890> of<00:04:44.040> problems<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.520> first

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
is about a lot of problems the first

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.690 
is about a lot of problems the first
half<00:04:44.970> so<00:04:45.150> just<00:04:45.420> off<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.110> obvious<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.920> maybe

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
half so just off the obvious and maybe

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.950 
half so just off the obvious and maybe
the<00:04:47.820> obvious<00:04:48.120> isn't<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.390> best<00:04:48.510> way<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.750> play

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
the obvious isn't the best way to play

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.920 
the obvious isn't the best way to play
but<00:04:49.200> sometimes<00:04:49.890> it<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.430> think<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.330> 49ers<00:04:51.630> do

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
but sometimes it is I think the 49ers do

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.900 
but sometimes it is I think the 49ers do
have<00:04:52.050> an<00:04:52.140> edge<00:04:52.260> early<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.950> 49ers<00:04:53.460> have<00:04:53.670> to

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
have an edge early and the 49ers have to

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.300 
have an edge early and the 49ers have to
have<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.210> real<00:04:54.690> sense<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.110> urgency<00:04:55.260> coming<00:04:56.130> into

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
have a real sense of urgency coming into

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.560 
have a real sense of urgency coming into
this<00:04:56.400> game<00:04:56.640> they're<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.000> trouble<00:04:57.180> if<00:04:57.450> they

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
this game they're in trouble if they

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.630 
this game they're in trouble if they
lose<00:04:57.720> this<00:04:57.930> football<00:04:58.320> game<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:59.010> eagle<00:04:59.370> is<00:04:59.400> not

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
lose this football game the eagle is not

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.800 
lose this football game the eagle is not
going<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.790> say<00:04:59.910> they're<00:05:00.030> going<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.180> relax<00:05:00.540> but

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
going to say they're going to relax but

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.480 
going to say they're going to relax but
the<00:05:00.930> fact<00:05:01.140> is<00:05:01.260> they're<00:05:01.410> unbeaten<00:05:01.860> there<00:05:02.340> in<00:05:02.430> a

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
the fact is they're unbeaten there in a

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.220 
the fact is they're unbeaten there in a
lousy<00:05:02.640> division<00:05:03.210> they're<00:05:03.870> in<00:05:03.990> pretty<00:05:04.170> good

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
lousy division they're in pretty good

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.070 
lousy division they're in pretty good
shape<00:05:04.560> already<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.130> make<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.370> playoffs<00:05:06.080> again

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
shape already to make the playoffs again

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.820 
shape already to make the playoffs again
let<00:05:07.950> down<00:05:08.160> possibly<00:05:08.780> yeah<00:05:09.780> why<00:05:10.080> not<00:05:10.230> they're

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
let down possibly yeah why not they're

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.110 
let down possibly yeah why not they're
off<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.010> big<00:05:11.220> divisional<00:05:11.670> win<00:05:11.760> against<00:05:12.000> the

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
off a big divisional win against the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.700 
off a big divisional win against the
redskins<00:05:12.480> it<00:05:12.630> could<00:05:12.780> happen<00:05:12.930> it's<00:05:13.410> a<00:05:13.530> long

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
redskins it could happen it's a long

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.230 
redskins it could happen it's a long
trip<00:05:13.920> and<00:05:14.130> they're<00:05:14.250> not<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.430> hundred<00:05:14.550> percent<00:05:14.760> I

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
trip and they're not a hundred percent I

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.240 
trip and they're not a hundred percent I
think<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.140> 49ers<00:05:16.410> will<00:05:16.800> win<00:05:16.950> this<00:05:17.070> football

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
think the 49ers will win this football

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.430 
think the 49ers will win this football
game<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.940> don't<00:05:18.810> think<00:05:18.870> it's<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.200> greatest

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
game I don't think it's the greatest

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.990 
game I don't think it's the greatest
play<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.920> world<00:05:20.100> laying<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.490> points<00:05:20.790> because

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
play the world laying the points because

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.480 
play the world laying the points because
it<00:05:21.120> could<00:05:21.300> be<00:05:21.330> close<00:05:21.690> but<00:05:22.440> I<00:05:22.500> do<00:05:22.620> it<00:05:22.860> with<00:05:23.370> less

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
it could be close but I do it with less

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.280 
it could be close but I do it with less
than<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.730> touchdown<00:05:24.120> to<00:05:24.360> me<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:24.750> still<00:05:25.110> have<00:05:25.200> to

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
than a touchdown to me I still have to

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.660 
than a touchdown to me I still have to
find<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.590> winner<00:05:25.770> of<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:25.950> football<00:05:26.130> game<00:05:26.490> I

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
find a winner of the football game I

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.580 
find a winner of the football game I
think<00:05:27.000> it's<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.150> 49ers<00:05:27.690> so<00:05:27.810> there<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.020> go<00:05:28.050> to

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
think it's the 49ers so there you go to

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.480 
think it's the 49ers so there you go to
plays<00:05:28.860> in<00:05:29.100> one<00:05:29.900> 49ers<00:05:30.900> first<00:05:31.140> half<00:05:31.350> 49ers<00:05:32.280> full
