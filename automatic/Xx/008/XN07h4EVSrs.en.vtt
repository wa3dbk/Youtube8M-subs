00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
in this video I will show you how to

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.789 
in this video I will show you how to
reflow<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> PlayStation<00:00:05.339> 3<00:00:05.690> fat<00:00:06.690> or<00:00:06.960> original

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
reflow a PlayStation 3 fat or original

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.220 
reflow a PlayStation 3 fat or original
style<00:00:08.189> futsal<00:00:08.790> there<00:00:09.330> are<00:00:09.480> three<00:00:09.960> or<00:00:10.050> four

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
style futsal there are three or four

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.720 
style futsal there are three or four
different<00:00:10.349> types<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.889> motherboards<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:11.429> this

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
different types of motherboards for this

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.820 
different types of motherboards for this
console<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.540> one<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.650> later

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
console this is one of the later

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.039 
console this is one of the later
generations<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:15.030> are<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.420> backwards

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
generations that are not backwards

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.500 
generations that are not backwards
compatible<00:00:16.369> but<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.520> course<00:00:17.760> all<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.210> boards

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
compatible but of course all the boards

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.750 
compatible but of course all the boards
have<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> same<00:00:19.109> two<00:00:19.770> chips<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
have the same two chips on it the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.259 
have the same two chips on it the
graphics<00:00:21.270> processor<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> main<00:00:22.970> CPU<00:00:23.970> on

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
graphics processor and the main CPU on

graphics processor and the main CPU on
both<00:00:24.869> boards<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.710> normal<00:00:26.160> process<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
both boards the normal process are the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.700 
both boards the normal process are the
normal<00:00:27.330> graphics<00:00:27.750> chip<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.230> gives<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
normal graphics chip that gives you the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.070 
normal graphics chip that gives you the
issue<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.599> gives<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
issue is this one that one gives you the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.510 
issue is this one that one gives you the
yellow<00:00:31.260> light<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.679> death<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.130> sort<00:00:32.430> of

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
yellow light of death that sort of

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.069 
yellow light of death that sort of
points<00:00:32.850> underneath<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.570> they'll<00:00:33.690> break<00:00:33.899> them

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
points underneath and they'll break them

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.549 
points underneath and they'll break them
away

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
away

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.410 
away

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to spray the flux around the chip I'm

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.670 
to spray the flux around the chip I'm
gonna<00:01:12.240> spray<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.720> until<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.110> start<00:01:13.320> seeing<00:01:13.350> it

gonna spray it until you start seeing it
come<00:01:13.860> out<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.369> end<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.570> flip

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
come out on this end and then I flip

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.410 
come out on this end and then I flip
around<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.860> same<00:01:17.189> thing<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
around do the same thing on that in and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
around do the same thing on that in and
then<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.930> all<00:01:19.110> four<00:01:19.380> lands<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.740> gently

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
then do it on all four lands just gently

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700 
then do it on all four lands just gently
after<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.450> starts<00:01:21.750> coming<00:01:21.900> out<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
after it starts coming out in just a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.190 
after it starts coming out in just a
little<00:01:23.040> bit<00:01:23.479> get<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.780> there

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
little bit get it in there

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.490 
little bit get it in there
very<00:01:26.070> good<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.210> course<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.750> normally

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
very good and then of course I normally

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.060 
very good and then of course I normally
hit<00:01:28.740> each<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.579> these<00:01:29.759> chips<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:31.140> some

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
hit each one of these chips with some

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.850 
hit each one of these chips with some
more<00:01:32.340> flux<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.320> want<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.590> thorough

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
more flux and if you want to be thorough

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.789 
more flux and if you want to be thorough
you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.369> also<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:36.540> seek<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.170> I've

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
you can also do they seek you I've

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.560 
you can also do they seek you I've
already<00:01:38.159> done<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.520> particular<00:01:39.090> board<00:01:39.360> with

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
already done this particular board with

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.440 
already done this particular board with
the<00:01:39.689> flux<00:01:39.979> same<00:01:40.979> concept<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.150> here

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the flux same concept it's right in here

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.300 
the flux same concept it's right in here
stretch<00:01:42.750> them<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> little

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
stretch them out and just get a little

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.950 
stretch them out and just get a little
bit<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.610> each<00:01:44.759> side<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.659> make<00:01:45.780> sure

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
bit on each side so you can make sure

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.170 
bit on each side so you can make sure
the<00:01:46.079> whole<00:01:46.229> board<00:01:46.530> gets<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:47.850> once

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the whole board gets it and then once

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.749 
the whole board gets it and then once
you're<00:01:48.329> done<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.890> might<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> bracket<00:01:50.430> or

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you're done I might have a bracket or

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.300 
you're done I might have a bracket or
set<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.299> usually<00:01:51.509> put<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> make

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
set up I usually put this on so I make

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.889 
set up I usually put this on so I make
sure<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.700> stable<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.720> particular

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
sure it's stable but in this particular

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.980 
sure it's stable but in this particular
kitchen<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.799> set<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> back<00:01:56.700> onto<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.210> metal

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
kitchen just set it back onto the metal

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.850 
kitchen just set it back onto the metal
frame<00:01:58.350> or<00:01:58.590> metal<00:01:58.829> piece

I<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:02.140> purchased<00:02:02.650> a<00:02:02.950> Waggoner<00:02:03.940> heat<00:02:04.390> gun

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
I have purchased a Waggoner heat gun

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.980 
I have purchased a Waggoner heat gun
they<00:02:06.520> do<00:02:06.580> have<00:02:06.910> other<00:02:07.180> types<00:02:07.480> of<00:02:07.600> heat<00:02:07.750> guns

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
they do have other types of heat guns

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.350 
they do have other types of heat guns
out<00:02:08.229> there<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:09.039> one<00:02:09.250> has<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> low<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.149> high

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
out there this one has a low and high

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.560 
out there this one has a low and high
setting<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:12.100> one<00:02:12.340> works<00:02:12.580> great<00:02:12.910> they

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
setting this one works great they

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.680 
setting this one works great they
normally<00:02:14.440> want<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:14.800> 1200<00:02:15.670> watt<00:02:15.850> or<00:02:16.090> really

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
normally want like 1200 watt or really

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.800 
normally want like 1200 watt or really
high<00:02:16.870> wattage<00:02:17.110> one<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.740> can<00:02:18.700> do<00:02:19.090> high<00:02:19.420> heat

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
high wattage one that can do high heat

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.590 
high wattage one that can do high heat
if<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.560> get<00:02:20.710> too<00:02:20.890> low<00:02:21.070> heat<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.640> won't<00:02:21.820> work<00:02:22.090> or

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
if you get too low heat it won't work or

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.370 
if you get too low heat it won't work or
it<00:02:22.960> may<00:02:23.340> fail<00:02:24.340> after<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.180> many<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.840> many<00:02:25.930> months

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
it may fail after so many so many months

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.440 
it may fail after so many so many months
or<00:02:26.530> very<00:02:26.830> quickly<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.880> don't<00:02:28.000> want<00:02:28.209> something

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
or very quickly you don't want something

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.430 
or very quickly you don't want something
like<00:02:28.540> that

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
like that

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.830 
like that
I<00:02:29.470> normally<00:02:30.100> heat<00:02:30.400> up<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.910> chip<00:02:31.270> for<00:02:31.630> about<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I normally heat up this chip for about a

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.140 
I normally heat up this chip for about a
minute<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.410> half<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.520> do<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.790> too<00:02:33.940> long

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
minute and a half if you do it too long

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.960 
minute and a half if you do it too long
it'll<00:02:34.720> end<00:02:35.170> up<00:02:35.410> causing<00:02:35.830> other<00:02:36.190> issues<00:02:36.700> and

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
it'll end up causing other issues and

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.400 
it'll end up causing other issues and
then<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.390> won't<00:02:37.570> be<00:02:37.660> able<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.900> fix<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.260> or<00:02:38.350> if

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
then you won't be able to fix it or if

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.350 
then you won't be able to fix it or if
you<00:02:38.470> do<00:02:38.620> too<00:02:38.890> little<00:02:39.070> you'll<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:39.940> issues

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
you do too little you'll have issues

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.670 
you do too little you'll have issues
where<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.750> month<00:02:40.959> or<00:02:41.080> two<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.410> will<00:02:41.500> fail

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
where in a month or two it will fail

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.670 
where in a month or two it will fail
again<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.880> course<00:02:43.180> then<00:02:43.390> again<00:02:43.420> even<00:02:43.900> doing

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
again of course then again even doing

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.830 
again of course then again even doing
that<00:02:44.800> one<00:02:44.980> minute<00:02:45.160> 30<00:02:45.610> seconds<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.480> may

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
that one minute 30 seconds it may

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.380 
that one minute 30 seconds it may
eventually<00:02:47.200> fail<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.070> again<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:49.180> best

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
eventually fail on you again the best

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.030 
eventually fail on you again the best
solution<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.230> know<00:02:50.320> send<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.680> off<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.830> the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
solution is you know send it off to the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.490 
solution is you know send it off to the
manufacturer<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.760> get<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:51.970> fixed<00:02:52.209> but<00:02:52.570> that

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
manufacturer you get it fixed but that

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.350 
manufacturer you get it fixed but that
sucks<00:02:54.040> because<00:02:54.220> then<00:02:54.550> you<00:02:54.670> lose<00:02:54.850> all<00:02:55.000> your<00:02:55.060> dad

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
sucks because then you lose all your dad

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.070 
sucks because then you lose all your dad
on<00:02:55.570> it<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.380> don't<00:02:56.470> want<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.709> do<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:58.080> just

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
on it and you don't want to do that just

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.830 
on it and you don't want to do that just
heat<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.350> up<00:02:59.530> for<00:02:59.739> about<00:02:59.800> a<00:02:59.920> minute<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.310> half

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
heat it up for about a minute and a half

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.330 
heat it up for about a minute and a half
get<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> stopwatch<00:03:02.200> if<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.709> don't<00:03:02.890> have<00:03:03.070> one

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
get a stopwatch if you don't have one

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:25.920 
get a stopwatch if you don't have one
that's<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.700> best<00:03:03.910> suggestion<00:03:04.330> on<00:03:04.660> counting

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.350 

you<00:03:26.410> may<00:03:26.560> see<00:03:26.620> them<00:03:26.920> bubble<00:03:27.280> out<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.760> little<00:03:28.120> bit

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
you may see them bubble out a little bit

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.800 
you may see them bubble out a little bit
as<00:03:28.660> you're<00:03:28.840> doing<00:03:29.700> that's<00:03:30.700> more<00:03:31.030> than<00:03:31.239> her

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
as you're doing that's more than her

00:03:31.810 --> 00:04:20.170 
as you're doing that's more than her
name

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.610 

of<00:04:20.870> course<00:04:21.079> once<00:04:21.350> you<00:04:21.440> hit<00:04:21.560> a

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
of course once you hit a

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.950 
of course once you hit a
minute-and-a-half<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:23.360> don't<00:04:23.510> have<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.810> turn

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
minute-and-a-half you don't have to turn

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.659 
minute-and-a-half you don't have to turn
it<00:04:24.110> off<00:04:24.230> -<00:04:24.440> actually<00:04:24.830> you're<00:04:24.919> gonna<00:04:25.040> hit<00:04:25.310> beet

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
it off - actually you're gonna hit beet

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.940 
it off - actually you're gonna hit beet
chips<00:04:25.700> real<00:04:26.419> quick<00:04:26.780> just<00:04:27.080> fairly<00:04:27.800> quickly

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
chips real quick just fairly quickly

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.140 
chips real quick just fairly quickly
heat<00:04:30.950> on<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:32.380> sometimes<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.830> can<00:04:34.400> wait<00:04:34.669> and

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
heat on it sometimes you can wait and

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.270 
heat on it sometimes you can wait and
then<00:04:35.300> hit<00:04:35.600> those<00:04:35.750> chips<00:04:36.080> later<00:04:36.380> but<00:04:36.710> they<00:04:37.070> keep

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
then hit those chips later but they keep

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.280 
then hit those chips later but they keep
the<00:04:37.460> dies<00:04:37.639> down<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.240> then<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.510> course<00:04:38.570> you

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
the dies down and then of course you

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.110 
the dies down and then of course you
don't<00:04:39.470> really<00:04:39.590> get<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.830> same<00:04:40.130> effect<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:40.790> I

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
don't really get the same effect so I

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.750 
don't really get the same effect so I
normally<00:04:41.570> do<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.810> right<00:04:42.050> after<00:04:42.230> of<00:04:43.070> course<00:04:43.340> you

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
normally do it right after of course you

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.000 
normally do it right after of course you
don't<00:04:43.940> have<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.240> count<00:04:44.419> on<00:04:44.750> those<00:04:47.830> once<00:04:48.830> you're

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
don't have to count on those once you're

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.340 
don't have to count on those once you're
done<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.150> don't<00:04:50.360> want<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.600> move<00:04:50.750> this<00:04:51.020> for

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
done and you don't want to move this for

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.260 
done and you don't want to move this for
a<00:04:51.500> few<00:04:52.100> minutes<00:04:52.430> after<00:04:52.820> about<00:04:52.970> five<00:04:53.240> minutes

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
a few minutes after about five minutes

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.870 
a few minutes after about five minutes
or<00:04:53.780> so<00:04:53.960> but<00:04:54.229> in<00:04:54.350> this<00:04:54.470> particular<00:04:54.830> case<00:04:55.250> I'm

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
or so but in this particular case I'm

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.540 
or so but in this particular case I'm
just<00:04:56.150> going<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.360> show<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:56.630> anyways<00:04:57.550> cause

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
just going to show you anyways cause

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.909 
just going to show you anyways cause
problems<00:04:59.060> I<00:04:59.180> guess<00:04:59.389> but<00:04:59.780> you<00:05:00.530> want<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.740> put

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
problems I guess but you want to put

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.300 
problems I guess but you want to put
thermal<00:05:01.340> compound<00:05:01.610> on<00:05:02.389> both<00:05:02.780> chips<00:05:03.200> and<00:05:03.800> you

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
thermal compound on both chips and you

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.510 
thermal compound on both chips and you
want<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.580> put<00:05:04.960> usually<00:05:05.960> better<00:05:06.139> dime<00:05:06.500> size<00:05:06.950> if

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
want to put usually better dime size if

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.100 
want to put usually better dime size if
not<00:05:07.820> a<00:05:08.090> little<00:05:08.389> less<00:05:08.810> than<00:05:09.020> that<00:05:09.229> on<00:05:09.770> there

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.450 

nope<00:05:15.110> in<00:05:15.260> this<00:05:15.380> case<00:05:15.680> I'm<00:05:15.950> not<00:05:16.100> actually

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
nope in this case I'm not actually

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.800 
nope in this case I'm not actually
touching<00:05:16.639> the<00:05:16.850> chip<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.270> don't<00:05:17.419> want<00:05:17.540> to<00:05:17.600> cause

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
touching the chip I don't want to cause

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.680 
touching the chip I don't want to cause
any<00:05:17.840> damage<00:05:18.229> to<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:18.860> if<00:05:18.979> I<00:05:19.130> can<00:05:19.280> avoid<00:05:19.370> it<00:05:19.690> and

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
any damage to it if I can avoid it and

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.290 
any damage to it if I can avoid it and
if<00:05:21.350> you<00:05:21.500> get<00:05:22.130> it<00:05:22.280> on<00:05:22.430> there<00:05:22.729> you<00:05:22.760> wouldn't<00:05:23.210> get

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
if you get it on there you wouldn't get

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.800 
if you get it on there you wouldn't get
in<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.450> center<00:05:24.970> that's<00:05:25.970> particularly<00:05:26.600> kids

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
in the center that's particularly kids

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.190 
in the center that's particularly kids
on<00:05:27.050> this<00:05:27.169> making<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.590> mess

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
on this making a mess

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.960 
on this making a mess
dime<00:05:30.200> size<00:05:30.650> amount<00:05:30.680> I'm<00:05:31.250> gonna<00:05:31.460> put<00:05:31.640> too<00:05:31.820> much

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
dime size amount I'm gonna put too much

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.690 
dime size amount I'm gonna put too much
on<00:05:32.210> there<00:05:32.270> overflow<00:05:33.200> put<00:05:34.100> too<00:05:34.280> little<00:05:34.310> on

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
on there overflow put too little on

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.120 
on there overflow put too little on
there<00:05:37.990> like<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.110> said<00:05:39.140> it's<00:05:39.440> not<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.710> best<00:05:39.919> way

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
there like I said it's not the best way

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.330 
there like I said it's not the best way
of<00:05:40.160> show<00:05:40.460> you<00:05:40.520> how<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:40.700> do<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:41.090> just<00:05:43.030> place<00:05:44.030> but

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
of show you how to do it just place but

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.409 
of show you how to do it just place but
get<00:05:46.340> the<00:05:46.430> same<00:05:46.669> concept

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
get the same concept

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.520 
get the same concept
I<00:05:47.780> normally<00:05:48.410> buy<00:05:48.770> ceramic<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.880> style<00:05:50.810> arctic

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
I normally buy ceramic to style arctic

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.250 
I normally buy ceramic to style arctic
silver<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:52.850> original<00:05:53.389> ceramic<00:05:53.900> Denton<00:05:54.169> two

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
silver the original ceramic Denton two

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.469 
silver the original ceramic Denton two
is<00:05:54.380> good<00:05:54.620> but<00:05:55.340> this<00:05:55.639> one<00:05:55.820> does<00:05:56.000> seem<00:05:56.210> to<00:05:56.330> do<00:05:56.450> a

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
is good but this one does seem to do a

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.879 
is good but this one does seem to do a
little<00:05:56.660> bit<00:05:56.870> better<00:05:57.050> on<00:05:57.169> the<00:05:57.320> PlayStation

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
little bit better on the PlayStation

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.010 
little bit better on the PlayStation
systems<00:05:58.370> you<00:05:58.820> can<00:05:58.970> buy<00:05:59.120> silver<00:05:59.419> base<00:05:59.690> or<00:05:59.990> the

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
systems you can buy silver base or the

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.170 
systems you can buy silver base or the
other<00:06:00.229> types<00:06:00.620> but<00:06:01.280> you<00:06:01.610> don't<00:06:01.789> really<00:06:01.880> get<00:06:02.120> a

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
other types but you don't really get a

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.050 
other types but you don't really get a
huge<00:06:02.690> benefit<00:06:03.260> from<00:06:03.620> it<00:06:03.830> this<00:06:04.340> is<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.669> cheaper

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
huge benefit from it this is the cheaper

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.409 
huge benefit from it this is the cheaper
type<00:06:05.300> this<00:06:05.750> is<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.050> 22<00:06:06.889> grams<00:06:07.190> Rindge<00:06:07.789> actually

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
type this is a 22 grams Rindge actually

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
started 25 grams syringe that has a lot

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.810 
started 25 grams syringe that has a lot
of<00:06:12.080> thermal<00:06:12.500> compound<00:06:12.710> in<00:06:13.130> it<00:06:13.220> for<00:06:13.460> a<00:06:13.490> lot<00:06:13.700> of

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
of thermal compound in it for a lot of

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.330 
of thermal compound in it for a lot of
systems<00:06:14.180> I<00:06:14.650> don't<00:06:15.650> know<00:06:15.740> how<00:06:15.860> many<00:06:15.919> systems

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
systems I don't know how many systems

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.070 
systems I don't know how many systems
they<00:06:16.580> can<00:06:16.610> do<00:06:16.940> but<00:06:17.210> you<00:06:17.240> can<00:06:17.450> do<00:06:17.539> a<00:06:17.570> lot<00:06:17.840> with

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
they can do but you can do a lot with

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.279 
they can do but you can do a lot with
this<00:06:18.910> of<00:06:19.910> course<00:06:20.000> once<00:06:20.389> you<00:06:20.510> get<00:06:20.630> it<00:06:20.750> done<00:06:20.960> you

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
this of course once you get it done you

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.390 
this of course once you get it done you
just<00:06:21.680> reassemble<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:22.370> system

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
just reassemble the system

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.659 
just reassemble the system
and<00:06:23.490> then<00:06:23.940> hope<00:06:24.360> and<00:06:24.660> pray<00:06:24.900> it<00:06:25.500> works<00:06:25.680> thank

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
and then hope and pray it works thank

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.820
