difficult spaces which is really

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.260 
difficult spaces which is really
important<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.649> me<00:01:54.829> especially<00:01:55.759> when<00:01:56.149> there's

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
important to me especially when there's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.819 
important to me especially when there's
a<00:01:56.329> lot<00:01:56.450> going<00:01:56.720> on<00:01:56.810> in<00:01:56.989> the<00:01:57.079> car<00:01:57.259> with<00:01:57.709> an

a lot going on in the car with an
children<00:01:58.280> etc<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.060> that's<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.569> big<00:01:59.720> plus<00:01:59.869> for<00:01:59.989> me

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
children etc so that's a big plus for me

children etc so that's a big plus for me
at<00:02:00.319> the<00:02:00.380> moment<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:00.920> think<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.489> visibility<00:02:01.729> is

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
at the moment I think the visibility is

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.639 
at the moment I think the visibility is
good<00:02:02.209> the<00:02:02.390> positioning<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:02.989> the<00:02:03.110> front<00:02:03.349> seat

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
good the positioning of the front seat

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.100 
good the positioning of the front seat
and<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.939> gloves<00:02:05.239> were<00:02:05.420> generally<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.020> the

the<00:03:58.750> thing<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:59.080> found<00:03:59.290> difficult<00:03:59.680> was<00:04:00.220> looking

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
the thing I found difficult was looking

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.120 
the thing I found difficult was looking
over<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.300> bonnet<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.900> would<00:04:02.500> take<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:02.860> bit<00:04:03.070> of

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
over the bonnet that would take a bit of

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.309 
over the bonnet that would take a bit of
getting<00:04:03.280> used<00:04:03.459> to

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
getting used to

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.080 
getting used to
but<00:04:04.439> with<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.709> cameras<00:04:05.219> and<00:04:05.519> everything<00:04:05.670> else

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
but with the cameras and everything else

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.839 
but with the cameras and everything else
all<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.569> assists<00:04:07.349> that<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.709> have<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.219> think<00:04:08.700> it

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
all the assists that you have I think it

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.809 
all the assists that you have I think it
would<00:04:08.969> be<00:04:09.120> just<00:04:09.599> great<00:04:09.810> driving<00:04:10.349> I'm<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:10.980> little

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
would be just great driving I'm a little

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.569 
would be just great driving I'm a little
disappointed<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:13.349> think<00:04:13.680> probably<00:04:13.980> with<00:04:14.370> the

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
disappointed I think probably with the

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.180 
disappointed I think probably with the
look<00:04:14.849> from<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.480> outside<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.259> can't<00:04:16.859> fault

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
look from the outside I can't fault

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.849 
look from the outside I can't fault
anything<00:04:17.820> inside<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.630> think<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.410> seats<00:04:19.680> were

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
anything inside I think the seats were

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.629 
anything inside I think the seats were
very<00:04:20.160> comfortable<00:04:21.079> all<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.109> safety<00:04:22.639> features

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
very comfortable all the safety features

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.589 
very comfortable all the safety features
everything<00:04:24.599> was<00:04:25.139> lovely<00:04:25.349> but<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:27.060> me<00:04:27.270> it

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
everything was lovely but to me it

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.650 
everything was lovely but to me it
doesn't<00:04:27.900> look<00:04:28.370> terribly<00:04:29.370> spectacular<00:04:30.360> on<00:04:30.509> the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
doesn't look terribly spectacular on the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.490 
doesn't look terribly spectacular on the
outside<00:04:31.580> impressed<00:04:32.900> comfortable<00:04:33.900> I'm<00:04:34.199> quite

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
outside impressed comfortable I'm quite

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.110 
outside impressed comfortable I'm quite
a<00:04:34.530> big<00:04:34.710> chap<00:04:34.949> but<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:35.580> seats<00:04:35.820> really

in<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> back<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:38.250> think<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.030> wow<00:04:39.180> factor<00:04:39.240> stood

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
in the back I think the wow factor stood

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.659 
in the back I think the wow factor stood
up<00:04:39.900> in<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.080> screen<00:04:40.289> I<00:04:40.560> have<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.039> iPads<00:04:41.460> I've

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.089 
up in the screen I have the iPads I've
just<00:04:41.849> ordered<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.240> 5s<00:04:42.599> and<00:04:42.630> so<00:04:42.870> on<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.229> for<00:04:43.949> me

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
using the screen to get around it's not

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.600 
using the screen to get around it's not
a<00:04:45.990> problem<00:04:46.199> and<00:04:46.530> we<00:04:46.830> can<00:04:46.949> alter<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.340> we<00:04:47.430> can

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
a problem and we can alter it we can

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.879 
a problem and we can alter it we can
change<00:04:47.789> the<00:04:48.000> settings<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.479> what<00:04:48.599> we<00:04:48.720> want<00:04:48.930> it's

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
a really nice big screen which is

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330 
a really nice big screen which is
unusual<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.289> usually<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.860> screens<00:04:53.160> are

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
unusual and usually the screens are

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.310 
unusual and usually the screens are
fairly<00:04:53.490> small<00:04:53.639> units<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.539> the<00:04:54.599> squinting<00:04:55.050> and

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
fairly small units and the squinting and

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.920 
fairly small units and the squinting and
it's<00:04:55.770> not<00:04:55.949> taking<00:04:56.340> I<00:04:56.460> off<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.759> road<00:04:56.910> -<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.330> think

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
it's not taking I off the road - I think

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.360 
it's not taking I off the road - I think
I've<00:04:57.990> read<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.169> criticism<00:04:58.470> for<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.190> heating

you've got to go in and change it on the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.490 
you've got to go in and change it on the
screen<00:05:02.130> but<00:05:02.400> it's<00:05:03.389> got<00:05:03.539> climate<00:05:03.900> control<00:05:04.229> so
