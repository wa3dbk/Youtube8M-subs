00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
there's a new study that's apparently

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.829 
there's a new study that's apparently
out<00:00:13.769> about<00:00:13.980> genetics<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.730> DNA<00:00:14.880> fat<00:00:15.480> be

sitting<00:00:16.109> what's<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.500> basically<00:00:16.859> say<00:00:17.220> well<00:00:17.580> if

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
sitting what's it basically say well if

sitting what's it basically say well if
your<00:00:18.000> butt<00:00:18.570> obesity<00:00:19.020> means<00:00:19.199> about<00:00:19.470> as

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
your butt obesity means about as

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.130 
your butt obesity means about as
indexable<00:00:20.279> birth<00:00:20.520> pretty<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.140> definitely

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
indexable birth pretty is definitely

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.519 
indexable birth pretty is definitely
traceable<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> parental<00:00:24.260> tendencies<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
traceable to parental tendencies and

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.179 
traceable to parental tendencies and
family<00:00:26.400> history<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:26.970> if<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.630> genetic

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
family history so if you have genetic

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.290 
family history so if you have genetic
predisposition<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.220> obesity<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> very

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
predisposition for obesity it's a very

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.609 
predisposition for obesity it's a very
difficult<00:00:30.480> problem<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> treat<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> have

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
difficult problem to treat and you have

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.110 
difficult problem to treat and you have
it<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.920> rest<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.130> your<00:00:32.219> life<00:00:32.399> it's

it for the rest of your life it's

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.729 
it for the rest of your life it's
extremely<00:00:33.690> difficult<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.079> manage<00:00:34.260> by<00:00:34.530> diet

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
extremely difficult to manage by diet

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
extremely difficult to manage by diet
and<00:00:34.890> exercise<00:00:35.219> alone<00:00:35.250> okay<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:35.969> let's<00:00:36.300> talk

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and exercise alone okay so let's talk

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.270 
and exercise alone okay so let's talk
about<00:00:36.600> take<00:00:37.170> carrying<00:00:37.590> those<00:00:37.739> extra<00:00:38.100> pounds

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
about take carrying those extra pounds

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
about take carrying those extra pounds
and<00:00:38.579> how<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.730> might<00:00:39.120> use<00:00:39.180> some<00:00:39.989> other<00:00:40.020> ways<00:00:40.860> of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and how we might use some other ways of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.229 
and how we might use some other ways of
getting<00:00:41.070> rid<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.579> something<00:00:41.790> you're<00:00:42.059> here

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
getting rid of it something you're here

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.720 
getting rid of it something you're here
to<00:00:42.360> talk<00:00:42.510> about<00:00:42.540> called<00:00:42.930> lipo<00:00:43.829> massage<00:00:44.309> what

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
to talk about called lipo massage what

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.400 
to talk about called lipo massage what
is<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.090> lipo<00:00:45.539> massage<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.020> an<00:00:46.140> external

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is that lipo massage is an external

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.350 
is that lipo massage is an external
treatment<00:00:46.920> which<00:00:47.039> treats<00:00:47.399> both<00:00:47.730> side<00:00:48.120> elite

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
treatment which treats both side elite

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.569 
treatment which treats both side elite
and<00:00:48.570> excess<00:00:49.500> fatty<00:00:49.829> deposits<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and excess fatty deposits in the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.400 
and excess fatty deposits in the
superficial<00:00:51.300> plane<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.719> below<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.170> skin

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
superficial plane just below the skin

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.319 
superficial plane just below the skin
it's<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.949> completely<00:00:53.250> non-invasive<00:00:53.579> technique

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
it's a completely non-invasive technique

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.959 
it's a completely non-invasive technique
and<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.260> its<00:00:55.410> third<00:00:55.969> reiteration

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and now it's in its third reiteration

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.819 
and now it's in its third reiteration
where<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> machine<00:00:57.840> has<00:00:58.140> become<00:00:58.469> far<00:00:58.800> more

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
where the machine has become far more

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.189 
where the machine has become far more
scientific<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> much<00:01:00.420> more<00:01:00.629> effective<00:01:01.109> in

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
scientific and much more effective in

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.990 
scientific and much more effective in
getting<00:01:01.350> rid<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.980> fat<00:01:02.309> deposits<00:01:02.879> which

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
getting rid of the fat deposits which

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820 
getting rid of the fat deposits which
caused<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.570> poor<00:01:04.049> taraji<00:01:04.350> effective

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
caused the poor taraji effective

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
caused the poor taraji effective
steadily<00:01:05.220> okay<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> difference<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.450> as

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
steadily okay but the difference is as

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.500 
steadily okay but the difference is as
opposed<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> liposuction<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.090> is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
opposed to liposuction it is

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.539 
opposed to liposuction it is
non-invasive<00:01:10.280> totally<00:01:11.280> non-invasive

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
non-invasive totally non-invasive

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
non-invasive totally non-invasive
there's<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.450> no<00:01:12.659> side<00:01:12.869> effects<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
there's really no side effects from this

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.580 
there's really no side effects from this
it's<00:01:14.450> FDA<00:01:15.450> approved<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> has<00:01:16.049> been<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.500> over

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it's FDA approved it has been for over

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560 
it's FDA approved it has been for over
20<00:01:16.950> years<00:01:16.979> okay<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.729> holding<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.210> something

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
20 years okay I'm holding up something

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
20 years okay I'm holding up something
right<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.900> looks<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:20.040> know

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
right now that looks like a you know

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.679 
right now that looks like a you know
like<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.310> spider-man<00:01:20.820> obvious<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
like a spider-man obvious that what is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.330 
like a spider-man obvious that what is
this<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> body<00:01:22.590> stocking<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.220> go

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this that's a body stocking that you go

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580 
this that's a body stocking that you go
into<00:01:23.670> before<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.210> undergo<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> process<00:01:24.960> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
into before you undergo the process it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
into before you undergo the process it
promotes<00:01:26.070> hygiene<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.640> allows<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> rollers

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
promotes hygiene and allows the rollers

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.999 
promotes hygiene and allows the rollers
to<00:01:27.479> move<00:01:27.509> smoothly<00:01:27.930> over<00:01:28.080> your<00:01:28.350> skin<00:01:28.619> because

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to move smoothly over your skin because

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
to move smoothly over your skin because
lipo<00:01:29.400> massage<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> done<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> entire<00:01:30.450> body

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
lipo massage is done on the entire body

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.359 
lipo massage is done on the entire body
not<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> localized<00:01:31.740> fat<00:01:31.890> deposits

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
not just on the localized fat deposits

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.350 
not just on the localized fat deposits
all<00:01:32.520> right<00:01:32.640> well<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.880> would<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.329> of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
all right well this would be kind of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.990 
all right well this would be kind of
cute<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> technique<00:01:35.040> uses<00:01:35.400> also<00:01:35.790> some

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
cute so the technique uses also some

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.910 
cute so the technique uses also some
muscle<00:01:36.420> contraction<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.799> like

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
muscle contraction which is kind of like

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.890 
muscle contraction which is kind of like
those<00:01:38.070> resistance<00:01:38.790> bands<00:01:39.030> well<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.570> happens

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
those resistance bands well what happens

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.020 
those resistance bands well what happens
is<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> technique<00:01:40.500> squeezes<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.369> fat<00:01:41.579> cells

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
is the technique squeezes the fat cells

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
is the technique squeezes the fat cells
and<00:01:42.329> actually<00:01:43.020> increases<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.740> blood<00:01:43.979> flow<00:01:44.100> by

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and actually increases the blood flow by

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.819 
and actually increases the blood flow by
using<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.939> roller<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.509> suction<00:01:46.229> mythology

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
using a roller and suction mythology

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.999 
using a roller and suction mythology
it's<00:01:47.220> also<00:01:47.490> stimulating<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.890> dilatation<00:01:49.890> of

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
it's also stimulating the dilatation of

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
it's also stimulating the dilatation of
a<00:01:50.280> lymphatic<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.850> you're<00:01:51.000> forcing<00:01:51.299> fluid<00:01:51.840> out

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
a lymphatic so you're forcing fluid out

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.420 
a lymphatic so you're forcing fluid out
of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> fat<00:01:52.290> cells<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> increasing<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
of the fat cells and increasing the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.490 
of the fat cells and increasing the
blood<00:01:53.549> supply<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.180> muscle<00:01:54.810> stimulation<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
blood supply I muscle stimulation you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.630 
blood supply I muscle stimulation you
want<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> muscles<00:01:56.250> they'll<00:01:56.399> pump

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
want to get the muscles they'll pump

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.310 
want to get the muscles they'll pump
that<00:01:56.790> excess<00:01:57.090> fluid<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.600> well<00:01:57.750> okay<00:01:58.140> we

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that excess fluid out as well okay we

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.630 
that excess fluid out as well okay we
can<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> band<00:01:58.890> working<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.430> there

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
can see the band working right there

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670 
can see the band working right there

obese and has problem areas of fat is it

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.229 
obese and has problem areas of fat is it
permanent<00:02:33.230> no<00:02:34.069> it's<00:02:34.280> not<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.670> has<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.939> be<00:02:34.970> done

permanent no it's not it has to be done

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.910 
permanent no it's not it has to be done
unlike<00:02:35.569> liposuction<00:02:36.230> which<00:02:36.319> is<00:02:36.439> permanent

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
good low salt and local Padre diet how's

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.369 
good low salt and local Padre diet how's
it<00:02:46.459> compare<00:02:46.909> to<00:02:46.939> thermage<00:02:47.389> the<00:02:48.019> maje<00:02:48.200> is

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
it compare to thermage the maje is

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.080 
it compare to thermage the maje is
different<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.769> magis<00:02:49.099> is<00:02:49.250> radiofrequency<00:02:49.669> to

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
different the magis is radiofrequency to

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.240 
different the magis is radiofrequency to
tighten<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> area<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:50.870> below<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.470> skin<00:02:51.769> so

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
tighten the area just below the skin so

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.069 
tighten the area just below the skin so
it<00:02:52.280> attempts<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.760> tighten<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.510> collagen<00:02:53.959> with

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
it attempts to tighten the collagen with

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.379 
it attempts to tighten the collagen with
heat<00:02:54.290> yeah<00:02:54.530> this<00:02:54.650> doesn't<00:02:54.859> mean<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.730> don't

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
heat yeah this doesn't mean I don't

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.000 
heat yeah this doesn't mean I don't
thermage<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.139> cost<00:02:57.319> effective<00:02:57.409> how<00:02:57.889> it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
thermage is cost effective how it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.860 
thermage is cost effective how it
obviously<00:02:58.310> all<00:02:58.669> right<00:02:58.909> like<00:02:59.150> massage<00:02:59.689> you
