 Buber plate Oh wearing was so but some large like to introduce there Ah So is Wu 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.120
 The wrapper is here 1 at 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.960
 My brother is at 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.590
 As you can see already, the number is already attached but it is on a certain site 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:33.020
 There is site which can make number plate 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:39.260
 The license plate was manufactured by that person, but it is quite before 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.110
 And license plate production in the way of Tomica of 86 to up the video of mounting directly below 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.340
 In the pool 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.810
 This time the sound is a bit bigger because it's two-quarter scale this time 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.380
 I would like to put a lumbar plate to the size So is take a look at once 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.410
 Let's go 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.940
 Yes, it looks like it's a motherfront, so it looks like it's a genuine 1 Eddymer 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.100
 Most cars 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:07.240
 I have a number on the tender but this is 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:08.440
 I 'm numbering diagonally in terms of drift specifications. 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.930
 If it is cool 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.610
 Such it is the bird who is atk thought I wonder if cool is more of Well values with 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.280
 I made it look 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.850
 In in Well 1 at Tan 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.970
 I made it to 1800. Now it is 180. 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.900
 Because it is 180 because it is it 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:34.270
 Those of 1800 and in 1800 I think I think I'd look beneath 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:38.300
 Yes Then you rear hate Wow Well normally only without so nothing 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:43.820
 I'm putting it on, I wonder if it will be a little nose hair 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:51.800
 Kedomo I have thought that we think Well, but the I wonder if people of this state is a good 2-fold 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:54.540
 Well , I think it's pretty big because it is 1/24 size so I can make it pretty pretty 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.900
 Yes let's just look at the numbers 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.680
 Yes this is what it looks like this is a torsion 300 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.970
 Another 1800 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.690
 Perhaps the person has to say and the orchid 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.920
 A little too much I do not know may actually have 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.090
 You may not be familiar with the number 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.690
 Yes people of this number 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.000
 But I'll put it with a pan Yes I feel like this 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.790
 Yes 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:31.120
 It looks like it's pretty clean and the realities are a bit out 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:37.090
 The appearance changes depending on the number only 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.230
 At the site where you make it sounds like printing and printing like this will come out the same 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.990
 It is it's number 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.470
 Well 6 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:46.700
 I will come out divided into my head 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:52.190

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:57.770

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:20.540
