00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.190
 using a scientific constructor 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.680
 robot insect experience you will be able babies 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.760
 basic knowledge in mechanics and 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.359
 electronics 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.069
 This kit will allow you to assemble yourself 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:16.839
 cute insect as well 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:17.939
 visualize the principles 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.339
 engineering but rarely mechanics 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.400
 toy work not only battery case 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.910
 but precise mechanical 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.140
 generator 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.140
 so proceed to the assembly 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810
 that is, he is a gearbox on the body 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.900
 data gear hook hooks 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.860
 glad to get presented 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.270
 until it stops 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.170
 steel cars who have holes 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.430
 hike on landing it on the axle 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.430
 the same thing done from another country 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 closed by cop 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.970
 let's collect six pairs of labs jumpers 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.030
 nadine jumper middle holes on 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.470
 the front came forward 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.590
 but the goalkeeper is not 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.160
 and then put on the jumper 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
 coming pin 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 closed by cop 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510
 do the same with the other 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.360
 parties 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 Stalin right and left knee on projects 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 Stalin paragraph 2 of the body 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.220
 Stalin fat mast numbers answers 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.850
 in case of a repeat behind left 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.300
 the other end of the mast 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300
 and potter titova superfluous 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.890
 permanent residence clamping 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.370
 and then connect the programs 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.299
 our work is insect ready 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.179
 he was very funny 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.009
 there is no solar energy 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.909
 can use 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.049
 conventional generator 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.569
 for tomorrow at this stage 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.939
 pricing more often from primary classes 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.719
 the discovery which children make modern 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.640
 becomes a kind 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:37.970
 rewards for their efforts and resourcefulness of the media
