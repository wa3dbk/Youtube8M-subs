00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
problem was when I placed down to custom

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.460 
problem was when I placed down to custom
spawner<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> gave<00:01:30.119> myself<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:31.320> would

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
spawner that I gave myself it would

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.710 
spawner that I gave myself it would
spawn<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.009> would<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.610> placed<00:01:32.909> properly<00:01:33.150> would

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
spawn it would be placed properly would

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.319 
spawn it would be placed properly would
say<00:01:33.930> creeper<00:01:34.409> spawner<00:01:34.740> placed<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.579> when<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
say creeper spawner placed and when I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.899 
say creeper spawner placed and when I
broke<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.990> instead<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.070> saying<00:01:38.340> creeper

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
broke it instead of saying creeper

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.090 
broke it instead of saying creeper
spawner<00:01:39.240> broken<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.049> would<00:01:40.200> say<00:01:40.409> Pig<00:01:40.740> spawner

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
spawner broken it would say Pig spawner

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.120 
spawner broken it would say Pig spawner
broken<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.970> when<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> broke<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.740> would<00:01:43.890> turn

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
broken so when I broke it it would turn

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.789 
broken so when I broke it it would turn
into<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> pig<00:01:44.700> spawner<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.450> some<00:01:45.630> reason<00:01:46.020> okay
