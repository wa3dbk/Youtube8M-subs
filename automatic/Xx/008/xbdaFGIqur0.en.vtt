00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
if you spend a lot of time shooting

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.450 
if you spend a lot of time shooting
outdoors<00:00:06.029> with<00:00:06.600> an<00:00:06.720> SLR<00:00:07.140> it's<00:00:07.890> inevitable

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
outdoors with an SLR it's inevitable

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.430 
outdoors with an SLR it's inevitable
that<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.790> will<00:00:09.000> at<00:00:09.300> some<00:00:09.330> point<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:10.380> a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
that you will at some point have a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.799 
that you will at some point have a
problem<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.040> sensor<00:00:11.370> dust<00:00:11.630> even<00:00:12.630> if<00:00:12.719> you

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
problem with sensor dust even if you

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.629 
problem with sensor dust even if you
never<00:00:13.049> change<00:00:13.469> lenses<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> field<00:00:14.370> thus

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
never change lenses in the field thus

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.490 
never change lenses in the field thus
can<00:00:14.849> still<00:00:15.120> work<00:00:15.360> its<00:00:15.540> way<00:00:15.690> into<00:00:15.900> your<00:00:16.020> camera

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
can still work its way into your camera

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.680 
can still work its way into your camera
and<00:00:16.650> show<00:00:17.190> up<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.490> your<00:00:17.520> images<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.210> smudges

and show up on your images as smudges

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
and show up on your images as smudges
and<00:00:18.720> spots<00:00:19.430> you<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.609> tell<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.029> sure<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.449> a

dust<00:00:21.750> spot<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> dust<00:00:22.590> spot<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:23.160> your<00:00:23.220> sensor

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
dust spot is a dust spot on your sensor

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.820 
dust spot is a dust spot on your sensor
if<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.420> appears<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> same<00:00:25.230> place<00:00:25.439> across

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
if it appears in the same place across

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.109 
if it appears in the same place across
several<00:00:26.250> images<00:00:28.220> watch<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.460> spot<00:00:29.820> right<00:00:30.090> here

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
several images watch the spot right here

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.790 
several images watch the spot right here
which<00:00:30.510> looks<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> could<00:00:31.320> actually<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
which looks like it could actually be a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.860 
which looks like it could actually be a
feature<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> ground<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.450> switch<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
feature on the ground but as I switch to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.990 
feature on the ground but as I switch to
the<00:00:33.960> next<00:00:34.050> image<00:00:34.320> an<00:00:34.739> image<00:00:35.309> which<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.640> panned

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the next image an image which is panned

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.940 
the next image an image which is panned
you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.510> see<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> spot<00:00:37.380> staying<00:00:37.800> in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you can see you know the spot staying in

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.069 
you can see you know the spot staying in
the<00:00:38.040> same<00:00:38.219> place<00:00:38.480> I've<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> same<00:00:39.960> problem

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
the same place I've got the same problem

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.490 
the same place I've got the same problem
up<00:00:40.410> here<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:42.149> there's<00:00:43.110> another<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.469> over

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
up here and there's another one over

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.600 
up here and there's another one over
here<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.620> case<00:00:46.800> my<00:00:47.010> sensor<00:00:47.370> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
here so in this case my sensor is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.940 
here so in this case my sensor is
completely<00:00:48.510> covered<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:48.840> dust<00:00:49.110> which<00:00:49.440> isn't

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
completely covered with dust which isn't

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.229 
completely covered with dust which isn't
too<00:00:50.190> big<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> surprise<00:00:50.550> given<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.149> i'm

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
too big a surprise given that i'm

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
too big a surprise given that i'm
standing<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.719> top<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.140> sand<00:00:52.410> dune<00:00:52.730> you'll

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
standing on top of a sand dune you'll

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.790 
standing on top of a sand dune you'll
probably<00:00:54.059> also<00:00:54.510> find<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.170> dust<00:00:55.410> spots<00:00:55.590> are

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
probably also find that dust spots are

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.260 
probably also find that dust spots are
more<00:00:56.039> visible<00:00:56.250> when<00:00:56.640> shooting<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:57.030> smaller

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
more visible when shooting at smaller

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630 
more visible when shooting at smaller
apertures<00:00:58.280> unfortunately<00:00:59.280> because<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
apertures unfortunately because you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
apertures unfortunately because you
usually<00:00:59.820> shoot<00:01:00.239> landscapes<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.989> small

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
usually shoot landscapes with small

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.840 
usually shoot landscapes with small
apertures<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.890> ensure<00:01:02.129> deep<00:01:02.309> depth<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.670> field

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
apertures to ensure deep depth of field

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.250 
apertures to ensure deep depth of field
this<00:01:03.030> means<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.539> landscape<00:01:03.930> images

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
this means that your landscape images

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.200 
this means that your landscape images
will<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.860> prone<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.220> revealing<00:01:05.729> any<00:01:05.939> dust

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
will be more prone to revealing any dust

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
will be more prone to revealing any dust
problems<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.900> might<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:08.340> good

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
problems that you might have the good

image that we've been working with for a
while<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.119> you've<00:01:36.360> probably<00:01:36.630> already

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
while now and you've probably already

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
while now and you've probably already
noticed<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.590> there's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> bad<00:01:38.040> dust<00:01:38.340> spot

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
noticed that there's a bad dust spot

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.340 
noticed that there's a bad dust spot
right<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.240> there<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> couple<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> others

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
right here and there a couple of others

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920 
right here and there a couple of others
hidden<00:01:40.710> around<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.810> need

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
hidden around here and there so we need

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
hidden around here and there so we need
to<00:01:43.020> take<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.850> another<00:01:44.850> tip<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.420> I've

easier way to adjust the radius of the
brush<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.870> simply<00:02:27.260> use<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.410> left<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
as the brush shortcuts in Photoshop I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.520 
as the brush shortcuts in Photoshop I
want<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.450> make<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> brush<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.140> little<00:02:33.440> bit

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
want to make the brush just a little bit

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.160 
want to make the brush just a little bit
bigger<00:02:33.769> than<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.040> spot<00:02:34.819> of<00:02:34.970> dust<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.450> then<00:02:36.110> I

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
bigger than the spot of dust and then I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.809 
bigger than the spot of dust and then I
click<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.620> that's<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.099> the<00:02:37.310> dust<00:02:37.489> is<00:02:37.640> gone

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
click and that's it the dust is gone

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.670 
click and that's it the dust is gone
there's<00:02:38.599> really<00:02:38.720> not<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:38.959> much<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.530> say

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
there's really not that much to say

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.620 
there's really not that much to say
about<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.160> spot<00:02:40.640> removal<00:02:41.000> tool<00:02:41.209> because<00:02:41.540> it

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
about the spot removal tool because it

about the spot removal tool because it
works<00:02:41.780> really<00:02:42.050> well<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.500> it's<00:02:42.620> very<00:02:42.800> easy<00:02:43.069> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
works really well and it's very easy to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.009 
works really well and it's very easy to
use<00:02:43.519> if<00:02:44.060> you're<00:02:44.180> wondering<00:02:44.330> what<00:02:44.569> this<00:02:44.630> other

use if you're wondering what this other
circle<00:02:45.799> is<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.850> where<00:02:47.410> Photoshop<00:02:48.410> is

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
circle is this is where Photoshop is

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.949 
circle is this is where Photoshop is
sampling<00:02:49.040> from<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.819> building<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.660> patch<00:02:50.930> that

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
goes over this image see if I drag it up

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.110 
goes over this image see if I drag it up
here<00:02:53.930> now<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:54.739> not<00:02:54.950> quite<00:02:55.220> as<00:02:55.340> clean<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:55.819> if

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
here now it's not quite as clean so if

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.030 
here now it's not quite as clean so if
Photoshop<00:02:56.750> makes<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.110> mistake<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.709> where<00:02:57.890> it

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
Photoshop makes a mistake and where it

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.490 
Photoshop makes a mistake and where it
chooses<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:59.120> can<00:02:59.360> manually<00:02:59.900> correct<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.380> by

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
chooses you can manually correct it by

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.620 
chooses you can manually correct it by
moving<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.950> around<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:02.269> I'm<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:02.569> to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
moving this around so I'm just going to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.410 
moving this around so I'm just going to
prowl<00:03:02.959> through<00:03:03.230> my<00:03:03.440> image<00:03:03.709> here<00:03:04.269> looking<00:03:05.269> for

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
prowl through my image here looking for

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.000 
prowl through my image here looking for
other<00:03:05.480> dust<00:03:05.780> spots<00:03:05.989> that's<00:03:06.319> worse<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.830> this

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
other dust spots that's worse on this

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.640 
other dust spots that's worse on this
side<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.400> sensor<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.849> looks<00:03:08.000> like<00:03:08.500> make<00:03:09.500> my

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
side of the sensor it looks like make my

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.220 
side of the sensor it looks like make my
brush<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> little<00:03:10.069> smaller<00:03:10.670> take<00:03:11.599> out<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:11.959> one

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
brush a little smaller take out that one

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.160 
brush a little smaller take out that one
that<00:03:13.069> one<00:03:13.310> again<00:03:14.269> these<00:03:14.450> are<00:03:14.510> non-destructive

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
that one again these are non-destructive

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.490 
that one again these are non-destructive
edits<00:03:16.090> because<00:03:17.090> all<00:03:17.420> Photoshop<00:03:17.959> has<00:03:18.109> to<00:03:18.260> do<00:03:18.380> is

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
edits because all Photoshop has to do is

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.680 
edits because all Photoshop has to do is
remember<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.359> coordinates<00:03:20.359> of<00:03:20.510> these

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
remember the coordinates of these

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.569 
remember the coordinates of these
different<00:03:20.900> points<00:03:21.440> and<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.920> can<00:03:22.070> store<00:03:22.310> those

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
different points and it can store those

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.440
