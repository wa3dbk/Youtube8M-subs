00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
here at the beginning now I think it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.920 
here at the beginning now I think it
makes<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> beginning<00:00:39.300> half<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> game<00:00:39.899> a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
makes the beginning half of the game a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.319 
makes the beginning half of the game a
little<00:00:40.230> harder<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:40.829> they<00:00:40.980> makes<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.730> second

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
little harder but they makes the second

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.200 
little harder but they makes the second
half<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> game<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> lot<00:00:43.200> easier<00:00:44.149> now<00:00:45.149> I'm

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
half of the game on a lot easier now I'm

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.700 
half of the game on a lot easier now I'm
just<00:00:45.390> follow<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> road<00:00:45.960> around<00:00:46.200> until<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.559> get
