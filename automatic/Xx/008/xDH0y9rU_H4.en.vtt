 We will introduce how to fold the eco-friendly course 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.050
 The finish looks like this 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.340
 I will hold my hand 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.789
 At first we use ordinary 15 centimeters of origami, but first we take in triangle 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.570
 And I'd have almost similar to that frame's how to fold 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.570
 Because it is slightly different 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.059
 At first we are in triangle 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.770
 Also 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.940
 I try to fit in the upper corner 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.150
 Also available to you in the same way as opposite 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.109

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.109
 I 'm on 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.150

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.490
 It will be part of the ear of coma 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.870
 Great 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.870
 I agree 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.760

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.680
 Well the opposite is the same way 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.040
 If you're lying, turn it over 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.310
 It is a part of the ear, I smell a little bit more 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.860
