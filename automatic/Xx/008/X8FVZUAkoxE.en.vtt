Mobile is concerned largely because of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.919 
Mobile is concerned largely because of
the<00:02:07.500> kind<00:02:07.650> of<00:02:07.830> storage<00:02:08.160> capability<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the kind of storage capability and and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.350 
the kind of storage capability and and
its<00:02:10.050> ability<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:11.820> it's<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
its ability to so I think it's going to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.820 
its ability to so I think it's going to
create<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:13.230> whole<00:02:14.070> new<00:02:14.210> digital<00:02:15.210> distribution

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
create a whole new digital distribution
