00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
I think well you know I mean it's a sort

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.810 
I think well you know I mean it's a sort
of<00:00:55.530> cliche<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.070> every<00:00:56.280> problem<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> an

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
of cliche but every problem is an

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
of cliche but every problem is an
opportunity<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> President<00:00:58.230> Obama<00:00:58.469> has<00:00:58.680> an

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
opportunity and President Obama has an

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.920 
opportunity and President Obama has an
opportunity<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.969> demonstrate<00:01:00.480> real

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
opportunity here to demonstrate real

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.020 
opportunity here to demonstrate real
leadership<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> critical<00:01:01.859> issue<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.760> so

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
leadership on a critical issue and so

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.119 
leadership on a critical issue and so
far<00:01:03.239> he's<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.629> doing<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.769> find<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
far he's not doing that and I find that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.520 
far he's not doing that and I find that
a<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:06.180> disappointing<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.320> an

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
a little disappointing I think it's an

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.399 
a little disappointing I think it's an
incredibly<00:01:08.280> important<00:01:08.729> issue<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.409> Senator

many<00:02:00.180> other<00:02:00.409> great<00:02:01.409> people<00:02:02.070> working<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.670> this

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
many other great people working on this

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.179 
many other great people working on this
issue<00:02:02.939> who<00:02:03.270> know<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.350> happens<00:02:04.829> across

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
issue who know that this happens across

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.580 
issue who know that this happens across
government<00:02:05.820> agencies<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> regular<00:02:07.140> basis

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
government agencies on a regular basis

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680 
government agencies on a regular basis
so<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.489> needs<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.910> scope<00:02:09.179> needs<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.569> be

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
so it's it needs the scope needs to be

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.420 
so it's it needs the scope needs to be
broadened<00:02:10.110> beyond<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.649> Secret<00:02:10.950> Service<00:02:11.129> I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
broadened beyond the Secret Service I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.490 
broadened beyond the Secret Service I
think<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.150> Inspector<00:02:12.599> General's<00:02:13.020> need<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
think the Inspector General's need to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.740 
think the Inspector General's need to
looking<00:02:13.800> at<00:02:13.920> every<00:02:14.100> government<00:02:14.460> agency

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
looking at every government agency

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.910 
looking at every government agency
government<00:02:15.750> employees<00:02:16.080> at<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> state<00:02:16.590> level

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
government employees at the state level

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.860 
government employees at the state level
there's<00:02:17.160> an<00:02:17.310> epidemic<00:02:17.880> right<00:02:18.060> now<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.420> America

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
there's an epidemic right now in America

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.310 
there's an epidemic right now in America
of<00:02:19.830> child<00:02:20.430> porn<00:02:20.760> child<00:02:21.180> trafficking<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.020> too

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
of child porn child trafficking and too

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.810 
of child porn child trafficking and too
many<00:02:22.500> government<00:02:22.860> employees<00:02:22.950> are<00:02:23.400> involved

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
many government employees are involved

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.000 
many government employees are involved
in<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.810> think<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.230> people<00:02:25.710> do<00:02:25.830> know

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
in that so I think that people do know

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.410 
in that so I think that people do know
about<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.610> think<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.880> president<00:02:27.270> has

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
about this and I think the president has

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.560 
about this and I think the president has
an<00:02:27.510> opportunity<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:28.110> broaden<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.800> scope<00:02:28.920> so

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
an opportunity to broaden the scope so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.670 
an opportunity to broaden the scope so
you're<00:02:30.570> not<00:02:30.690> saying<00:02:30.900> it's<00:02:31.110> specifically

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you're not saying it's specifically

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.860 
you're not saying it's specifically
political<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.340> been<00:02:32.520> going<00:02:32.820> on<00:02:33.030> for<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> long

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
political it's been going on for a long

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.560 
political it's been going on for a long
time<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.650> not<00:02:34.800> about<00:02:34.950> who<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.700> who<00:02:35.910> which

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
time this is not about who is who which

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.930 
time this is not about who is who which
the<00:02:36.810> individual<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.709> sitting<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> White

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the individual is sitting in the White

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180 
the individual is sitting in the White
House<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.360> any<00:02:39.480> particular<00:02:39.750> time<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.920> is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
House at any particular time but this is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.699 
House at any particular time but this is
something<00:02:42.000> where<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.810> president<00:02:43.350> should

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
something where the president should

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.640 
something where the president should
come<00:02:44.010> out<00:02:44.040> sort<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.700> swinging<00:02:45.150> that's<00:02:46.050> exactly

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
come out sort of swinging that's exactly

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.290 
come out sort of swinging that's exactly
right<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.830> mean<00:02:47.010> President<00:02:47.730> Obama<00:02:47.970> didn't

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
right I mean President Obama didn't

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.479 
right I mean President Obama didn't
create<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:48.810> problem<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:49.920> now<00:02:50.220> being

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
create this problem but it is now being

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.310 
create this problem but it is now being
exposed<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.540> believe<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:51.989> reaching

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
exposed and I believe it's reaching

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.979 
exposed and I believe it's reaching
epidemic<00:02:52.860> levels<00:02:53.280> under<00:02:53.700> his<00:02:53.910> leadership<00:02:54.120> so

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
epidemic levels under his leadership so

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.510 
epidemic levels under his leadership so
he<00:02:55.140> does<00:02:55.320> need<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.530> come<00:02:55.770> out<00:02:55.890> swinging<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.400> he

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
he does need to come out swinging and he

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.640 
he does need to come out swinging and he
the<00:02:56.790> more<00:02:57.000> he<00:02:57.150> marginalizes<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.170> says<00:02:58.380> well

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the more he marginalizes and says well

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.080 
the more he marginalizes and says well
these<00:02:58.830> are<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> bunch<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.310> knuckleheads<00:02:59.520> I

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
these are a bunch of knuckleheads I

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.000 
these are a bunch of knuckleheads I
think<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.870> worse<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.230> looks<00:03:01.410> for<00:03:01.560> him<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.800> think

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
think the worse it looks for him I think

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.620 
think the worse it looks for him I think
this<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> real<00:03:02.520> opportunity<00:03:02.850> for<00:03:03.209> him<00:03:03.510> to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
this is a real opportunity for him to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.500 
this is a real opportunity for him to
take<00:03:04.190> powerful<00:03:05.190> leadership<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> matter<00:03:06.330> of

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
take powerful leadership on a matter of

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.280 
take powerful leadership on a matter of
national<00:03:06.660> security<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.980> patriotism<00:03:08.640> and

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
national security and and patriotism and

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.070 
national security and and patriotism and
how<00:03:10.290> do<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.560> deal<00:03:10.920> with<00:03:11.610> just<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.810> sort<00:03:13.020> of

measures of forcing them out because you

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.949 
measures of forcing them out because you
can<00:03:22.410> it's<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.040> easy<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.850> imagine<00:03:24.269> this

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
can it's so easy to imagine this

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.050 
can it's so easy to imagine this
happening<00:03:25.200> again<00:03:25.860> unfortunately<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.850> is

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
happening again unfortunately but it is

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.789 
happening again unfortunately but it is
easy<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.480> imagine<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:28.019> happening<00:03:28.170> how<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.709> you

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
easy to imagine it happening how do you

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.530 
easy to imagine it happening how do you
get<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.190> head<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.519> these<00:03:29.640> guys<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.239> make

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
get in the head of these guys and make

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.259 
get in the head of these guys and make
them<00:03:30.810> change<00:03:31.049> their<00:03:31.200> behavior<00:03:32.060> well<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.090> think

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
them change their behavior well I think

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.930 
them change their behavior well I think
it's<00:03:33.540> called<00:03:33.810> ending<00:03:34.200> impunity<00:03:34.350> Jonathan<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
it's called ending impunity Jonathan I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.180 
it's called ending impunity Jonathan I
mean<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.690> think<00:03:36.750> it's<00:03:37.019> creating<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.739> culture

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
mean I think it's creating a culture

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.640 
mean I think it's creating a culture
where<00:03:38.730> we<00:03:38.940> follow<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.480> US<00:03:39.780> Constitution<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
where we follow the US Constitution and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.259 
where we follow the US Constitution and

sexual exploitation and it
which<00:04:27.980> is<00:04:28.160> what<00:04:28.310> happens<00:04:28.610> when<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:28.880> use<00:04:29.090> a
