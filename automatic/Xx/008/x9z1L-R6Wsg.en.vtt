00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.890
 and 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.689
 most cabinets are equipped 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.580
 a panoramic dental radio the 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.500
 dental panoramic radio is a tool 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.759
 excellent detection of a lot of 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.829
 worries and dental problems 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.260
 but you will see that sometimes 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.809
 we can miss true 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.640
 problematic because the image that is going to be 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.280
 provided by the remy step is not 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.290
 sufficient to determine the origin 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.739
 of a problem and especially the gravity of the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.449
 problem 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.870
 in this case I draw your 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.040
 attention to this area when one 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.680
 sees the panoramic dental 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.949
 we still feel that there is 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.360
 maybe some little worries from high 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.619
 now we realize a collar bim 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.600
 always the same huh as bing who is 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.780
 pretty high- pitched who is at least in 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.580
 a field of 10 by 10 and has already 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.479
 what we see we see that under 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.950
 the left maxillary sinus there are 2 or 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.490
 even three months air that are 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.990
 not have an infection that has spoiled 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.470
 water what is around the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.170
 roots 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.930
 when combine allows us 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.360
 to get cuts that are these 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.280
 where you see that roots are just a 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.260
 almost planted in the city 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.050
 there is nothing but granular tissue and 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.130
 almost no more bone between the teeth and 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.290
 the maxillary sinus 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.000
 you see that there is much more 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.860
 blatant than the image of the panoramic 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.990
 dental often the patient can we get 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.280
 complain about anything and when I am told 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.650
 that we will have to extract it is in 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.360
 what is the case in this case 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.840
 clinics well he does not understand 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.760
 Why 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.250
 and when you mount an image like this 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.170
 Well here he is convinced he accepts 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.760
 well they see that on the front 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.430
 when he does not have problem with the offer 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.200
 covers teeth and 3d replenishment 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.270
 lets see how much the lesion 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.280
 bone has reached the roots of 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.930
 molars to the suburbs and there it is a 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.729
 reconstitution not there who we see 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.769
 also on the side of the palace he lost 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.360
 all the bone and there I think there is 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.830
 even no explanation to give the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.830
 demonstration is made for the patient 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.320
 the first thing you need 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.600
 decide is to realize unknown 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.770
 that is, to have images that they 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.240
 are sufficient 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.190
 again I insist on the size 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.620
 of the field the cone bim should not be 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.260
 lower a field of 10 by 10 for 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.330
 to be able to give not only the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.460
 situation and the dental problem 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.410
 but also the situation and the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.890
 problematic at the level of lost y are 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.959
 the important thing is that the orl surgeon 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.850
 can give you the endorsement and the top 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.150
 start the top of the pines there to you the 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.459
 give 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.350
 when he goes to see that lost yom is not 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.240
 stuffy the first thing that will look 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.370
 if there is not a polyp that clog the 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.950
 ciom and that will prevent aeration of the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.600
 sinus and so you understand well that he 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.790
 will have to give him information 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.010
 who had since the size of the teeth 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.870
 far above lost yom it's up to 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.500
 say almost to the eye so that 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.900
 ol can see and say yes dear 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.790
 confreres you can achieve this 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.500
 sinus transplant without any problem because 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.500
 lost yom is not clogged 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.190
 you have to have the means to have a 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.230
 image that can start at the level of 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.820
 tents and go very high 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.280
 that is, it takes at least ten 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.770
 centimeters of singing height for 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.010
 able to access and information 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.050
 dental and information cemetery 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.290
 lead because on one side the surgeon 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.690
 dentist can tell him that the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.790
 problematic comes from this small step 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.830
 so much water that you see there that has 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.620
 stuck but that she also comes from a 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.380
 time that was treated when the ol is going 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.100
 to receive the patient he will understand and 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.570
 he will see thanks to these warm images 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.690
 who are you still told the had 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.959
 we are talking here about the tooth and we are very 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.520
 top 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.739
 so we can not afford to have 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.570
 a small tooth shock that is a field 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.299
 of 10 by simple one really needs to 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.390
 go up to 10 by 10 votes or more 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.730
 even eleven by 13 that really allows 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:34.900
 to show to work on both 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:36.370
 logical the new bindum school the 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.979
 same information as scanners 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.270
 helicoidal the Colombian hui he is going 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.860
 achieve 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.840
 he will take information from a 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.880
 like and so that will allow him to give 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.160
 or black radiation for the patient 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.660
 while the helical scanner is going 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.240
 turn around the patient on an area 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.700
 defined and deliver a lot more than 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.870
 radiation that camping 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.700
 all this to get the same 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.710
 information that we already have in the cone 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.560
 binomial once and with less rekem 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.990
 is to have the same information as to 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.050
 scanner if only in the content 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.990
 is integrated software that allows to 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.169
 to explain to patients 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.110
 delimit general 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.180
 inside to show the so mu of so 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.650
 all this is didactic and it allows 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.930
 to the patient to understand what we are going 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.819
 do and in terms of acceptance of 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.009
 treatment plans it's phenomenal because 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.960
 that when the patient does not understand it 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.310
 can not adhere inside when 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.469
 understands and we have the tools 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.560
 computer to explain him thanks 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:35.930
 to the outputs through the software that is 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.889
 in the menu and well it looks like nothing 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.889
 he adheres complaint 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.849
 Oh
