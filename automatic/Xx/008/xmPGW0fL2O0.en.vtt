the other things that I really liked

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.869 
the other things that I really liked
about<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:42.090> quick<00:00:42.360> -<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.020> meant

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
about it is that the quick - just meant

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.549 
about it is that the quick - just meant
the<00:00:44.879> height<00:00:45.059> adjustment<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.500> says

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the height adjustment is all it says

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.369 
the height adjustment is all it says
quarter<00:00:47.399> inch<00:00:47.550> increments<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:49.020> simply

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
quarter inch increments so I just simply

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.819 
quarter inch increments so I just simply
pull<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> pin<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.030> want<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.570> at<00:00:51.870> 3

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pull the pin and if I want to be at 3

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
pull the pin and if I want to be at 3
inches<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.579> push<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> pan<00:00:54.180> over<00:00:54.449> here

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
inches I just push the pan over here

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900 
inches I just push the pan over here
when<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> lower<00:00:55.079> down<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.530> deck<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.730> goes

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
when I lower down the deck it just goes

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
when I lower down the deck it just goes
down<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.329> where<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.899> set<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.469> very

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
down to where I have it set it's very

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.029 
down to where I have it set it's very
quick<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.579> I'm<00:01:00.359> constantly<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.140> adjusting

the<00:01:02.190> cutting<00:01:02.699> height<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.840> deck

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
the cutting height of the of the deck

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.050 
the cutting height of the of the deck
depending<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> cutting<00:01:05.430> conditions<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
depending on the cutting conditions and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.490 
depending on the cutting conditions and
the<00:01:06.119> way<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> grass<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> growing<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the way the grass is growing and in

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
the way the grass is growing and in
right<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.250> got<00:01:08.490> some<00:01:08.670> leaves<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.119> have

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
right now we got some leaves so I have

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.750 
right now we got some leaves so I have
to<00:01:09.479> raise<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.140> bit<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:11.700> other

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
to raise it up a little bit the other

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280 
to raise it up a little bit the other
thing<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.689> impressed<00:01:13.110> with

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
thing that I really was impressed with

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.370 
thing that I really was impressed with
this<00:01:13.470> ferris<00:01:13.860> unit<00:01:14.360> not<00:01:15.360> only<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> suspension

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
this ferris unit not only the suspension

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.200 
this ferris unit not only the suspension
but<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.740> new<00:01:16.920> deck<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.790> this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
but this new deck that they have this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.020 
but this new deck that they have this
icd<00:01:18.840> deck<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:20.040> been<00:01:20.280> off<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> couple<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
icd deck it's been off for a couple of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.429 
icd deck it's been off for a couple of
years<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:24.150> advantage<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.170> got

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
years now but the advantage is it's got

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.249 
years now but the advantage is it's got
this<00:01:25.650> slope<00:01:26.100> has<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.240> void<00:01:27.509> air<00:01:27.810> chamber

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
this slope has a little void air chamber

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.050 
this slope has a little void air chamber
underneath<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.610> those<00:01:29.759> blades

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
underneath there get those blades

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
underneath there get those blades
lifting<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.780> grass<00:01:31.020> before<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.530> gets<00:01:31.680> cut

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
lifting that grass before it gets cut

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.210 
lifting that grass before it gets cut
and<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:33.509> discharge<00:01:33.750> opening<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.770> here

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
and the discharge opening on here

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.490 
and the discharge opening on here
they've<00:01:35.909> opened<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> 18<00:01:37.079> inches<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
they've opened this up to 18 inches and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.069 
they've opened this up to 18 inches and
often<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.009> got<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> cut<00:01:38.549> when<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.390> early<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
often I got a cut when it's early in the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.359 
often I got a cut when it's early in the
morning<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.770> there's<00:01:40.979> dew<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
morning and then there's dew on the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.609 
morning and then there's dew on the
ground<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> grass<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.290> really

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
ground and or if the grass is really

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770 
ground and or if the grass is really
thick<00:01:44.070> they've<00:01:44.670> really<00:01:45.000> opened<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
thick they've really opened this up it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
thick they've really opened this up it
discharge<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.950> don't<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
discharge is good I don't have the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.840 
discharge is good I don't have the
double<00:01:47.820> cut<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.170> has<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.369> comes

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
double cut and this also has a it comes

lowers<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.080> operating<00:02:34.530> temperature<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.099> it's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
lowers the operating temperature so it's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.790 
lowers the operating temperature so it's
running<00:02:35.610> much<00:02:35.880> cooler<00:02:36.290> therefore<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.410> going

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
running much cooler therefore it's going

I<00:02:39.269> like<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.230> ROPS<00:02:40.610> although<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:41.940> some

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
I like the ROPS although I have some

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.670 
I like the ROPS although I have some
trees<00:02:43.019> with<00:02:43.580> low-hanging<00:02:44.580> branches<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:46.470> ROPS

is<00:02:46.920> foldable<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:48.120> was<00:02:48.360> pretty<00:02:48.569> impressed

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
is foldable and I was pretty impressed

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.550 
is foldable and I was pretty impressed
with<00:02:49.200> how<00:02:49.709> easy<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:51.600> lower<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.989> straps

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
