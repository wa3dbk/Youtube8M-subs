with<00:00:28.859> Dan<00:00:29.070> Brown's<00:00:29.340> list<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.820> 80<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.390> no

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
with Dan Brown's list of 80 I have no

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.659 
with Dan Brown's list of 80 I have no
idea<00:00:31.050> where<00:00:31.439> he<00:00:31.500> got<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.679> number<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.550> one

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
idea where he got that number for one

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.830 
idea where he got that number for one
thing<00:00:32.850> we're<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.329> sure<00:00:33.420> how<00:00:33.780> many

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
thing we're not really sure how many

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.260 
thing we're not really sure how many
Gospels<00:00:34.350> there<00:00:34.649> were<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.950> we're

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
Gospels there were that we're

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.700 
Gospels there were that we're
circulating<00:00:36.270> however<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:37.380> he's<00:00:37.530> also

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
circulating however what he's also

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.799 
circulating however what he's also
suggesting<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.210> belongs<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
suggesting is that this belongs in the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.869 
suggesting is that this belongs in the
earliest<00:00:40.079> period<00:00:40.530> when<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.770> doesn't<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.700> we

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
earliest period when it doesn't what we

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.119 
earliest period when it doesn't what we
have<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.300> terms<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.629> documents<00:00:43.200> are<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.829> four

canonical Gospels from the first century

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.130 
after that we have Gospels that are
written<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> second<00:00:48.510> third<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> way

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
up through the 9th century and if you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.310 
up through the 9th century and if you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
pseudo matthew that's 9th century we're

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.990 
pseudo matthew that's 9th century we're
talking<00:01:00.059> about<00:01:00.710> 45<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.739> 60<00:01:02.340> gospel<00:01:02.760> something

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
talking about 45 to 60 gospel something

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.070 
talking about 45 to 60 gospel something
like<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.329> they're<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.510> later<00:01:03.750> that's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
like that but they're all later that's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.350 
like that but they're all later that's
the<00:01:04.260> point<00:01:04.439> now<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> first<00:01:06.299> thing

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the point now that's the first thing

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
the point now that's the first thing
what<00:01:06.600> argues<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.110> let's<00:01:07.740> look<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
what argues it let's look at the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.800 
what argues it let's look at the
earliest<00:01:08.159> materials<00:01:09.150> we've<00:01:09.240> got<00:01:09.390> those<00:01:09.540> four

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
earliest materials we've got those four

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
earliest materials we've got those four
Gospels<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> things<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.040> many

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
Gospels and one of the things that many

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
Gospels and one of the things that many
people<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.390> realize<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
people don't realize is that the the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.789 
people don't realize is that the the
modern<00:01:14.729> book<00:01:15.000> form<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.570> today<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
modern book form we have today that is

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.649 
modern book form we have today that is
binding<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> left<00:01:17.970> side<00:01:18.119> where<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.450> turn

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
binding on the left side where you turn

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
binding on the left side where you turn
the<00:01:18.840> pages<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.470> called<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.770> codex<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.880> was

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the pages it's called a codex that was

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.300 
the pages it's called a codex that was
invented<00:01:21.509> probably<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.259> last<00:01:22.470> decade<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
invented probably the last decade of the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.090 
invented probably the last decade of the
first<00:01:23.549> century<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.350> very<00:01:25.380> firm

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
first century and we have very firm

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
first century and we have very firm
evidence<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:26.880> Christians<00:01:27.450> who

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
evidence that it was Christians who

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.990 
evidence that it was Christians who
popularized<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.530> first<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.970> just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
popularized this first and they just

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.090 
popularized this first and they just
took<00:01:30.420> off<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.470> first<00:01:31.770> five

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
took off with it for the first five

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.370 
took off with it for the first five
centuries<00:01:32.430> ad<00:01:32.790> Christians<00:01:33.780> had<00:01:34.079> eighty

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.179 
only twenty percent of their books on a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
codex so the Christians were the ones

codex so the Christians were the ones
who<00:01:41.250> are<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.670> using<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.150> far<00:01:42.360> more<00:01:42.540> than

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.960 
who are really using this far more than
others<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.079> some<00:01:43.399> have<00:01:44.399> suggested<00:01:44.549> that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
others and some have suggested that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
others and some have suggested that
perhaps<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.509> codex<00:01:45.840> form<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.229> invented

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
perhaps the codex form was invented

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.800 
perhaps the codex form was invented
because<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.460> could<00:01:47.700> incorporate<00:01:48.030> more<00:01:48.540> than

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
because it could incorporate more than

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.499 
because it could incorporate more than
one<00:01:49.049> book<00:01:49.320> while<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> role<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> scroll

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
one book while as a role or a scroll

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.969 
one book while as a role or a scroll
could<00:01:51.810> only<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.140> something<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> size

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
could only have something like the size

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.950 
could only have something like the size
of<00:01:53.130> Luke<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.149> couldn't<00:01:54.450> put<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.750> four

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
of Luke in it you couldn't put all four

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.560 
of Luke in it you couldn't put all four
Gospels<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.369> there's<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.820> suggestion

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
Gospels on it so there's a suggestion

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.050 
Gospels on it so there's a suggestion
that<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.530> original<00:01:58.740> codex<00:01:59.460> form<00:01:59.700> used<00:01:59.939> by

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that the original codex form used by

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.819 
that the original codex form used by
Christians<00:02:00.299> was<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.840> put<00:02:01.020> all<00:02:01.229> four<00:02:01.530> Gospels

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
Christians was to put all four Gospels

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.800 
Christians was to put all four Gospels
on<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.549> therefore<00:02:03.090> you're<00:02:03.479> able<00:02:03.719> to
