00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
happy to show you how to solve it the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.870 
happy to show you how to solve it the
speed<00:00:30.330> version<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.560> want<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
hold both sides like so where it's just

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.959 
hold both sides like so where it's just
kind<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.140> you're<00:00:37.860> grabbing<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.370> entire<00:00:38.670> page

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that you're going to bring the bottom up

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.149 
that you're going to bring the bottom up
the<00:01:17.460> bottom<00:01:17.700> flap<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.950> bring<00:01:19.950> one<00:01:20.460> page<00:01:20.729> over

the bottom flap up bring one page over

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.600 
the bottom flap up bring one page over
flip<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.369> side<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.900> way<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> back

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
flip this side all the way to the back

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.980 
flip this side all the way to the back
and<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.170> pops<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.350> corner<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.990> so

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and that pops this corner out like so so

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.270 
and that pops this corner out like so so
just<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.560> came<00:01:31.710> from<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> watch

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
just we came from here and if you watch

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
just we came from here and if you watch
flicks<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.430> side<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:36.000> okay

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
flicks this side out okay

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.060 
flicks this side out okay
and<00:01:37.799> then<00:01:38.009> from<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:38.790> view<00:01:39.950> bring<00:01:40.950> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and then from the back view bring this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.050 
and then from the back view bring this
side<00:01:41.310> over<00:01:42.170> flip<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.350> page<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.850> page

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
side over flip one page up and one page

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.710 
side over flip one page up and one page
over<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.460> solved<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.680> rubix<00:01:49.680> magic

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
over and you just solved the rubix magic

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.790 
over and you just solved the rubix magic
so<00:01:53.150> let's<00:01:54.150> try<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.480> again<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:55.050> little<00:01:55.710> bit

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
so let's try that again a little bit

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.600 
so let's try that again a little bit
faster<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.340> time

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
faster this time

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.440 
faster this time
I'm<00:01:57.570> gonna<00:01:57.720> bring<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:59.120> turn<00:02:00.120> it<00:02:00.300> over

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
I'm gonna bring it here turn it over

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.240 
I'm gonna bring it here turn it over
make<00:02:01.140> sure<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.440> really<00:02:01.620> careful<00:02:01.860> at<00:02:02.100> this

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
make sure you're really careful at this

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.530 
make sure you're really careful at this
park<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.760> can<00:02:02.880> actually<00:02:03.180> break<00:02:03.330> your

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
park is you can actually break your

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.970 
park is you can actually break your
Rubik's<00:02:03.840> magic<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:05.460> flick<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.980> bring

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
Rubik's magic and then flick it bring

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.650 
Rubik's magic and then flick it bring
the<00:02:08.070> top<00:02:08.280> side<00:02:08.520> over<00:02:08.840> right<00:02:09.840> page<00:02:10.110> one<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.660> one

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the top side over right page one the one

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.680 
the top side over right page one the one
side<00:02:12.930> all<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.350> way<00:02:13.380> over<00:02:14.090> from<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.270> back<00:02:15.450> side

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
side all the way over from the back side

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.630 
side all the way over from the back side
you're<00:02:15.960> going<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.200> flip<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.950> flip

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
you're going to flip it like that flip

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:26.000 
you're going to flip it like that flip
one<00:02:17.940> page<00:02:18.530> like<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:21.680> bring<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.800> out<00:02:25.010> okay

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
one page like so and bring it out okay

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.140 
one page like so and bring it out okay
now<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:27.510> get<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.320> fix<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.740> position<00:02:29.250> you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
now to get it to fix this position you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.880 
now to get it to fix this position you
want<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.780> facing<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.560> where

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
want to have it facing like so where

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.180 
want to have it facing like so where
it's<00:02:32.010> an<00:02:32.130> L<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:33.350> make<00:02:34.350> sure<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.620> ring<00:02:34.800> side<00:02:35.070> is

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
