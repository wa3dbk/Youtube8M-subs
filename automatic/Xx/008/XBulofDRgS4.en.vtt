00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.170
 speak there moÃ§ada beauty who speaks and 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 frogs and today I bring another video to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.680
 that accompanies the channel that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.439
 finally after a few days without 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 post video and be able to heal the pain 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.809
 health problem we throat 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.480
 with one more video of injustices then 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.550
 gods the hand giving us continuity in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.160
 series I 'm doing on the channel with a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.559
 video of combo of the characters I want 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.690
 see if I can do all of them 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.960
 I can not guarantee but I'm trying here. 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.910
 just learned how to play low 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.489
 cool with each of the characters to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.100
 do the combos and bring here show 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.789
 for you with exclusive content there 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.129
 in the channel 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.090
 this time we have the how the combos of 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.859
 Super man 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.170
 This is a very cool character from 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.570
 injustice even I found a little 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.869
 overpowered to speak the truth because 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.150
 I have a very high damage. 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.500
 DNA sequences the sequences combos 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.750
 hit 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.170
 they actually take enough damage from 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.420
 opponent and on the other hand he has no 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.600
 many stream it does not have so much 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 stroke variation to be able to use 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.909
 sequence for use in Congo and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.740
 it ends up that his gameplay or the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.780
 how are you guys seeing that every 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.630
 new combo nor the number of hits 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.360
 increases but is basically very similar 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.100
 changes very little because this is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.220
 the main blow this blow that people 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.649
 get up there and grab the character in the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.590
 in the air is practically the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.509
 like him to finish the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.670
 combo actually after the beach in giving 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.240
 pressing r 2 for him to take a damage one 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.399
 slightly larger or uneven is a good 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.270
 a money stake a control for 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.700
 back and square so that it can give a 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.350
 ray in the air so basically with this the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.530
 combos of his are thus very much 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.520
 similar but anyway this is fine 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.800
 nice to play with the character he 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.030
 As I said, he's got some damage as well. 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.890
 high up and with the page you learn 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.050
 make these debris when you 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.040
 is playing online it playing against 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.550
 opponents 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.930
 they help a lot to achieve it 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.070
 defeat the opponent and together with 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.950
 these rubble 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.560
 as he is an ex pm and is quite fast 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.500
 His special, he can also 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.870
 grab the air and face the special beyond 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.370
 to be nice take a lot of damage so it's worth 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.800
 It's really worth learning a little bit about 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.110
 How does this character work? 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.450
 do these as because during the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.240
 multiplayer match there will help 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.650
 quite even practically this was a 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.510
 very fast video to show the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.130
 such as superman 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.800
 I should make other videos like myself 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.480
 I talked about other guys other characters 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.910
 the video is almost 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.890
 end of these as special gives to 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.250
 do as freezing the character in the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.930
 singing and using it is also the scenario 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.030
 throwing him into another arena that 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.370
 this is bringing damage to the opponent and is 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.140
 well cool looks very beautiful it also gives 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.550
 to use this with superman 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.260
 so the video is practically 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.940
 closing the crowd took advantage of 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.100
 analyze who likes it, do not stop clicking 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.410
 in like or add to favorites that 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.900
 this helps a lot in the disclosure and for 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.700
 to pass on to those guys who enjoy games 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.350
 and see the videos on youtube beauty 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.450
 so I'm closing down here until 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.450
 next video earned hug
