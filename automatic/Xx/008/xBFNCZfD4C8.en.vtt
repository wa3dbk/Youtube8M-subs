00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
I'm in Australia I had to have to think

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.529 
I'm in Australia I had to have to think
on<00:00:25.859> what<00:00:25.920> else<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.429> could<00:00:26.490> use<00:00:27.500> my<00:00:28.500> original

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
on what else I could use my original

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.410 
on what else I could use my original
experiment<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.109> some<00:00:31.710> green<00:00:32.130> bar<00:00:33.000> from

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
experiment was with some green bar from

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.770 
experiment was with some green bar from
the<00:00:33.450> stringy<00:00:33.810> battery<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.480> process<00:00:36.480> went

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the stringy battery and the process went

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.290 
the stringy battery and the process went
very<00:00:37.050> well<00:00:38.149> but<00:00:39.149> when<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.750> sheath<00:00:40.500> dried<00:00:40.950> out

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
very well but when the sheath dried out

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.810 
very well but when the sheath dried out
it<00:00:42.469> curled<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.800> distorted<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.789> had<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
it curled and distorted so I had to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.189 
it curled and distorted so I had to
start<00:00:48.120> again<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.090> next<00:00:51.120> time<00:00:51.510> around<00:00:51.570> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
start again so the next time around I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.099 
start again so the next time around I
used<00:00:54.170> some<00:00:55.170> seasoned<00:00:55.800> bark<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.660> much<00:00:57.660> older

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
soaked it for about 24 hours or until it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.789
