00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.219
 in the meantime, the playoffs of the single VTB league are gaining 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.710
 move saves regov in a single youth 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.830
 league champions 200 did not try this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.619
 season new system final 8 fair 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.960
 talent held in Saratov youthful 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.300
 maximalism and high speed contrast 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.580
 against the background of the wisdom of the masters and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.580
 final format on were added excitement 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.619
 each match the case when even the whole 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.050
 unbeaten season on the way to the final 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.239
 there will be no guarantee here everything 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.579
 starts from 0 a time to study 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.040
 rival and recuperate quite already 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.469
 no adult risks to young 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.410
 basketball players and so the top 8 teams 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.600
 the tournament came face to face all 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.160
 starting from the semi-finals and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.250
 even before that everything is very close 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.340
 quality basketball emotions over the edge 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.270
 he is absolutely high level 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.420
 competition 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.980
 and I would say men's emotions that is this 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.310
 not just here young people there 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.710
 a certain age 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.810
 site decision making 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.230
 coaching decision that is all about the heat 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.430
 refereeing that is everything corresponded 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.470
 competition which you can envy 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.260
 very difficult because the quarter finals 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.150
 imposes a very heavy imprint 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.590
 can go down season first to lose and 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.140
 fall off 8 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.450
 Igor just the first game of the day they 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.490
 were the most uninteresting basketball 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.790
 but the plan was probably the most intense 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.380
 by emotions, but already the games of the last day 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.350
 when you play the final here already and physics 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.750
 definitely comes out one of the first 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.670
 roles of psychology naturally 1 lawsuit ska 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.259
 from the championship but it's still far from 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.430
 unequivocal result all games were 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.909
 close and all were different games 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.650
 the finalists toodor cisco is very hard 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.690
 played and of the door brought decent 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.090
 semifinal Khimki they are generally unique 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.409
 the game in my opinion happened where 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.509
 actually so favorite means was 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.549
 bits of team play just command 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.800
 the game that showed who not all fought before 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.929
 the latter is even weaker more or less 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.720
 teams played the strongest 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.160
 well how to save until the last moment and 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.050
 how I really liked that nobody 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.910
 no one was inferior was very interesting 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.760
 all teams wanted to win the first 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.070
 place fought to the last we are very 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.380
 well tuned to them disassembled 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.330
 the team is very good and led them them 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.600
 leaders in nine months so say 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.400
 gave birth to a child because we started 1 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.380
 August is now May 3rd, approximately like 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.220
 Once nine months I am their weaving in the very 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.930
 begged beg 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.880
 and what you need to suffer and you will become 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.910
 the champion 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.370
 here we have become 2 3 multiple champions 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.400
 Youth League Astapkovich Dankevich 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.740
 many guys became the first time for them 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.500
 I donâ€™t know it but now I can see by the eyes 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.050
 that it is scary great joy because 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.840
 well for them to become champions for the first time 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.030
 life and here they are in this offered taught 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.370
 till it was hard yes we had a very 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.570
 hard year vegetables and hardest year on 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.180
 great professional career 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.080
 the coach but we survived and they did 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.440
 Your business is the most important goal and objectives 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.050
 n education of Russian players and in this 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.810
 sense here of this competition which 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.900
 a lot of bad word has passed here 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.620
 material to a lot of a lot of well 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.890
 quality 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.490
 smart very technically trained 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.410
 players 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.750
 Well, like to convert further this 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.300
 the biggest tough question next 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.510
 step for the guys don't fall i continue then 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.870
 progressive 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:42.370
 above the rise here is this basketball yes 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.230
 and the club still bind that player 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.620
 who was raised in his system 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.689
 it would be a mountain of gold youth league 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.060
 went to Moscow silver got 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.310
 Kazan and bronze rides Khimki 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.379
 what route will the medals go 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.349
 adult tournament and find out only through 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:02.069
