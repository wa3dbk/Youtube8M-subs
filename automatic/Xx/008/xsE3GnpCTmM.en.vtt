thing about this timepiece there's
actually<00:01:11.810> five<00:01:12.200> different<00:01:12.280> movements<00:01:13.280> on

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
actually five different movements on

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.890 
actually five different movements on
this<00:01:13.640> watch<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.180> got<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.420> main<00:01:14.659> one

this watch so you got the main one

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.420 
this watch so you got the main one
correct<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:16.130> got<00:01:16.310> four<00:01:17.030> different<00:01:17.299> ones<00:01:17.720> all

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
correct you got four different ones all

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.789 
correct you got four different ones all
around<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:20.180> case<00:01:20.420> of<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.720> watch<00:01:20.900> it's<00:01:21.560> kind

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
around the case of the watch it's kind

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.580 
around the case of the watch it's kind
of<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:21.979> domed<00:01:22.810> case<00:01:23.810> design<00:01:24.350> in<00:01:24.619> on<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.520> big<00:01:26.119> thick

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
of a domed case design in on a big thick

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.530 
of a domed case design in on a big thick
silicone<00:01:27.590> strap<00:01:27.920> that<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.850> whole<00:01:29.090> case

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
silicone strap that the whole case

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.950 
silicone strap that the whole case
itself<00:01:30.049> pretty<00:01:31.010> much<00:01:31.280> moves<00:01:31.670> younger<00:01:32.360> when

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
itself pretty much moves younger when

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.660 
itself pretty much moves younger when
it's<00:01:33.170> on<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.320> case<00:01:33.619> which<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.189> interesting

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
it's on the case which is interesting

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.039 
it's on the case which is interesting
because<00:01:34.790> you<00:01:34.970> can<00:01:35.150> get<00:01:35.270> different<00:01:35.509> angles<00:01:35.780> of

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
because you can get different angles of

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.570 
because you can get different angles of
all<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.470> four<00:01:36.710> different<00:01:37.100> movements<00:01:37.520> that

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
all the four different movements that

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.490 
all the four different movements that
are<00:01:37.700> housed<00:01:37.970> inside<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.720> case<00:01:38.990> alone<00:01:39.320> with

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
are housed inside of the case alone with

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.630 
are housed inside of the case alone with
just<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.009> main

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
just the main
