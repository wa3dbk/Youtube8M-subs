techniques and this one particularly
we're<00:00:11.820> going<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.000> work<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.420> improving<00:00:12.769> hip

we're going to work on improving hip

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.620 
we're going to work on improving hip
internal<00:00:14.340> rotations<00:00:14.849> particularly<00:00:15.389> for

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
internal rotations particularly for

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.980 
internal rotations particularly for
breast<00:00:16.320> strokers<00:00:17.480> breast<00:00:18.480> strokers<00:00:18.690> often

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
breast strokers breast strokers often

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.570 
breast strokers breast strokers often
have<00:00:19.170> issues<00:00:19.529> with<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.890> with<00:00:20.160> their<00:00:20.340> knees

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
have issues with the with their knees

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.060 
have issues with the with their knees
and<00:00:21.420> pain<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> inside<00:00:22.439> part<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.920> their

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and pain on the inside part of their

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.450 
and pain on the inside part of their
knee<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.490> very<00:00:23.670> big<00:00:23.850> part<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.269> often<00:00:24.689> is

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
knee is a very big part of that often is

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.269 
knee is a very big part of that often is
inadequate<00:00:26.460> range<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.359> motion<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> hip<00:00:28.500> so

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
inadequate range of motion at the hip so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.070 
inadequate range of motion at the hip so
really<00:00:29.580> look<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:29.820> testing<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.660> couple<00:00:30.779> things

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
really look at testing a couple things

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.959 
really look at testing a couple things
on<00:00:31.230> Harry<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.189> if<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.489> make<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> change

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
on Harry and see if we can make a change

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.020 
on Harry and see if we can make a change
to<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.390> immediately<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.760> why<00:00:35.760> don't<00:00:36.000> you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
to that immediately so why don't you

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.610 
to that immediately so why don't you
tell<00:00:36.210> me<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.719> having<00:00:37.140> an<00:00:37.290> Avenger

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
tell me as you are having an Avenger

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.979 
tell me as you are having an Avenger
neither<00:00:37.829> towards<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.460> knees<00:00:39.149> together<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
neither towards you knees together is

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.770 
neither towards you knees together is
going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> let<00:00:40.379> them<00:00:40.530> fall<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.610> side

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
going to let them fall out to the side

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.639 
going to let them fall out to the side
so<00:00:42.780> we're<00:00:42.899> looking<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> hip<00:00:43.500> knee

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so we're looking at the hip knee

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.529 
so we're looking at the hip knee
internal<00:00:44.070> rotation<00:00:44.430> range<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.149> motion<00:00:45.450> we

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
internal rotation range of motion we

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.150 
internal rotation range of motion we
consider<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.020> right<00:00:46.230> side<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
consider that right side is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.560 
consider that right side is
significantly<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.180> more<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> left

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
significantly more and more the left

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.990 
significantly more and more the left
side<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.190> we're<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> see

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
side so what we're going to do is to see

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.420 
side so what we're going to do is to see
if<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.480> make<00:00:51.989> any<00:00:52.230> change<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.250> that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
if we can make any change to that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
if we can make any change to that
internal<00:00:54.000> rotation<00:00:54.329> range<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.320> left

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
internal rotation range on the left

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.520 
internal rotation range on the left
here's<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.690> simple<00:00:57.690> thing<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> do

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
here's a simple thing that we get to do

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.639 
here's a simple thing that we get to do
is<00:00:59.250> we'll<00:00:59.520> bend<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.820> knee<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.260> 90

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
is we'll bend that knee up to here at 90

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.219 
is we'll bend that knee up to here at 90
degrees<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> work<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.390> my<00:01:03.690> with

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
degrees I'm going to work with my with

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.920 
degrees I'm going to work with my with
my<00:01:04.379> thumb<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:05.010> at<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> moment<00:01:05.220> now

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
my thumb in there at the moment now

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.149 
my thumb in there at the moment now
targeting<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.080> towards<00:01:07.500> some<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.710> those<00:01:07.830> deep

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
targeting in towards some of those deep

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.810 
targeting in towards some of those deep
hip<00:01:08.400> rotators<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:10.530> through<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.549> glute

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
hip rotators so down through the glute

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.000 
hip rotators so down through the glute
muscle<00:01:12.240> down<00:01:13.049> towards<00:01:13.500> some<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> those<00:01:13.770> other

muscle down towards some of those other
deeper<00:01:14.430> hip<00:01:14.580> rotators<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.450> we're<00:01:15.600> going

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
deeper hip rotators and then we're going

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.020 
deeper hip rotators and then we're going
to<00:01:15.750> maintain<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.259> pressure<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.700> turn

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
to maintain that pressure and just turn

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.359 
to maintain that pressure and just turn
outwards<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.380> release<00:01:20.009> some

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
outwards and see if we can release some

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.980 
outwards and see if we can release some
of<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.000> tightness<00:01:23.270> basically<00:01:24.270> cranking<00:01:24.869> off

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
of that tightness basically cranking off

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.300 
of that tightness basically cranking off
here<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> little<00:01:25.409> bit<00:01:25.619> making<00:01:25.830> sure<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.189> don't

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
here a little bit making sure we don't

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.070 
here a little bit making sure we don't
hurt<00:01:26.580> anything<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.150> his<00:01:27.270> knee<00:01:27.540> at<00:01:27.689> all<00:01:27.840> so

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
hurt anything in his knee at all so

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.210 
hurt anything in his knee at all so
we're<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.290> putting<00:01:28.560> too<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:28.829> pressure<00:01:29.040> on

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
we're not putting too much pressure on

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.849 
we're not putting too much pressure on
to<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:29.759> over<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.060> Harry

we<00:01:39.020> need<00:01:39.140> an<00:01:39.229> effort<00:01:39.500> for<00:01:39.829> quite<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.159> long<00:01:40.310> time

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
we need an effort for quite a long time

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.010 
we need an effort for quite a long time
would<00:01:40.820> like<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.240> depending<00:01:41.539> on<00:01:41.600> how<00:01:41.750> quickly

rotation<00:02:32.709> range<00:02:33.070> of<00:02:33.190> motion<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.570> can<00:02:34.690> hold

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
rotation range of motion so we can hold

rotation range of motion so we can hold
that<00:02:34.900> for<00:02:34.959> as<00:02:35.110> long<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:35.260> we<00:02:35.470> want<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:35.770> that's

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
that for as long as we want but that's

that for as long as we want but that's
let's<00:02:36.280> say<00:02:36.400> that's<00:02:36.670> enough<00:02:36.910> for<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.360> moment

retest thanks with those legs fall

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.699 
retest thanks with those legs fall
outside<00:02:48.310> again<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:50.200> can<00:02:50.290> see<00:02:50.350> quite

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
outside again and you can see quite

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.470 
outside again and you can see quite
easily<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:51.100> that's<00:02:51.610> improved<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.209> let's

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
easily that that's improved that let's

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.630 
easily that that's improved that let's
let's<00:02:53.260> get<00:02:53.440> into<00:02:53.800> rotation<00:02:54.430> quite

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
let's get into rotation quite

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.540 
let's get into rotation quite
significantly<00:02:55.239> next<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.340> short

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
significantly next and so and in a short

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.680 
significantly next and so and in a short
time<00:02:57.610> we've<00:02:57.850> made<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.150> change<00:02:58.360> we<00:02:58.570> can

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
time we've made that change we can

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.330 
time we've made that change we can
expect<00:02:59.049> if<00:02:59.170> we<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.410> produce<00:02:59.650> some<00:03:00.100> more<00:03:00.250> of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
expect if we can produce some more of

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.400 
expect if we can produce some more of
that<00:03:00.400> type<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.900> work<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.110> get<00:03:02.260> some

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
that type of work that we get some

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.620 
that type of work that we get some
better<00:03:02.560> results
