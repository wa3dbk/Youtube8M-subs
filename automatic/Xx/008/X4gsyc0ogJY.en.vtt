up and down they can move forwards
backwards<00:01:14.659> they<00:01:15.320> can<00:01:15.499> move<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:15.950> then<00:01:16.100> out

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
backwards they can move and then out

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.330 
backwards they can move and then out
then<00:01:17.539> the<00:01:17.810> seat<00:01:18.049> pan<00:01:19.539> can<00:01:20.539> slide<00:01:21.020> out<00:01:21.920> for<00:01:22.280> a

then the seat pan can slide out for a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.849 
then the seat pan can slide out for a
taller<00:01:22.640> person<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.270> support<00:01:23.450> them<00:01:23.899> or<00:01:24.229> in<00:01:24.590> for

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
taller person to support them or in for

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.489 
taller person to support them or in for
a<00:01:24.920> shorter<00:01:25.219> person<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.179> then<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:27.049> chair<00:01:27.319> can

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
a shorter person and then the chair can

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:32.499 
a shorter person and then the chair can
be<00:01:27.649> locked<00:01:27.950> at<00:01:28.340> different<00:01:28.759> angles<00:01:30.369> or<00:01:31.369> it<00:01:32.329> can

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
be locked at different angles or it can

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.050 
be locked at different angles or it can
lean<00:01:32.719> right<00:01:32.990> back<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:33.649> obviously<00:01:36.999> this<00:01:37.999> is

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
lean right back and obviously this is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.120 
lean right back and obviously this is
the<00:01:38.240> adjustment<00:01:38.810> for<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.469> tension<00:01:39.740> for

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
the adjustment for the tension for

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.639 
the adjustment for the tension for
leaning<00:01:40.429> back<00:01:40.639> and<00:01:41.170> then<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.289> can<00:01:42.319> lean<00:01:42.619> right

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
leaning back and then you can lean right

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.529 
leaning back and then you can lean right
back<00:01:43.100> in<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.429> chair<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.819> be<00:01:43.939> supported<00:01:44.450> by
