00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.989
 jeffrey herlings and antonio cairoli

 first round of the mx2 also facilitated 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.649
 from the fact that jeffrey herlings leaves 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.929
 from the last position of the pound sign 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.939
 departure is the French jordi tixier a 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.799
 center the shock immediately followed by 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.899
 british poker club the eighteen year old 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.670
 Dutch d'orleans home pilot is though 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.659
 immediately motivated more than ever to a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.270
 treat yourself to the fourth affirmation 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.280
 consecutive exceeds the jump with wine e 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.869
 it gets rid of immediately after max anstie 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.670
 putting himself in pursuit of the days 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.319
 tixier the transalpine resists 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.700
 proudly in command before the 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.440
 hammered pressure of the companion of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.299
 team but at eleven minutes of the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.159
 conclusion of the march hernych body 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.080
 the decisive attack against him and 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.090
 passes to lead in the rear meanwhile 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.039
 with the very first positions already defined 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.319
 and spectacular overtaking of button e 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.090
 petrov going off the track while max 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.950
 rods behind the two treads preserves 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.660
 the third place on the finish line and therefore 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.330
 jeffrey herlings to transit first 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.340
 in front of the deaf and dying max in the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.840
 category mx1 antonio cairoli wants the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.000
 fifth career victory on the circuit 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.470
 dutch parker svar but starting more 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.050
 fast of all in the first run of the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.729
 mx1 and the Russian bob reshef cairoli however it is 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.349
 immediately to his pursuit and with gods 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.149
 balances instant from the top positions for 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.920
 a fall at the start overtakes little 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.629
 time bob searches seem initiated at a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.069
 comfortable success but did not reckon 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.750
 with his teammate of 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.300
 bikers particularly at ease 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.039
 on the black Dutch sand the Belgian ktm 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.569
 it is very fast and after passing bob 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.700
 reach and pass to the command of the race 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.379
 right in front and cairoli once 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.970
 first of the bikers make a mistake 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.010
 distraction that costs you the loss 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.110
 the Sicilian is thus of two positions 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.459
 table number 222 to go first 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.680
 under the checkered flag in front of 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.569
 second iger bob and is third dyker in the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.519
 mx2's second race is still one 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.170
 jeffrey herlings once in a departure 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.030
 who smiles again at the brilliant 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.290
 shore of tizie author of his second 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.599
 day out 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.099
 the Dutch ktm started badly and in phases 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.200
 initials is far from the leading group 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.330
 xvi accounts to the command is particularly 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.459
 inspired by the British jeff nichols that 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.740
 digs with the other Dutch ktm 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.550
 they take and take second place not 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.290
 he's involved 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.580
 head fight the british sledgehambers 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.230
 that seems to be struggling in this 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.970
 second run lap after lap is done 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.950
 increasingly threatening from the rear the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.990
 silhouette of jeffrey herlings that tops 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.850
 all with a disarming ease 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.560
 three minutes from the complete conclusion 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.360
 the masterpiece with overtaking a tixier 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.100
 which allows him to conquer the sixth 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.470
 success in as many marches as this 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.910
 2013 the fourth consecutive on this 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.140
 traced in the mx2 class 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.570
 thanks to this double statement 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 jeffrey herlings makes his with the maximum 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.380
 of points the ranking of day two 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.300
 second places allow jordi tixier 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.700
 to conquer the place of honor in front 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.410
 to jack nicholson in the overall standings 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.580
 despite being disputed 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.710
 only three tests 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.110
 the mx2 world championship already seems 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.910
 almost decided are 49 points of 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.010
 advantage that the phenomenon erding up 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.390
 French tixier but beyond that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.500
 the impression that there is no one in 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.200
 able to counter the excessive power 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.030
 of the Dutchman in race 2 of the mx1 e 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.860
 still howitzer let in the shoot 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.200
 in front of the blue philippe aerts already 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.850
 excellent tenth in race 1 among the bosses and gods 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.220
 bikers with cairoli that this time is 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.630
 unresponsive departing in the head bob 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.610
 reacher seems to stretch over philippe 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.260
 aerts that will come out of the scene soon for a 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.970
 technical problem but did not reckon 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.860
 with the wild Belgian giant gods 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.420
 bikers to win under the flag a 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.580
 chess and give that to cairoli 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.200
 second draws third boas thanks to 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.239
 first place in race 1 in the second race 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.110
 2 antonio cairoli is very poker of 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.820
 success in the netherlands 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.320
 thus winning for the fifth time in 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.580
 career on this track 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.140
 the excellent bikers get on the second 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.630
 step of the podium while winning 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.400
 the third square is Russian bobryshev in 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.260
 cairoli general classification exploits the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.030
 bad day of design but fighting for 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.440
 the very first positions and lengthens 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.330
 definitely on him bringing the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.800
 own advantage 26 lengths yes 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.840
 however, he looks threatening in third place 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.669
 of bikers just one point from desalle e 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.230
 potentially an inconvenient customer for the 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.480
 world championship title fight 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.800
 motocross mx1 mx2 returns between two 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.810
 weeks in Italy in the arc of trento 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.500
 with the Trentino Grand Prix valid 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.500
 as a fourth round
