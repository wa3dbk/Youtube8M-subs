demo phase that we're about to go into

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.830 
demo phase that we're about to go into
here<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.719> project<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> what<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> see

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
here of this project so what you see

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.360 
here of this project so what you see
here<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.199> everything's<00:01:01.590> been<00:01:01.770> removed<00:01:02.160> we've

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
here is everything's been removed we've

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.969 
here is everything's been removed we've
taken<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> fireplace<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.690> Bene<00:01:03.899> some<00:01:04.890> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
taken out the fireplace the Bene some of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.969 
taken out the fireplace the Bene some of
the<00:01:05.040> framing<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.720> drywall<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the framing and then the drywall so you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.649 
the framing and then the drywall so you
see<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.310> big<00:01:08.520> header<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:09.090> across<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.630> top

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
see that big header going across the top

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.750 
see that big header going across the top
that<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.350> load-bearing<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.369> could<00:01:11.580> not

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that was load-bearing so we could not

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.090 
that was load-bearing so we could not
remove<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.170> ended<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.439> removing<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
remove that so we ended up removing the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.679 
remove that so we ended up removing the
hearth<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> fireplace<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.420> low<00:01:15.659> enough

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
hearth so the fireplace was low enough

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.280 
hearth so the fireplace was low enough
as<00:01:16.259> far<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.890> clearance<00:01:17.340> issues<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.290> wood

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
as far as clearance issues to that wood

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.109 
as far as clearance issues to that wood
stud<00:01:19.619> that's<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:20.159> across<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.670> top<00:01:20.700> there

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
stud that's going across the top there

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
stud that's going across the top there
you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.840> see<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> bump<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.830> or

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you can see this is a bump out or

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.460 
you can see this is a bump out or
doghouse<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:24.090> exterior<00:01:24.509> chase<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.140> their<00:01:25.290> home

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
doghouse or exterior chase on their home

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.830 
doghouse or exterior chase on their home
so<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.430> plenty<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.909> clearance<00:01:27.210> issues

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
so we have plenty of clearance issues

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.340 
so we have plenty of clearance issues
within<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:29.150> doghouse<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.170> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
within this doghouse here to make this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.770 
within this doghouse here to make this
fireplace<00:01:31.770> work<00:01:32.100> here's<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.150> box<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
fireplace work here's the box for the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.569 
fireplace work here's the box for the
blower<00:01:34.020> system<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> new<00:01:35.009> fireplace

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
blower system for the new fireplace

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.149 
blower system for the new fireplace
that's<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> allow<00:01:36.270> convection<00:01:36.960> Heat<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that's going to allow convection Heat to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.670 
that's going to allow convection Heat to
go<00:01:38.759> into<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> room<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.590> an

comes<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:44.119> here<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> finished

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
comes out to here we have the finished

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
comes out to here we have the finished
project<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> unit's<00:01:48.390> been

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
project so you can see the unit's been

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
project so you can see the unit's been
lowered<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> floor<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
lowered to the floor we have the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.030 
lowered to the floor we have the
finished<00:01:50.310> cement<00:01:51.270> board<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> tile<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.890> they

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
finished cement board and tile that they

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.429 
finished cement board and tile that they
chose<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
chose on and here you can see we have a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.130 
chose on and here you can see we have a
sealed<00:01:55.890> efficient<00:01:56.880> fireplace<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.630> there's<00:01:57.869> an

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
sealed efficient fireplace so there's an

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.050 
sealed efficient fireplace so there's an
it<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.799> reburn<00:01:59.159> system<00:01:59.610> that's<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
it the reburn system that's in the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.539 
it the reburn system that's in the
fireplace<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.509> allows<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> fire<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
fireplace that allows for the fire the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.999 
fireplace that allows for the fire the
two<00:02:03.509> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.810> reborn'<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
two kind of reborn' and it's going to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.920 
two kind of reborn' and it's going to
radiate<00:02:05.490> heat<00:02:05.880> off<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.210> front<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.540> glass

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
radiate heat off the front of that glass

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.949 
radiate heat off the front of that glass
because<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.799> sealed<00:02:08.190> front<00:02:08.700> glass

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
because of that sealed front glass

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.390 
because of that sealed front glass
that's<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> vents<00:02:10.920> where<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.190> blower

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that's with the vents where the blower

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.800 
that's with the vents where the blower
is<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.760> blow<00:02:11.879> out<00:02:12.030> again<00:02:12.420> that's<00:02:12.629> good

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
is going to blow out again that's good

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.589 
is going to blow out again that's good
give<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> combination<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.800> radiant<00:02:14.370> heat

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
give you a combination of radiant heat

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.960 
give you a combination of radiant heat
combined<00:02:15.650> with<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.860> convection<00:02:17.459> heat<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.880> it

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
combined with that convection heat so it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.930 
combined with that convection heat so it
really<00:02:18.590> really<00:02:19.590> transforms<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.459> room<00:02:20.670> and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
really really transforms the room and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.760 
really really transforms the room and
really<00:02:21.180> transforms<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.080> way<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.440> entire

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
really transforms the way the entire

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.460 
really transforms the way the entire
house<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.190> heated<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.599> customer<00:02:25.020> uses<00:02:25.349> this

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
house is heated the customer uses this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.710 
house is heated the customer uses this
as<00:02:25.680> their<00:02:25.860> only<00:02:26.099> heat<00:02:26.489> source<00:02:26.760> now<00:02:27.060> as<00:02:27.300> opposed

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
as their only heat source now as opposed

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.500 
as their only heat source now as opposed
to<00:02:27.870> running<00:02:28.349> forced<00:02:28.860> air<00:02:28.980> before<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:30.180> again<00:02:30.360> we
