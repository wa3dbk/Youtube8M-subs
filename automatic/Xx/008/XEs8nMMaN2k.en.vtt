00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.430 
we'll be parting that out and this one
will<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.819> done<00:03:00.090> probably<00:03:00.750> next<00:03:00.930> season<00:03:01.349> I'm

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
will be done probably next season I'm

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.170 
will be done probably next season I'm
guessing<00:03:01.799> because<00:03:02.010> we're<00:03:02.580> putting<00:03:02.790> stuff<00:03:03.030> up

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
guessing because we're putting stuff up

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.680 
guessing because we're putting stuff up
in<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.420> loft<00:03:03.569> now<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:06.180> one<00:03:06.390> will<00:03:06.480> be<00:03:06.510> out

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
in the loft now and this one will be out

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.780 
in the loft now and this one will be out
either<00:03:06.959> late<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.590> season<00:03:08.069> or<00:03:08.190> early<00:03:08.640> next

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
either late this season or early next
