Hello, Welcome to Neeta In Kitchen.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.410
Today we are going to prepare Crispy Sabudana Mixture.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.350
Sabudana is also known as Sago.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.810
This recipe is a very popular mixture during fast,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.870
which tastes great and is a real time pass snack.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.810
It can be made easily at home and will definitely be

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.310
better than the namkeen available in the market.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.560
I am sure you will definitely like it.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.070
So let's see the ingredient needed to prepare Sabudana Mixture

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.130
We need 100 Grams of nylon sabudana or large sago pearls

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.059
50 Grams of Peanuts

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.479
50 Grams of Potato Sev

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.219
Â½ Teaspoon Black Pepper Powder

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.100
1Teaspoon Powdered Sugar

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.520
1 Teaspoon Indian Rock Salt

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.990
and Oil to deep fry 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.830
Take a deep frying pan and pour oil in it. 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.340
Let the oil heated properly. 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.200
Make sure that oil should be warm enough otherwise

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.860
sago will not be crispy but sticky and taste bad.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.700
To test the temperature of oil, put one sago pearl in it.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.500
If the sago comes up immediately and become puff, 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.580
it means that our oil is ready to fry. 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.000
Lower down the flame &amp; add small batch of sago pearl to hot oil.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.580
Deep fry it by stirring it constantly over low heat.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.120
Be careful that Sago remains white in color.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.980
Break or eat the sago to check whether they are

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.180
properly cooked from the core.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.500
Take it out in a bowl.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.420
Now we will stir fry our potato sev on low flame and take

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.520
it out immediately. As our oil is hot, sev will be fry immediately

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.620
We will repeat the same process for peanuts.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.220
If we over fry the potato sev &amp; peanuts then they will taste bad

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.409
We have fried all the ingredients.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.620
In a large bowl, mix it well.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.880
Now we will sprinkle Black Pepper powder,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.180
powdered sugar,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.300
Indian rock salt and mix it well.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.140
Our Delicious Sabudana Mixture is ready.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.360
Once cooled, store it in an air-tight container

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.520
and enjoy for next couple of days.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.110
So prepare it at your home &amp; share your experience with me.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.650
