00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920
 and so hello everyone mr to this 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:18.180
 today I will show you as normal as possible 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:22.410
 minecraft is 161 up to version 1 62 but also 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:30.060
 so then you could have such 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:32.399
 the problem is that you come to this 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.050
 want minecraft you don't start 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.760
 growth or must have a license 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.420
 I want to tell you the license to be able to either 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:49.190
 write and so for this we need 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:53.300
 magic launcher that's magic better means we 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.300
 go online to google and punch 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.300
 So 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.410
 now excuse me just slows down 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.050
 because of this because of what i recorded in 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.050
 deep or on the bir and pierce magik 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.270
 launcher and here we see the site with the magicians of Klava 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.120
 than mantra form. On this 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:30.690
 and that means you are downloading from it 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:36.210
 magic lounge here we see 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.280
 such a site and here you are 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.240
 translate it depending on your browser 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.830
 but see this for windows but 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.830
 this is mate your system 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:56.180
 Here we are in this case for windows and I 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:56.180
 I downloaded it later then we copy it 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.990
 folder enter appdata to find your 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.990
 maykravt 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.540
 and so here maykravt 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.410
 . meters so it means we are bringing up here 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:28.820
 so here I have it already there 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:28.820
 then it means open 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.129
 so we wait until it loads it to me 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.280
 opened quickly 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.280

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.170

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.730
