00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.010
 because 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.889
 cotton 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.390
 Hello, thank you very much for watching 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980
 this video today is showing makeup 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.350
 as you can see today's main makeup 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 these are lips red lips are always 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.790
 always up to date 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.030
 very classic look and decided it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.710
 fill with very simple eye makeup and 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.480
 very bronzed skin and not used 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 blush I wanted to create an effect 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.620
 bronze rested later as if 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.140
 just returned from vacation I am very 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.059
 hope you like it toplice 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.940
 if you want to know how I created it 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.680
 then look further so you can 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 guess what I'm starting of course with 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.030
 bases under the shadows as I have many times 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.399
 remembered the base under the shadows extends 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.410
 life also helps your eye makeup 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.780
 in a get-together of shadows and of course transfers 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.149
 full pigment days then turn to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.399
 messenger to the makeup itself and directly 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.170
 I start you and a very interesting shade 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.250
 which few people like me personally 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.470
 I consider it perfect 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.720
 It is a shade of m. from bobbi brown it on 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.810
 in fact the color of the nursery 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.729
 surprises but i think he plays 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.350
 very cool role here such a transition 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.690
 shade of the century folds 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.470
 there I put it and with the help of fluffy 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.470
 brush for shading 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.679
 I decided to put on all the mobile eyelid 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.959
 these are the shadows of Loreal they are of that color 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.179
 champagne really kids no more 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.300
 It looks like a pressed pigment for which I 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.429
 I love them very much they are very well stewed 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.410
 they are very silky in feeling and 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.959
 I recommend to put them better with your fingers 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.490
 so not that the pigment does them 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.530
 really passed on for ages 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.149
 then i come back previous brush 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.840
 used and dialed 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.080
 a little bit 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.990
 colors from bobbi brown and dimming the outer 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.700
 corner of the eye also shading borders 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.910
 between our light shade and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.760
 brown and then with a brush 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.030
 for shading, I draw the line between 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.530
 eyebrow and our brown and after 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.530
 this prakash upper lashes 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.560
 eye makeup I will finish a little bit on the belt 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:29.620
 for now, turn to face makeup at first I 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.400
 I apply makeup base using the future 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.650
 release skinlite 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.120
 it gives a delicate glow to the face that 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.159
 very good spring to your skin 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.310
 looked healthy and rested 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.719
 I distribute the base using a 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.879
 synthetic brush and then level 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.750
 tone using a di dip base from 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.799
 Mike foreva while trying and movement I 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.689
 I use in those places where I need 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.700
 more coverage where I am 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.790
 coverage is not so important i use 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.620
 twisting motion tone i put by 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.439
 the same brush that she wore understand 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.489
 as it seems to me that it allows 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.489
 tonal basis is even better to shade 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.400
 now i come to from disguise 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.560
 bruises under my eyes they 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.359
 strong enough so this process 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.489
 includes a lot of steps that 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.370
 you certainly do not necessarily 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.849
 do but first i put white first 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.519
 pigment 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.470
 but directly to the blue itself and then 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.299
 same on blues our Persky 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.269
 collector i use persian collector 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:31.060
 from mac and all this will allow namely 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.810
 to block the blue so that there is no gray 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.549
 then on under the spatial eye 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.489
 then on top of all this i use 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.500
 ordinary kanter skin color I use 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.549
 him to directly all 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.049
 do it block 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.639
 our its inverted form 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.620
 triangles as it is very profitable 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.620
 highlight the space under the eyes 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.230
 never forget to stain 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.420
 the chancellor is also the inner corner of the eye 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.940
 because there too there is a senecio which 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:09.220
 gives our fatigue all cream 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.110
 texture I always secure powder and I 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.480
 I use it on the whole face not as well 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.610
 eyes it seems to me that it prolongs 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.739
 life and makeup as well as on top 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.630
 and blush browsers or the rest of the powder 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.440
 the products will go to bed very even and 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.200
 no stains 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.230
 and the consequences come eyebrows i use 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.230
 cream shadows from meybellin seems to me 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.410
 they are very similar in color to debra will wash 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.480
 from she stereo hills about these shadows i 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.500
 staining the blood make their field 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:57.760
 correct form 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:59.620
 and more clear and I will 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.720
 combing my eyebrows to a little bit 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.680
 dry our eyebrows did not look at 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.950
 face band 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.080
 and after that I put accents in 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.850
 inner corner of the eye and under the brow all 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.350
 it will make our eyes look like 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.660
 more rested and also on the back 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.860
 raise eyebrow it is very visual 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.979
 looks good 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.990
 and finally dye my lower lashes I 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.879
 I like to do it once dealt 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.069
 concealer under the eyes so that no 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.889
 concealer didn't hit the cilia they didn't 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:29.889
 would look bleached after that i 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.360
 I book a face I do it very rarely but 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.550
 for some reason this time 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.069
 I wanted to use my favorite 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.080
 bronzer from essense he's cheap he 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.270
 good he is fine the dressmaker loses 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.099
 claws the main thing i use all the same 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.590
 brush that I applied tonal 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.689
 basis on our blaser around the perimeter of everything 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.400
 faces and how do you see the difference right 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.520
 the part of course looks a lot more 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.639
 profitable then I shade with 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.129
 tassels dual fibroma abrasive to make it a 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.129
 still somehow looked natural and 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.900
 legendary highlighter alert you in 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.240
 other i will leave 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.129
 and the glare on the cheekbones a little on the top 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.389
 half of the back of the nose and necessarily from 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.490
 check marks above the upper lip 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.620
 and this is just the radiance that is visible from 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:27.339
 cosmos maybe it's not like family 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:29.379
 that's exactly what i like in ours 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:31.750
 makeup left only my lips 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:34.629
 wanted classic red lips and 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.419
 pencil is perfect for this purpose 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:39.339
 from the blessings in the color of the skull I always 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.930
 I draw my lips with a pencil when 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:44.349
 I use some bright dark 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.939
 the rich color and color of the poppy series is 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.020
 exactly the red one that fits 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:49.020
 absolutely everyone 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.900
 when using a bright color on the lips 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.240
 never forget to paint the corners 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.669
 Lip please pay attention to them so 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.520
 how spaces will be visible and it will be 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.860
 look not very nice and I'm on top 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.080
 Obama walked to give the same red too 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:17.810
