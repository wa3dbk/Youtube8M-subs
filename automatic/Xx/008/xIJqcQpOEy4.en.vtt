00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.860
 well, we are msn racing, we are a 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.440
 specialized store in the world of 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.439
 engine but specifically for pilot both 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.090
 of cars like karting currently the 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.860
 material that we have here in exhibition 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.890
 is the material referring to the pilot of 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.350
 car that is a little different from the pilot 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.480
 of karting especially on the part of the 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.010
 fireproof material for example from the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.320
 materials that demand to run is what 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.870
 there is under the underwear the underwear 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.430
 because somehow in this case then 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.220
 well I'm showing you what is the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.159
 shirt that is long sleeve and that 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.110
 is prepared and that is especially 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.390
 designed so that in case of fire 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.130
 inside the vehicle the pilot can 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.710
 to be 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.620
 and have time to get out of the car without 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.720
 that you can burn the same happens so much 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.000
 with the pants that is what we see here 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.010
 and that in addition an important detail is 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.530
 that you can not use your underpants 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.020
 because that's not fireproof is 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.450
 surprising therefore the trousers by 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.880
 example has to be taken without the clothes 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.300
 male interior then we also have 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.640
 the part of the soto casco that goes just 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.220
 Under the helmet, that's why they put it on 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.180
 the pilots over the head and then 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.850
 they put it also precisely for 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.160
 protect the face in case there is a 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.750
 fire inside the vehicle or something else 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.420
 also very important that we can 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.040
 observe are the socks unlike 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.610
 that there are no underpants if there 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.810
 socks and socks is a 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.640
 sock 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.610
 in this case white but 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.930
 designed also with the characteristic 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.850
 from the fire theme clothes always go 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.530
 marked so that the curators can 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.560
 verify what it is 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.740
 the material designed to support the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.590
 heat with this label once we talk 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.930
 clothing had the good monkeys 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.210
 Well, now I'm going to present to you two of the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.819
 monkeys that we sell in messina racing 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.539
 for the car section in this case 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.860
 we're 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.780
 we have here shown the gptech model 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.250
 that is a model the truth that is the top 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.620
 of range of alpinestars 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.489
 and one of the characteristics of this monkey is 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.860
 its lightness is very light very comfortable not 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.480
 bothers the driver when he drives and 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.040
 They are also of the characteristics that 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.900
 have this monkey apart from the colors 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.680
 that you may like more or less 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.519
 is the ergonomics of design in the part 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.230
 rear 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.560
 we see precisely in the back 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.650
 from the cervical area to the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.650
 lumbar area we have this rubber that 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.109
 absorbs the movements of the pilot 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.530
 when he's driving that makes that 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:56.599
 the monkey is very comfortable very comfortable for 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.920
 drive and that does not bother then what 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.500
 which allows the pilot to be 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.840
 100% focused on driving 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.180
 if we see the following model that has 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.000
 for example alpinestars which is the model 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.550
 lower east of here that is 7 us 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.910
 we based on the gp pro logically it is a 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.740
 somewhat cheaper price but also 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.570
 for a city for certain reasons like 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.020
 one of them is the area of ​​the rubber that 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.490
 we only find it in the lower back 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.820
 back area no longer has 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.400
 found also is a monkey that 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.900
 it is not as light as the gp tech but 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.360
 people also like it therefore 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.660
 the criterion of the pilot is the one that 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.670
 decide which monkey to stay with or with 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.739
 the light one and the one that has the gums or 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.540
 well with the gp pro that also like 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.790
 a lot but I repeat it's a tension of 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.790
 the pilot who decides on the purchase
