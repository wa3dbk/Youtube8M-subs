00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello we are in a first video of a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.790
 miniseries that is going to be of this game 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.590
 mcpeak back excel 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.620
 it's a game that was recommended to me 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:24.080
 time and good downloading the 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:28.470
 how do you say the free version for ipad 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.830
 well I made the mistake that now you go 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.150
 Let's see 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.800
 there are three rounds worth 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.690
 until the first the second the third 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.760
 I do not know if this is a fourth this window 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.070
 and since I did not know what the game was for 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.430
 play the first round 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.719
 It's worth how you have to spend in the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.870
 different scenarios where you have 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.899
 that get you not killed 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.640
 and good as I did not know what it was x me 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.699
 I went by and I did not realize what fun 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.420
 is to play this game that to people like 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.420
 you are spending it 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.810
 and I do not remember what had to be done 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.780
 I think you have to catch stretch alone 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.350
 in the eyes that there is like a Martian who 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.350
 it is smoked 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
 by then this miniseries is going to be 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.170
 three chapters 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.690
 only that this one had the capitular be a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.460
 little boring because I already know what there is 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.100
 what to do, although maybe not at all 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.380
 no but you have to create man in the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.330
 belly came out the first one is that will play 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.480
 as did any power and exploited and 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.680
 Uruguay exploits cattle to form a 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.650
 mind that you do not have to get 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.020
 that explode 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.619
 I can not load 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.619
 is to try to give him this fat candle 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.159
 that is this 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.020
 it was a person 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.510
 No idea what to do there 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.410
 ok this is still here has 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.970
 effectively the home 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.130
 then the next video 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.630
 I will spend the second round and I guess 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.550
 it will be a little more entertaining because 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.550
 I'll know what to do 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.620
 here we take the denture is achieved more 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.620
 of a scream that we passed then 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.210
 to ours 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.210
 Like dad 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.930
 and we saved ourselves as an eye 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.170
 and it's going to be the last one we take the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.209
 trophy and we give the alarm 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.040
 this very salty child will take the bomb 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.390
 to your house until later 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.390
 and we saved the school 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.370
 I will not be passing but it's worth 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.370
 vale has to do 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.700
 do not 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.989
 with this data 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.989
 nobody is there 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.650
 do not 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.470
 and it does not have cavitation units 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.430
 and good then 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.330
 I think I want to give line is worth it 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.330
 we have passed the first round 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.849
 good is a video of the other rounds 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.829
 and he wanted to tell us something but he told me 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.420
 he forgot that it was simply that he wanted 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.079
 upload this video for not leaving them a 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.760
 video this weekend and good and 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.640
