it the glare but you can enable that and
what<00:02:00.770> it'll<00:02:00.890> do<00:02:01.099> is<00:02:01.130> it'll<00:02:01.420> use<00:02:02.420> your<00:02:02.539> 3G

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
what it'll do is it'll use your 3G

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.460 
what it'll do is it'll use your 3G
connection<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.330> instead<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.360> receiving<00:02:06.080> on

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
connection and instead of receiving on

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.589 
connection and instead of receiving on
Wi-Fi<00:02:07.039> you'll<00:02:07.310> start<00:02:07.490> transmitting<00:02:08.030> on<00:02:08.209> Wi-Fi

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
Wi-Fi you'll start transmitting on Wi-Fi

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.690 
Wi-Fi you'll start transmitting on Wi-Fi
so<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:08.899> can<00:02:09.289> essentially<00:02:09.560> share<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.310> 3g

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
so you can essentially share the 3g

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.250 
so you can essentially share the 3g
connection<00:02:11.150> with<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.390> laptop<00:02:11.959> or<00:02:12.110> other

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
connection with a laptop or other

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.150 
connection with a laptop or other

portable device ipod touch ipad whatever

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.699 
portable device ipod touch ipad whatever
you<00:02:16.340> like<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.569> share<00:02:17.870> your<00:02:18.079> 3G<00:02:18.440> connection

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
you like and share your 3G connection

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.470 
you like and share your 3G connection
through<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.250> device<00:02:19.549> it's<00:02:20.000> sort<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.269> turns

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
through this device it's sort of turns

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.620 
through this device it's sort of turns
it<00:02:20.630> into<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.900> mifi<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.010> really<00:02:22.340> nice<00:02:22.670> my

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
it into a mifi and it's really nice my

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.910 
it into a mifi and it's really nice my
3g<00:02:23.930> connections<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.380> little<00:02:24.410> bit<00:02:24.650> slow<00:02:24.859> today

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
3g connections a little bit slow today

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.310 
3g connections a little bit slow today
so<00:02:25.250> i<00:02:25.430> haven't<00:02:25.640> gotten<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:26.209> lot<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.989> use<00:02:27.109> out<00:02:27.260> of

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
so i haven't gotten a lot of use out of

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.080 
so i haven't gotten a lot of use out of
that<00:02:27.500> feature<00:02:27.799> but<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.130> definitely<00:02:28.760> appreciate

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
that feature but I definitely appreciate

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.150 
that feature but I definitely appreciate
having<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.750> another<00:02:30.350> thing<00:02:30.560> that's<00:02:30.709> new<00:02:30.890> here

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
having it another thing that's new here

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.349 
having it another thing that's new here
is<00:02:31.280> if<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.459> click<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:31.760> applications<00:02:31.970> and

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
is if you click on applications and

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.490 
is if you click on applications and
manage<00:02:35.359> applications<00:02:35.989> you'll<00:02:36.230> see<00:02:36.380> that

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
manage applications you'll see that

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.720 
manage applications you'll see that
there's<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.739> new<00:02:36.859> on<00:02:37.040> SD<00:02:37.760> card<00:02:38.060> option<00:02:39.730> hobble

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
there's a new on SD card option hobble

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.009 
there's a new on SD card option hobble
you<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:40.970> see<00:02:41.269> that<00:02:42.670> there<00:02:43.670> we<00:02:43.760> go<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.870> says

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
you can see that there we go so it says

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.449 
you can see that there we go so it says
on<00:02:45.200> SD<00:02:45.829> card<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:48.470> turns<00:02:48.799> out<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.069> in

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
on SD card and it turns out that in

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.069 
on SD card and it turns out that in
order<00:02:49.609> to<00:02:49.819> install<00:02:50.150> applications<00:02:50.750> onto<00:02:50.900> the

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
order to install applications onto the

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.440 
order to install applications onto the
SD<00:02:51.170> card<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:52.040> need<00:02:52.280> new<00:02:52.970> versus<00:02:53.329> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
SD card you need new versus the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.699 
SD card you need new versus the
applications<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.049> developers<00:02:54.440> need<00:02:54.590> to

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
applications the developers need to

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.009 
applications the developers need to
enable<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.220> be<00:02:55.459> insulted<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:55.970> SD<00:02:56.690> card<00:02:56.720> so

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
enable it to be insulted a SD card so

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.449 
enable it to be insulted a SD card so
right<00:02:57.139> now<00:02:57.170> there's<00:02:57.470> nothing<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.889> there<00:02:58.100> all

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
right now there's nothing on there all

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.660 
right now there's nothing on there all
my<00:02:58.850> applications<00:02:58.970> are<00:02:59.780> on<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.950> main<00:03:01.340> memory

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
my applications are on the main memory

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.580 
my applications are on the main memory
but<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.150> future<00:03:02.329> you'll<00:03:02.569> be<00:03:02.630> able<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.840> move

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
but in the future you'll be able to move

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.470 
but in the future you'll be able to move
manually<00:03:04.160> move<00:03:04.370> applications<00:03:04.609> over<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.389> the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
manually move applications over to the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.059 
manually move applications over to the
SD<00:03:05.720> card<00:03:05.750> or<00:03:06.109> install<00:03:07.040> them<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.639> the<00:03:07.760> SD<00:03:08.030> card

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.660 

the<00:03:13.069> other<00:03:13.100> thing<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.370> you'll<00:03:13.549> really

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
the other thing that you'll really

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.720 
the other thing that you'll really
notice<00:03:13.819> here<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:15.639> everything<00:03:16.639> just

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
notice here is that the everything just

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.309 
notice here is that the everything just
seems<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:17.030> little<00:03:17.060> bit<00:03:17.420> faster<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:17.989> got<00:03:18.079> a<00:03:18.109> new

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
seems a little bit faster it's got a new

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.860 
seems a little bit faster it's got a new
Justin<00:03:18.950> time<00:03:19.160> java<00:03:19.910> compiler<00:03:20.239> which<00:03:20.660> means

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
Justin time java compiler which means

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.839 
Justin time java compiler which means
that<00:03:21.040> native<00:03:22.040> applications<00:03:22.549> aren't<00:03:22.640> going<00:03:22.790> to

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
that native applications aren't going to

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.170 
that native applications aren't going to
seem<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.780> different<00:03:24.170> but<00:03:24.409> the<00:03:24.879> third<00:03:25.879> party

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
seem to different but the third party

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.930 
seem to different but the third party
applications<00:03:26.720> are

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
applications are

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.430 
applications are
really<00:03:27.090> much<00:03:27.210> more<00:03:27.390> responsive<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:28.350> of

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
really much more responsive so one of

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.350 
really much more responsive so one of
the<00:03:28.590> slowest<00:03:29.520> applications<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.120> I've<00:03:30.240> been

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
the slowest applications that I've been

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.140 
the slowest applications that I've been
using<00:03:30.420> lately<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:31.400> fennec<00:03:32.400> which<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.910> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
using lately is fennec which is the

using lately is fennec which is the
mobile<00:03:33.780> version<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:34.350> Firefox<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.990> because

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
mobile version of Firefox and because

mobile version of Firefox and because
this<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.350> an<00:03:37.440> early<00:03:37.650> beta<00:03:37.950> release<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.370> fennec

this is an early beta release a fennec

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.080 
this is an early beta release a fennec
it<00:03:38.970> does<00:03:39.600> tend<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.900> be<00:03:39.990> really<00:03:40.230> slow<00:03:40.710> but<00:03:41.280> much

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
it does tend to be really slow but much

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.000 
it does tend to be really slow but much
much<00:03:42.510> faster<00:03:42.690> much<00:03:42.930> more<00:03:43.260> responsive<00:03:43.530> doesn't

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
much faster much more responsive doesn't

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.310 
much faster much more responsive doesn't
really<00:03:44.130> increase<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.240> page<00:03:45.540> rendering<00:03:45.840> too

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
really increase the page rendering too

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.790 
really increase the page rendering too
much<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.370> application<00:03:48.470> just<00:03:49.470> doesn't

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
much but the application just doesn't

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800 
much but the application just doesn't
seem<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.070> take<00:03:50.280> as<00:03:50.460> long<00:03:50.490> when<00:03:50.970> you're<00:03:51.120> moving

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
seem to take as long when you're moving

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.720 
seem to take as long when you're moving
from<00:03:52.140> place<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.440> place<00:03:52.470> launching<00:03:53.310> new<00:03:53.430> tabs

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
from place to place launching new tabs

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.230 
from place to place launching new tabs
exactly<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:54.800> things<00:03:55.800> like<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.730> fennec

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
exactly and things like that so fennec

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.850 
exactly and things like that so fennec

looking for so if you've got more than a

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.510 
looking for so if you've got more than a
dozen<00:06:15.200> applications<00:06:15.950> on<00:06:16.070> your<00:06:16.190> phone<00:06:16.340> it's

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
gonna be a lot faster to find maybe by

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.409 
gonna be a lot faster to find maybe by
typing<00:06:18.380> for<00:06:18.530> them<00:06:18.680> instead<00:06:19.280> of<00:06:19.340> scrolling<00:06:20.120> and

can rotate the screen and in the past

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.870 
can rotate the screen and in the past

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 
you could only rotate in one direction

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.279 
you could only rotate in one direction
I've<00:07:27.270> gotten<00:07:27.510> very<00:07:27.630> used<00:07:27.720> to<00:07:27.930> having<00:07:27.990> a

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:28.289 
I've gotten very used to having a

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:30.890 
I've gotten very used to having a
trackball<00:07:28.680> on<00:07:28.830> the<00:07:28.919> side<00:07:29.389> on<00:07:30.389> the<00:07:30.539> right<00:07:30.690> side

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 
trackball on the side on the right side

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.000 
trackball on the side on the right side
but<00:07:32.090> you<00:07:33.090> can<00:07:33.240> also<00:07:33.419> now<00:07:33.720> rotate<00:07:34.139> in<00:07:34.710> the<00:07:34.860> other

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.010 
but you can also now rotate in the other

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.950 
but you can also now rotate in the other
direction<00:07:35.250> you<00:07:36.000> can't<00:07:36.210> rotate<00:07:36.449> upside<00:07:36.840> down

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
direction you can't rotate upside down

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.290 
direction you can't rotate upside down
but<00:07:37.680> I<00:07:37.710> can't<00:07:37.979> quite<00:07:38.490> imagine<00:07:38.669> why<00:07:39.000> you'd<00:07:39.120> want

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 
but I can't quite imagine why you'd want

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.180
