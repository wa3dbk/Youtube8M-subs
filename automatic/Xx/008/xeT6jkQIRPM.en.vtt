00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.490
 wondering faces among the makers of the 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.259
 Bundesliga since the numbers of the new 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.240
 English television contract are known 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.710
 is discussed how to the bundesliga 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.900
 make it even more profitable 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.330
 especially the demand for unpopular 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.610
 measures by dfl-chef seifert scares 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.440
 many fans on another split 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.040
 the game day is no longer a taboo 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.870
 his 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.900
 Of course we also have to think 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.400
 make as we remember our markets 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.650
 the others can open it 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.390
 Connection times need than 15 30 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.949
 Of course, not many like to hear that 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.480
 Some say this is not allowed to be us 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.829
 have to keep the tradition 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.450
 but I still think that we are with the 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.250
 time have to go and that just that 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.690
 discussion about kick-off times they need 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.310
 we just lead open and honest 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.149
 and if that leads to us 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.710
 More television money can be achieved at the 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.260
 tv contracts yes there you have to 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.300
 thoughts make 95 billion euros 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.730
 get manchester united and co for 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.239
 three games 3.2 billion per 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.700
 season 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.530
 There are 800 for comparison in Germany 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.120
 35 million per season 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.620
 but the bundesliga has in the last 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.270
 years even though economically in the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.780
 disadvantage in comparison to the premier league 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.780
 caught up 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.889
 basically more gets tv money 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.409
 gets as tables first of 

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:13.819
 Bundesliga that's huge 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.069
 differences we always have to deal with more 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:19.159
 In spite of everything, we all know that 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.959
 Of course, every player is what 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.399
 the single club has to offer that 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.509
 not all participants in the 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.700
 Premier League in the Champions League 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.380
 really play on split as in 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.119
 the bundesliga is the day of the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.380
 premier league but not one 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.270
 There are more games in england 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.549
 six instead of five different 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.529
 kick off times on a weekend a lot 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.359
 it is more serious in spain where it is for 

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:40.310
 ten games ten different 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.869
 abutting times must be careful 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.529
 in germany, i always have quite good 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.609
 made that we have the mistakes that very much 

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:49.279
 good always available that we do not 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.350
 about gambling already sees that 

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:52.240
 other 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.470
 vacation with the apart of those 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.270
 not quite agree 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.229
 It's not just the kick-off times 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.659
 could change 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.549
 also possible new later 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.560
 the seasons of the sports show around the 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.560
 to strengthen the exclusivity of pay-tv
