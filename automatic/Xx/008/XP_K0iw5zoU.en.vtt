00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.899
 still gigabytes and this is another 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.460
 video series how to counter 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.160
 today we will have a hero release 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.860
 whom many have asked I chose it from 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 comments at least recently 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.600
 you rarely see publicly 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.260
 this hero is very strong and dangerous today 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 release huskar drove 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.250
 first you need to identify weaknesses 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.650
 our hero's first absence 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.960
 no delays, despite the fact that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.030
 q feed fairly easy control 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.610
 he is clearly not enough 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.239
 the slowdown from the ults doesn't count second 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.590
 severely vulnerable to physical damage 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.420
 Passive of Huscar protects him well against 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.840
 mac pro cast of but that's not physical 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.730
 attacks it will crumble just like that 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.360
 the third though and not force but nevertheless 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.539
 artifact dependence 4 is not the most 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.809
 settled Leith potential as always a little 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.789
 your hero hozcar is light enough 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.920
 in the management of the hero with built 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.229
 hill kai fire arrows with dota ron 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.869
 Smartest passive and dangerous 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.689
 Ulta It has excellent gank 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.920
 the potential especially the beginning of the game is very 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.780
 perceptible damage from ulta 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 a coupe with fire arrows helps 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.900
 kuskar almost instantly kill 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.189
 the enemy 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.700
 beyond that even if you leave it 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.470
 on low hp it just won't kill you 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.909
 for the bite of pun is not enough health like him 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.979
 as if the rambo mode is on 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.200
 but becomes almost invulnerable by 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.689
 all magical ron and attacks you with 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.520
 speed of light and turns such situations 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.320
 When Khuskar remaining so p 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.930
 killed your team's floor in front of your 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.130
 death the best line for cuzco and tomit 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.680
 now go directly to your 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.329
 the actions of the fault of what is best for you 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.880
 take certain heroes about which i 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.119
 I'll tell you later, you must remember a couple 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.680
 Things first is that against huskar 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.329
 better not to take jokers and heroes 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.390
 exclusively mac pro cast 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.840
 For example, Zeus is all because of passive 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.729
 which gives the magician resist the second this 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.899
 that in the first half of the game hozcar is very 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.899
 strong and do not underestimate him 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.970
 your team must be hurt 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.860
 must stand wards as after 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.349
 how will kuskar get his ultimate right away 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.670
 go make frags in order to 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.530
 avoid it we just need 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.160
 put standard anti ganga and wards 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.150
 and at the sight of kuskara go away 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.519
 it's also important to control him 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.959
 movement if your mider will 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.660
 constantly giving information action 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.799
 Huskara write down and and so forth 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.879
 I want to catch a grunt 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.080
 It will be very easy due to the fact that Khuskar 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.879
 them for which disables 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.310
 who against him will help you a lot 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.799
 teleport if it so happens that you 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.780
 met descent arm11 its sure that you 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.610
 cope with them you immediately do you 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.170
 about u 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.769
 sweden you can not do anything but kill 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.560
 is unlikely to have time themselves physics with korra 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.000
 at first, it will become simply useless 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.519
 firstly he won't have the ones he needs 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.250
 Artov And secondly, these Khuskar is far from 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.170
 the most powerful and useful characters are not 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.180
 dying from his hand the question is simple 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.560
 hammer a nail in his own coffin because 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.010
 huskar is designed specifically for large 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.370
 number of early frags it's time 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.480
 talk specifically about counter heroes 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.730
 great choice against huskar and will 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.160
 a hero with illusions namely house night and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.090
 phantom lancer 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.740
 huskar is a fat killer and he doesn't have 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.110
 arsenal no ouya abilities for 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.540
 destruction illusions that simply 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.040
 wipe it off 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.270
 In addition, the same house night has 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.130
 quite good health 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.340
 which helps him to easily worry 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.960
 Ugta Khuskar best hero to take and taste 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.970
 my box and not only opinion 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.430
 is a troll as we said 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.680
 Oscar strongly weasley kind of physical 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.900
 Damage from this morning for at least 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.070
 have plenty 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.290
 thanks to the high attack speed three 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.260
 ways not to give out the wildest nat fsp and 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.460
 do not forget about the ability receptors 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.780
 also if the opposite team from 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.300
 a piece then you can safely take Troll 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.100
 a good hero will also be vrk thanks 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.380
 its ulta it outputs as the Troll 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.990
 big pussy ps from which not to 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.060
 what to save for and the third skill is bright and 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.040
 gus soon it is easy to kill her after squeeze 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.510
 ulta 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.760
 if you talk about fist dagragers would 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.760
 a crime not to mention here mortru 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.920
 even say nothing scales attack speed 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.230
 kicking and powerful krits 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.330
 but do not forget that phantom 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.530
 assassin is primarily a light hero 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.000
 and to get 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.490
 deadly crites 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.530
 she needs and artifacts therefore at first 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.770
 just keep from descending rapa 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.120
 further and be always on guard 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.940
 of the subjects I would like to highlight 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.860
 the following artifacts namely bkb and 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.900
 halberd 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.720
 tank served frolicked cult kuskar a 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.610
 also to the orders grew old if you have 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.920
 bkb you will have to housar very much 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.270
 try to kill you 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.780
 halberds gives us additional misses 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.610
 health 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.160
 what helps us to live further against 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.900
 Huskar and design which is great 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.520
 protect us from everything and so make it 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.120
 almost completely useless in 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.870
 Timfayte on it all thanks for the fact that
