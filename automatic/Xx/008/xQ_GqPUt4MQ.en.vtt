technically starts a semi tone below
that<00:00:26.800> on<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:26.980> f-sharp<00:00:27.249> but<00:00:27.820> there<00:00:28.179> are<00:00:28.330> some

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
that on the f-sharp but there are some

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.130 
that on the f-sharp but there are some
saxophones<00:00:29.560> made<00:00:29.859> these<00:00:30.070> days<00:00:30.310> that<00:00:31.150> do<00:00:31.929> have

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
saxophones made these days that do have

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.130 
saxophones made these days that do have
an<00:00:32.320> F<00:00:32.470> sharp<00:00:32.770> key<00:00:33.210> which<00:00:34.210> enables<00:00:34.750> you<00:00:34.840> to<00:00:34.870> play

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
an F sharp key which enables you to play

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.319 
an F sharp key which enables you to play
it<00:00:35.410> quite<00:00:35.860> simply<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.410> not<00:00:38.710> use<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.489> any

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
it quite simply and not use the any

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.709 
it quite simply and not use the any
alternative<00:00:41.520> fingerings<00:00:42.520> of<00:00:42.789> decimal<00:00:43.390> style

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
alternative fingerings of decimal style

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.240 
alternative fingerings of decimal style
fingerings<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.940> technically<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.739> the

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
fingerings so technically the the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.160 
fingerings so technically the the
autosomal<00:00:48.609> range<00:00:49.030> starts<00:00:49.449> at<00:00:49.600> that<00:00:49.719> high<00:00:49.930> F

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
autosomal range starts at that high F

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.529 
autosomal range starts at that high F
sharp<00:00:50.500> of<00:00:51.219> your<00:00:51.609> highest<00:00:51.820> F<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.420> you

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
sharp of your highest F that you

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.880 
sharp of your highest F that you
normally<00:00:52.690> play<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.960> interesting<00:00:56.469> thing<00:00:56.710> I

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
normally play the interesting thing I

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.959 
normally play the interesting thing I
noticed<00:00:57.579> was<00:00:57.969> after<00:00:59.370> struggling<00:01:00.370> for<00:01:00.550> quite<00:01:00.940> a

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
noticed was after struggling for quite a

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.350 
noticed was after struggling for quite a
while<00:01:01.210> and<00:01:02.070> practicing<00:01:03.070> in<00:01:03.219> and<00:01:03.460> working<00:01:04.210> on

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
while and practicing in and working on

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.080 
while and practicing in and working on
this<00:01:04.650> technique<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:06.340> be<00:01:06.460> able<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.670> play<00:01:06.910> up

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
this technique to be able to play up

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.710 
this technique to be able to play up
there<00:01:07.620> once<00:01:08.620> I<00:01:08.800> did<00:01:08.980> hit<00:01:09.190> that<00:01:09.220> G<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
there once I did hit that G the

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.320 
there once I did hit that G the
following<00:01:11.170> notes<00:01:11.410> became<00:01:12.100> a<00:01:12.460> lot<00:01:12.880> easier

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
following notes became a lot easier

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.820 
following notes became a lot easier
because<00:01:13.840> then<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.230> was<00:01:14.320> just<00:01:14.410> a<00:01:14.560> matter<00:01:14.740> of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
because then it was just a matter of

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.980 
because then it was just a matter of
finding<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.430> alternate<00:01:16.390> fingerings<00:01:16.900> for

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
finding the alternate fingerings for

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.010 
finding the alternate fingerings for
each<00:01:17.260> note<00:01:17.650> as<00:01:17.890> I<00:01:18.070> went<00:01:18.310> up<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.720> worked

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
each note as I went up that worked

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.730 
each note as I went up that worked
because<00:01:20.980> I<00:01:21.010> had<00:01:21.780> had<00:01:22.780> developed<00:01:23.380> the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
because I had had developed the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.270 
because I had had developed the
technique<00:01:24.550> needed<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:26.080> that<00:01:26.440> is<00:01:26.950> what<00:01:27.130> this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
technique needed and that is what this

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.820 
technique needed and that is what this
course<00:01:27.580> is<00:01:27.700> all<00:01:27.850> about<00:01:28.410> finding<00:01:29.410> and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
course is all about finding and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.190 
course is all about finding and
developing<00:01:30.120> that<00:01:31.120> technique<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.870> one<00:01:32.050> that

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
developing that technique that one that

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.180 
developing that technique that one that
will<00:01:32.530> enable<00:01:32.830> you<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.160> play<00:01:33.970> up<00:01:34.180> there<00:01:34.620> so<00:01:35.620> how

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
will enable you to play up there so how

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.480 
will enable you to play up there so how
high<00:01:36.370> can<00:01:36.430> we<00:01:36.610> go<00:01:37.140> well<00:01:38.140> enough<00:01:38.530> sax<00:01:38.890> invented

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
high can we go well enough sax invented

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.690 
high can we go well enough sax invented
