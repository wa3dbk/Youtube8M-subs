we<00:00:10.769> have<00:00:10.950> always<00:00:11.130> thought<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.550> design<00:00:12.210> as

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
we have always thought of design as

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.160 
we have always thought of design as
being<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.160> much<00:00:14.190> more<00:00:14.370> than<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.020> the<00:00:16.020> way

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
being so much more than just the way

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.120 
being so much more than just the way
something<00:00:16.500> looks<00:00:20.090> it's<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.330> whole<00:00:21.510> thing<00:00:22.130> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
something looks it's the whole thing the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.310 
something looks it's the whole thing the
way<00:00:23.250> something<00:00:23.699> actually<00:00:23.880> works<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.080> many

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
way something actually works on so many

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.650 
way something actually works on so many
different<00:00:25.590> levels

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.980 

ultimately<00:00:31.660> of<00:00:31.900> course<00:00:32.310> design<00:00:33.310> defines<00:00:33.990> so

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
ultimately of course design defines so

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:47.319 
ultimately of course design defines so
much<00:00:35.350> of<00:00:35.560> our<00:00:35.680> experience

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.430 

I<00:00:47.359> think<00:00:48.170> there<00:00:48.499> is<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.949> profound<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.440> enduring

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
I think there is a profound and enduring

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.299 
I think there is a profound and enduring
beauty<00:00:52.600> in<00:00:53.600> simplicity<00:00:54.550> in<00:00:55.550> clarity<00:00:56.239> in

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
beauty in simplicity in clarity in

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.689 
beauty in simplicity in clarity in
efficiency<00:00:58.309> true<00:00:59.179> simplicity<00:00:59.539> is<00:01:00.699> derived

efficiency true simplicity is derived

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.170 
efficiency true simplicity is derived
from<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:02.690> much<00:01:02.960> more<00:01:03.729> than<00:01:04.729> just<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:05.149> absence

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
from so much more than just the absence

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.109 
from so much more than just the absence
of<00:01:05.720> clutter<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.170> ornamentation<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.789> about

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
of clutter and ornamentation it's about

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.460 
of clutter and ornamentation it's about
bringing<00:01:08.390> order<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.369> complexity

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.090

we've<00:01:43.350> considered<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.520> tiniest<00:01:45.210> details

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
we've considered the tiniest details

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.580 
we've considered the tiniest details
like<00:01:46.650> refining<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.280> typography<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:49.440> much

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
like refining the typography to much

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.640 
like refining the typography to much
larger<00:01:50.100> ones<00:01:50.310> by<00:01:50.909> redesigning<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.170> icons

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
larger ones by redesigning all the icons

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.120 
larger ones by redesigning all the icons

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and developing a grid system allowed us

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.330 
and developing a grid system allowed us
to<00:01:56.159> achieve<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:57.030> much<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.450> harmonious
