00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.374
I completely understand...

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:58.121
the loving nickname
he was given, "Gusta,"

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:01.173
they call him "Gusta,"
our great defender, our sheriff.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.176
He was called up to dispute
the Pan American Games,

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.199
"Gusta!"

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.167
He looks like Reginaldo Rossi!

00:01:09.823 --> 00:01:11.712
I don't, dude!

00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:14.610
He's known as the "Rei do Brega!"

00:01:15.404 --> 00:01:17.813
I'll stop,
I'll stop fooling around!

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:19.911
Zito was an incredible person,

00:01:20.343 --> 00:01:24.059
it's because of him that
I'm here getting ready to play,

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:26.491
he was very important to me,

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.540
and, God willing,
I'll score a goal for him.

00:01:30.277 --> 00:01:31.707
I'd like to send a kiss
to my fans...

00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:33.536
and to my fan clubs!

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:36.611
The fan club run by
Ana and Suelen Vasconcelos!

00:01:37.403 --> 00:01:39.266
Kisses to both of you,
my beauties!

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:40.874
They'll go nuts!

00:01:41.154 --> 00:01:43.035
They're always posting
something new!

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:46.786
Now I'll repay their fondness,
kisses to both of you!

00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:48.271
Marcelo Barreto!

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.790
- Geuvânio decided to move forward...
- Geuvânio is moving forward...

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.405
and he scored!

00:01:53.908 --> 00:01:54.835
Here's the thing:

00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:59.264
they wanted to cut the hair of the boys
who came from the Youth Academy,

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:01.781
then they cut Thiago Maia's hair,

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:03.776
but when they were to cut
John's hair,

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:05.544
a goalkeeper, 6' 5" feet tall,

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:07.256
no one had the courage!

00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:08.993
Nobody will ever cut my hair!

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.975
I'm from Diadema, dude!

00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:14.410
They gave up,
Leandrinho gave up,

00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:15.885
Gabigol gave up,

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.156
they gave up!

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.948
I'll tell John that you are the one
who will cut his hair!

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:23.639
Will you? Alright then,
I want to see that!

00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:25.039
Will you?

00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:27.887
No, it's impossible,
he's huge!

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.972
It wouldn't be easy!

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.036
Today we're going home
as winners,

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:40.608
then we'll be the Santos FC we were
at the beginning of the season!

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:41.221
Let's do it!

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.533
We must be confident!

00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:44.801
We had four chances,
in four matches...

00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:47.274
we scored the opener,
but we didn't manage the result.

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:51.262
We must be patient,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.067
and by patient I mean that...

00:03:53.448 --> 00:03:55.676
we must watch our passing,
we can't miss.

00:03:55.855 --> 00:03:56.807
This is a great match,

00:03:56.927 --> 00:03:58.883
a match that everyone
likes to dispute,

00:03:58.884 --> 00:03:59.761
furthermore,

00:03:59.762 --> 00:04:01.492
we'll have an entire week
ahead of us,

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:02.624
let's win today's match,

00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:03.786
we must commit ourselves,

00:04:03.787 --> 00:04:07.324
keeping in mind that
we must help each other,

00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:09.644
if you experience a problem,
speak up,

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:12.113
we don't have only one captain,
we have eleven,

00:04:12.114 --> 00:04:12.926
everyone must speak up.

00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:13.808
One more thing,

00:04:13.972 --> 00:04:16.828
there are people from outside
giving us information,

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.401
their point of view might be
different from ours,

00:04:19.712 --> 00:04:23.001
we must pay attention
to their information.

00:05:03.717 --> 00:05:05.775
This is a very important victory,

00:05:06.258 --> 00:05:08.016
we showed how strong our group is,

00:05:08.547 --> 00:05:10.208
we had a weakened side,

00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:14.182
but our group is hard working,

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:17.389
we managed to prove to ourselves...

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.121
that we're qualified enough
to be at the top.

00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:20.724
Very important,

00:05:21.062 --> 00:05:22.029
it was a derby match,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.206
we'll have an entire week
to work hard,

00:05:25.207 --> 00:05:26.103
to rest,

00:05:26.497 --> 00:05:28.524
now we must keep it up,

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.642
we must work hard,
we deserve to be at the top.

00:05:31.643 --> 00:05:34.524
I'd like to thank our fans
for their support,

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:36.089
we played with our guts!

00:05:36.207 --> 00:05:37.940
I'm very happy with the victory,

00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:40.280
we needed to play
just like we did today,

00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:43.333
it was a tough match,
but we deserved to win,

00:05:44.286 --> 00:05:46.435
we must glorify God...

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:48.781
This dude is a great player!

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:51.176
We just need to give him a chance,
he's a great player!

00:05:51.177 --> 00:05:53.675
He's a great player,
you saw that today!

00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:55.890
- My partner!
- Thanks!

00:05:56.451 --> 00:05:58.822
We're working hard
to do our best for Santos FC,

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.924
and, thanks to God,
today we managed...

00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:04.433
to help Santos FC win.

00:06:04.434 --> 00:06:06.834
I'd like to thank our fans
for their support,

00:06:06.835 --> 00:06:09.715
we're counting on their support
to help us ascend,

00:06:09.716 --> 00:06:13.018
we need to get out
of the lower reaches.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.871
Today we can celebrate,

00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:20.744
we dedicate it to our fans...

00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.191
and to Zito's relatives,

00:06:23.192 --> 00:06:25.509
we hope it brings them
some happiness,

00:06:25.936 --> 00:06:28.108
it doesn't ease their pain,

00:06:28.442 --> 00:06:30.628
but it was important to us,

00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:34.770
and we hope it turns out to be
the starting point...

00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:38.161
for a great campaign throughout
the Brazilian Championship.
