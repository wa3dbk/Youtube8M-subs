this game type is all about so unlike

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
this game type is all about so unlike
regular<00:00:46.020> capture<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> flag<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.129> don't<00:00:47.399> have

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
regular capture the flag you don't have

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.670 
regular capture the flag you don't have
to<00:00:47.760> go<00:00:47.850> into<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> enemy's<00:00:48.510> base<00:00:48.750> capture<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
to go into the enemy's base capture that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.260 
to go into the enemy's base capture that
flag<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.129> run<00:00:50.219> all<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.610> back<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> your

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
flag and run all the way back to your

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
flag and run all the way back to your
base<00:00:51.420> instead<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.590> flag<00:00:52.920> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
base instead there's just one flag that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.220 
base instead there's just one flag that
spawns<00:00:53.850> pretty<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.750> middle<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
spawns pretty much in the middle of the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.779 
spawns pretty much in the middle of the
map<00:00:55.379> usually<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.010> most<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> cases<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
map usually in most of the cases it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
map usually in most of the cases it
spawns<00:00:57.000> right<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> middle<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.199> both

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
spawns right in the middle and both

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
spawns right in the middle and both
teams<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.579> fight<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.359> flag<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
teams have to fight to get that flag and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.170 
teams have to fight to get that flag and
then<00:01:01.050> take<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.559> their<00:01:01.829> home<00:01:02.129> base<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.090> I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
then take it to their home base so I

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.880 
then take it to their home base so I
would<00:01:03.510> say<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.960> actually<00:01:04.110> reminds<00:01:04.769> me

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
would say that it actually reminds me

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
would say that it actually reminds me
more<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.189> team<00:01:05.880> defender<00:01:06.420> from<00:01:06.720> modern

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
more of team defender from modern

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
more of team defender from modern
warfare<00:01:07.140> 3<00:01:07.320> than<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> does<00:01:08.159> capsule<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> fly

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
warfare 3 than it does capsule to fly

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.490 
warfare 3 than it does capsule to fly
because<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.210> team<00:01:09.390> defender<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:10.290> was<00:01:10.380> only

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
because in team defender there was only

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.469 
because in team defender there was only
one<00:01:10.830> flag<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.640> hold<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.000> flag<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
one flag you have to hold that flag and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.510 
one flag you have to hold that flag and
you<00:01:12.540> got<00:01:12.720> points<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.860> kind<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> similar

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you got points and it's kind of similar

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.859 
you got points and it's kind of similar
to<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> course<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to this but of course you do have to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.990 
to this but of course you do have to
actually<00:01:16.049> capture<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.850> only

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
actually capture it but there is only

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.030 
actually capture it but there is only
one<00:01:18.360> flag<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.229> actually<00:01:19.530> fighting

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
one flag and you are actually fighting

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
one flag and you are actually fighting
over<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.490> flag<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.299> especially<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.110> some

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
over that flag and especially in some

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.140 
over that flag and especially in some
games<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.130> into<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.850> will

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
games that you get into it will

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910 
games that you get into it will
definitely<00:01:24.630> feel<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.290> team<00:01:25.530> defender

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
definitely feel like team defender

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.649 
definitely feel like team defender
because<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.340> played<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.820> game<00:01:27.030> where

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
because I played one game where

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.660 
because I played one game where
basically<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> guys<00:01:28.470> were<00:01:28.829> they<00:01:29.250> had<00:01:29.400> lost

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
basically the guys were they had lost

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.310 
basically the guys were they had lost
the<00:01:29.909> first<00:01:30.150> round<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> second<00:01:31.229> round

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the first round so for the second round

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.590 
the first round so for the second round
they<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.740> sat<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.159> back<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.909> their<00:01:33.180> spawn

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
they just sat in the back of their spawn

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.899 
they just sat in the back of their spawn
with<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> flag<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.189> didn't<00:01:35.460> even<00:01:35.520> try<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
with the flag and didn't even try and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
with the flag and didn't even try and
capture<00:01:36.210> which<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.720> kind<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.170> annoying<00:01:37.439> but

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
capture which was kind of annoying but

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.190 
capture which was kind of annoying but
yeah<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.700> definitely<00:01:38.939> turned<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.689> into<00:01:39.869> team

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
yeah that definitely turned it into team

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
yeah that definitely turned it into team
defender<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.280> must<00:01:41.549> say<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.210> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
defender and I must say that this is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.080 
defender and I must say that this is
probably<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:43.200> favorite<00:01:43.229> game<00:01:44.100> type<00:01:44.430> right<00:01:44.880> now

of<00:02:56.520> this<00:02:56.610> game<00:02:57.060> type<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.480> would<00:02:57.870> say<00:02:58.140> there's

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
of this game type I would say there's

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.380 
of this game type I would say there's
maybe<00:02:58.709> three<00:02:58.860> different<00:02:59.760> ways<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.180> play<00:03:00.360> this

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
maybe three different ways to play this

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.270 
maybe three different ways to play this
game<00:03:00.660> site<00:03:00.870> there<00:03:01.050> might<00:03:01.230> be<00:03:01.260> more<00:03:01.620> if<00:03:01.890> there

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
game site there might be more if there

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.710 
game site there might be more if there
is<00:03:02.400> more<00:03:02.640> I'll<00:03:02.820> let<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.480> go<00:03:03.630> along

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
is more I'll let you know as I go along

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.900 
is more I'll let you know as I go along
but<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.500> first<00:03:04.740> way<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.520> person<00:03:05.880> that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
but the first way is the person that

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.940 
but the first way is the person that
basically<00:03:06.300> just<00:03:06.570> runs<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.200> flag<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.800> your

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
basically just runs the flag it is your

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.130 
basically just runs the flag it is your
main<00:03:08.190> mission<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.760> get<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.150> flag<00:03:09.390> pick<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.020> up

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
main mission to get that flag pick it up

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.290 
main mission to get that flag pick it up
run<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.770> capture<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.520> that's<00:03:11.910> your<00:03:12.090> job

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
run it capture it that's your job

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.820 
run it capture it that's your job
obviously<00:03:12.900> for<00:03:13.020> this<00:03:13.170> kind<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.380> class<00:03:13.620> you

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
obviously for this kind of class you

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.010 
obviously for this kind of class you
want<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.070> be<00:03:14.160> using<00:03:14.520> an<00:03:14.670> SMG<00:03:15.030> or<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> pistol<00:03:15.900> so

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
want to be using an SMG or a pistol so

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.840 
want to be using an SMG or a pistol so
you<00:03:16.080> can<00:03:16.260> be<00:03:16.380> super<00:03:16.650> fast<00:03:16.830> on<00:03:17.040> your<00:03:17.130> feet<00:03:17.190> you

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
you can be super fast on your feet you

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.699 
you can be super fast on your feet you
want<00:03:18.060> lightweight<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:19.140> could<00:03:19.410> also<00:03:19.560> use

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
want lightweight and you could also use

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.170 
want lightweight and you could also use
extreme<00:03:20.100> conditioning<00:03:20.580> but<00:03:20.730> i<00:03:20.790> would<00:03:21.000> say

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
extreme conditioning but i would say

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.970 
extreme conditioning but i would say
that<00:03:21.209> lightweight<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.959> more<00:03:22.230> important<00:03:22.830> than

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
that lightweight is more important than

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.620 
that lightweight is more important than
extreme<00:03:23.370> conditioning<00:03:23.850> just<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.209> my<00:03:24.330> opinion

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
extreme conditioning just in my opinion

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.030 
extreme conditioning just in my opinion
just<00:03:24.840> because<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.080> helps<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.440> get<00:03:25.620> out<00:03:25.860> of

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
just because it helps you get out of

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.770 
just because it helps you get out of
sticky<00:03:26.310> situations<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.420> helps<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.690> move

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
sticky situations and it helps you move

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.449 
sticky situations and it helps you move
around<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.110> map<00:03:28.200> faster<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.070> i<00:03:29.100> would<00:03:29.340> say

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
around the map faster so i would say

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.370 
around the map faster so i would say
lightweight<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.030> definitely<00:03:30.750> definitely<00:03:30.930> for

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
lightweight is definitely definitely for

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.900 
lightweight is definitely definitely for
sure<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.769> want<00:03:31.980> light<00:03:32.130> wait<00:03:32.160> if<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.820> want

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
sure you want light wait if you want

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.250 
sure you want light wait if you want
extreme<00:03:33.239> conditioning<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.810> then<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.140> will

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
extreme conditioning to then it will

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.620 
extreme conditioning to then it will
make<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.560> monster<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.940> other<00:03:36.150> way<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.600> I

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
make you a monster the other way that I

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.910 
make you a monster the other way that I
would<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.080> play<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.350> game<00:03:37.500> type<00:03:37.739> and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
would like to play this game type and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.190 
would like to play this game type and
this<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.130> how<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.489> personally<00:03:39.120> prefer<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.989> play

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
this is how I personally prefer to play

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.620 
this is how I personally prefer to play
these<00:03:40.380> types<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.800> games<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.269> a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
these types of games that is of a

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.050 
these types of games that is of a
clearer<00:03:43.200> slice<00:03:43.830> basically<00:03:44.519> just<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.820> slayer

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
clearer slice basically just a slayer

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.870 
clearer slice basically just a slayer
pretty<00:03:45.510> much<00:03:45.750> it's<00:03:46.290> basically<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.950> slayer<00:03:47.430> so

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
pretty much it's basically a slayer so

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.520 
pretty much it's basically a slayer so
instead<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.330> me<00:03:48.690> running<00:03:48.900> straight<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.440> the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
instead of me running straight to the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.810 
instead of me running straight to the
flag<00:03:49.739> at<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:49.980> beginning<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.489> game<00:03:50.610> to

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
flag at the beginning of the game to

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.880 
flag at the beginning of the game to
pick<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.150> up<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.450> capture<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.470> basically

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
pick it up and capture it I basically

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.250 
pick it up and capture it I basically
try<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.459> flank<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.060> enemy<00:03:54.090> who's<00:03:54.870> trying<00:03:55.200> to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
try and flank the enemy who's trying to

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.930 
try and flank the enemy who's trying to
capture<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.650> flag<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.130> flag<00:03:56.340> spawns<00:03:56.700> in

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
capture the flag so the flag spawns in

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.699 
capture the flag so the flag spawns in
the<00:03:57.060> middle<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:57.540> will<00:03:57.720> run<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.200> left<00:03:58.440> or<00:03:58.680> to

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
the middle I will run to the left or to

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.560 
the middle I will run to the left or to
the<00:03:58.830> right<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.370> try<00:03:59.640> and<00:03:59.760> kill<00:04:00.000> enemies<00:04:00.450> that

are trying to capture the flag that's my
job<00:04:02.580> now<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.450> doesn't<00:04:03.780> mean<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.140> never

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
job now it doesn't mean that you never

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.930 
job now it doesn't mean that you never
pick<00:04:04.650> up<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.890> flag<00:04:05.100> as<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.519> will<00:04:05.610> see<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:05.760> this

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
pick up the flag as you will see in this

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.520 
pick up the flag as you will see in this
game<00:04:06.180> as<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.510> pick<00:04:06.690> up<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.900> flag<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.320> think

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
game as you pick up the flag I think

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.740 
game as you pick up the flag I think
twice<00:04:07.799> or<00:04:08.340> something<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.850> but<00:04:09.570> it's

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
twice or something like that but it's

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.479 
twice or something like that but it's
not<00:04:09.900> your<00:04:10.110> primary<00:04:10.380> concern<00:04:10.709> it's<00:04:11.160> not<00:04:11.340> your

not your primary concern it's not your
primary<00:04:11.820> objective<00:04:12.510> it's<00:04:12.660> not<00:04:12.840> even<00:04:13.140> really

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
primary objective it's not even really

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.199 
primary objective it's not even really
your<00:04:13.470> job<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:14.070> states<00:04:14.459> like<00:04:14.640> your<00:04:14.850> part-time

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
your job it states like your part-time

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.849 
your job it states like your part-time
job<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.810> capture<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.260> flag<00:04:16.410> what's<00:04:16.709> your

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
job to capture the flag what's your
