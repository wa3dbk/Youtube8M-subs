strawberries<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.529> choose<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.340> use<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> organic

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
strawberries I choose to use the organic

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.550 
strawberries I choose to use the organic
ones<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.300> because<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.840> above<00:00:31.050> ground<00:00:31.289> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
ones just because it's above ground and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.680 
ones just because it's above ground and
sometimes<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.009> touches<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> dirt<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.210> feel

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
sometimes it touches the dirt and I feel

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.030 
sometimes it touches the dirt and I feel
like<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.050> little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.350> cleaner<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.890> baby

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
like it's a little bit cleaner for baby
