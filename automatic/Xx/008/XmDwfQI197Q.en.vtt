it's<00:00:15.630> built<00:00:15.900> into<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.379> controller<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.949> know

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
it's built into the controller I know

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.250 
it's built into the controller I know
it's<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> lot<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.580> electrical<00:00:18.510> tape<00:00:18.690> don't

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it's a lot of electrical tape don't

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.590 
it's a lot of electrical tape don't
question<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:20.010> part<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> design<00:00:20.640> I'm

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
question it it's part of the design I'm

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
xbox straight into the xbox I've taken

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.889 
xbox straight into the xbox I've taken
it<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.430> I've<00:00:35.579> cut<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.969> into<00:00:36.090> stripped<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it here I've cut it into stripped it

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.540 
it here I've cut it into stripped it
down<00:00:36.930> put<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.530> green<00:00:37.710> wires<00:00:38.010> inside

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
down put the green wires inside

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.540 
down put the green wires inside
connected<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.930> rear<00:00:40.550> reconnected

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
connected to this and rear reconnected

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.930 
connected to this and rear reconnected
will<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.790> rested<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> wires<00:00:42.620> okay<00:00:43.640> then<00:00:44.640> it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
will be rested the wires okay then it

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.670 
will be rested the wires okay then it
comes<00:00:45.210> round<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.750> connects<00:00:46.379> into<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
comes round here connects into a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.400 
comes round here connects into a
wireless<00:00:46.890> adapter<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
wireless adapter and then that's it that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.680 
wireless adapter and then that's it that
is<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.730> okay<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.270> let's<00:00:51.570> get

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
is actually all it is okay so let's get

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.209 
is actually all it is okay so let's get
us<00:00:51.780> some<00:00:51.809> gameplay<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> dirty<00:00:52.920> screen

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
us some gameplay up the dirty screen

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.959 
us some gameplay up the dirty screen
refresh<00:00:53.550> rate<00:00:54.440> if<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> can't<00:00:56.730> see

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
refresh rate if you know you can't see

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
refresh rate if you know you can't see
it<00:00:57.030> there's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.870> screen<00:00:58.289> refresh<00:00:58.620> rate<00:00:58.859> but

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it there's a screen refresh rate but

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.599 
it there's a screen refresh rate but
we'll<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.489> some<00:00:59.640> quickly<00:01:00.050> might<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
we'll get some quickly might as well I

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.650 
we'll get some quickly might as well I
mean<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.629> previous

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
mean you can see this in a previous

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.179 
mean you can see this in a previous
video<00:01:04.379> basically<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.960> xbox<00:01:06.960> 360<00:01:07.500> lag<00:01:07.799> switch

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
video basically the xbox 360 lag switch

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.090 
video basically the xbox 360 lag switch
because<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.060> done<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> dazzle<00:01:10.200> even

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
because that's done with the dazzle even

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.710 
because that's done with the dazzle even
though<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> Dorothy's<00:01:11.939> refresh<00:01:12.450> rate

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
though this is Dorothy's refresh rate

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.920 
though this is Dorothy's refresh rate
much<00:01:13.189> well<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.090> show<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.540> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
much well this is just to show that it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.600 
much well this is just to show that it
works<00:01:16.100> really<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:19.979> I'll<00:01:20.189> show<00:01:20.220> them

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
works really and then I'll show them

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.270 
works really and then I'll show them
this<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:21.420> when<00:01:21.750> you're<00:01:22.380> actually<00:01:22.619> lagging

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this then when you're actually lagging

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.899 
this then when you're actually lagging
you<00:01:23.520> don't<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:25.100> LED<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.759> you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you don't get a LED on that so like you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
you don't get a LED on that so like you
push<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.659> goes<00:01:27.869> away<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.100> let<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
push it it goes away just to let you

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.100 
push it it goes away just to let you
know<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:30.509> you're<00:01:30.630> lagging<00:01:30.810> basically<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
know that you're lagging basically and I

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
know that you're lagging basically and I
don't<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:35.040> guy<00:01:35.280> isn't<00:01:35.430> even

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
go crazy because the screen refresh rate

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.039 
go crazy because the screen refresh rate
looked<00:01:43.409> really<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.000> bit<00:01:45.149> retarded<00:01:45.299> all

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
looked really it's a bit retarded all

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.090 
looked really it's a bit retarded all
