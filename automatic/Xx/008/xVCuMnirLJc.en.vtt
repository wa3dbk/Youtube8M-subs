 according to the interests of the defenders of zauiya 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.000
 have ended up with thousands of hectares of forests eliminating federal 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.130
 that only occur in this part of the planet this from damage plants 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.160
 we are dedicated to spread care and respect for our environment 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.360
 We understood that our human bins have helped to try it 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.080
 In a short time we became United States response 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.700
 in my first we protect the juvenile males that descended to the city 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.820
 for the release of their ecosystems and the lack of food trunk and fireman 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.490
 If you were exposed on May 20, 2011, this absence arrived. 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.570
 Found by a young couple in an area near the city of Muskiz 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.250
 possibly fleeing the fire with their mother they separated when entering 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.250
 contact with the human being or with unknown noises 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:23.189
 Then on June 3, two bear cubs arrived, they say that affectionately before 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.219
 to give them a formal name we call the fat one and the skinny one they are two months older than 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.319
 they walk 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.699
 now they live together and play during the day and have not had any problems 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:38.529
 piquÃ© integration the story of this pair of assassins is emotional without its 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:42.199
 mother came to them near the camp of billiards who fought 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:47.199
 the fire in chestnuts and then the brigadistas died when approaching they saw in the 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:52.289
 body of the mother multiple burns caused by the cee fire upon reaching the 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:57.319
 The bear cubs were reviewed by the veterinarian to make sure 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.930
 that they were free of disease dt 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.049
 after separating 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.810
 we are and we lodge in a quarantine area for several days for the 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:10.469
 welfare of them and the rest of the bears that already had mezquitic as they are 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.510
 small are already in the lactation stage 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.040
 so we gave him a diet based on milk the ration consists of a mixture 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.379
 of milk for puppy road and milk for human baby 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:27.369
 because the percentage of fat in the milk of oza is 33% and the network of 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:32.449
 22 percent oaks are also added colostrum-based medicines 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:37.859
 and multivitamins have gradually been offered some chopped fruit and 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.670
 I think it's for puppy dog 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.620
 since they are fast-growing animals and their needs 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.650
 nutritional changes quickly 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 mccain I think breakfasts at 9 in the morning in Quito and apples that are left 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.859
 so that they play as in complexity 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.459
 yes at six o'clock in the afternoon scenes milk croquettes of apple and watermelon picassent 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.109
 as part of the protocol to follow in the American black bear breeding care 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.029
 We carry out environmental and environmental enrichment activities 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:11.249
 nutrition, for example, are offered activities similar to those already 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:15.599
