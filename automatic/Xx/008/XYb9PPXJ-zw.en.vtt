00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
to pass amo tea and inspection so that's

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
to pass amo tea and inspection so that's
a<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> fail<00:01:27.979> we've<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> exhaust

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
a bit of a fail we've got the exhaust

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.080 
a bit of a fail we've got the exhaust
something<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.560> little<00:01:31.850> support<00:01:32.850> just

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
something here now little support just

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.410 
something here now little support just
there<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:34.259> that's<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.950> mounted<00:01:35.729> solid

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
there all that's gonna be mounted solid

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.039 
there all that's gonna be mounted solid
to<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> engine<00:01:37.220> there's<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> bend<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.689> flexi

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
to the engine there's a bend and a flexi

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.190 
to the engine there's a bend and a flexi
going<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.490> we'll<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.759> aiming<00:01:42.200> hope

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
going here and then we'll be aiming hope

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.100 
going here and then we'll be aiming hope
through<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.560> gap<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> hopefully

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
through that gap just there so hopefully

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.700 
through that gap just there so hopefully
we<00:01:49.110> should<00:01:49.939> we<00:01:50.939> should<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.710> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
we should we should be there right the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.190 
we should we should be there right the
exhaust

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200
