00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
but it's a concern i remember when the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.609 
but it's a concern i remember when the
east<00:00:30.599> sign<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.990> came<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> next<00:00:31.470> day

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
east sign that came in here the next day

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.709 
east sign that came in here the next day
and<00:00:31.890> i<00:00:32.579> was<00:00:32.730> assuming<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.420> there<00:00:33.510> was<00:00:33.600> some

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and i was assuming that there was some

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.389 
and i was assuming that there was some
sort<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.079> team<00:00:34.260> option<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> second<00:00:35.309> year

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
sort of team option on the second year

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.620 
sort of team option on the second year
and<00:00:35.550> there's<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:36.000> there's<00:00:36.180> no<00:00:36.329> mention<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and there's just there's no mention of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.520 
and there's just there's no mention of
it<00:00:36.690> i<00:00:36.780> thought<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.260> would<00:00:37.350> have

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it i thought that they would have

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.600 
it i thought that they would have
something<00:00:37.860> built<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> protect<00:00:38.460> themselves

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
something built in to protect themselves

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.639 
something built in to protect themselves
that<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:39.570> he<00:00:39.660> blows<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.320> found<00:00:40.559> their

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
that if he blows up and they found their

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.959 
that if he blows up and they found their
guy<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.040> he<00:00:41.100> can't<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.460> go<00:00:41.550> running<00:00:41.700> off

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
guy that he can't just go running off

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.600 
guy that he can't just go running off

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
okay I found some stability maybe not in

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.810 
okay I found some stability maybe not in
terms<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.649> coaching<00:01:47.040> staff<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.490> terms<00:01:47.640> of

supporting<00:01:49.590> cast<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.040> I've<00:01:50.700> got<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> starting

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
supporting cast and I've got a starting

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.940 
supporting cast and I've got a starting
job<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.840> why<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.200> want<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.409> go<00:01:52.500> start<00:01:52.710> over

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950

job so why do I want to go start over
again<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.939> would<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
again and then I would think if that

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.850 
again and then I would think if that
would<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.840> haven't<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.409> Reese<00:01:55.560> item

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
would be that you haven't in Reese item

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.959 
would be that you haven't in Reese item
and<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.130> throw<00:01:56.189> something<00:01:56.460> at<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.790> in

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and you can throw something at them in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.030 
and you can throw something at them in
the<00:01:57.420> L<00:01:57.509> week<00:01:57.659> 12<00:01:57.899> week<00:01:58.020> 13<00:01:58.380> never<00:01:58.740> let<00:01:58.890> them<00:01:58.979> hit
