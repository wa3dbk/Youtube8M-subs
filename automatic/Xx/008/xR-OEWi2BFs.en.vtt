that<00:01:28.710> won't<00:01:28.950> work<00:01:29.450> but<00:01:30.450> rock<00:01:30.750> takes<00:01:31.320> out

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500

puzzle so there's plenty of
replayability<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.560> again

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
replayability now we can do this again

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.190 
replayability now we can do this again
and<00:01:44.450> there's<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.810> different

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and there's going to be a different

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.300 
and there's going to be a different
solution<00:01:48.860> in<00:01:50.299> this<00:01:51.299> case<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.380> paper<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
solution in this case the paper want and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.179 
solution in this case the paper want and
we<00:01:53.369> found<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.880> new<00:01:54.180> solution<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.409> we've<00:01:55.619> had<00:01:55.649> two

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
we found a new solution so we've had two

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.010 
we found a new solution so we've had two
different<00:01:56.369> solutions<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.450> short<00:01:57.719> period<00:01:57.780> of

have<00:02:00.810> more<00:02:00.840> you'll<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.860> find<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:02.850> we

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
have more you'll have to find out now we

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
have more you'll have to find out now we
can<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.659> out<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> next<00:02:04.409> level<00:02:04.860> by<00:02:05.009> tapping

there<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.909> again<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> levels<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.409> increase

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
there and again the levels get increase

you're<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.629> see<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.590> puzzle

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
you're going to see that the puzzle

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.160 
you're going to see that the puzzle
boards<00:03:03.459> are<00:03:03.639> created<00:03:04.389> differently<00:03:04.930> they're

boards are created differently they're

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.069 
boards are created differently they're
not<00:03:05.319> auto<00:03:06.040> created<00:03:06.940> they're<00:03:07.420> actually<00:03:07.840> been

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
not auto created they're actually been

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.099 
not auto created they're actually been
hand-picked<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.370> they're<00:03:09.970> not<00:03:10.209> as<00:03:10.480> easy<00:03:10.840> as

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
hand-picked so they're not as easy as

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.949 
hand-picked so they're not as easy as
they<00:03:11.290> appear<00:03:11.829> I<00:03:11.980> played<00:03:12.519> some<00:03:12.849> in<00:03:13.090> all<00:03:13.359> of<00:03:13.660> the
