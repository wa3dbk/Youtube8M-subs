00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
it's stronger than Ted and like when you

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.160 
it's stronger than Ted and like when you
tap<00:03:57.030> sometimes<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.690> have<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:57.990> things

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.810 
also thought this would be a time
working<00:04:05.510> do<00:04:06.510> duets<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.520> experiment<00:04:08.520> super

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
much about discovering passion as it is

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.410 
much about discovering passion as it is
learning<00:04:16.380> dance<00:04:16.620> steps<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.940> lesson<00:04:18.330> is
