if<00:02:13.430> all<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.610> us<00:02:13.760> look<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.150> same<00:02:14.360> there

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
if all of us look the same there

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.050 
if all of us look the same there
wouldn't<00:02:15.170> really<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.410> any<00:02:15.620> competition

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
wouldn't really be any competition

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.880 
wouldn't really be any competition
because<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.180> all<00:02:17.269> look<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.480> same<00:02:17.890> there

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
because we all look the same there

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.350 
because we all look the same there
wouldn't<00:02:19.099> really<00:02:19.160> be<00:02:19.370> any<00:02:19.730> beauty<00:02:20.060> or

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
wouldn't really be any beauty or

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.080 
wouldn't really be any beauty or
differences<00:02:20.989> or<00:02:21.290> uniqueness<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.550> anyone

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
differences or uniqueness to anyone

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.729 
differences or uniqueness to anyone
because<00:02:23.569> we<00:02:23.840> would<00:02:23.959> all<00:02:24.050> have<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.260> same<00:02:24.410> shape

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
because we would all have the same shape

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.809 
because we would all have the same shape
we<00:02:25.370> don't<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.760> mean<00:02:25.819> we<00:02:26.150> essentially<00:02:26.629> be<00:02:27.819> twins

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
we don't I mean we essentially be twins

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.589 
we don't I mean we essentially be twins
of<00:02:29.030> each<00:02:29.120> other<00:02:29.300> right<00:02:29.510> many<00:02:30.019> many<00:02:30.290> twins<00:02:31.599> we

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
of each other right many many twins we

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.119 
of each other right many many twins we
just<00:02:32.840> be<00:02:32.959> clones<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.500> drones<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.950> mean

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
just be clones and drones I mean

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.559 
just be clones and drones I mean
literally<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:37.549> first<00:02:37.730> logical<00:02:38.239> piece<00:02:38.420> of

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
literally so the first logical piece of

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.690 
literally so the first logical piece of
my<00:02:38.629> mind<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.989> that<00:02:39.170> we<00:02:39.830> all<00:02:39.950> can't<00:02:40.250> be<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.549> same

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
my mind is that we all can't be the same

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.180 
my mind is that we all can't be the same
and<00:02:40.970> it's<00:02:41.599> okay<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.739> we're<00:02:42.890> different

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
and it's okay that we're different

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.009 
and it's okay that we're different
because<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.970> makes<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> world<00:02:44.390> beautiful<00:02:44.660> it

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
because it makes the world beautiful it

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.420 
because it makes the world beautiful it
makes<00:02:45.290> things<00:02:45.560> fun<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:46.040> makes<00:02:46.220> things

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
makes things fun it makes things

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.089 
makes things fun it makes things

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
frustrating for me because I know how it

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.589 
frustrating for me because I know how it
feels<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.470> be<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.459> focused<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:05.060> being<00:03:05.269> skinny

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
feels to be so focused on being skinny

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.119 
feels to be so focused on being skinny
and<00:03:05.810> being<00:03:05.959> perfect<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:06.470> being<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:06.829> you

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
and being perfect and being this you

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.059 
and being perfect and being this you
know<00:03:07.250> ideal<00:03:08.379> but<00:03:09.379> really<00:03:09.849> we<00:03:10.849> need<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.090> put<00:03:11.299> our

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
know ideal but really we need to put our

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.220 
know ideal but really we need to put our
reality<00:03:13.069> brains<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:13.910> check<00:03:14.180> we<00:03:14.930> can't<00:03:15.140> all<00:03:15.200> be

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
reality brains in check we can't all be

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.309 
reality brains in check we can't all be
the<00:03:15.410> same<00:03:15.440> okay<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:17.450> part<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.840> being<00:03:18.049> beautiful

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.770 
the same okay so part of being beautiful
i<00:03:19.660> believe<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:20.930> really<00:03:21.799> embracing<00:03:22.310> yourself

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780

so<00:03:23.780> in<00:03:24.139> order<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.910> counteract<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.569> crazy

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
so in order to counteract the crazy

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.140 
so in order to counteract the crazy
ideal<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:28.069> we<00:03:28.100> all<00:03:28.310> have<00:03:28.340> in<00:03:29.049> society<00:03:31.150> we
