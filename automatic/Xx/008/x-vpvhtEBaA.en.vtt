00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.440 
say it looks pretty good all right it's
really<00:06:00.650> coming<00:06:00.860> together<00:06:01.040> now<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.700> got<00:06:02.060> all<00:06:02.240> the

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
really coming together now I got all the

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.210 
really coming together now I got all the
clothes<00:06:02.690> taken<00:06:02.930> care<00:06:03.170> of<00:06:03.200> and<00:06:03.380> yeah<00:06:03.680> maybe

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
clothes taken care of and yeah maybe

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.950 
clothes taken care of and yeah maybe
this<00:06:04.460> sides<00:06:05.090> a<00:06:05.240> little<00:06:05.270> bit<00:06:05.540> more<00:06:05.690> cream<00:06:05.930> than

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.600 
this sides a little bit more cream than
that<00:06:06.230> side<00:06:06.440> but<00:06:06.920> I<00:06:06.950> still<00:06:07.160> think<00:06:07.370> it<00:06:07.460> looks

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
that side but I still think it looks

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
and all the random mitts matched odds

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.440 
and all the random mitts matched odds
and<00:06:13.010> ends<00:06:13.130> that<00:06:13.310> are<00:06:13.430> going<00:06:13.670> on<00:06:13.850> in<00:06:13.880> here<00:06:14.180> so

dark because if you do the dark of high

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.409 
dark because if you do the dark of high
it'll<00:06:28.490> just<00:06:28.669> feel<00:06:28.820> like<00:06:28.970> it's<00:06:29.150> pushing

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
it'll just feel like it's pushing

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.150 
it'll just feel like it's pushing
everything<00:06:29.750> down<00:06:30.080> and<00:06:30.110> too<00:06:30.320> heavy<00:06:30.500> so<00:06:31.100> I'm

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
everything down and too heavy so I'm

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.860 
everything down and too heavy so I'm
going<00:06:31.370> light<00:06:31.610> to<00:06:31.760> dark<00:06:32.030> and<00:06:32.210> i'm<00:06:32.480> going<00:06:32.690> to<00:06:32.750> do

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
going light to dark and i'm going to do

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
things like that so we'll see how it

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:46.690 
things like that so we'll see how it
works<00:06:40.100> out<00:06:40.430> to<00:06:45.040> organize<00:06:46.040> all<00:06:46.190> those<00:06:46.310> scarves

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
works out to organize all those scarves

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.280 
works out to organize all those scarves
that<00:06:46.760> i<00:06:46.850> had<00:06:47.000> just<00:06:47.150> bundled<00:06:47.690> and<00:06:47.780> thrown<00:06:48.140> out

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
that i had just bundled and thrown out

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.690 
that i had just bundled and thrown out
there<00:06:48.410> I<00:06:48.560> got<00:06:48.740> these<00:06:48.830> clear<00:06:49.160> bins<00:06:49.400> which<00:06:49.580> are

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
there I got these clear bins which are

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.280 
there I got these clear bins which are
awesome<00:06:49.880> because<00:06:50.300> you<00:06:50.450> can<00:06:50.540> see<00:06:50.900> them<00:06:51.020> through

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
awesome because you can see them through

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.440 
awesome because you can see them through
and<00:06:51.650> then<00:06:52.310> I<00:06:52.550> was<00:06:52.760> able<00:06:52.880> to<00:06:53.000> fold<00:06:53.240> them<00:06:53.390> up

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
and then I was able to fold them up
