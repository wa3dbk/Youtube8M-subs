is<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.300> north<00:00:12.509> american<00:00:12.990> version<00:00:13.170> not<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
is the north american version not the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.919 
is the north american version not the
international<00:00:14.610> version<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.450> uses<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
international version so it uses the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.140 
international version so it uses the
snapdragon<00:00:16.800> processor<00:00:17.369> as<00:00:17.550> opposed<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
snapdragon processor as opposed to the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660 
snapdragon processor as opposed to the
nvidia<00:00:18.869> tegra<00:00:19.140> 3<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.189> was<00:00:20.310> actually<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
nvidia tegra 3 so it was actually a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.939 
nvidia tegra 3 so it was actually a
little<00:00:20.699> more<00:00:20.970> challenging<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:22.199> find<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.740> rum

been a pretty good experience so I just
like<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> take<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> bit<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> time<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.810> show<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
like to take a bit of time to show a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.170 
like to take a bit of time to show a
couple<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> features<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.580> found<00:01:08.939> in

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
couple of the features that I found in

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.730 
couple of the features that I found in
signage<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.049> mod<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.470> found

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
signage and mod that I found

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.280 
signage and mod that I found
particularly<00:01:11.130> useful<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.630> first<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
particularly useful and the first one is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.429 
particularly useful and the first one is
this<00:01:13.950> concept<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.549> profiles<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> go

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
this concept of profiles so if you go

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.700 
this concept of profiles so if you go
into<00:01:16.619> settings<00:01:18.170> there's<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> profile

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
into settings there's the profile

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
into settings there's the profile
section<00:01:20.040> which<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> ends<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.540> being

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
section which and it ends up being

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.320 
section which and it ends up being
fairly<00:01:22.530> reminiscent<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> used<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.150> use

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
fairly reminiscent to what I used to use

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.690 
fairly reminiscent to what I used to use
for<00:01:24.540> many<00:01:24.720> years<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.080> blackberry<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.310> I've<00:01:26.460> set

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
for many years on blackberry so I've set

for many years on blackberry so I've set

there's actually a distinct hidden
button<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.319> right<00:04:00.440> of<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.150> task<00:04:02.150> switcher

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.180 
button which will bring up the the menu
very<00:04:06.349> handy<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:08.590> think<00:04:09.590> one<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.010> the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
very handy and I think one of the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.640 
very handy and I think one of the
reasons<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.700> I<00:04:10.819> wanted<00:04:11.319> signage<00:04:12.319> in<00:04:12.440> laud

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
reasons that I wanted signage in laud

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.860 
reasons that I wanted signage in laud
the<00:04:12.680> most<00:04:13.069> is<00:04:13.370> because<00:04:13.790> for<00:04:14.299> some<00:04:14.480> reason<00:04:14.510> it

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
the most is because for some reason it

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.500 
the most is because for some reason it
HTC<00:04:15.590> they<00:04:16.160> turned<00:04:16.459> off<00:04:16.609> one<00:04:16.849> of<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.090> coolest

HTC they turned off one of the coolest
