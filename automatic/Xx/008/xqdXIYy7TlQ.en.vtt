extension to to unbolt it you come

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.519 
extension to to unbolt it you come
across<00:00:26.519> one<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.849> these<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.349> somebody<00:00:28.349> either

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
across one of these it somebody either

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.589 
across one of these it somebody either
went<00:00:28.859> crazy<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.609> when<00:00:29.939> they<00:00:30.060> tightened<00:00:30.449> it

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
went crazy with when they tightened it

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.370 
went crazy with when they tightened it
or<00:00:30.980> it's<00:00:31.980> been<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.340> there<00:00:32.489> quite<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> while<00:00:33.380> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
or it's been on there quite a while and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.780 
or it's been on there quite a while and
rather<00:00:35.100> than<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:37.370> first<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.430> all<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.670> want

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
rather than just first of all you want

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.310 
rather than just first of all you want
to<00:00:38.820> find<00:00:39.059> an<00:00:39.239> extension<00:00:39.600> something<00:00:40.170> with<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to find an extension something with a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
to find an extension something with a
nice<00:00:40.530> square<00:00:41.010> end<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.910> will<00:00:42.030> fit<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.329> there

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
nice square end that will fit in there

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.020 
nice square end that will fit in there
and<00:00:42.690> nice<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> snug<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.460> you'll<00:00:44.610> notice<00:00:44.879> if

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and nice and snug and you'll notice if

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.010 
and nice and snug and you'll notice if
you<00:00:45.149> start<00:00:45.600> torquing<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.910> uh<00:00:48.020> you'll

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you start torquing on it that uh you'll

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.569 
you start torquing on it that uh you'll
probably<00:00:49.230> strip<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> thing<00:00:50.190> off<00:00:50.370> you'll

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
probably strip the thing off you'll

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.369 
probably strip the thing off you'll
probably<00:00:50.760> round<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.329> off<00:00:51.570> or<00:00:51.780> crack<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
probably round this off or crack it and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.590 
probably round this off or crack it and
if<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.949> take<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> drift<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.879> start<00:00:54.239> hitting<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
if you take a drift and start hitting on

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.170 
if you take a drift and start hitting on
the<00:00:54.949> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.280> fins<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.760> you'll<00:00:56.969> probably

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the on the fins here you'll probably

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.939 
the on the fins here you'll probably
break<00:00:57.510> those<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:59.699> best<00:00:59.879> thing<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> do

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
break those two so the best thing to do

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.640 
break those two so the best thing to do
why<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> turning<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:03.439> tap<00:01:04.439> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
why are you turning it just tap it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.450 
why are you turning it just tap it
lately<00:01:05.420> or<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.890> gotta<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.189> steady

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
lately or you got you gotta have steady

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.080 
lately or you got you gotta have steady
force<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.119> ratchet<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:09.990> just

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
force on your ratchet and then just

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
force on your ratchet and then just
likely<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.540> keep<00:01:12.750> tapping<00:01:12.960> away<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
likely just keep tapping away at the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.249 
likely just keep tapping away at the
thing<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.299> she'll<00:01:15.299> eventually<00:01:15.450> she'll<00:01:16.080> come

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
thing and she'll eventually she'll come

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.140 
thing and she'll eventually she'll come
loose<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.860> won't<00:01:17.040> break<00:01:17.280> anything<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
loose and you won't break anything you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.760 
loose and you won't break anything you
won't<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.509> buy<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> new<00:01:18.869> cover<00:01:19.140> although<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
won't have to buy a new cover although a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.230 
won't have to buy a new cover although a
lot<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> these<00:01:20.159> filters<00:01:20.520> now<00:01:20.909> they<00:01:21.060> come

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
lot of these filters now they come

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.810 
lot of these filters now they come
actually<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> new<00:01:22.350> cover<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.640> still

want<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> try<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.570> thing<00:01:24.630> off<00:01:24.960> in

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
want to try and get this thing off in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:34.270 
want to try and get this thing off in
one<00:01:25.290> piece<00:01:25.320> we'll<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:32.900> camera<00:01:33.900> here

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
one piece we'll get this camera here

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.149 
one piece we'll get this camera here
knock<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.490> down<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:39.350> there<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.619> she<00:01:40.890> comes

actually has stretched out it here on

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.399 
actually has stretched out it here on
this<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.189> had<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.060> off<00:01:51.299> before<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.020> I'm

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
this thing I had this off before but I'm

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.039 
this thing I had this off before but I'm
just<00:01:52.560> doing<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.100> demonstrate<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.990> uh

if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.740> come<00:01:55.920> across<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.549> these

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
if you do come across one of these

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.209 
if you do come across one of these
plastic<00:01:57.840> covers<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.920> said<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
plastic covers and like I said the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.280 
plastic covers and like I said the
import<00:01:59.549> carves<00:01:59.880> use<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.270> now<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.600> oil

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
import carves use them now on oil

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.179 
import carves use them now on oil
filters<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:03.259> diesel<00:02:04.259> trucks<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.890> using

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
filters and this diesel trucks are using

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.010 
filters and this diesel trucks are using
them<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.579> seven<00:02:05.790> three<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.450> six<00:02:06.689> always

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
them the seven three and the six always

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.949 
them the seven three and the six always
use<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.500> similar<00:02:08.340> setup

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
use a similar setup

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.490 
use a similar setup
and<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.340> got<00:02:11.370> your<00:02:12.500> your

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and just like that you got your your
