like I'm doing right now you see them do

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.749 
like I'm doing right now you see them do
way<00:00:30.269> way<00:00:30.900> way<00:00:31.500> too<00:00:31.560> much<00:00:31.740> weight<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
way way way too much weight and the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.690 
way way way too much weight and the
exercise<00:00:33.270> really<00:00:33.719> turns<00:00:34.079> into<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:35.070> back

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
exercise really turns into a back

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.630 
exercise really turns into a back
extension<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.190> shoulders

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
extension and you get your shoulders

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.580 
extension and you get your shoulders
involved<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.809> looks<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.230> you're

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
involved and it just looks like you're

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.319 
involved and it just looks like you're
having<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.219> seizure<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.790> mean<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.180> guys<00:00:42.270> have

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
having a seizure I mean you guys have

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.750 
having a seizure I mean you guys have
probably<00:00:42.600> seen<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:42.989> where<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.129> person's<00:00:44.520> back

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
probably seen it where the person's back

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
probably seen it where the person's back
looks<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.660> sea<00:00:46.020> basically<00:00:46.710> because

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
looks like a sea basically because

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.279 
looks like a sea basically because
they're<00:00:47.129> using<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:48.149> angle<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.930> lift<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
they're using that angle to lift the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.080 
they're using that angle to lift the
weight<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.280> putting<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
weight and it's not really putting the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
weight and it's not really putting the
tension<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.110> biceps<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> guys

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
tension on the biceps and if you guys

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.619 
tension on the biceps and if you guys
have<00:00:53.489> been<00:00:53.520> watching<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> whole<00:00:54.149> time<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
have been watching the whole time what I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.400 
have been watching the whole time what I
try<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.350> keep<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.210> guess<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.930> bicep

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
try to do is keep my I guess my bicep

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770 
try to do is keep my I guess my bicep
kind<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> perpendicular<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.149> ground<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
kind of perpendicular to the ground and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.930 
kind of perpendicular to the ground and
I<00:01:00.870> don't<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.500> move<00:01:01.949> my<00:01:02.219> elbows<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I don't like to move my elbows up and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 
I don't like to move my elbows up and
make<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.090> easier<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.750> all<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.409> does<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
make it easier because all that does is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.149 
make it easier because all that does is
just<00:01:05.010> take<00:01:05.729> tension<00:01:06.119> off<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.560> bicep<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
just take tension off of the bicep and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.800 
just take tension off of the bicep and
here's<00:01:08.610> another<00:01:08.760> great<00:01:09.060> exercise<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.720> I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
here's another great exercise that I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.010 
here's another great exercise that I
really<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:12.030> seated

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
really like this one is just a seated

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780 
really like this one is just a seated
dumbbell<00:01:13.350> curl<00:01:13.890> what<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.700> on

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
dumbbell curl what you do is just get on

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
dumbbell curl what you do is just get on
a<00:01:14.820> bench<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.420> bring<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.960> shoulders<00:01:16.350> back

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
a bench and bring your shoulders back

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.830 
a bench and bring your shoulders back
and<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.630> this

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and all you really have to do with this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.830 
and all you really have to do with this
is<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.280> moving<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> weight<00:01:21.299> with

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
is think about moving the weight with

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.770 
is think about moving the weight with
your<00:01:22.560> bicep<00:01:23.130> instead<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.450> lot<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
your bicep instead I think a lot of the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
your bicep instead I think a lot of the
time<00:01:24.960> people<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.799> moving<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> weight

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
time people think of moving the weight

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.340 
time people think of moving the weight
with<00:01:26.939> their<00:01:27.119> hand<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
with their hand and just kind of

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.230 
with their hand and just kind of
bringing<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> weight<00:01:28.979> up<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.880> change

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
bringing the weight up but if you change

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.490 
bringing the weight up but if you change
the<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.350> you're

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the way that you think when you're

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.109 
the way that you think when you're
lifting<00:01:31.680> weights<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.640> makes<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.939> huge

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
lifting weights it makes a huge

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.429 
lifting weights it makes a huge
difference<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.810> might<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.110> sound<00:01:34.320> like

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
difference and it might not sound like

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.080 
difference and it might not sound like
it<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.890> next<00:01:35.130> time<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> gym<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
it but next time you're in the gym just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420 
it but next time you're in the gym just
give<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> try<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.439> you're<00:01:38.040> sitting<00:01:38.189> down

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
give this a try so you're sitting down

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.890 
give this a try so you're sitting down
on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> bench<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.090> bring<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.479> all<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.750> way

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
on the bench you bring it all the way

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
on the bench you bring it all the way
down<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.740> guys<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> bottom<00:01:41.790> of

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
down you guys can see at the bottom of

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.840 
down you guys can see at the bottom of
each<00:01:42.450> rep<00:01:42.780> my<00:01:43.409> tricep<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.159> looks<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.700> it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
each rep my tricep it looks like it

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.760 
each rep my tricep it looks like it
flexes<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.290> making

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
flexes and that's because I'm making

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.670 
flexes and that's because I'm making
sure<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.579> bicep<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.570> fully<00:01:48.899> extended<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
sure that my bicep is fully extended and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.520 
sure that my bicep is fully extended and
then<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> contracted<00:01:50.930> almost<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.470> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
then I contracted almost all the way to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.080 
then I contracted almost all the way to
the<00:01:52.710> top<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.040> don't<00:01:53.159> want<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> take<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.520> all

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the top you don't want to take it all

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.030 
the top you don't want to take it all
the<00:01:54.149> way<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.229> where<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.619> weight<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the way up to where the weight is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.590 
the way up to where the weight is
perpendicular<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> ground<00:01:57.180> because

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
perpendicular with the ground because

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
perpendicular with the ground because
then<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> really<00:01:58.560> take<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> tension<00:01:59.219> off<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
then you really take the tension off the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.340 
then you really take the tension off the
bicep<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.420> kind<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> defeat<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> whole

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
bicep and kind of defeat the whole

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.709 
bicep and kind of defeat the whole
purpose<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.490> yeah<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
purpose of it but yeah this is just a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.870 
purpose of it but yeah this is just a
couple<00:02:03.990> clips<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.530> my<00:02:04.710> workout<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.640> wanted

on the contraction every single rep and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.800 
on the contraction every single rep and
that<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.700> most<00:02:47.849> important<00:02:48.299> thing<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
that is the most important thing the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.140 
that is the most important thing the
weight<00:02:49.079> on<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.410> bar<00:02:49.620> yes<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.459> kind<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.760> matters

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
weight on the bar yes it kind of matters

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.630 
weight on the bar yes it kind of matters
in<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:52.170> long<00:02:52.560> term<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:52.980> making<00:02:53.280> sure<00:02:53.459> that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
in the long term and making sure that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.280 
in the long term and making sure that
you're<00:02:53.790> getting<00:02:53.879> stronger<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.170> know

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
you're getting stronger but you know

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
short term just focus on the contraction

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.569 
short term just focus on the contraction
because<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.709> key<00:02:58.920> but<00:02:59.250> anyway

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579
