00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.010 
so we have to mess about with this and
this<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.090> hard<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.420> thought<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.750> was<00:02:36.840> better

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
this is hard I thought that was better

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.020 
this is hard I thought that was better
to<00:02:37.410> me<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.860> line<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.250> needs<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.520> do<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.790> most

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
to me the line that needs to do is most

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.920 
to me the line that needs to do is most
is<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.330> base<00:02:39.480> line

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
is the base line

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.680 
is the base line
it's<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> continual<00:02:41.130> line<00:02:41.310> if<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.150> continual

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
it's the continual line if the continual

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.440 
it's the continual line if the continual
line<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.200> really<00:02:43.680> emphasize<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.700> text<00:02:45.270> dress

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
line can really emphasize the text dress

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.260 
line can really emphasize the text dress
and<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.950> sopranos<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.880> top<00:02:48.060> line

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
and then the sopranos on the top line

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.300 
and then the sopranos on the top line
the<00:02:48.300> most<00:02:48.570> evident<00:02:49.170> treats<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.890> little<00:02:50.100> bit

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
the most evident treats it a little bit

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.010 
the most evident treats it a little bit
delicately<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.120> make<00:02:51.270> sure<00:02:51.300> they<00:02:51.540> do<00:02:51.600> some<00:02:51.990> of

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
delicately but make sure they do some of

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.860 
delicately but make sure they do some of
it<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.410> think<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.430> effect<00:02:53.640> works<00:02:54.180> out<00:02:54.390> well<00:02:54.600> but

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
it I think the effect works out well but

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.050 
it I think the effect works out well but
I<00:02:54.930> think<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.440> has<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.710> thumb<00:02:56.040> ding-dong<00:02:56.850> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
I think it has the thumb ding-dong the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.880 
I think it has the thumb ding-dong the
word<00:02:57.210> came<00:02:57.570> my<00:02:58.560> man<00:02:58.860> came<00:02:59.370> or<00:02:59.850> my<00:03:00.570> man<00:03:00.900> came<00:03:01.410> all

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
word came my man came or my man came all

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.580 
word came my man came or my man came all
my<00:03:02.520> man<00:03:02.850> came<00:03:03.360> all<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.260> could<00:03:04.380> do<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.560> like

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
my man came all you could do it like

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.960 
my man came all you could do it like
Monty<00:03:04.950> Python<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> could<00:03:05.490> put<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.730> stress<00:03:05.940> on

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
Monty Python you could put the stress on

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.510 
Monty Python you could put the stress on
all<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.330> different<00:03:06.480> by<00:03:07.080> man<00:03:07.470> came<00:03:07.710> also<00:03:07.890> they

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
all the different by man came also they

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.150 
all the different by man came also they
said<00:03:09.090> but<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.690> think<00:03:09.960> we<00:03:10.050> have<00:03:10.200> we've<00:03:10.770> just<00:03:11.010> have

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
said but I think we have we've just have

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.460 
said but I think we have we've just have
to<00:03:11.280> think<00:03:11.580> about<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.090> because<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:13.140> a

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
to think about this because this is a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.100 
to think about this because this is a
tricky<00:03:14.000> section<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.270> applies<00:03:15.540> equally<00:03:16.050> to

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
tricky section and it applies equally to

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.890 
tricky section and it applies equally to
the<00:03:16.350> last<00:03:16.560> part<00:03:16.830> as<00:03:16.950> well<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.750> personally<00:03:18.750> have

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
the last part as well I personally have

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.990 
the last part as well I personally have
become<00:03:19.170> more<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.620> more<00:03:19.740> convinced<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
become more and more convinced that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.590 
become more and more convinced that
choral<00:03:21.810> singers<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.970> many<00:03:23.970> many<00:03:24.270> solo

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
choral singers and many many solo

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.010 
choral singers and many many solo
singers<00:03:24.990> do<00:03:25.290> not<00:03:25.590> use<00:03:25.890> rhetoric<00:03:26.280> enough

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
singers do not use rhetoric enough

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.240 
singers do not use rhetoric enough
result<00:03:28.020> is<00:03:28.170> they<00:03:28.410> comes<00:03:28.680> over<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.040> all<00:03:29.100> very

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
result is they comes over it's all very

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.040 
result is they comes over it's all very
beautiful<00:03:29.730> but<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:29.970> doesn't<00:03:30.240> really<00:03:30.570> convey

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
beautiful but it doesn't really convey

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.080 
beautiful but it doesn't really convey
anything<00:03:31.380> when<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.710> hear<00:03:31.920> really<00:03:32.490> fine<00:03:32.730> solo

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
anything when you hear really fine solo

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.020 
anything when you hear really fine solo
artist<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.260> back<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.530> his<00:03:34.620> head<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:35.850> art

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
artist in the back of his head the art

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.820 
artist in the back of his head the art
of<00:03:36.180> rhetoric<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.720> being<00:03:36.900> persuasive<00:03:37.350> with<00:03:37.740> the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
of rhetoric of being persuasive with the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.880 
of rhetoric of being persuasive with the
text<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.940> comes<00:03:39.720> over<00:03:40.050> clearly<00:03:40.410> they're<00:03:40.710> in<00:03:40.800> a

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
text is comes over clearly they're in a

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.650 
text is comes over clearly they're in a
different<00:03:41.040> league<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.910> my<00:03:42.090> own<00:03:42.240> personal

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
different league this is my own personal

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.070 
different league this is my own personal
view<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:44.040> think<00:03:44.250> choir<00:03:44.520> is<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.850> same<00:03:45.080> there

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
view and I think choir is the same there

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.260 
view and I think choir is the same there
are<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.320> many<00:03:46.470> excellent<00:03:47.220> choirs<00:03:47.670> these<00:03:48.000> days

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
are so many excellent choirs these days

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.420 
are so many excellent choirs these days
they<00:03:48.420> sing<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.750> all<00:03:48.840> beautifully<00:03:49.620> into<00:03:49.890> and

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
they sing it all beautifully into and

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.320 
they sing it all beautifully into and
yet<00:03:51.090> somehow<00:03:51.360> I'm<00:03:51.920> nothing<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.730> would<00:03:54.120> in

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
yet somehow I'm nothing so I would in

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.470 
yet somehow I'm nothing so I would in
this<00:03:54.480> be<00:03:54.780> quite<00:03:55.260> keen<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.310> seeing<00:03:56.610> quite<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.150> lot

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
this be quite keen on seeing quite a lot

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.810 
this be quite keen on seeing quite a lot
of<00:03:57.720> messing<00:03:58.380> about<00:03:58.470> with<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.310> really

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
of messing about with that and really

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.540 
of messing about with that and really
trying<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.090> bring<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:00.360> alive
