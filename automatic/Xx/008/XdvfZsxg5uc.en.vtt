you spent a lot of time putting it
together<00:02:04.510> so<00:02:05.520> make<00:02:06.520> sure<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:06.880> box<00:02:07.090> is

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
together so make sure this box is

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.229 
together so make sure this box is
unchecked<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:08.319> click<00:02:08.379> OK<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.310> then<00:02:09.939> try

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
unchecked and click OK and then try

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.199 
unchecked and click OK and then try
again<00:02:11.040> my<00:02:12.040> guess<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.489> that<00:02:12.670> would<00:02:12.849> clear<00:02:13.180> up

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
again my guess is that would clear up

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.420 
again my guess is that would clear up
your<00:02:13.329> issue<00:02:13.659> if

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430
