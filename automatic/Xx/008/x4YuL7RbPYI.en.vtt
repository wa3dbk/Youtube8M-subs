 dvd review and end of january is waiting in the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.900
 German cinemas raise the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.469
 story of a great man tries 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.429
 to portray the unfortunately recently 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.279
 has died and that is it now 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.279
 around mandela the long way to freedom 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.850
 i have wonderful kids one 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.230
 great woman i want her to be free 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.230
 are in your own country 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.040
 we are the people of this country but we 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.500
 do not own any rights 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.750
 there is only time left in it 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.750
 two alternatives are submission 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.320
 or can 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.000
 No worries we will find next 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.350
 then we hang out and then need 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.740
 They make a new husband of them at night 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.740
 become 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.950
 someone wants something from me 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.380
 The verdict is life-long 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.930
 We will never be a wife again or again 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:52.170
 smock you will leave her star 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.620
 what can one we are alone together 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.870
 strongly 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.310
 you think you know what was going on 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.310
 I would not be otherwise I would not be here 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.310
 people are angry we are all would 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.650
 there is a new campaign so it starts 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.650
 on 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.710
 the human learns to have 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.810
 he can learn to clear 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.760
 because love corresponds to the nature of 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.760
 human heart very much 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.020
 Mandela goes the long way to freedom 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.820
 100 and 39 minutes a moment he is 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.950
 firm yet unknown but determined 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.960
 it will be a maximum of fsk 12 years old 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.570
 and comes in Germany from the 30th 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.800
 january 2014 in german cinemas 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.050
 outside tells the story of 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.240
 nelson mandela from his youth all the way up 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.280
 for his political orientation 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.570
 concept of inequality between the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.640
 Instruction of black russell in 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.710
 South Africa until the moment he arrives 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.270
 begins to defend a political leader 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.980
 up to the pokemon says 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.090
 Nonviolence is over we have to 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.980
 to grab the weapons 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.750
 until he was imprisoned in the 1960s 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.400
 Will come out again after 27 years 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.560
 captivity among other things cops 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.390
 Iceland and just the first president 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.010
 his country will be black 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.480
 skin color or this last 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.280
 point you almost exclude and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.990
 try this all the way to the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.400
 There is also freedom to educate 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.840
 the subtitle the long way to the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.640
 freedom that is for political 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.870
 interested in interesting or 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.430
 who live with this from this 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.680
 man, we really deal with a strong one 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.070
 neatly tells the film at the synonymous 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.360
 say 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.460
 The typical stripes may look 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.140
 but many classes in school 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.880
 also say he is trying an insane 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.590
 long time span cover and that is 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.450
 a major drawback of the film has quite 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.070
 The emotional moments are great 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.930
 Portrait of this man is trying too 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.310
 his wife winnie wonderful too 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.600
 characterize that I think so too 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.310
 Nice to see that in the foreground 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.959
 cities with inside and to show this 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.489
 man has therefore a very important woman 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.350
 at his side she supports 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.880
 had helped but also one 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.280
 another conception of a kind of revolution 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.020
 and, above all, it does 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.060
 this man with his conviction only 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.100
 to show up to the last second 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.600
 as you have handed down him and that 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.190
 I think that's exciting but how 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.540
 said the biggest drawback with this film 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.769
 is always moments are one 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.419
 Okay, how are you? 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.919
 how does the whole then there 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.780
 little four or seven even 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.550
 ten-year jump that of course 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.020
 Clear when you are just under two and a half hours 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.180
 the story of a lifetime 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.350
 it only wants to be told in some 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.940
 moments as if you had much more 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.230
 turned and the studio meant here 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.669
 unfortunately we have to go down a bit 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.780
 cut because I have somehow 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.730
 feel that 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.960
 the movie just castrated too much 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.520
 has been at this point because 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.139
 otherwise I would be really good at it 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.210
 But it also has to be something 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.160
 bring along such interest to strip 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.690
 like and should have that should be 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.400
 absolutely look at some 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.290
 moments so grab when you understand 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.300
 what this basically is this deep 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.830
 believe in freedom and peace 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.440
 actually a very simple principle 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.240
 and how many sacrifices man has to bring 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.680
 to get there and that is very 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.440
 exciting for your self too 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.150
 eyes how many things we have in our in 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.400
 our country of freedoms and 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.080
 Fundamental rights enjoy everything else 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.760
 as a matter of course are also in the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.470
 today's world and that's why 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.150
 shake me mandela as real 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.800
 interesting film at the Sitzfleisch 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.540
 must bring because he is already well 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800
 a little tugs over this 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.419
 two and a half hours but still 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.330
 is incredibly interesting in his 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.430
 genre as a biographical drama very much 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.840
 strong 8 out of 10 possible points exactly 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.700
 These values give the strip as well 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.160
 So all in all I can do that 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.540
 like to look at that is really what 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.150
 one may also expect and that is me 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.950
 through with yours to mandela the long way 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.450
 to the freedom that like thumb because we 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.560
 This one did not plan that 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.360
 Otherwise, here are a few 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.550
