00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.210 
and in today's video I'm going to talk
about<00:00:02.850> your<00:00:03.060> DSLRs<00:00:03.689> auto<00:00:03.899> focus<00:00:04.380> modes<00:00:04.589> there

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
about your DSLRs auto focus modes there

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.740 
about your DSLRs auto focus modes there
are<00:00:05.339> three<00:00:05.549> auto<00:00:05.759> focus<00:00:06.150> modes<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.569> need

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
are three auto focus modes that you need

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.000 
are three auto focus modes that you need
to<00:00:06.839> be<00:00:06.960> aware<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.410> they<00:00:07.529> might<00:00:07.710> be<00:00:07.830> called

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
to be aware of and they might be called

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.040 
to be aware of and they might be called
different<00:00:08.340> things<00:00:08.519> depending<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.570> what<00:00:09.809> brand

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
different things depending on what brand

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.720 
different things depending on what brand
your<00:00:10.200> camera<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.500> but<00:00:10.889> they<00:00:10.950> all<00:00:11.070> basically<00:00:11.280> do

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
your camera is but they all basically do

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.940 
your camera is but they all basically do
the<00:00:11.759> same<00:00:11.910> thing<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:13.200> first<00:00:13.410> one<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.679> your

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the same thing the first one is your

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.490 
the same thing the first one is your
single<00:00:14.160> shot<00:00:14.429> autofocus<00:00:14.849> mode<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
single shot autofocus mode and this is

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.590 
single shot autofocus mode and this is
very<00:00:16.650> good<00:00:16.770> for<00:00:17.220> subjects<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.270> aren't

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
very good for subjects that aren't

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.060 
very good for subjects that aren't
moving<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.080> if<00:00:19.170> you're<00:00:19.260> taking<00:00:19.410> still

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
moving so if you're taking still

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.060 
moving so if you're taking still
portraits<00:00:20.609> architecture<00:00:22.070> basically

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
portraits architecture basically

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.529 
portraits architecture basically
anything<00:00:23.340> where<00:00:23.609> your<00:00:23.730> subject<00:00:24.060> isn't<00:00:24.240> moving

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
anything where your subject isn't moving

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.599 
anything where your subject isn't moving
this<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> autofocus<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.430> should

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
this is the autofocus that you should

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.849 
this is the autofocus that you should
use<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.840> really<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.500> autofocus

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
use and this is really the autofocus

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.009 
use and this is really the autofocus
mode<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.550> i<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:29.880> probably<00:00:30.359> ninety<00:00:30.869> nine

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
mode that i use probably ninety nine

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.870 
mode that i use probably ninety nine
percent<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.619> time<00:00:31.800> because<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.610> what

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
percent of the time because that is what

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.970 
percent of the time because that is what
i<00:00:32.910> usually<00:00:33.239> shoot<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.530> single<00:00:34.829> shot

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
i usually shoot the single shot

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.490 
i usually shoot the single shot
autofocus<00:00:35.399> mode<00:00:35.760> basically<00:00:36.270> locks<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.170> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
autofocus mode basically locks on to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.170 
autofocus mode basically locks on to
your<00:00:37.829> subject<00:00:38.070> based<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> autofocus

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
your subject based on the autofocus

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
your subject based on the autofocus
point<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:39.989> chosen<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.590> after<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
point that you have chosen and after it

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
has locked on it won't change the focus

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.970 
has locked on it won't change the focus
even<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.750> your<00:00:45.899> subject<00:00:46.110> moves<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
even if your subject moves in and out of

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
even if your subject moves in and out of
the<00:00:47.160> frame<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.610> move<00:00:47.789> forward<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.360> backward<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the frame or move forward or backward it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
the frame or move forward or backward it
doesn't<00:00:49.289> change<00:00:49.500> your<00:00:50.070> focus<00:00:50.340> unless<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
doesn't change your focus unless of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240 
doesn't change your focus unless of
course<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.780> let<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.440> shutter<00:00:52.890> button

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
course you let go of your shutter button

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.360 
course you let go of your shutter button
and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.989> refocus<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.410> subject<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and then you refocus on your subject the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.490 
and then you refocus on your subject the
second<00:00:56.760> autofocus<00:00:57.270> mode<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.960> continuous

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
second autofocus mode is your continuous

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.849 
second autofocus mode is your continuous
autofocus<00:00:58.680> mode<00:00:59.309> and<00:01:00.829> unlike<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
autofocus mode and unlike the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.979 
autofocus mode and unlike the
single-shot<00:01:02.489> autofocus<00:01:03.090> mode<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.449> actually

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
single-shot autofocus mode this actually

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
single-shot autofocus mode this actually
follows<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.500> subject<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.700> have

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
follows your subject so if you have

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.200 
follows your subject so if you have
click<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.780> shutter<00:01:07.020> onto<00:01:08.010> subject<00:01:08.970> based

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
click on your shutter onto subject based

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.789 
click on your shutter onto subject based
on<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.630> course<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> autofocus<00:01:10.320> point<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
on of course the autofocus point that

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.100 
on of course the autofocus point that
you've<00:01:10.920> chosen<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:12.030> subject<00:01:12.479> moves<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you've chosen if that subject moves a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.039 
you've chosen if that subject moves a
forward<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.280> backward<00:01:14.700> left<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.479> your

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
forward or backward left or right your

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
forward or backward left or right your
focus<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:16.650> actually<00:01:17.189> follow<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.729> your

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
focus will actually follow it your

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.670 
focus will actually follow it your
camera<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.330> actually<00:01:18.659> follow<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.500> this

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
camera will actually follow it so this

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320 
camera will actually follow it so this
is<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:19.950> good<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.580> subjects<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.270> are

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
is very good for subjects that are

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.609 
is very good for subjects that are
moving<00:01:21.680> constantly<00:01:22.680> moving<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
moving constantly moving in and out of

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.950 
moving constantly moving in and out of
the<00:01:25.729> original<00:01:26.729> point<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.090> focus<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the original point of focus so this is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.260 
the original point of focus so this is
good<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.290> sports<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:29.670> children<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.150> are

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
good for sports for children that are

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
good for sports for children that are
moving<00:01:30.509> quickly<00:01:30.630> maybe<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.350> wildlife

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
moving quickly maybe a wildlife

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.190 
moving quickly maybe a wildlife
basically<00:01:32.880> anything<00:01:33.180> where<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.630> subject<00:01:34.049> is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
basically anything where your subject is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.060 
basically anything where your subject is
moving<00:01:35.840> outside<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.500> initial<00:01:37.740> focus

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
moving outside of your initial focus

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.240 
moving outside of your initial focus
point<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:39.270> third<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.869> called<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.650> hybrid

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
point the third one is called the hybrid

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980 
point the third one is called the hybrid
autofocus<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.509> basically<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
autofocus and this is basically a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.560 
autofocus and this is basically a
mixture<00:01:43.290> between<00:01:43.380> single<00:01:44.009> shot<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
mixture between single shot and

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
mixture between single shot and
continuous<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.470> leave<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.860> camera

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
continuous and if you leave your camera
