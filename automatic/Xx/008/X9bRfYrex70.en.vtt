00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
with you guys I think advanced warfare

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.700 
with you guys I think advanced warfare
has<00:01:53.240> push<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.659> boundaries<00:01:54.020> as<00:01:54.170> far<00:01:54.409> as<00:01:54.500> call

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
has push the boundaries as far as call

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.890 
has push the boundaries as far as call
of<00:01:54.740> duty<00:01:55.130> goals<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.759> I<00:01:56.060> honestly<00:01:56.509> think<00:01:56.720> we

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
of duty goals and I honestly think we

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.510 
of duty goals and I honestly think we
weren't<00:01:57.140> ready<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.470> see<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.650> call<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.130> duty<00:01:58.369> like

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520
