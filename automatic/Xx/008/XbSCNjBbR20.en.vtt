well<00:00:07.250> most<00:00:07.490> people<00:00:07.820> think<00:00:08.060> that<00:00:08.360> bacteria<00:00:09.050> are

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
well most people think that bacteria are

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.140 
well most people think that bacteria are
actually<00:00:09.680> bad<00:00:09.980> for<00:00:10.010> you<00:00:10.430> we<00:00:10.760> think<00:00:11.030> of

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
actually bad for you we think of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.030 
actually bad for you we think of
bacteria<00:00:11.719> will<00:00:11.840> hear<00:00:12.110> about<00:00:12.230> bacterial

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
bacteria will hear about bacterial

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.799 
bacteria will hear about bacterial
infections<00:00:13.580> we<00:00:13.730> think<00:00:13.940> a<00:00:14.030> lot<00:00:14.209> about<00:00:14.360> what's

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
infections we think a lot about what's

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.660 
infections we think a lot about what's
in<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.020> news<00:00:15.200> about<00:00:15.379> salmonella<00:00:16.160> outbreaks

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
and things like that but there are

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.500 
and things like that but there are
bacteria<00:00:18.890> that<00:00:19.310> are<00:00:19.369> good<00:00:19.760> for<00:00:19.940> you<00:00:20.030> it's<00:00:20.240> been

tissue of which is the appendix and in
the<00:01:22.430> appendix<00:01:23.200> bacteria<00:01:24.200> will<00:01:24.740> stimulate<00:01:25.250> the

the appendix bacteria will stimulate the

the appendix bacteria will stimulate the

way that will complete their

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
developmental cycle and so what happens

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.030 
developmental cycle and so what happens
is<00:01:31.909> after<00:01:32.149> these<00:01:32.990> B<00:01:33.229> cells<00:01:33.259> are<00:01:33.740> in<00:01:33.920> the

intestine in the appendix and they
complete<00:01:36.770> their<00:01:36.890> developmental<00:01:37.310> cycle<00:01:37.910> then

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
complete their developmental cycle then

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.450 
complete their developmental cycle then
they<00:01:38.929> can<00:01:39.259> make<00:01:39.830> antibodies<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.850> can<00:01:41.450> fight

surface of spores will interact with a

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.530 
surface of spores will interact with a
molecule<00:02:23.060> on<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.110> P<00:02:24.290> cells<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:26.180> believe

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
molecule on the P cells and we believe

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.900 
molecule on the P cells and we believe
that<00:02:26.569> this<00:02:27.020> interaction<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.980> very<00:02:28.280> important

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
that this interaction is very important

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.970 
that this interaction is very important
for<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.510> B<00:02:29.690> cells<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.320> undergo<00:02:30.830> this

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
for the B cells to undergo this

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.800 
for the B cells to undergo this
developmental<00:02:31.489> stage<00:02:31.850> in<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.300> appendix

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
developmental stage in the appendix

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.490 
developmental stage in the appendix
before<00:02:33.739> they<00:02:33.890> proceed<00:02:34.070> on<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.970> migrate<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
before they proceed on to migrate to the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.050 
before they proceed on to migrate to the
spleen<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.130> lymph<00:02:37.280> nodes<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.880> produce

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
spleen and lymph nodes to produce

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.480 
spleen and lymph nodes to produce
antibodies
