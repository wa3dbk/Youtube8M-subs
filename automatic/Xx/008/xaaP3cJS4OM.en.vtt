 40 euros 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.729
 it did not look like this 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.509
 like that without the sensible home so what is it necessary to party and 

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.409
 of the nature of relationships understood how do we just choose his 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.040
 character 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.940

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.250
 word process the mummy the mummy and the return of the mummy title 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.220
 so why not and so that's gone so of course these myths it's a 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.730
 a party wins on the cinema yes it's a very good goal so 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.340
 here and we started from the beginning for all my stuff it's a 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.110
 accessible it's very easy had started actually even if we know 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.390
 not good video games 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.210
 it's 13 it's easy to get by 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.130
 and here I can afford I intend to play a person tonight like that 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.020
 he gets there 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.909
 there is already it's very nice to play with you 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.030
 he is always more successful 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.369
 and above all and not participate six years more than it seems 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.160
 and 2 the chances of very good surprises altogether and we're going 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.150
 actually attended a movie clip - and 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.420
 I have a little stronger to the team 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.420
 at multiples are I know what it is 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.890
 let's read fatal this year the tocsin 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.659
 to the north in some clauses he had had in this context the study it takes 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.010
 get up completely crazy it's very very folk so so the difference 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.399
 she only wants to be part of life to set up one wonders 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.399
 why should he be very handsome as an anvil 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.599
 that said we chatter we can produce we will not expect anything 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.599
 for questions voting not be very strong margin named the actor 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.289
 in addition to humanity 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.059
 and here is the time his readers time 39 years always has it takes 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:28.009
 learn as much as possible to accumulate the most points 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.789
 m there we realize that we heard as part of the program and waits 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:33.090
 always always at the cleat congratulations 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.449
 named the character of sir glastint of the tomes 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.079
 fear 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.389
 I did a little bit 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.130
 it was the young woman had a reason and he was right 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.359
 three years not bad me I live your life must also 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.039
 I think of the secret why I think a song eminently 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.739
 exactly why 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.739
 but everyone to take it so final 1 end 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.529
 For its part 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:56.539
 I am horrified 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.739
 lost paradise 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.209
 the group sii with that lamartine china no 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.100
 his son I am the same person 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.180
 charlie sheen on the pavements for half compared to the euro the 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.180
 written proofs of fairly short term 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.420
 however, two nights are very courteous - schedules 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.959
 which allows to see a common count a certain rhythm 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.640
 - and that's good too yes 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.290
 so after three different events there is a so-called event 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.129
 accessories 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.959
 We must recognize 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.349
 what movie are we talking about 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.899
 I'm going to celebrate this defeat I do not know at all these lands chavaroche 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:33.539
 complete 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.929
 at hama nearly 10% to 5% for hanging on the hollywood poles okay 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.280
 m not sure 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.099
 I saw a lot of movies and an era that made me laugh a lot 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.219
 so like I talk with mainstream movies so that's also what 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.549
 thought the movie 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 but I'm going to the last title the queen for the end of fasting 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.280
 harold and kumar chase the ice 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.880
 it was so it's not bad either no questionnaires and how many 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.130
 of time see a little over 2800 francs for 2800 m so we wait we have 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.569
 what to see coming unless 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.290
 percent can not be proved inaccurate m at least 17 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.879
 saleh 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.359
 go to me I do not feel ansa 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.339
 nigel ely 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.109
 so it's an 'utility' up the auction and because it's really 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.500
 stronger is him 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.150
 that's what's good is that 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.390
 for them two more time for the price we have a little fun and for 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.430
 go away it's not super super super expensive absolutely no it's a good game 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.030
 so why why than 13 points with a higher to apply there is a 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.520
 little lack any novelty compared to the episode 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.259
 three high school students must say that in fact they feel rather new 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.129
 Questions 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.729
 it is rather an adonnent 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.479
 kouici if the sleeves are well presented the questions are well 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.100
 presented 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.960
 all he has to talk about the presenter is to see 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.190
 not only it's ugly either it's not very funny it's not very 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.719
 what he suffered not good faith 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.840
 it is not a great atmosphere to the point that the level of the atmosphere 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:56.999
 it's a little missed in the west a little for a party wins it's a bit of a pity 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.699
 okay but let's say that when you see several ambulances and vehicles 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.190
 with your friends m 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.700
 we do not need for a current total to explode no it's true it's 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.250
 true it's not happening if 10% and it's true again for two days 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.720
 the six heads we talk about at the same time quite fit I can 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.779
 choose what I mean 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.319
 who am I? 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.909
 then we have a photo that's it we must stop it must succeed without 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.819
 help with his record as it also felt that felt 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:24.930
 although you will see that 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.330
 they are both they rub shoulders in all cases of both 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.020
 I aim he must go over the caps to an agreement 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.120
 we found it between 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.800
 picture showing his 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.710
 see 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.779
 surprise 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.900
 - 2013 in the first leg 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.599
 I have not at all that it would be deeper by cons 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.459
 I am disappointed with the race alliance to revive the latter 

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.089
 berlin eighties because for me i like i'm fine i'm fine of 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.110
 cinema and I like that day day 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.210
 % and I like doing gÃ©rard majax magic tricks 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.680
 in these they have established hotels of 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.849
 m 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:11.690
 little success 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.169
 gesture of his father 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.169

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.279
 indeed he had gone to Lille 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:35.509
 good but here it is going to have to determine anyway it is this one 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.729
 is really in mans we still play we still play excited 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.990
 hamas before that I did silly things as you can see franck and 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.520
 women having a dream 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.309
 without waiting so 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:49.229
 arms outstretched 1% of Muslim women 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:50.509
 I will know 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.020
 % 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.339
 I'm happy it was wonderful 

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:59.039
 here is robot is not very good on that one no we are not very talented 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:00.669
 on that one but it's true that 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.410
 frankly me I want these are the stakes 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.050
 that I like because these funny really between friends now for 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.160
 the 13-year-old's rating played like nags we did not talk too much about the 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.140
 same day time what can we say a game about cinema pretty much 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.320
 times the victims of the rhythm by its implantation as you said here is a 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.370
 small 6 or if it's not super super super fun 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.699
 no but much more than what is online and for that you all have 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.479
 his friends and watched the text written by david cameron 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.979

 this video for the summit have been enlisted in the cinema it's really 

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:40.599
 important if we have more big cities and subscription cards of 

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:43.529
 stuff it's really cool really practical and this expensive patrol 

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:46.529
 according to budgets anyway will say something 

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:49.319
 as soon as possible
