00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.849
 Yaroslav shoes transfer to buy 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 Today I propose to talk about 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.710
 floppy pt-eighth level 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.990
 jac tiger 88 well, or as it is called 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.660
 some water makers profitable shed 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.359
 I remind you that this is not a review but a personal opinion 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.699
 from the game on this tank tale of how much 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.619
 he farms and the main advantages 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.619
 cars and so drove 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.190
 Let's start with the main advantages and 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.020
 disadvantages of the advantages of this car 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.330
 somewhat first is quite 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.430
 armored cabin whose thickness 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.559
 is 250 millimeters 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.550
 this is enough to quite often 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.430
 catch unpowered 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.050
 on the other hand nld board and feed clearly 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.390
 can't boast good 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.880
 performance armor second major plus 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.610
 This car is her gun on a jeep tiger 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.710
 88 as the name implies 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.510
 eighty eight millimeter guns 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.670
 its distinctive features 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.850
 this is a high rate of fire which 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.580
 is 11 rounds per minute high 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.110
 accuracy well and good dpm to minus 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.420
 this instrument can be attributed to 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.840
 a little noise that as for me not too 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.220
 bothers for a good game on this Fri 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.649
 the last major virtue of this 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.200
 birdie is the preferential level of fighting 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.240
 higher than nines you do not get but 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.030
 counterweight to the main disadvantage of this pt 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.770
 is its maneuverability and speed 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 movement you can easily spin 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.750
 even medium tanks well as the maximum 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.470
 Jagdigger speed is only 28 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 kilometers per hour now I think it is worth 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.850
 tell who it will fit and how to 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.920
 it is better to play with speed 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.500
 Characteristics logic tells me 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.509
 what is it pt 2 lines and always better 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.700
 stick somewhere behind tactics 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.830
 shooting at light from the bushes to you 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.020
 bring quite a lot of homework but mine 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.569
 the soul does not like bushes and on that personally 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.069
 I prefer to play more aggressively 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.230
 percentage of survival in such a game 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.240
 you yourself will not be too high 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.010
 but for the time while you are pushing 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.860
 line in the forefront then you are no problem 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.230
 will be able to throw enough 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.750
 homework for good farming and valuable 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.819
 contribution to winning the word thanks to good 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.800
 accuracy you are really able 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.349
 target any vulnerabilities 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.330
 opponents in general, I personally choose 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.310
 aggressive fighting style since 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.349
 it is in this game that you can get 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.260
 much more positive emotions that 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.210
 I have always put above any farm or 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.680
 stats 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.260
 those who think that the machine can not 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.660
 farm you are deeply mistaken in the first place 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.000
 shells of this pt are extremely cheap and from 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.040
 addition after the battle of pure farm you will have 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.860
 more than when playing a conventional technique 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.140
 for an average battle you get 65 thousand 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.650
 silver that for preferential straight technology 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.660
 very good 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.360
 in the end we got an interesting Fri-Sau 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.310
 which is weak maneuverability but excellent 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.050
 gun preferential level fights but 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.360
 insufficient booking 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.300
 I will honestly say that personally in my hangar I 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.040
 I did not bring this pt and I doubt that I will buy it and 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.570
 soon we are there 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.090
 enough no less worthy 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.490
 competitors but I know that there are many 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.250
 connoisseurs of this as well as simple 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.260
 players and some waterways to me 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.300
 personally it was nice and fun to play on 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.550
 This tank has several dozen battles 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.440
 yet the car is probably not for me she 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.620
 rather for those who love the game from the second 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.870
 lines and seats in the bushes and on this 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.850
 write me all about what car you want 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.740
