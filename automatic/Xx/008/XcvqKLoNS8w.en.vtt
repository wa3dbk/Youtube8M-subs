00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 for more to less on how to set 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.200
 Welcome back to my channel in 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.480
 this short video I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.809
 technical characteristics of the camera 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.610
 of samsung galaxy 64 and many already 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.740
 surely many have read of ketele 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.890
 this phone comes with a camera 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.789
 rear of 5 megapixels and front vga 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.600
 he has a ship made I 'm going to show him 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.400
 effectively with the phone in your hand 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.260
 through your options 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.199
 configuration for you to confirm 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.210
 really what is it like that there is a detail 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.930
 that you should keep in mind is that there are two 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.969
 versions of samsung galaxy 64 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.660
 I look here I have them is the version 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.780
 normal that the samsung galaxy 64 and is 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.360
 the samsung galaxy 64 plate version 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 the light version as you can see in your 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.949
 box here they say comes with 3 megapixels 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 of main camera and the normal version 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.530
 it comes with a 5 megapixel camera 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.000
 I have here the two phones without 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.500
 But I am with the normal 64 that is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.540
 the one that comes with you let's enter 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.450
 here by configuration to not look for 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.480
 we grow with the camera I just give 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.910
 click here on the camera 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.100
 I'm here to accept here I was 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.220
 asking if I want to change the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.710
 Storage location option a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.440
 the micro sd that I already install a I'm going 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.659
 to accept and here we are simply going to 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.240
 enter here by the screw 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.069
 and we are by the screw and to see your 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.469
 main features again 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:38.280
 by the screw and here we can see the 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:44.819
 resolution or size in this case of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:48.539
 the camera is 2560 x 1536 this 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:51.060
 size is basically 4 megabytes what 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.030
 ideal is to keep it in the 5 megabytes that 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.979
 It is a little larger than is 2560 x 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.530
 thousand 920 and can take minimum photos of 2 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.759
 megabytes so your back camera is going 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.009
 from 2 mb to 5 megabytes in terms of 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.649
 recorder the video let's look at the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.130
 video configuration here I'm already 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.130
 recording 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.550
 to get out here the interesting thing is that 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.250
 comes with pause option 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.790
 so I can pause and then continue 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.250
 with the video or if we do not stop it we are going to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.240
 look at the video settings 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.830
 we enter here the middle video has a 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:39.430
 only video size option that is 1280 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.340
 x 720 this is basically almost that an hd 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.110
 it's not a full hd since a full hd 1920 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.650
 x 1080 and this is 1280 x 720 so it's 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.920
 a cache basically let's look to see 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.080
 the options of the front camera in 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.420
 this case the dga 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.230
 I'm going to put my finger here on the 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.690
 botoncito the gea 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.599
 to not appear in the camera click here 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.900
 to invest as you can see everything goes 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.640
 as black or red as on my finger 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.510
 I went here to the configuration option 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.489
 again 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.269
 and just here I can see the 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.940
 size options to mars and it shows me 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.520
 size 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.820
 here he does not show me I do not know why I do not 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.190
 show the data are almost not seen not what 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.610
 I can set up since it's a 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.050
 resolution of 640 x 480 people and bg a 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.620
 both for photos with so much for video 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.530
 basically those are the characteristics 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.170
 most important of the options 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.100
 camera configuration we are going to 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.530
 return back to the back 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.210
 and it's here I'm already a back 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.120
 let's look at more options of the camera 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:04:00.430
 we can have obviously has key 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.620
 volume that is interesting timer 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.560
 white balance value of the 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.400
 exhibition guide lines I maintain the 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 flash activated life line 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.560
 disabled if the file name is 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.209
 can configure very interesting and the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.120
 storage place that is also 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.370
 recommended on the microsd card in the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.900
 if they have already installed it 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.720
 are the lines that I mentioned 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.760
 previously with that we can take 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.810
 better pictures another thing that I like 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.460
 know and it's very interesting or important 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.590
 to take into account if they bought 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.560
 a phone of these see if the phone 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.020
 has autofocus let's take a picture 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.810
 of an object that is as close to 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.240
 and there we realize, for example, I do not know 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.210
 if they can see, I do not believe if I give 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.850
 a small click to the screen 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.900
 immediately adjust the resolution is 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.870
 say that he has autofocus 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.090
 here we can see that an unfocused 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.419
 click on the screen and immediately 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.669
 towards autofocus is very important 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.229
 keep in mind now compared a some 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.870
 phone from these that that camera 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.610
 have an autofocus option that was all 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.919
 for this video some other question 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.289
