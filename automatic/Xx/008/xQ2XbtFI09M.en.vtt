00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello to all I speak to you very 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.060
 often from photoshop since the software 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.379
 that I use for to draw then 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.550
 you have to know that it's always 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.620
 important to know a little bit how 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.049
 it works different software even 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.890
 if you do not use photoshop but 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.600
 whether you work on studio manga or 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.220
 no or other I do not know the names anymore 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.699
 there are a lot of similarities 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 so that can eventually serve you 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.880
 even if you do not know him 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.019
 really for those who ask themselves 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.010
 question of my outfit it's just that I 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.510
 am invited to a wedding 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.579
 after that I have no time to change 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.790
 so I'm going to do the video tie 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.250
 for once finally brief it's gone to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.079
 your pencils 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.960
 so I had explained to you the last 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.559
 times how to set up the sheet 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.309
 with 300 dpi that's the size 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.600
 today what we will see is a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.640
 little bit how precisely create his 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.980
 workspace that is to say that there 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.500
 for once you have to make window finally 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.960
 in any case the responsible windows and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.520
 you see I checked layer on layer 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.870
 that's what it's all about 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.150
 it's very important to know where we are 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.740
 hear saints so historic I 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.520
 you talked about it too it's all 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.160
 the actions you do 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.420
 it allows you to go back if 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.470
 you have made mistakes and is therefore 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.630
 you have 10 15 20 30 actions that you 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.310
 can review and obviously the tools 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.750
 so that's it's really the thing 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.300
 base knowing that see he still remains 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.240
 full I did not check color it was 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.410
 common sense we can find it easily 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.760
 Well, here you go to see all this 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.390
 knowing me what I advise you 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.890
 these three there what after that so what 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.360
 that I wanted to explain to you is that 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.820
 I did when I kept to win 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.740
 time all but layer explain us a 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.420
 little bit the method for when one is 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.680
 confronted with his blank page 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.390
 because in general we do his little 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.369
 sketch you saw an all the layers 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.660
 do is named it's really very 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.070
 practice to finally find myself I'm doing 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.060
 that I do for the video we know that 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.649
 of her I do not but I 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.950
 lose when i d-kalck it's a little 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.040
 galley 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.710
 so here I do them to explain to you 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.830
 so the sketch and always annoys you 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.820
 also with its very important anchoring 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.729
 so I already did a great job 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.880
 I already did and knowing that you see 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.590
 I zoomed on what is super 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.050
 important to actually understand is that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.430
 me like this trail on tablet so there 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.200
 I remove the background a few 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.510
 whites is that my cal that anchor 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.980
 you saw he's on a layer 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.060
 transparent so it's very convenient 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.130
 for me it's only at the level of 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.500
 color it's just below there is 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.209
 no worries you necessarily if you 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.280
 work I made the example on purpose 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.080
 below if you are working on paper 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.380
 on a piece of paper and you 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.030
 scanner you what you will have it's not 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.540
 a drawing like mine transparency and 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.430
 a blank sheet 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.870
 you will tell me yes but how do I 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.450
 do me a shot to color if it's 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.480
 a cisse on a blank piece of paper 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.180
 case with all the traits that are around 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.709
 of white and well in fact there is this little 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.180
 you see this little thing is very 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.700
 important to know these different 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.750
 layer settings so normal I 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.150
 explains to you know that I'm going to make a 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.709
 layer below so I my the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.020
 flat color that's there I'm going 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.020
 try so normal I'm in products 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.170
 you will see that from the moment 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.090
 where I feel products hop I'm going 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.100
 put that the right size I did 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.640
 control your it allows me to 2 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.680
 enlarge will transform my december 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.570
 it 's about having put in product that 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.110
 lets see what's behind 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.790
 whereas if I had put it in normal 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.020
 sending a blank sheet so very 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.120
 important if you work on paper 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.980
 and you scan your drawing you can 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.600
 very well colorized on photoshop but 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.100
 you put in products like that we see 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.690
 the color that below you saw 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.080
 there I did I'm going to remove but calm 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.240
 and I have a layer of solid colors here is a 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.370
 layer of light on which I put my 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.010
 shadows is my case that anchor the shot 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.860
 there I have my drawing at my drawing 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.510
 is there for the well finished shot and if you 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.210
 you work on this sheet 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.760
 white like that so there is one thing that 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.900
 is super convenient when you kill when 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.970
 you if you work on tablets too 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.250
 is that for the cal that anchor and 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.240
 there I found it there is this little 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.460
 option which is I really great 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.740
 this one the little square with 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.540
 small squares in it is that if you 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.880
 the unchecked where you tick him and well 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.890
 you can directly put in 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.250
 color your your spitting his 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.620
 touch the rest you saw the hqe or 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.760
 laureen just my anchor in black and 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.630
 it's very convenient because a good month 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.460
 what I had done at the base is that 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.680
 you saw I had it I had it 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.360
 colorized in hair color and the 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.390
 skin color so that l 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.130
 impression a little cartoon au aux 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.790
 characters what while the cij's 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.650
 to fill black we have a little more aspect 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.610
 a little bit what we know very light that 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.889
 small nuances but 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.530
 when we start it's not really 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.759
 refine your style and level 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.689
 anchoring when I play well I you 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.830
 always talk about that but you've seen 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.539
 that at anchor levels makes a 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.669
 special video on it but you have 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.830
 all my traits are traits in 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.689
 different sizes there at the arm level 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.669
 as it is an important area it is 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.439
 quite thick but all folded to his 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.750
 purposes it must be hierarchical it is 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.090
 its anchor once again I you 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.629
 will explain a little bit better a 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.949
 next time at the tools level 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:13.349
 which is important which I like to be the 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.779
 whole happiness outfitter the different 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.810
 layers at the tools level then there are 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.490
 the selection tool that is very important 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.719
 that can be for example so that I 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.479
 you had explained it the dr time but 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:27.389
 when you really want to define a 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.580
 area so to the eye the flaw at the 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.949
 way the assault but also the way that's 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.400
 when it's a little bit more 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.340
 maybe you can do that 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.199
 in geometric form what 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.580
 what other tool in cloud images it 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.440
 should speak it's very important if 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.550
 gum 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.590
 I do not explain why the eraser 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.770
 it is obviously to erase the tool 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.120
 text uncle t it's all stupid to click 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:58.290
 on the hop tea and suddenly you write 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.000
 to blah blah blah and suddenly you have 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.380
 different sizes of everything indicated 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.570
 for different types of police the has of 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.370
 typography that are either to download 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.760
 either by default in your software 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:13.320
 photoshop or whatever you have all types 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.490
 of all types of nice writing after one 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.139
 do what you want do some 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.139
 bubbles could make a little bubble 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.160
 we have no matter 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.560
 and after you then you know the hand 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.569
 the hand is not bad it's for these 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.699
 for 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.259
 move the workload say that if 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:34.009
 ferias there are two tools moving to 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:36.349
 sékou sylla that will move flat on 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:39.020
 a call that will move to someone in 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.300
 particular so here it is the bubble is l 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.129
 hand tool that moves all your drawing 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.599
 so it's really 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.439
 navigate in your drawing this is 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.669
 also practical 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:48.770
 I have one here lies all 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.240
 actors if the space key button 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.580
 space it makes me appear the hand this 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.580
 would be very practical zoom tools 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.319
 are finally zooming in or out years 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.819
 you must know you must know 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.499
 already know my opinion so again a 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.490
 times if you use photoshop and that 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.369
 you use your white sheet and 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.619
 that you scan it do not hesitate to 

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:08.689
 position your different layers 1 in 

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:11.749
 flatten I'll go back on 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:13.729
 I'm going to put the anchor one that you 

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:15.469
 will be used as filling for flat areas 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.529
 you saw at 1 set a color 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:21.080
 united so that red than blue that 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:23.119
 yellow and there I made a welcome that 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.949
 is called light or the gemmi of shadows
