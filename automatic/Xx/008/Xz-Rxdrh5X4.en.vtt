to<00:02:05.590> get<00:02:05.680> one<00:02:05.799> with<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.950> light<00:02:06.130> on<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.399> if<00:02:06.460> you

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
to get one with a light on it if you

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.490 
to get one with a light on it if you
have<00:02:06.579> one<00:02:06.850> with<00:02:06.969> a<00:02:07.030> light<00:02:07.240> on<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.600> these<00:02:08.140> lights

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
have one with a light on it these lights

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.630 
have one with a light on it these lights
aren't<00:02:08.770> going<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.039> show<00:02:09.100> up<00:02:09.280> as<00:02:09.430> bright

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
aren't going to show up as bright

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.020 
aren't going to show up as bright
because<00:02:10.000> only<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:10.690> much<00:02:10.960> of<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:12.010> energy<00:02:12.640> can

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
because only so much of the energy can

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.490 
because only so much of the energy can
go<00:02:13.150> through<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.420> light<00:02:13.570> or<00:02:13.780> you're<00:02:14.320> going<00:02:14.410> to

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
go through the light or you're going to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.650 
go through the light or you're going to
blow<00:02:14.650> out<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.920> switch<00:02:15.190> itself<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.330> get<00:02:16.540> one

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
blow out the switch itself so get one

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.880 
blow out the switch itself so get one
without<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.930> light<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:17.740> to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
without a light on it I like to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.100 
without a light on it I like to
one<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.340> looks<00:02:18.550> pretty<00:02:18.760> flush<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.360> looks

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
one it looks pretty flush it looks

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.600 
one it looks pretty flush it looks
pretty<00:02:20.350> good<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.560> think<00:02:20.890> all<00:02:21.100> my<00:02:21.190> friends<00:02:21.520> are

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
pretty good I think all my friends are

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.130 
pretty good I think all my friends are
always<00:02:21.760> asking<00:02:21.880> what<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.480> switches<00:02:22.840> for<00:02:22.959> you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
always asking what the switches for you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.840 
always asking what the switches for you
can<00:02:23.260> tell<00:02:23.410> them<00:02:23.560> whatever<00:02:23.740> dome<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:24.700> for

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
can tell them whatever dome it's for

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.090 
can tell them whatever dome it's for
something<00:02:25.120> crazy<00:02:25.390> reality<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.590> only<00:02:26.860> for<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
something crazy reality is only for the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.520 
something crazy reality is only for the
light<00:02:27.340> but<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.060> looks<00:02:28.209> good<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:29.500> just

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
light but it looks good and you just

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.260 
light but it looks good and you just
have<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.010> drill<00:02:30.310> for<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.730> switch<00:02:30.940> it's<00:02:31.150> a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
have to drill for this switch it's a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.350 
have to drill for this switch it's a
half<00:02:31.630> inch<00:02:31.900> hole<00:02:32.140> into<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.700> center<00:02:33.850> which<00:02:34.240> is

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
half inch hole into the center which is

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.870 
half inch hole into the center which is
pretty<00:02:34.570> basic<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.190> put<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.490> right<00:02:36.520> in

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
pretty basic and if you put it right in

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.600 
pretty basic and if you put it right in
the<00:02:36.940> center<00:02:37.120> on<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.750> back<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.610> you're

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the center on the back of this you're

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.920 
the center on the back of this you're
going<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.790> have<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.030> cut<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.570> little<00:02:40.780> piece

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
going to have to cut out a little piece

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.630 
going to have to cut out a little piece
as<00:02:41.260> well<00:02:41.440> you'll<00:02:41.860> see<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.160> when<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.340> do<00:02:42.459> it

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
as well you'll see it when you do it

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.310 
as well you'll see it when you do it
really<00:02:43.180> basic<00:02:43.600> just<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.870> screw<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.260> in

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
really basic just to screw this in

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.840 
really basic just to screw this in
because<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.739> can<00:02:44.890> unscrew<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.400> right<00:02:45.580> now<00:02:45.700> if

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
because I can unscrew this right now if

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.610 
because I can unscrew this right now if
I<00:02:45.910> wanted<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.420> pull<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.660> out<00:02:46.750> other<00:02:47.410> than

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
I wanted to and pull it out other than

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.280 
I wanted to and pull it out other than
that<00:02:47.800> that's<00:02:48.040> really<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.610> took<00:02:49.000> me<00:02:49.450> about<00:02:49.690> 30

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
that that's really it took me about 30

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.550 
that that's really it took me about 30
minutes<00:02:50.770> pretty<00:02:51.610> basic<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.360> like<00:02:53.320> how<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.500> looks

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
minutes pretty basic I like how it looks

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.640 
minutes pretty basic I like how it looks
I'm<00:02:54.370> also<00:02:54.580> going<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.209> putting<00:02:55.840> another

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
I'm also going to be putting another

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.030 
I'm also going to be putting another
switch<00:02:57.100> probably<00:02:58.090> around<00:02:58.209> here<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:59.040> one

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
switch probably around here and one

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.040 
switch probably around here and one
probably<00:03:00.400> over<00:03:00.670> here<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.600> same<00:03:01.780> type<00:03:01.930> of

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
probably over here the same type of

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.830 
probably over here the same type of
switch<00:03:02.260> uh<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.850> light<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.480> one<00:03:04.660> is

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
switch uh this light this one is

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.300 
switch uh this light this one is
obviously<00:03:05.290> just<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.590> turn<00:03:05.739> these<00:03:05.890> on<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.250> off

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
obviously just to turn these on and off

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.880 
obviously just to turn these on and off
I'm<00:03:07.209> going<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.420> have<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:08.019> I'm<00:03:08.440> going<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.769> have

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
I'm going to have that I'm going to have

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.009 
I'm going to have that I'm going to have
another<00:03:09.100> one<00:03:09.310> next<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:10.030> adjust<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.989> for

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
another one next to it to adjust it for

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.380 
another one next to it to adjust it for
my<00:03:11.230> music<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:11.769> if<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:11.920> turn<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.430> on<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:13.209> this

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
that's going to be a video in the next
