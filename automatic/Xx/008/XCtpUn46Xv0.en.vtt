00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.969
 and what's happening warning kids? 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.460
 party and as you see in the title the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 mystery of dogs in hackett today os 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.280
 I come to tell this little secret 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.930
 I'm curious because I do not know if I 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.030
 it will never have happened that you will have 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.940
 asked where the balls come from 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.530
 dogs on the map of gijÃ£ that in the 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.510
 other sites are worth out of the 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.270
 map but here they can not come from the sea or 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.760
 they can not where they come from they do not come 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.120
 helicopters and leave them here like this 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.890
 that I have tried is good to me 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.170
 time trying to get me the dogs in 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.329
 this map but as you know it is a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.730
 madness is let 's say 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.089
 you remember the map of tom the modern 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.010
 warfare 3 because it is worse still there is 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.289
 get a high streak as well as not 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.789
 camps is a little bit hard and for 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.910
 I've had it done with the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.400
 superiority 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.120
 of the peacekeeper as you see the weapon 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.229
 new of the new dlc wanted to tell you that 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.520
 I have the season pass 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.710
 so you will see all the new ones 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.770
 maps that are taking out and I guess that 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.550
 also those with weapons this this 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.700
 example and as you see 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.690
 I started it when I was just killed 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.110
 because at first I think I think 444 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.910
 55 or something like that and I say it's worth the first 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.700
 part of everything and that there are a couple of casualties 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.550
 cool because I did not consider it important 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.229
 put it so that's what started from 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.840
 here from the satanic the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.050
 killing the dogs and what to tell you 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.580
 about this weapon is good as all 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.590
 We knew at the beginning they were going to check 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.390
 a lot for people to love 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.250
 buy the DT because if you do not feel in 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.680
 inferiority compared to those who do not 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.550
 they have 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.920
 and when everything has happened a little 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.920
 of time then the people then 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.970
 the karan beast is worth it 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.530
 no normal and people no longer like no longer 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.380
 will have the need to buy the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.420
 Well, more than anything, that's my opinion but 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.310
 I would say yes as it says here I am 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.630
 regulating and distracting with a lot 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.910
 be careful because like this one 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.570
 scavenger of the few times that no 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.570
 I'm scavenger and had only 15 15 bullets 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.190
 and so I had to get the dogs out 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.310
 with the pistolita but luckily as 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.160
 you know with assists of obese and with 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.780
 the covers because I could take it out later 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.470
 I already make a few cool losses with 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.570
 the b-23 but good simply that now 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.300
 I'm going to throw the dogs and I'll leave you 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.830
 so you can see where it comes from where 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.720
 from this ministry I now give a 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.140
 little round here they kill me and here is 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.140
 the solution 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.220
 of everything 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.510
 and I was waiting for you as you have seen 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.519
 some people will surely know it I do not know 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.519
 say it in the comments here is 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.069
 I'm pretty cool because the 23 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.730
 same mother of mine when I make a play 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.040
 so I feel double pro so that 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.450
 say in the comments and if I already 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.459
 you knew if you did not know if you 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.440
 seemed curious as you see there are some 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.069
 wineries at the end and at the beginning of the map 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.269
 some open doors that come from there 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.190
 dogs when pulling is 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.830
 represents that we send the dogs are 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.500
 like in the ship's hold in the part 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.049
 from below there tranquilitos and when you 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.520
 you say the puppy you come that I just 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.240
 to get out here on a streak life 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.270
 they come out through those doors and just like 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.920
 they kill and then they go back to the same place and 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.930
 they go back to get in there but as usual 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.150
 you know for copyright reasons has not been 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.650
 could put the return home as well 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.930
 say it because 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.220
 because if I put a lot second it's a 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.220
 song then highlights the copyright and 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.070
 better in the channel by 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.100
 so as you see here I go back out 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.350
 a streak rapporteur was nothing of the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.440
 following dogs and for wanting to play me 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.700
 like not to be careful as this kills me 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.729
 I do not give him a bullet but hey 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.860
 it was simply that I wanted to bring you the 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.080
 he has solved himself so to speak 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.550
 As you can see I am pointing the time to 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.800
 head with the tail and as I said a 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.749
 checked if you do not have the good that I have 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.520
 observed or would buy the maps 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:48.440
 I guess I 'll make a video explaining in 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.540
 my opinion of each map and everything 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.150
 but mirage and the other one and green I love 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.650
 I got good runs and austria and type 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.180
 with a game with on those maps but 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.980
 I got good streaks but I did not 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.890
 liked the game if I did not have the 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.100
 quality that I thought was enough to 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.200
 and upload it still has brought us 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.550
 but when I get to the nice you know 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.690
 that I will be the first to bring oslo 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.300
 attention this I hear you I turn you 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.250
 kill and tell me I shit in the milk now 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.550
 I have to be careful so that I do not 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.850
 improves the detention item 3 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.770
 the paper walls of this map are 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.440
 good are brutal 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.690
 I do not know what I was thinking about leaving because 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.970
 when you make a boat the most logical 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.729
 is that now it is the most resistant 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.409
 possible so that it does not sink but it is 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.199
 framework I believe that if in reality what 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.750
 they put into the sea they made a little boat 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.310
 of paper 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.670
 it would look good 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.440
 what else can you say that also the map of 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.750
 since we were with the new maps 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.540
 I also wanted to tell you the map of 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.000
 hydro has disappointed me a lot had 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.540
 very good looking I expected a lot of wait 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.970
 very much the truth because it was very good 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:14.590
 paint with the water and everything I say goes to 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.540
 be nice but no longer the one to not 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.510
 I'll like it because you're on a roll and 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.820
 that the young woman the next day I do not know who 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.370
 happened I do not know if it went to me as a marc is 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.920
 there and I'm on a roll 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:31.690
 for water internet tree milk 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.910
 and then also in the backs the 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.490
 rhythms on the new maps are a 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.800
 little bit more as defined they have to 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.140
 distribute in that area yes or yes and as not 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.060
 you get very inside one or two of your 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.760
 team within that area to follow 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.220
 appearing there so to get 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.500
 pizzas and with the sniper is enough 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.940
 good maps but initially 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.520
 was to catch loft 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.400
 so be careful here that you are better off 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.430
 the game already kills me the last time 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.620
 it kills me it kills me with a milk drink and 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.850
 then I fall the dazed now my own 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.320
 theory now that I do not get the 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.940
 puppies that had been so long 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.300
 wishing 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.530
 As I said, I'll be back to normal 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.810
 the frequency of videos on the channel 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.930
 last last low to end the 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.760
 video just say is that remember 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.310
 that dreaming is free and throwing the video 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.780
 leave a comment too and see you 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.780
 kids until next time
