at<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> sand<00:04:01.330> as<00:04:01.599> you<00:04:01.720> can<00:04:01.870> see<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.730> bunch<00:04:03.730> of

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
at the sand as you can see a bunch of

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.009 
at the sand as you can see a bunch of
the<00:04:03.940> areas<00:04:04.360> if<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.959> can<00:04:05.110> see<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:07.720> is<00:04:07.900> the

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
the areas if you can see this is the

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.860 
the areas if you can see this is the
most<00:04:08.200> labor-intensive<00:04:08.560> by<00:04:09.190> far<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:10.569> this

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
most labor-intensive by far and this

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.960 
most labor-intensive by far and this
makes<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.260> vsms<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:12.400> probably<00:04:12.700> makes<00:04:12.819> the

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
makes the vsms it probably makes the

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.860 
makes the vsms it probably makes the
most<00:04:13.150> time<00:04:13.410> so<00:04:14.410> if<00:04:14.829> you<00:04:14.890> want<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.660> see<00:04:16.660> how<00:04:16.780> it
