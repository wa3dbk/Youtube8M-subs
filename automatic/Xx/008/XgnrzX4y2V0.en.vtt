we'll<00:04:08.500> see<00:04:08.680> something<00:04:09.100> come<00:04:09.250> out<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.490> this

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
we'll see something come out of this

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.530 
we'll see something come out of this
there<00:04:09.820> we<00:04:09.910> go<00:04:12.060> obviously<00:04:13.060> we're<00:04:13.210> not<00:04:13.300> going<00:04:13.450> to

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
there we go obviously we're not going to

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.540 
there we go obviously we're not going to
dive<00:04:13.690> too<00:04:14.050> deep<00:04:14.080> into<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.860> device<00:04:15.250> today

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
dive too deep into the device today

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.640 
dive too deep into the device today
we're<00:04:15.880> just<00:04:16.180> going<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.419> give<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:16.780> an<00:04:16.900> idea<00:04:17.049> of

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
we're just going to give you an idea of

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.120 
we're just going to give you an idea of
what<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:19.510> can

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
what you can

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.270 
what you can
on<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.580> first<00:04:21.260> startup<00:04:22.260> here<00:04:22.470> we'll<00:04:22.980> get<00:04:23.100> into

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
on the first startup here we'll get into

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.860 
on the first startup here we'll get into
the<00:04:23.430> full<00:04:23.700> review<00:04:24.000> when<00:04:24.300> we<00:04:24.420> do<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.720> full

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
the full review when we do the full

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:33.170 
the full review when we do the full
review<00:04:25.140> in<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.320> future<00:04:25.590> video<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:31.970> remember<00:04:32.970> the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
review in a future video I remember the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.480 
review in a future video I remember the
old<00:04:33.660> Kindles<00:04:34.080> took<00:04:34.260> forever<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.680> start<00:04:34.740> on<00:04:35.370> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
old Kindles took forever to start on the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.730 
old Kindles took forever to start on the
first<00:04:35.700> time<00:04:36.030> startup<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:37.320> looks<00:04:37.470> like<00:04:37.530> the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
first time startup so it looks like the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.990 
first time startup so it looks like the
status<00:04:38.130> bar<00:04:38.340> is<00:04:38.490> moseying<00:04:39.000> along<00:04:39.120> quite<00:04:39.600> well

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
status bar is moseying along quite well

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.670 
status bar is moseying along quite well
don't<00:04:42.000> know<00:04:42.090> if<00:04:42.240> it's<00:04:42.450> all<00:04:43.020> in<00:04:43.200> my<00:04:43.320> head<00:04:43.350> that

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
don't know if it's all in my head that

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.320 
don't know if it's all in my head that
it<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:43.980> new<00:04:44.160> device<00:04:44.460> but<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:44.970> know<00:04:45.090> either

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
it is a new device but you know either

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.370 
it is a new device but you know either
way<00:04:50.390> first<00:04:51.390> time<00:04:51.570> startups<00:04:51.930> are<00:04:52.020> always<00:04:52.260> gonna

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
way first time startups are always gonna

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.200 
way first time startups are always gonna
be<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.590> little<00:04:52.770> bit<00:04:52.860> slow<00:04:53.100> because<00:04:53.370> well<00:04:54.000> you've

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
be a little bit slow because well you've

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.630 
be a little bit slow because well you've
started<00:04:54.510> up<00:04:54.630> for<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.840> first<00:04:54.990> time<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:55.650> has<00:04:56.370> to

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
started up for the first time and has to

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.960 
started up for the first time and has to
kind<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.360> optimize<00:04:57.630> itself<00:04:58.350> no<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.550> don't

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
kind of optimize itself no I don't

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.220 
kind of optimize itself no I don't
recall<00:05:00.270> seeing<00:05:00.390> that<00:05:00.600> little<00:05:00.870> thumb<00:05:01.050> there

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
recall seeing that little thumb there

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.410 
recall seeing that little thumb there
before<00:05:01.590> but<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:02.850> looks<00:05:03.090> like<00:05:03.150> it's

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
before but that looks like it's

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.990 
before but that looks like it's
different<00:05:03.680> English<00:05:04.680> USA<00:05:05.100> even<00:05:05.670> though<00:05:05.790> we're

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
different English USA even though we're

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.380 
different English USA even though we're
here<00:05:06.150> in<00:05:06.270> Canada<00:05:10.370> another<00:05:11.370> load<00:05:11.610> screen<00:05:14.390> let's

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
here in Canada another load screen let's

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:27.060 
here in Canada another load screen let's
get<00:05:15.540> some<00:05:15.690> zoom<00:05:15.960> on<00:05:16.200> this

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:37.530 

loving<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.060> black<00:05:28.240> hair<00:05:28.570> really<00:05:29.290> nice

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.960 

alright<00:05:38.640> let's<00:05:39.640> connect<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.060> Wi-Fi<00:05:41.820> we<00:05:42.820> have

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
alright let's connect to Wi-Fi we have

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.720 
alright let's connect to Wi-Fi we have
multiple<00:05:43.600> connection<00:05:44.590> only<00:05:44.770> shows<00:05:45.280> one<00:05:45.310> right

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
multiple connection only shows one right

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.250 
multiple connection only shows one right
now<00:05:45.850> we'll<00:05:46.120> just<00:05:46.150> do<00:05:46.420> the<00:05:46.570> one<00:05:46.720> that's<00:05:46.930> open

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
now we'll just do the one that's open

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.080 
now we'll just do the one that's open
here<00:05:47.440> so<00:05:47.710> we<00:05:47.860> don't<00:05:47.950> have<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:48.310> input<00:05:48.460> passwords

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
here so we don't have to input passwords

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.610 
here so we don't have to input passwords
and<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:50.020> was<00:05:50.140> quick

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
and that was quick

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.210 
and that was quick
Wow<00:05:51.640> and<00:05:52.000> actually<00:05:52.830> connected<00:05:53.830> quite<00:05:54.010> quickly

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
Wow and actually connected quite quickly

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.620 
Wow and actually connected quite quickly
there<00:05:55.530> so<00:05:58.800> close<00:05:59.800> that<00:06:00.180> looks<00:06:01.180> like<00:06:01.360> we<00:06:01.480> have

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630

bore you guys with creating an account
on<00:06:13.150> camera<00:06:13.660> here<00:06:13.840> or<00:06:14.080> logging<00:06:14.680> into<00:06:14.830> my

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
on camera here or logging into my

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.360 
on camera here or logging into my
account<00:06:15.010> rather<00:06:15.490> so<00:06:16.090> skip<00:06:16.840> that<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.800> didn't

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370

account rather so skip that and didn't
skip<00:06:18.550> that<00:06:18.700> but<00:06:18.970> we<00:06:19.150> just<00:06:19.390> fast<00:06:20.020> forwarded

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
skip that but we just fast forwarded

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.830 
skip that but we just fast forwarded
there<00:06:20.650> so<00:06:21.640> you<00:06:21.730> see<00:06:22.060> that<00:06:22.270> nothing<00:06:22.570> has

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
there so you see that nothing has

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.920 
there so you see that nothing has
changed<00:06:23.380> on<00:06:23.470> the<00:06:24.070> main<00:06:24.370> screen<00:06:25.150> here<00:06:25.630> you<00:06:25.780> are

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
changed on the main screen here you are

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.460 
changed on the main screen here you are
still<00:06:26.200> getting<00:06:26.770> your<00:06:27.280> home<00:06:27.640> as<00:06:27.970> you<00:06:28.570> see<00:06:28.810> this

still getting your home as you see this

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.840 
still getting your home as you see this
is<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:29.800> home<00:06:29.950> I'm<00:06:30.190> pressing<00:06:30.580> the<00:06:30.670> home<00:06:30.820> button

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
is the home I'm pressing the home button

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.450 
is the home I'm pressing the home button
and<00:06:31.510> you<00:06:32.230> just<00:06:32.470> get<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.770> list<00:06:32.980> of<00:06:33.130> books<00:06:33.370> you

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.100 
and you just get the list of books you
have<00:06:33.670> so<00:06:34.030> nothing<00:06:34.900> must<00:06:35.110> just<00:06:35.260> change<00:06:35.560> there<00:06:36.000> I

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
have so nothing must just change there I

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.680 
have so nothing must just change there I
guess<00:06:38.110> yeah<00:06:39.010> it<00:06:39.250> doesn't<00:06:39.700> look<00:06:39.880> I<00:06:40.030> would<00:06:40.600> have

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
guess yeah it doesn't look I would have

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.710 
guess yeah it doesn't look I would have
liked<00:06:40.810> to<00:06:40.840> see<00:06:41.140> the<00:06:41.460> books<00:06:42.460> kind<00:06:43.390> of<00:06:43.450> like<00:06:43.570> on<00:06:43.690> a
