as<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> daily<00:01:16.470> activity<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.460> going

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
as a daily activity because it's going

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just too much and the repetitive nature

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.030 
just too much and the repetitive nature
of<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.470> funny<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> ironic

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
of it now that's that's funny and ironic

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.160 
of it now that's that's funny and ironic
considering<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> whole<00:01:24.240> series

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
considering that we have a whole series

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.770 
considering that we have a whole series

intelligently training less getting

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.380 
intelligently training less getting
better<00:01:34.140> results<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.740> 1/3<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.220> time<00:01:35.549> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
better results in about 1/3 the time so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.539 
better results in about 1/3 the time so

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.090 
single day as far as I'm concerned is
stretching<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.020> walking<00:01:43.530> those<00:01:43.829> should<00:01:44.040> be

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
stretching and walking those should be

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.340 
stretching and walking those should be
your<00:01:44.250> basic<00:01:44.729> daily<00:01:44.880> activities<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.630> you're<00:01:46.200> in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
your basic daily activities if you're in

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.899 
your basic daily activities if you're in
strength<00:01:46.590> training<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
strength training then you can do that a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.609 
strength training then you can do that a
couple<00:01:48.000> times<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.479> week<00:01:48.509> anything<00:01:49.229> every

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
couple times a week anything every

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.960 
couple times a week anything every
single<00:01:49.890> day<00:01:50.009> probably<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> best<00:01:50.729> idea

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
single day probably not the best idea

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.810 
single day probably not the best idea
especially<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.990> running<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.640> want

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
especially with running so if you want

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.209 
especially with running so if you want
to<00:01:53.909> lose<00:01:54.030> weight<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> stay<00:01:55.950> fit

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
to lose weight and you want to stay fit

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.130 
to lose weight and you want to stay fit
it<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.939> boils<00:01:57.299> down<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> first<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.079> all

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
it really boils down to first of all

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.660 
it really boils down to first of all
when<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.649> comes<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> weight<00:01:59.009> loss<00:01:59.040> your<00:01:59.460> diet

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
when it comes to weight loss your diet

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.709 
when it comes to weight loss your diet
is<00:01:59.820> going<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.149> most<00:02:00.299> important<00:02:00.689> thing

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
is going to be the most important thing

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.810 
is going to be the most important thing
so<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:01.979> eating<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.280> clean<00:02:02.610> diet

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so you have to be eating a clean diet

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.530 
so you have to be eating a clean diet
that's<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.899> 70<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.710> 75<00:02:05.399> percent<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
that's like 70 to 75 percent of the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.279 
that's like 70 to 75 percent of the
equation<00:02:07.670> exercise<00:02:08.670> wise<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.929> need<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.200> be

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
equation exercise wise you need to be

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.320 
equation exercise wise you need to be
doing<00:02:10.470> basic<00:02:10.979> activity<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> daily<00:02:11.970> basis<00:02:12.300> so

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
doing basic activity on a daily basis so

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.520 
doing basic activity on a daily basis so
walking<00:02:12.870> around

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
walking around

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.440 
walking around
extra<00:02:13.770> walk<00:02:13.980> walk<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> stairs<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.300> those

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
extra walk walk the stairs do all those

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.410 
extra walk walk the stairs do all those

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
higher intensity so sprint jogs friend

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.229 
higher intensity so sprint jogs friend
jog<00:03:10.590> tap<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> set<00:03:11.100> up<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.970> think<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
jog tap a set up and I think the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.059 
jog tap a set up and I think the
combination<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> cleaning<00:03:13.350> full<00:03:13.890> body

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.370 
combination of the cleaning full body
strength<00:03:14.340> training<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:15.690> minimal<00:03:16.200> type

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
strength training and that minimal type

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.470 
strength training and that minimal type
of<00:03:16.500> interval<00:03:16.709> training<00:03:16.769> is<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.610> key<00:03:17.850> to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
of interval training is the key to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.380 
of interval training is the key to
losing<00:03:18.660> weight<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.140> staying<00:03:19.530> fit<00:03:20.209> but<00:03:21.209> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
losing weight and staying fit but the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.470 
losing weight and staying fit but the
most<00:03:21.540> important<00:03:21.959> thing<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.140> consider<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:23.480> do

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
most important thing to consider is do

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.090 
most important thing to consider is do
what<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.690> love<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:25.320> I'm<00:03:25.500> outdoors<00:03:25.890> right
