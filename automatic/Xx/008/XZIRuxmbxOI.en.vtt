00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.929
 Some believe it is about the protection of the civilian population and we are stuck 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.220
 Resolutely, the Libyan population must be protected, others believe that 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.189
 RTL for the very reason 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.500
 the only reason to keep in Libya often is that the animal is dead 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.750
 Do you think we would be in the zoo today in the house exporting fall broccoli 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.509
 throw 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.759
 but some are convinced that the intervention in Libya is only about 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.970
 Currency issues in particular go to Gaddafi's plans to introduce 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.840
 become the a1 unified African gold 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.220
 a possible sharing of the abundant front I think he has that 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.840
 is one of those someone in secret Florian Vogel 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.360
 You have to be as soon as you declare you go from burnout to something else six 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.320
 Women Wobmann's target of attacks on the subject were two conferences 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.070
 died in 1996 and 2000 also gets organized a lot 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.150
 everyone was interested in most of the African fabrics and loved it 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.880
 stunk Richard Becker Kellerderby did not give up in the months before the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.530
 Military intervention though he is the African and Muslim nations 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.030
 on 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.310
 to join together and implement that new currency 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.030
 Counterweight to the dollar and the euro 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.930
 the oil and other commodities would still be worldwide in the following year 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.190
 This idea is going to be the economic equilibrium worldwide 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.230
 Shake up the collection in Berlin with the prosperity of a nation day and night 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.460
 the desert covenant does not act differently Lübtheen 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.290
 over 144 tons of gold are the British gold reserves, for example 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.590
 twice as extensive the population of the country conjured ten times larger 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.680
 As the usual Gaddafi should have intended his luck in the 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.130
 Misfortune or whatever else could be on the world markets 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.869
 sold and exchange and accept anything other than currency or 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.290
 whether it was possible to fly to the capital of a gold - everyone 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.130
 Step in that direction for sure 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.509
 from today does not make me hot enemy act these made the 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.320
 Future and important central banks worldwide that certainly would not be Vienna 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.590
 So John had to put forward other reasons to invest it immediately 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.209
 That would not be the first time that something like that happened in 2000 in the tester then 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.590
 This in a private is currently in the future no longer in dollars 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.959
 Minden believes that it will then become the 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.919
 Sanctions and the insertion came 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.159
 because the Americans resolutely interfered with war by all means 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.939
 to prevent stage trade all member states now cover one euro 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.929
 a golden one would have serious consequences for the world financial system 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:36.049
 but it could possibly be both the meaning and the influence of 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.469
 strengthen the African population and prevent this from happening 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.969
 some black activists are ready for anything in the US 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.180
 the US should welcome the self-determination of Africans they have the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.149
 Africans in the United States themselves are entitled to self-determination 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.270
 It would not surprise us 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.620
 in the US all companies for the free exercise of 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.230
 Self-determination to offer the woman still on her continent that 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.430
 British gold is here in secret sisters in the deep of 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.530
 Bank of England 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.569
 As with most industrialized nations, the amount of gold is not enough 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.650
 will be circulated in the case of Lübtheen and many other Gulf States 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.380
 is that otherwise a golden offset the successful countries of Africa and Africa 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.470
 of the Middle East into the situation 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.100
 We are sorry for their energy and their customers 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.810
 the price has gone up and we want to get paid some are the gold 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.870
 View the USA and the NATO allies could be quite simple 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.919
 do not allow 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.039
 there is a question
