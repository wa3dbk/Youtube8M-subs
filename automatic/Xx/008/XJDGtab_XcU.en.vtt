I<00:01:22.520> guess<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> had<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> long<00:01:24.210> time<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I guess I had this a long time in the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.170 
I guess I had this a long time in the
frictional<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.520> should<00:01:27.000> have

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
frictional I think I have should have

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.440 
frictional I think I have should have
eaten<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.630> earlier<00:01:27.990> when<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.350> succeeded<00:01:29.450> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
eaten as earlier when I succeeded so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.219 
eaten as earlier when I succeeded so
once<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.869> due<00:01:31.049> date<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.530> 15th<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:33.540> today

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
once the due date is the 15th and today

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.780 
once the due date is the 15th and today
I<00:01:34.259> think<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.240> 14<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.479> something<00:01:39.140> what<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
I think is 14 or something what so it

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.710 
I think is 14 or something what so it
must<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.909> still<00:01:42.270> at<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> good<00:01:42.780> shape

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
must be still at a good shape

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.100 
must be still at a good shape
so<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.899> finished<00:01:46.079> completed<00:01:46.799> off<00:01:46.979> them<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.020> I'm

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
so I finished completed off them so I'm

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.800 
so I finished completed off them so I'm
not<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:49.829> fresh<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.090> guess<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.570> should

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
not it's not fresh and I guess it should

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.100 
not it's not fresh and I guess it should
be<00:01:52.020> fresh
