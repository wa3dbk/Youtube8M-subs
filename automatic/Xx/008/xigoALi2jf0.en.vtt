00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.250
 or the girls welcome to the channel one 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.839
 Again, first of all, I want to ask you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.370
 speech if they hear me the voice a bit 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.790
 rare what happens that I'm sick 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.990
 and today I bring you a video that makes 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.910
 It was a little while ago 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.930
 proposed and some girls said that 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.460
 They would like you to talk about this and 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.640
 I have a brief review about water 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.210
 thermal 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.550
 first I will explain what it is 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.840
 thermal water is a liquid that is in 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.629
 the depths of the earth is water 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.360
 It is usually at high temperatures 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.390
 and it reaches the surface goes up to the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.879
 surface through large cracks 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.260
 geological during the ascent and 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.460
 as it goes up it goes picking 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.120
 different minerals that is what it gives you 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.789
 the unique feature 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.550
 this unique this type of liquid treats 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.840
 I have the sea water of abel in it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.000
 the largest size 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.470
 well as well as if it were an aerosol 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 we stop like this is going to see 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.530
 back is like that 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.420
 and I'm going to tell you what minerals have 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.420
 I'm going to read them because I do not remember them 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.600
 of memory and I will tell you what we 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.180
 will help each mineral 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.720
 we start with the chloride the chloride we 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.790
 will help regulate the bait of the face 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.810
 and to calm the irritation that we can 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.280
 have if we get a rash or 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.100
 we have a good allergic reaction 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.010
 this will not calm the irritation and the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.630
 itch 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.600
 has sulfate that help the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.610
 elasticity of the skin and has effect 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 relaxing 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.970
 this is useful when we stay over 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.000
 let's be others 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.950
 it also has fluorine that this is one of 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.440
 the most important components for me 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.960
 or those that you consider most important 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.509
 because fluorine has a one action 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.560
 Antibacterial antiseptic and 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.020
 disinfectant 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.450
 that is why as they will have been 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.900
 account is that when I maquillo 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.780
 sprayed on the brush and then I 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.959
 I apply makeup with that because the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.900
 brush with which he applied the base does not 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.620
 I praise daily or if I recorded once for 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.140
 week or so then he pulverized 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.480
 a bad water to disinfect it and not 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.069
 bring bacteria to my skin so I avoided 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.310
 will start in granites bar two 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.069
 black spots 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.630
 also it contains iron as iron 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.230
 what you are going to do is improve the conditions 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.500
 that we have on the skin has on the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.290
 copper will favor the collagen to the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.870
 melanin which is what gives the pigment of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.660
 the skin and in the keratin that is the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.840
 main component of that of the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.450
 epidermis also contains without the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.780
 What zinc is going to do is give 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.280
 and help us keep the skin hydrated 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.810
 and also has a restorative action 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.030
 that counteracts acne 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.240
 that component is also very important 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.040
 they also contain magnesium calcium that 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.130
 what they are going to help is to activate the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.060
 enzymes of the skin and finally contains 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:33.110
 sodium that sodium rises equilibrating e 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.550
 hydric of the skin and then good as 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.220
 have heard he has a lot of 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.590
 minerals 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.030
 it is good that they dare to try it 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.740
 because I think it's going to be useful for them 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.260
 heap 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.190
 Now I 'm going to talk to you a little about the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.680
 uses that I give yes 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.290
 I do not know if there are more I give these 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.980
 four and I'm going to share them with 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.180
 you the first one is to moisturize I do not know if 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.430
 it happens to them sometimes we arrive 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.849
 but we are not going to the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.379
 somewhere and it's very hot or 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.129
 we know we're going to be outdoors 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.799
 and it's very hot then maybe 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:15.799
 if we put a cream we can open 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.989
 give a quick face on all the 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.810
 people that we face face with 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.789
 fat trend then what 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.759
 they can do is use a little bit of the water 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.009
 thermal and dry it with a cloth this is going to 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.040
 help life to be hydrated but 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.350
 We will not feel heavy 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.900
 the second use that I give is for 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.000
 remove makeup stalls from 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.370
 makeup and make-up remover 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.350
 sometimes when we get very tired if 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.180
 It's late and I do not feel like doing all 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:51.420
 my night routine the make-up remover 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.870
 what are we going to retire with a wipe 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.540
 with a natural and is make-up remover and 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.449
 good eyes yes or if it has to be with 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.409
 make-up remover a little stronger 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.110
 but it gives me confidence to wash my face 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:10.740
 then what I do is go back he made a 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.279
 little thermal water and with the same cloth 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.379
 to clean me if there is a part left 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:19.529
 clean again happens to me to remove 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.330
 all all the remains that may have 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:24.409
 remained of makeup or the 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.930
 make-up remover if it is too greasy 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:32.280
 the fourth use is 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:36.450
 cool the congested ies 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:39.360
 try it and you will not regret it 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.710
 some day they burn excessively if 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.200
 they are exposed to the sun excessively 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.200
 and their skin burns 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.770
 if it is placed in the water it will give them a 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.530
 feeling of calm that ardor and going to 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.390
 help the irritation go away more 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.150
 Quick 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:03.290
 and the fourth and last use that is the most 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.760
 frequent that is to fix the makeup 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.710
 I repeat the above and I 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.900
 placed on the brush good and in addition to 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.510
 disinfect the use for me to fix 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.520
 the base if you have any way out 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.180
 some party if they want to fix even more 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.120
 the makeup after they finish they 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.750
 they give a spray of water and leave it 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.020
 dry 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.870
 this time they will not dry it with a 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.880
 cloth will let it dry alone and that 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.880
 will make you last a long time 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.620
 more time what have been done so 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.320
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.840
