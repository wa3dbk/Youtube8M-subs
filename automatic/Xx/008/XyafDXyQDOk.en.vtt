00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello everyone with you a bowl of lera and today 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.290
 I will tell you about one interesting 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.990
 tactics on the map sandy river mode 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 combat storming for the attacking side for 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.860
 start note on the map 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.279
 those positions that usually take 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.350
 attacking and defending side this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.439
 Of course, not all places to go 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.939
 but the most frequently visited positions 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.160
 allies and enemies 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 rendering them just for you 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.769
 brighter imagined the usual picture 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.660
 random combat and now in red 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.820
 have seen that part of the map which is in my 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 optimal look for fast 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.219
 destruction of enemies and painless 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.950
 victories and absolutely unpredictable this 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.140
 turns the center of the map it would seem that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.079
 It may be easier but there are some nuances 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.879
 which we will look further I will 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.370
 use a second mini card for 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.329
 to mark major milestones advancing 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.920
 our tank for greater visibility and 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.649
 first stop on our way 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.070
 this is the slope of the hill and either its foot 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.680
 approximately squared and 5 needed here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.890
 slow down to shoot at 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.830
 fast tanks that already occupied the regiment 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.140
 and drive away in order not to clearly get into the board 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.780
 Naturally, if your speed allows 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.180
 then this step can be safely omitted and 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.000
 drive forward but for slow tanks 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.880
 this action is very helpful if that one 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.620
 shines stupid then he will stay there 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.200
 without your allies well if clever 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.020
 mommy and roll back that will give you a chance 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.450
 drive to the coveted mound here at last 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.730
 we got to the second position on our 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.280
 Victory path with it can be relatively 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.300
 highlight opponents safely 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.330
 which are on the shelf 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.160
 his lodgings also sometimes go out and hand out 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.830
 hardly come to life 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.320
 turned you nose the only problem 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.940
 This of course artillery therefore stand on 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.490
 one place is categorically not 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.950
 it is recommended well after you and your 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.470
 allies deal with opponents 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.690
 near the shelf you can move and 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.240
 see who is there near the base or 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.550
 generally go to the other flank in the third 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.220
 in the final step of this tactical 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.260
 maneuver you should not change the second and third 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.720
 stages in places because when you stand 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.820
 in second position your form closes 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.280
 from opponents at first whether the seal 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.190
 high bank but if you go immediately 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.200
 on the third position then just shelves you 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.330
 can well throw a 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.720
 perhaps only a masochist and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.510
 t95 drivers and yes of course this 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.890
 tactics don't always work and I'm sure 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 that you can come up with something 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.540
 more interesting but if you are standing in 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.640
 indecision don't know where to go 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.010
 then take this advice and 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.360
 curse the author when you merge with 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.730
 a score of 15 0 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.700
 seriously, you need to put a couple more 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.560
 words on 1 step number one and the first 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.170
 linger on it is not worth it because 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.270
 if across an isthmus with square e3 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.680
 look out firefly top work out 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.530
 enemies of the first second and 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.730
 and secondly if your firefly is already shining 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.430
 first second 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.860
 are you confident in your guns and disguises then 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.200
 you can linger a bit and fill the crush 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.540
 how I did it in this fight because 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.819
 it is obvious that it is better to shoot for sous-100 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.010
 on long distances than from the hill on 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.720
 second position since angles 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.849
 vertical new little and yes 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.860
 the tower is not yet separately I would like to 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.450
 note a couple of wonderful bushes 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.200
 who settled on this 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.750
 saving slope to one of them i 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.480
 I'm coming up right now and since we 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.610
 so low enough gave course hides 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.120
 me and I will light up only after the shot 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.220
 on enemies in addition to this course is 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.500
 small lowlands so the enemies will not be able 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.390
 shoot you right and left if y 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.420
 you have enough to bear the silhouette and now I 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.280
 already on another pc su-152 drive up to 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.890
 the second best bush on this slope 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.040
 he is on the other flank near 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.470
 position number 3 is also required 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.140
 low silhouette and gelatin a good overview on 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.959
 This pt I drive a stereo therefore 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.530
 when I drove up the ledge and she earned 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.359
 the roads start to glow here 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.400
 convenient to shine for allies who 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.470
 stand behind to the same if you have 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.720
 good disguise or opponents of 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.970
 forest chambers and but you can also 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.830
 hand over it with impunity 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.169
 the moment of course still lucky that 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.760
 opponents were not only behind the mountain in 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.400
 its standard location but there were 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.139
 scattered over the hills even a knowledge 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.039
 neat artillery execute my 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.310
 aim 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:39.099
 but the most important thing is that despite the fact that I 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.440
 already released several of his logs killed 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:44.740
 enemy tank I still did not get behind 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.169
 the light is not arrogant yet I am a panther 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.050
 and although you guessed it 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.180
 timer 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.340
 the game for this fight is a thought or am I 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.470
 a little shot dedicated to his 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.379
 allies and therefore I believe that the chosen 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.379
 me the tactics of this fight justified itself 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.380
 and finally for the most patient 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.979
 I'll tell you about one 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.240
 edematous position already by 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.910
 defenders 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.100
 good it will be for the defense of the shelf if 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.560
 not a lot of allies went there 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.280
 tanks the bulk went to the first 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.320
 second she is perfect for tanks 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.900
 with armored towers and decent 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.270
 vertical orientation angles given 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.250
 example i use t-34 but worth 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.680
 note that armored towers and corners 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.710
 This is not a prerequisite if you have 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.620
 a tank with good alpha and you are ready 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.110
 lean out a little to give home again 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.430
 rolling the position is also suitable for 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.880
 I used you on Su-152 and even on 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.199
 su-100 and she's great to roll but here 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.979
 on t-34 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.510
 you can work miracles on it 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.610
 the only problem is as always 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.490
 art she can throw here 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.800
 and the fight that I show you is on 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.289
 in fact gums and one of many there 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.000
 no longer the result of you, but the most 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.250
 strange interesting fear same not 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.830
 I can not show because I played in 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.770
 him still during the last patches just 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.560
 make a video on it but at the end I 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.470
 show the results and there is truly 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.050
 strange medal unusually insult t-34 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.699
 look if you are interested here i am 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.880
 apply my last tactical move 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:29.330
 I will fall down the pit to make the enemy 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.590
 eager to make a drive spent 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.530
 lumbago ally 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.540
 but before you the outcome of the battle which ruled 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.540
 just at that position got him 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.600
 strange toss for this t34 bad 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.030
 review , after all, I knocked out of him watch 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.070
 but subscribe to the channel if you want 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.120
 see more interesting videos and 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.120
 Thanks for attention
