00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
is just the best I couldn't ask for a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.050

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so that's great and the scent I mean

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.360 
so that's great and the scent I mean
it's<00:02:15.060> basically<00:02:15.770> chestnut<00:02:16.770> include<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.250> a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
it's basically chestnut include it's a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
it's basically chestnut include it's a
nice<00:02:17.580> um<00:02:18.830> creamy<00:02:19.830> chestnut<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:21.420> very<00:02:21.930> deep

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
nice um creamy chestnut it's very deep

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.390 
nice um creamy chestnut it's very deep
and<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.489> clove<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.800> doesn't<00:02:26.099> add<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and the clove is just it doesn't add a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.100 
and the clove is just it doesn't add a
spice<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.180> adding<00:02:27.510> something<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.959> little

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
spice but it's adding something a little

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.530 
spice but it's adding something a little
extra<00:02:28.290> giving<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.040> an<00:02:29.310> extra<00:02:29.790> depth<00:02:30.090> so

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
extra giving it like an extra depth so

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.660 
extra giving it like an extra depth so
it<00:02:30.599> wouldn't<00:02:30.810> be<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:30.959> like<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> plane<00:02:31.739> because

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
it wouldn't be just like a plane because

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.640 
it wouldn't be just like a plane because
chestnuts<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.330> nice<00:02:33.480> set<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> chestnut<00:02:34.319> can<00:02:34.500> be

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
chestnuts a nice set the chestnut can be

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.160 
chestnuts a nice set the chestnut can be
I<00:02:35.510> want<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.569> say<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.019> could<00:02:37.110> be

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
I want to say it's but it could be

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.520 
I want to say it's but it could be
rather<00:02:37.610> boring<00:02:38.610> bland<00:02:39.450> at<00:02:39.720> time<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.290> i<00:02:40.319> think

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
rather boring bland at time so i think

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.890 
rather boring bland at time so i think
the<00:02:40.769> cloves<00:02:41.010> gives<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.819> kind<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.750> like

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the cloves gives it like kind of like

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.160 
the cloves gives it like kind of like
just<00:02:43.170> an<00:02:43.680> extra<00:02:44.130> layer<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.549> just<00:02:45.360> greatness<00:02:45.750> so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
just an extra layer of just greatness so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.479 
just an extra layer of just greatness so
really<00:02:46.860> like<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.420> um<00:02:48.420> i<00:02:48.480> don't<00:02:49.140> get<00:02:49.260> seedier

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489
