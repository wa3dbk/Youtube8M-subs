00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
afraid of taking initiative because you

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.319 
afraid of taking initiative because you
more<00:03:41.190> concerned<00:03:41.489> on<00:03:41.580> what<00:03:41.730> people<00:03:41.880> say<00:03:42.150> watch

more concerned on what people say watch

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.910 
more concerned on what people say watch
but<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.959> president<00:03:43.440> showed<00:03:43.650> me<00:03:43.799> that

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
but the the president showed me that

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.530 
but the the president showed me that
despite<00:03:44.549> whatever<00:03:44.970> you're<00:03:45.299> going<00:03:45.420> through

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
despite whatever you're going through

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.300 
despite whatever you're going through
despite<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.140> not<00:03:46.290> having<00:03:46.470> money<00:03:46.680> despite<00:03:46.950> not

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
despite to not having money despite not

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.009 
despite to not having money despite not
having<00:03:47.340> indication<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:48.600> go<00:03:48.959> out

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
having indication that you can so go out

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.840 
having indication that you can so go out
there<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.500> make<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.950> difference<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.519> your<00:03:50.549> life

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
there and make a difference in your life

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.890 
there and make a difference in your life
and<00:03:50.970> make<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> difference<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.630> other<00:03:51.810> people's

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
and make a difference in other people's

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.229 
and make a difference in other people's
so<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.470> think<00:03:52.769> they<00:03:53.160> are<00:03:53.190> going<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.609> take<00:03:53.880> away

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
so I think they are going to take away

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.599 
so I think they are going to take away
today<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.350> important<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.069> get<00:03:56.250> involved
