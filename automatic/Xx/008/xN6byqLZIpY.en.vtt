00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.610
 on 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.579
 this is not a player protesting now but the evil as well 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:14.809
 Mendrina, Lea Mittmann and, above all, the students 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.490
 It is quite clear that there must be more of the pattern of the catalog people have 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:21.489
 have in the market 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.279
 I've already noticed the elementary school where I was in the class with the 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.489
 Foreigners share only in migrants share of over 50 percent where I then 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.190
 after the second or third place also Englich 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.210
 with two or three people in a class reading the auxiliary ships fluently 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.880
 Can I am just after the fourth class also dirt the gymnasium 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.490
 We also changed the percentages to the Abitur after twelve years 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.930
 just let the same stuff be more or less compressed 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.020
 Less time in a year then they have a partial class 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.270
 so to be really young this spot twelve or thirteen so act 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.490
 40-hour week 3 percent partly so it's not after ten eleven twelve 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.870
 Years ago it is said that such a construct gets blown, says Realschule gets 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.420
 a secondary school and then even the secondary school so there is no chance 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.450
 At least I never had such big problems downstairs 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.039
 in the mobilization so to speak explained to absolutely hostile to me 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.150
 Nevertheless, Claire Beyer are still on the classic side 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.479
 Role distribution in the school the students against the teacher of 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.289
 difficult position with many school directors has me already the problems 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.930
 then on strike day coming warmer to create some push students 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.490
 So that did not include the strike India with students 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.189
 Students and so now more and more understand that education is not products 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.140
 I can not be seen detached from the rest of society 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.049
 think this is going to be such a radicalization of protests here too 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:40.540
 gave as well 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.840
 and in the educational strike week the action bank robbery issue also 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.710
 Bailout not only for banks have also called for education 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.350
 should because we think it can not be that one pulls time over years 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.910
 so no he knows I learn all the stages 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.020
 Content of parties Mense hundreds of billions in Bangkok given away 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.570
 It will be right after the federal elections is really violent 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.370
 rejected the most striking difference is that is so 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.380
 such sports arena is so there and France is there then from the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.869
 protest tradition so a little further so test general strike 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.639
 had led 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.639
 but make difference every year next year 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.059
 at the educational 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.939
 around 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.439
 I want to enforce that immediately every year at least 50 billion 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.790
 Euro more done for education could hire more 100,000 teachers nationwide 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.370
 should 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.770
 Class size of percent 15 to 20 students did so a thing would 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.129
 me right now 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.209
 push through 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.599
 Germany is from the oecd countries, for example, that per country on the 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.069
 most in the least 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.549
 at least not embarrassed by keeping competitive products education away 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.619
 Being in one of the richest countries in the world would take care of that here 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:51.679
 People organize and protest against this social system 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:52.869
 the yield 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:56.639
 and to make them more profit-oriented there this year are new 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.809
 because I have to write my high school diploma it's about war 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:04.069
 my mother is also a teacher, how can that be good? 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.269
 Understand the crew that with value extremely much to work and so 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.309
 to replace the band has 800 replaced not so expensive which is also I test title
