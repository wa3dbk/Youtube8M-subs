00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.040
 from the nectar of the flowers of 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.230
 Sevillian silver runner 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.299
 bees produce a honey that neighbors 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.540
 of the region habitually use in their 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:23.230

 pestiños roses loja a set of 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.800
 homemade desserts in which honey is 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:28.800
 It becomes the main ingredient 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.410
 we're not going to be piñonate which is typical 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.820
 very old of the ronquillo a dessert 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:54.430
 divine then the flour is thrown 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.320
 then the egg goes bicarbonate 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.340
 the oil and vinegar water after 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.460
 later when you're the bun 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.589
 rich is made the syrup that bears the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.100
 honey 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.950
 cinnamon a little lemon clove 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.780
 striped sugar and holly 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.780
 first let's go with a dozen eggs 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.200
 that approximately 7 dozen 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:31.710
 piñonate a little hole is opened because 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.590
 This is the measurement of oil and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.969
 water vinegar good then 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.969
 we are already the games 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.060
 a dozen 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:58.150
 now, next 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:01.659
 it is beaten good put already is for 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.600
 put the ingredients well then 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.240
 now the empty shell is 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.259
 It is the measure of 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.259
 of the oil 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.160
 one 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.160
 and another that are 23 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.310
 4 we have finished with the oil and now 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.540
 we are going to take you we take 2 mobile a 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.540
 little bit of life 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.130
 and now we're going to take it equally from 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.130
 vinegar water 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.330
 two 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.720
 and 4 this is the measure that takes 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.240
 of oil and vinegar water now you will 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.140
 take a teaspoon 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.140
 of bicarbonate 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.319
 now we throw the flour 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.730
 the carnit of bach walk to all that 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.189
 go putting until some 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.099
 mass then it takes approximately two 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.099
 kilos and now let's knead it 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.460
 it has to be very good to move up 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.420
 that does not stick in the hands 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.420
 in points 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.530
 to make it very rich 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.269
 so that the dough is warm and now 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.209
 we are going to put it up there is the 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.069
 candela so that the dough is warm 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.760
 while the oil is heated and 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.760
 do jericho then 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.950
 we go to oil this needs to have 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.950
 oil 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.550
 and now the valley is made 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.920
 this is nothing more than to spend it in the 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.880
 blood 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.530
 well let's take ico and we 're going to 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.530
 throw it in the oil 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.900
 and something I know and a little bit of that 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:36.130
 Golden age and once it is golden 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.130
 we turn it around 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.110
 we're going to make it great 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.579
 wonderfully 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.740
 let's see the syrup that is thrown 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.990
 I go erico from the pinion of honey 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.630
 the lemon 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.009
 a little nail one of poquita 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.020
 cinnamon 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.960
 sugar 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.590
 and the ajolí is when it's done 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.460
 good for the same ones that put the arts 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:18.370
 from Peru like honey and this has been done 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.370
 it's about a pound and a half of honey 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.160
 now a little lemon scrape from 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.500
 lemon 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.500
 a little cinnamon 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.509
 we have not done all 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.630
 now a little nail 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:53.179
 and now when I 'm in syrup cooking 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.550
 One half is tested on a plate with 

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:58.530
 Water 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.530
 to make the candy point 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.180
 it's worth like this now because this is for 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.340
 make the syrup test now you're 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.340
 like that and it got a little 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.360
 and it is checked whether it was to be able the 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.620
 chaya the angry ones that I think is 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.110
 because they look 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.169
 it sounds this is the skin and all the 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.820
 ingredients that we have thrown 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:26.940
 this is the same as the candy 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.940
 now we throw a little syrup 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.590
 it has to be warm as it is 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:38.940
 right now because if not the basis of 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.940
 cools and curdles 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.000
 I go 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.100
 now so mars 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.000
 you have to wet your hands and this is already 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.520
 we put 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.639
 is going to be preparing it to cool 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.300
 to be able to 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.300
 short 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:14.550
 it's over after squeezing you're 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.550
 add sesame 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:28.700
 this is ready 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.700
 so now I'm going to cut it 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.650
 the dessert is over 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.650
 ready to serve 

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:50.879
