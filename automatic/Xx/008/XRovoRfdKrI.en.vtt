00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.440
 hello everyone today I'm going to 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.120
 show a pretty useful tic that I just 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.799
 to find in this type this is going to 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.140
 allow to enter our applications 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.820
 favorites from the pre box of this 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.080
 way we will be able to enter 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.150
 the application that we want 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.130
 logically skipping the code of 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.900
 security and good as you can 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.580
 see I have the applications down here 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.950
 they are quite similar to the application 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.239
 of camera that comes by default and I what 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.620
 only thing I would have to do would be 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.450
 select one in this case I'm going to 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.250
 select facebook and slide it towards 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.840
 up and as you can see here enter the 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.390
 application of paper that is the application 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.220
 that I have as Facebook and it would work 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.930
 perfectly if I pressured him the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.550
 home button what will happen is that 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.980
 I will return to him what I write 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.840
 to be able to put my password so I do not 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.790
 enter your device only enters 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.770
 to your favorite application in the same way 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.880
 I could do it with phone as 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.309
 you can see today I am in the 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.980
 phone and there are my calls and everything 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.260
 I could dial but I could also 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.239
 get out without any problem and to 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.619
 we see the configurations of this 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.259
 tweet the only thing we have to do is 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.969
 go adjustments once in settings 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.530
 we will go to the section clicks 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.330
 here we have the click 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.010
 and the only thing that I have modified are 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.799
 how many icons can I have in the part 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.210
 below in this case put 6 after 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.220
 we are going to get the option of 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.380
 configure the icons for example here 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.540
 we can see here when we want to go in 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.159
 this case has put the camera but I 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.050
 here in user applications could 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.030
 place anyone could be better or 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.070
 favorite whatever I could place the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.259
 application that I would like also I have 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.270
 the option to modify the image here 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.860
 there are different icons in this case I 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.840
 I always leave it to the one who comes by 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.790
 defect and here we have the option of 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.229
 put him if you want if we want us 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.090
 ask for code when opening the 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.800
 application I have removed it in all 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.690
 but logically we can put it in the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.039
 that we want and good now 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.140
