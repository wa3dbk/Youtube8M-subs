00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.859
 history out here impeccable the street of 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.900
 the whole sequence nothing but here the 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.790
 luxury camera police who is in 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.130
 this time you did not feel intimidated 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.760
 nothing but me but but obviously 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.890
 I felt that there was an atmosphere of that thing 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.020
 rare will you comment me decided to ask 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.150
 another and fato told you that there was something 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.310
 interesting clear because there was an excess 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.100
 of formality but clearly I was 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.030
 outside the scope of police function the 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.789
 what I was doing was like a 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.970
 invitation I'm going this was on the other side 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.500
 of the square true this the serene and the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.710
 capital was presented to very kind person 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.600
 and dispatched to the porfolio liza 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.790
 bahienses sir doing that studying 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.230

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.820
 friend I want to tell you that in my house 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.210
 we follow very closely the consult 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.710
 comments very interesting and the mind to 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.660
 call I hope you do not bother telling me 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.000
 because I want to tell later what happened to me 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.980
 obviously in the year 98 is some years 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.980
 when I had another position here 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.960
 and the thing is like that and he told me if he wants 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 you can investigate it I asked in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.500
 language would be language entered so they have it 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.350
 very clear this case the paihuano he 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 llama said hey he just dropped something from the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.259
 sky has to be cordoned off because it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.240
 began to gather people who are the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.700
 witnesses that of the few notifications 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.950
 we have what they saw and he says 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.570
 that comes to cordon and they were already 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.890
 some military were very few 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 I'm going to find that people tell him 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.040
 already make a fence start to put 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.869
 let's say these cords see people not 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.030
 is to do that ideally says that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.560
 begin to arrive by helicopter which 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.350
 we are seeing in the previous photograph 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.180
 and suddenly it comes and they align it to everything 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.710
 and to those who are military who are 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.159
 of chile who are create money and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.249
 there was this capital in question 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.159
 I have seen there is not one bright thing that 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:52.530
 an object fell and everything else ok 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.200
 this is the truth nice this is a piece 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.149
 of airplane let's say an accident fell not 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.409
 there are wounded there were no deaths so for 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.439
 make the recovery of these objects 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 you are going to help me review me 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.970
 said part fell off an area of the car 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.819
 perfect and no matter what happens see what 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.459
 see that was what happened has understood 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.099
 understood what they carry is this piece that 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.519
 was the house card go on the other 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.160
 loma and says that ve says it 's like an egg 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.420
 says not complete and flying vicens and that 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.650
 just as an egg is shaped by an egg a 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.930
 little bit wider on one side a little bit 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.019
 more mongoose to the other with that shape and with 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.569
 that round with that volume had a 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.299
 hole somewhere and they already had in 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.099
 the people or the creatures that were 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.590
 in the plane taken out of that changing 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.109
 and he went with another colleague in charge of 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.390
 take one out then come take them 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.940
 they were covered and no more samples was 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.380
 dead and come 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.819
 since you already told them already 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.760
 the truth that you have to say 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.220
 perfectly supportive to count to 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.680
 his grandchildren and says he was what 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.310
 they are giving as well as laying the foundations 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.600
 to tell you the following 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.130
 says he writes it as a child but 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.500
 after reading and it was understood that 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.800
 could be that size a creature of a 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.050
 color as well as white is that 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.880
 usually he tried a target 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.650
 pale as well as mixed with it or with 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.970
 medium gray or without being gray like 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.530
 clearly it describes the 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.150
 convergence to exactly have the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.340
 closed eyelids and very large eyes 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.780
 big headed with a tight diver with a 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.630
 belt with some monkeys with some 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.490
 symbols and that what they do know there 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.290
 had like a ccoo bar said 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.030
 want they did not reach 5 of them but 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.920
 that as I say tight he would say 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.540
 3 , but they seemed to think they were more so 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.320
 they had like a little face as well as 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.050
 girl and it takes them is already up and I 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.750
 I am my son, please, I ask him 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.130
 I did not cite me I will not deny though 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.290
 people here know that I know about this 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.410
 I just wanted to share with you 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.950
 because I have no doubt because I saw this 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.790
 shipping live after 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.610
 exactly because then and here it comes 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.980
 the number of them or spend a week of 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.900
 back in santiago I had not spoken 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.110
 this no part of fact I commented 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.110
 this 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.140
 structuring and I was already involved in 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.090
 these issues and it comes from a fleet of 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.300
 radiotaxis is taking me on a trip 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.400
 long because I was going out of Santiago and 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.110
 did as well as base or salfate if as 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.420
 typical as it is today that now things 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.630
 that speaks and comes and suddenly without 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.600
 permission is going to take a vote of 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.520
 GDL confidence and a little because no 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.040
 I want to know what stopped the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.250
 gangster went away goes to the side and stopped 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.770
 comes later to look and it takes me out like this 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.130
 how in life this was me before I am 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.840
 retired for health reasons 83 was a 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.580
 military yes he had a meeting or that 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.190
 I do not know if it is higher than the 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.460
 Colonel milestone in what I confess as being 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.900
 it blocks a man of 50 years wrong 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.240
 so he said look, I'm a soldier and 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.570
 he managed to say it's true for suicide 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.570
 sorry
