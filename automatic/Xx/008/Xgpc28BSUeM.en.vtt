obviously not conceding the gold is the

obviously not conceding the gold is the
big<00:00:03.029> factor<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.449> me<00:00:03.480> when<00:00:04.230> you're<00:00:04.350> playing<00:00:04.470> at

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
big factor to me when you're playing at

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.900 
big factor to me when you're playing at
home<00:00:04.680> before<00:00:04.890> state<00:00:05.250> important<00:00:05.640> him<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.820> that

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
home before state important him is that

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.670 
home before state important him is that
you<00:00:06.000> don't<00:00:06.120> consider<00:00:06.330> giving<00:00:07.259> ourselves<00:00:07.380> a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
you don't consider giving ourselves a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.770 
you don't consider giving ourselves a
good<00:00:07.830> chance<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.850> think<00:00:09.300> people<00:00:09.450> seem<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
good chance and I think people seem to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.930 
good chance and I think people seem to
meet<00:00:09.990> dr.<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> decent<00:00:10.769> enough<00:00:10.890> so<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.220> and<00:00:11.370> it

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
meet dr. a decent enough so it and it

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.520 
meet dr. a decent enough so it and it
causes<00:00:12.150> problems<00:00:12.630> early<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.080> forest<00:00:13.349> half

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
causes problems early on the forest half

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.230 
causes problems early on the forest half
so<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.950> boy<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.429> think<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.730> fitness<00:00:14.940> levels

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
so and boy I think of fitness levels

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.700 
so and boy I think of fitness levels
told<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.540> meet<00:00:15.660> early<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> game<00:00:16.410> which

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
told to meet early on in the game which

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.409 
told to meet early on in the game which
in<00:00:16.919> fairness<00:00:17.159> to<00:00:17.279> them<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:17.909> thought<00:00:18.239> would

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:18.419 
in fairness to them we thought would

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:19.939 
in fairness to them we thought would
because<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:18.720> haven't<00:00:19.079> started<00:00:19.439> by<00:00:19.679> playing

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
because they haven't started by playing

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.309 
because they haven't started by playing
a<00:00:20.069> switch<00:00:20.249> but<00:00:21.060> will<00:00:21.239> kneel<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.539> important<00:00:21.960> now

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:22.319 
a switch but will kneel is important now

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.839 
a switch but will kneel is important now
got<00:00:22.529> no<00:00:22.679> way<00:00:22.829> gold<00:00:23.099> so<00:00:23.339> it<00:00:23.399> gives<00:00:23.519> us<00:00:23.669> a<00:00:23.699> good

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
got no way gold so it gives us a good

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.009 
got no way gold so it gives us a good
chance<00:00:24.089> and<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.329> fancy<00:00:24.599> your<00:00:24.689> chances<00:00:24.720> of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
chance and we fancy your chances of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.229 
chance and we fancy your chances of
getting<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.699> getting<00:00:26.699> chances<00:00:27.089> over

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
getting you know getting chances over

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.059 
getting you know getting chances over
there<00:00:27.419> and<00:00:27.539> maybe<00:00:27.630> nicking<00:00:27.960> ago<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.859> was

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:29.069 
there and maybe nicking ago this was

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.290 
there and maybe nicking ago this was
going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.249> say<00:00:29.399> we<00:00:29.550> had<00:00:29.669> to<00:00:29.699> put<00:00:29.880> few<00:00:30.059> chances

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
going to say we had to put few chances

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.030 
going to say we had to put few chances
so<00:00:30.689> during<00:00:31.019> start<00:00:31.259> hoped<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.619> would<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.919> better

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
so during start hoped I would be better

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.770 
so during start hoped I would be better
if<00:00:32.579> let's<00:00:32.940> say<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.240> didn't<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.540> any<00:00:33.660> more

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
if let's say they didn't get any more

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.270 
if let's say they didn't get any more
better<00:00:33.960> yeah<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.740> important<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
better yeah I think the important is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220 
better yeah I think the important is
that<00:00:35.310> you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.880> go<00:00:36.120> down<00:00:36.300> tremec<00:00:36.780> ago<00:00:36.960> it's

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that you know we go down tremec ago it's

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.470 
that you know we go down tremec ago it's
about<00:00:37.350> his<00:00:37.560> employment<00:00:37.860> then<00:00:38.270> but<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.390> gives

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
about his employment then but it gives

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.910

you<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> platform<00:00:40.080> on<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.380> nail<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.680> be<00:00:40.770> able

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
you the platform on one nail to be able

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.900 
you the platform on one nail to be able
