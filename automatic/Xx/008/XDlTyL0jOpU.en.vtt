00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.799 
working the river so this appears to be
some<00:00:39.510> granular<00:00:40.140> tissue<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.809> appears

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
some granular tissue right here appears

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.029 
some granular tissue right here appears
to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.200> some<00:00:43.440> glandular<00:00:43.860> tissue<00:00:44.160> right<00:00:44.520> here

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
to be some glandular tissue right here

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.750 
to be some glandular tissue right here
but<00:00:47.039> i<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.520> there<00:00:47.820> i<00:00:49.129> suspect<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.460> lot<00:00:50.610> of

need<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.699> lot<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.910> autologous<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:54.989> very

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
need a lot of autologous I'm not very

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.549 
need a lot of autologous I'm not very
20s<00:00:56.160> because<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.239> don't<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.629> an<00:00:57.809> ass<00:00:58.170> tonight

because<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.000> glandular<00:01:00.449> tissue

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
because in this glandular tissue

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.860 
because in this glandular tissue
disorder<00:01:01.260> sarah<00:01:01.710> meters<00:01:02.129> ground<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.420> i<00:01:03.449> think

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
disorder sarah meters ground but i think

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.070 
disorder sarah meters ground but i think
what<00:01:04.019> has<00:01:04.170> happened<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
would need to see so you can have those

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.600 
would need to see so you can have those
in<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.640> maybe<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.820> this

in on this maybe on this
food<00:01:49.060> dad<00:01:49.270> knows<00:01:49.660> it's<00:01:49.930> dry<00:01:50.200> but<00:01:50.230> I<00:01:50.740> thinking

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
food dad knows it's dry but I thinking

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.430 
food dad knows it's dry but I thinking
of<00:01:51.520> their<00:01:51.730> people<00:01:53.340> its<00:01:54.340> own<00:01:54.670> fear<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.440> bit

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
of their people its own fear a bit

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.230 
of their people its own fear a bit
unfair<00:01:57.300> disorder<00:01:58.300> how<00:01:59.140> this<00:02:00.150> because<00:02:01.150> you

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
unfair disorder how this because you

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.120 
unfair disorder how this because you
really<00:02:01.540> need<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.780> see<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.200> central<00:02:02.680> for<00:02:02.980> our

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
really need to see the central for our

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.490 
really need to see the central for our
skeletal<00:02:03.700> muscle<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:04.900> also<00:02:05.110> need<00:02:05.470> to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
skeletal muscle and you also need to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.590 
skeletal muscle and you also need to
have<00:02:05.620> a<00:02:05.710> glandular<00:02:06.070> tissue<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:07.180> what<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.360> think

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
have a glandular tissue so what I think

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.780 
have a glandular tissue so what I think
is<00:02:07.750> happened<00:02:08.140> here<00:02:08.350> possibly<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.670> a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
is happened here possibly is that a

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.520 
is happened here possibly is that a
glandular<00:02:10.030> tissue<00:02:10.450> may<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:10.810> undergone

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
glandular tissue may have undergone

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.730 
glandular tissue may have undergone
optimises<00:02:12.400> okay<00:02:13.180> because<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.290> globular

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
optimises okay because the globular

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.970 
optimises okay because the globular
tissue<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.160> water<00:02:15.520> light<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.150> very<00:02:16.390> quickly<00:02:16.980> so

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
tissue of water light is very quickly so

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.430 
tissue of water light is very quickly so
this<00:02:18.820> could<00:02:19.090> possibly<00:02:19.330> have<00:02:19.930> been<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.350> a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
this could possibly have been in a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.620 
this could possibly have been in a
better<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:21.490> important<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.060> better<00:02:22.240> speaker

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
better it's important a better speaker

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.110 
better it's important a better speaker
preservation<00:02:23.560> that's<00:02:24.130> what<00:02:24.280> other<00:02:24.550> side<00:02:24.820> over
