00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.850
 just instruction in Russian 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.560
 inclusive soon for the first time 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:31.580
 granulated plans here had 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.580
 the complete set of the feeder is present 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.010
 finger-type battery 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:47.750
 two types of attachment we body itself 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:58.469
 feeders that allows cloud faith 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:01:05.210
 put up 6 chips 66 pro six-chips 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:10.770
 feeding day people walk with two 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 on the side of the case is the entrance to the hose 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.560
 from compressor to purge and in 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:22.220
 avoid accumulation of moisture in the housing and in 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.750
 further fluctuations if this 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.720
 appetizing fed and even formulated 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.650
 have a compressor should 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.479
 minimize this accumulation process 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.950
 own top 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.680
 By the way, it also finds how to say a button 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.960
 for forced feeding ie 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.240
 twisting it 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:52.470
 the feeder will feed right into the data 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.850
 further by type of attachment means there is 1 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:02.119
 wall mount 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:06.960
 Aquarium insert it into the bottom of the body and 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:10.350
 on on the side 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:16.650
 with whom on a press the second option too 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.270
 mounted in the same hole but this 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.620
 of character 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.959
 This disc is double-sided tape 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.590
 which is attached glued aquarium lid 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.700
 in the same way 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:38.390
 connecting the feeder in this position 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:46.190
 we fix on the root of what else 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:53.370
 we expose the compartments for feed 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:55.950
 feed quantity 1 1 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.959
 cranking the feeder you have enough 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:05.810
 highlighting two three three 4 5 six 7 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:10.140
 everyone doesnâ€™t want 8 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:15.120
 all that will be enough either 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:19.650
 no 8 went on for some reason 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.560
 I jam in principle if you do not 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.019
 excessive amount of fish then i think 3 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.660
 or 4 h 3 or 4 divisions 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:33.079
 will be the most you at least the most 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.590
 popular spices add in principle 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.140
 main already 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:43.380
 we listed personally I like it better 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:49.380
 bond under double-sided tape so 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:53.340
 as if the aquarium is not an open top 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.680
 then mounting on board would mean that 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:01.440
 you will either have the lid assembled or 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.109
 will have if you have two parts 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.920
 nakida haircut you set the task here 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.780
 remove the letter does not quite fit and yourself 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.320
 more universal option on 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.420
 double sided tape after it was secured 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.959
 have established 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.180
 and use thank you for your attention you 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.220
 watched a video review 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.220
