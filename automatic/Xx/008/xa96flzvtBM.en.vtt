00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
for a second felt the need to pull it

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.349 
for a second felt the need to pull it
aside<00:04:05.040> because<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.670> come<00:04:05.849> in<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.060> way<00:04:06.180> of

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
aside because it's come in the way of

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.520 
aside because it's come in the way of
anything<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:06.870> I've<00:04:07.139> done<00:04:08.750> it's<00:04:09.750> kind<00:04:10.470> of

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
anything that I've done it's kind of

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.500 
anything that I've done it's kind of
like<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.739> clutch<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.579> woman<00:04:11.910> carries<00:04:12.329> it's

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
like a clutch that a woman carries it's

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.539

that's extremely light if you want to
see<00:04:19.590> very<00:04:20.519> very<00:04:20.609> easy<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.060> carry<00:04:21.239> around<00:04:21.359> okay

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
see very very easy to carry around okay

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.350 
see very very easy to carry around okay
now<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.560> know<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.979> part<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.700> love<00:04:24.000> about

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
something which is almost a cross

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.650 
something which is almost a cross
between<00:04:26.849> a<00:04:27.060> phone<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.510> it

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
between a phone and it

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.150 
between a phone and it
which<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.170> you<00:04:28.350> know<00:04:28.440> exactly<00:04:28.590> where<00:04:29.010> this

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
which is you know exactly where this

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.250 
which is you know exactly where this
fits<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.640> it<00:04:29.730> takes<00:04:29.940> over<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.540> that<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.930> lot<00:04:31.140> of

people<00:04:31.530> have<00:04:31.620> started<00:04:31.980> now<00:04:32.130> questioning<00:04:32.670> the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
people have started now questioning the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.070 
people have started now questioning the
idea<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.270> if<00:04:33.420> you<00:04:33.510> have<00:04:33.630> something<00:04:33.870> like

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
idea that if you have something like

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.170 
idea that if you have something like
this<00:04:34.470> with<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> screen<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.670> kind<00:04:36.030> of

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
this with a screen of this kind of

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.030 
this with a screen of this kind of
technology<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.990> hardware<00:04:37.470> inside<00:04:37.830> the

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
technology the hardware inside the

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.380 
technology the hardware inside the
feature<00:04:38.250> sets<00:04:38.580> everything<00:04:39.000> else<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.240> they

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
feature sets everything else that they

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
because that's the big controversy today

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.090 
because that's the big controversy today
our<00:05:05.940> tablets<00:05:06.570> about<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:07.110> die<00:05:07.320> because<00:05:07.590> phones

our tablets about to die because phones

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.240 
our tablets about to die because phones
of<00:05:08.400> this<00:05:08.610> size<00:05:08.850> or<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:10.110> know<00:05:10.200> HP<00:05:10.800> doesn't<00:05:11.040> like

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
of this size or you know HP doesn't like

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.250 
of this size or you know HP doesn't like
calling<00:05:11.700> it<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.880> phone<00:05:12.090> a<00:05:12.120> voice<00:05:12.480> tab<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:13.050> this

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
calling it a phone a voice tab of this

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.560 
calling it a phone a voice tab of this
size<00:05:13.500> would<00:05:14.070> easily<00:05:14.370> replace<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.120> tablet<00:05:15.450> so

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
size would easily replace the tablet so

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.180 
size would easily replace the tablet so
do<00:05:15.630> you<00:05:15.720> even<00:05:15.900> need<00:05:16.290> two<00:05:16.680> things

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
do you even need two things

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.700 
do you even need two things
I<00:05:17.280> think<00:05:17.490> it'll<00:05:17.730> depend<00:05:17.910> on<00:05:18.620> C<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.650> think

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
I think it'll depend on C I think

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.980 
I think it'll depend on C I think
technology<00:05:20.160> itself<00:05:20.820> is<00:05:21.060> such<00:05:21.480> a<00:05:21.510> thing<00:05:21.810> that's

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
technology itself is such a thing that's

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.900 
technology itself is such a thing that's
constantly<00:05:22.620> changing<00:05:23.100> every<00:05:23.340> six<00:05:23.580> months

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
constantly changing every six months

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.760 
constantly changing every six months
every<00:05:24.150> one<00:05:24.330> year<00:05:24.570> there's<00:05:24.810> there's<00:05:25.140> new

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
every one year there's there's new

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.310 
every one year there's there's new
things<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:26.280> keep<00:05:26.460> coming<00:05:26.820> up<00:05:26.940> as<00:05:27.780> of<00:05:28.050> today

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
things that keep coming up as of today

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.810 
things that keep coming up as of today
definitely<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.980> think<00:05:29.070> this<00:05:29.340> is<00:05:29.460> something

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
definitely I think this is something

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.540 
definitely I think this is something
that's<00:05:30.000> that's<00:05:30.870> very<00:05:30.990> very<00:05:31.440> handy<00:05:32.010> very<00:05:32.040> very

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
that's that's very very handy very very

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.600 
that's that's very very handy very very
useful<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.470> of<00:05:34.470> course<00:05:34.740> I<00:05:34.890> think<00:05:35.100> in<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.400> kind

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
useful and of course I think in the kind

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.460 
useful and of course I think in the kind
of<00:05:35.760> times<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:36.210> we<00:05:36.330> live<00:05:36.480> in<00:05:36.540> now<00:05:36.690> you're

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
of times that we live in now you're

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.440 
of times that we live in now you're
trying<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.860> sort<00:05:38.070> of<00:05:38.130> combine<00:05:38.580> everything<00:05:39.300> and

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
trying to sort of combine everything and

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.720 
trying to sort of combine everything and
have<00:05:39.630> just<00:05:40.140> one<00:05:40.290> thing<00:05:41.010> that<00:05:41.190> you<00:05:41.310> can<00:05:41.490> carry

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
have just one thing that you can carry

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.080 
have just one thing that you can carry
around<00:05:41.910> versus<00:05:42.450> having<00:05:42.750> multiple<00:05:43.560> devices<00:05:44.090> so

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
around versus having multiple devices so

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.420 
around versus having multiple devices so
I<00:05:45.150> guess<00:05:45.570> if<00:05:45.720> it<00:05:45.810> serves<00:05:46.110> someone's<00:05:46.860> purpose<00:05:47.280> I

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
I guess if it serves someone's purpose I

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.550 
I guess if it serves someone's purpose I
think<00:05:47.460> it's<00:05:47.790> definitely<00:05:48.450> your<00:05:49.020> your<00:05:49.350> go-to

think it's definitely your your go-to
device

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040
