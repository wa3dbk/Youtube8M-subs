00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 U 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.500
 But let's take a look at the 72-page 5-degree Lipton . 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.939
 Ahodoriton 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:24.710
 Because we raise a much higher note than the Octave Faldo, 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:29.600
 I need a lot of fastenings and I practice exercises to get the correct learning through my neck . 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.769
 So you can play a lot later when you play 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.129
 Helpful 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:39.380
 But be aware that it's the hardest thing to do. 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:42.230
 Oh bother andoesimyeon the front and positive than that does not cling good practice 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.489
 It you go back exercises are very helpful. 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.649
 What if you'll train tone or octave Tony practiced in some whole process automatic lip 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.969
 Tone Must Not Be Practiced 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.579
 Since you can not practice at all, be sure to master the previous course 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.640
 It's a good idea to cross over to Odori Tons. 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.899
 As shown on page 73 of the manual , 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.970
 Figure pronounce table doeguyo held a prayer eohwa peg 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:12.049
 Wu lifting the tongue to give it another narrow the airway o much narrowed in 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:18.650
 It makes me squeeze from the state and makes me more pressure . 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:22.400
 When we turn on the faucet and send the water of the lake far away, 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:26.900
 It's the same as leaving out, but because of the increased pressure, 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:31.939
 If you do not grab exactly like being in the Lake neck faucet 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.930
 Because the effect appears, please be sure to tighten your neck enough to give strength 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.159
 good 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:43.820
 So the 5th round is bplet fb place. 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.890
 So take a low b flat on the broke and hold the two octaves and hold it back two octaves 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.920
 c Hold the flat 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.310
 You're practicing playing one key. 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.840
 B at the bottom and after the minute 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.229
 With that b-flat key, I pulled the Octave Apple with my throat 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.040
 E again to play the rooftop 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.450
 With the sound quality fixed and the neck pressure to the floor without moving the thumb 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.130
 Sound is raised 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.030
 If you look at it so much higher than Octabuton , 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.120
 Join 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.879
 Oh, it's a chance to tighten it. 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.709
 For those who are not very good , hold the two-octave arm and make it sound, 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:26.470
 In the state of keeping 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:31.069
 b Hold the flat key and if you keep trying to make that f sound 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.650
 Keep up the Plectranthus Tiemann will be also be able to hear two more 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:41.280
 b if the exercises went up by a semitone flat 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:43.500
 Mr. Asshi Fasshi and I can go up to Sol Soo even if I climb another semis. 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.720
 Practice enough to the point where it is. 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:54.750
 Oh , if you go up to about two or three and practice it, 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:57.359
 You do not have to practice enough to see the throat tighten your mouth and bite 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.750
 I believe you can control your power. 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.750
 Repeat enough to make sure you master yourself
