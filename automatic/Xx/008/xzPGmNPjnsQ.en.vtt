00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.569
 with the boys of Uderzo of the Bund de 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.699
 and here too are going out - 14 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.039
 only 15 clock 1 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.630
 Demnig already during the Asus Herbst press conference in Munich 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.259
 a counter opinion could 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.880
 a link to the video IT and Nils appears on Sisson youtube-link 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.859
 finally the device is here 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.579
 this is now available in Germany 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.579
 League is set out 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 Cup 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.220
 dpa 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.089
 so first shows Amy wants the 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.720
 Bernd the card 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.649
 lb 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.850
 then immediately 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.070
 the physicist possible that he does 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.220
 Of course this is not true on the white device installed 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.570
 So a normal standard that there is nature 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.910
 so gave the court 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.810
 Flop packed 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.110
 and like us in Cologne 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.870
 10 8 6 4 3 4 around 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.790
 ability 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.620
 HW the support 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.190
 we can also use the device as medias in your living room 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.680
 use 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.000
 in Nigeria 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.050
 that guarantees 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.430
 the fluid reproduction of the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.180
 old Serbin material 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.180
 and some games can also be played 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.930
 we have stupid corp interested 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.830
 33 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.070
 he should still be out for a bit more performance than other data 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.340
 the only one goal in mind and we have the built-in 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.509
 when he dvd his words drive 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:16.289
 thus also the no external learning can the device directly sites for example the 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.289
 from BP 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.389
 yes the good piece then 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.389
 Choose and change JÃ¤ggi 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:35.049
 and who already has a plan to pigeon out at home has who 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.159
 not notice 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.969
 that the box here is a little bit thicker 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.169
 the projects had the boxing volume of 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:44.709
 one liter to the housing 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.799
 The new iBooks have her one point for Federer 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.609
 as far as I know 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.549
 So a bit thicker but synonymous with a dvd drive 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.829
 important for me 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:02.619
 with me still the whole connections of course also a few Alpiq later 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.619
 Too mild I wanted to do what is still in the box 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.369
 because of his 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.369
 was still the i 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.179
 Base plate 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.469
 that comes that Peter Liebers amount 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.469
 from ours 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.219
 there the trains 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.099
 can stand nicely 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.499
 as in the picture 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.499
 that's enough 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.039
 and here we have even more accessory box 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:41.149
 that not everyone is one 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:42.589
 Quickstart hastened 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.779
 that is very clever there are still some like aha still in early May are in 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:47.999
 the whole area 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:51.339
 that must be laughed about too 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.339
 they have that here 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.549
 Well 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.549
 looks like an infrared receiver 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:07.809
 and then it does not just look that way 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:11.099
 that's it on the a8 we're even more remote here 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.779
 So all Windows Media Center Steinert 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.949
 So really know nonsensical sitting here on the couch has the remote 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.949
 Property tax expensive multimedia 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.919
 like to be here Fink old Darmstadt 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.919
 and the associated last point 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.770
 Of course it should not be missing 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.730
 Rheine 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.730
 Stephen Myers 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.259
 I want 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.520
 Klose the surface 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.520
 white and west like east 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.189
 Bons for trucks not 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:04.309
 to the readers 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:09.080
 if he does not want to put the bosses on your new bonds 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.969
 for you with this opening of this new record 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.830
 also directly the acid lcd monitor 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.110
 turn on screws 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.389
 how it works 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.379
 but already at the box 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.120
 Target 12 shown 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.499
 but I will demonstrate it again 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.499
 that was already the complete contents of the box 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.819
 "There is nothing more in it 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.500
 Onlooker box e-bay 15 01 so first more accurate 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.719
 So too 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:42.889
 the 4th 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.770
 Einstein is 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.120
 behind the 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.879
 wireless internet antenna 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.379
 to sign up for Schnitzel 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.279
 and I have a look 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.270
 what's up front 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.219
 Let's say a little bit about that 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.330
 we definitely say so 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.089
 this will be seen more in the episode 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:05.459
 we live and connect for headphone and microphone so i'm mine 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:07.849
 Time here 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.319
 like Manuel the device 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.680
 they have to 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.770
 Jamie conveniently USB twice a card reader and for example or photos 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:20.339
 or videos from 9 and cameras too direct 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.089
 to play too 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:26.089
 here we still have a small town Susanne b 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:30.169
 missing at the counter 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.710
 the still the magpies the expression still for the Victory 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.020
 Of course, there are also some ports in the back 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.599
 to go to the first and four times USB 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:45.180
 then one in front of Gerbert for all 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.240
 the FT monitors of the CRT monitors 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.129
 not yet 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.580
 in the digital outputs 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.270
 for everyone else we have here love him 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.909
 Company again a headphone jack 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:58.990
 for example, if you are yours 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.449
 would like to connect expensive plant 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:03.949
 and as he never says 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.439
 m 

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:08.439
 and every connector for the power supply 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:14.229
 what you think you should see and hear video for 9 Andrews the box 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.309
 Abe 15 01 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:19.149
 Dulko individual actions 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.070
 because like the boy have integrated us 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.449
 so synonymous in DVD drive 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:27.850
 I will now install a few games and Prince Max 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.460
 and then we can see the overall performance with other nettops 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.939
 and compare netbooks 

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:37.319
 if you do not want to miss a video 

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:39.219
 Tom LÃ¼thi down here 

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:41.729
 Emden youtube account 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:44.990
 and then you can find the tests on military bases in
