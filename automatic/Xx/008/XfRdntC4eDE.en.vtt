name you might be able to get a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.270 
name you might be able to get a
soldering<00:02:20.080> iron<00:02:20.230> under<00:02:20.530> there<00:02:20.709> but<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.069> gotta

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
soldering iron under there but you gotta

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.880 
soldering iron under there but you gotta
be<00:02:21.370> careful<00:02:21.989> not<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.200> solder<00:02:23.560> any<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.830> the

be careful not to solder any of the
circuit<00:02:24.340> board<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:26.340> what<00:02:27.340> we're<00:02:27.489> going<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.700> do

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
circuit board so what we're going to do

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.690 
circuit board so what we're going to do
is<00:02:28.030> we're<00:02:28.900> going<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.110> do<00:02:29.230> exactly<00:02:29.700> what

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
is we're going to do exactly what

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.800 
is we're going to do exactly what
someone<00:02:30.970> else<00:02:31.120> has<00:02:31.330> done<00:02:31.450> before<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:33.690> sorry<00:02:34.690> I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
someone else has done before is sorry I

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.440 
someone else has done before is sorry I
should<00:02:35.170> mention<00:02:36.000> what<00:02:37.000> we're<00:02:37.150> going<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.330> do

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
should mention what we're going to do

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.640 
should mention what we're going to do
first<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.959> we're<00:02:38.140> going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.290> take<00:02:38.500> this

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
first is we're going to take this

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.180 
first is we're going to take this
battery<00:02:39.100> out<00:02:39.510> when<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.600> take<00:02:40.840> these<00:02:41.019> out<00:02:41.290> push

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
battery out when you take these out push

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.690 
battery out when you take these out push
them<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.580> way<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.830> flip<00:02:45.100> them<00:02:45.280> up<00:02:45.430> and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
them this way and flip them up and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.490 
them this way and flip them up and
that's<00:02:46.330> doing<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.019> way

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
that's doing it that way

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.509 
that's doing it that way
stops<00:02:48.070> breaking<00:02:48.640> off<00:02:48.760> these<00:02:49.680> these<00:02:50.680> sections

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
stops breaking off these these sections

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.500 
stops breaking off these these sections
that<00:02:51.670> hold<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.150> place

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
that hold it in place

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.990 
that hold it in place
so<00:02:53.230> do<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.650> way<00:02:53.800> let's<00:02:54.070> pretend<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.820> is

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
so do it that way let's pretend this is

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.820 
so do it that way let's pretend this is
a<00:02:55.030> new<00:02:55.930> battery<00:02:56.880> shove<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> battery<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.830> get

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
a new battery shove the battery in get

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.550 
a new battery shove the battery in get
yourself<00:03:00.070> a<00:03:00.160> piece<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.519> card<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.260> fold<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.440> up

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
yourself a piece of card and fold it up

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.170 
yourself a piece of card and fold it up
like<00:03:02.620> that

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
like that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.090 
like that
and<00:03:04.180> all<00:03:04.300> we're<00:03:04.450> going<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.630> do<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.440> put<00:03:05.769> that<00:03:05.800> on

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
and all we're going to do is put that on

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.820 
and all we're going to do is put that on
top<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:07.150> then<00:03:07.780> when<00:03:07.959> we<00:03:08.050> replace<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.620> cover

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
top and then when we replace the cover

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.759 
top and then when we replace the cover
it<00:03:09.400> just<00:03:09.780> puts<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.900> bit<00:03:11.019> more<00:03:11.170> pressure<00:03:11.440> on<00:03:11.590> the

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
it just puts a bit more pressure on the

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.710 
it just puts a bit more pressure on the
battery<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.430> puts<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.390> bit<00:03:13.540> more

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
battery and that puts a bit more

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.319 
battery and that puts a bit more
pressure<00:03:14.019> onto<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:15.370> pins<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.880> have<00:03:16.000> gone<00:03:16.209> in

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
pressure onto the pins that have gone in

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.410 
pressure onto the pins that have gone in
here<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.870> then<00:03:17.860> what<00:03:18.070> you'll<00:03:18.220> find<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.760> that

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
here and then what you'll find is that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.470 
here and then what you'll find is that
still<00:03:19.780> makes<00:03:20.049> a<00:03:20.200> contact<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.090> still<00:03:22.299> makes

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
still makes a contact so it still makes

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.970 
still makes a contact so it still makes
a<00:03:22.600> contact<00:03:22.989> with<00:03:23.079> everything<00:03:23.500> because<00:03:23.829> you're

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
a contact with everything because you're

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.729 
a contact with everything because you're
packing<00:03:24.250> out<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:25.660> packing<00:03:26.079> out<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.350> whole<00:03:26.560> of

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
packing out you packing out the whole of

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:35.220 
packing out you packing out the whole of
this<00:03:26.860> key<00:03:27.329> right<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:29.290> when<00:03:29.500> that's<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.860> place

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.339 

just<00:03:36.230> put<00:03:36.379> this<00:03:36.470> back<00:03:36.709> together<00:03:36.860> like<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:38.349> and

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
just put this back together like so and

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.520 
just put this back together like so and
if<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.560> look<00:03:39.739> at<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.950> button<00:03:40.720> we<00:03:41.720> have<00:03:41.959> power

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
if you look at the button we have power

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.320 
if you look at the button we have power
you<00:03:42.799> see<00:03:42.980> that's<00:03:43.549> working<00:03:44.000> fine<00:03:44.239> with<00:03:44.769> voxels

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
you see that's working fine with voxels

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.699 
you see that's working fine with voxels
when<00:03:47.330> you<00:03:47.420> change<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:47.810> battery<00:03:47.959> sometimes

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
when you change the battery sometimes

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.309 
when you change the battery sometimes
they<00:03:49.069> lose<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.400> cold<00:03:49.670> in<00:03:49.819> them<00:03:50.030> if<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.140> has

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
they lose the cold in them if it has

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.729 
they lose the cold in them if it has
lost<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.739> cold<00:03:52.010> go<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.940> car<00:03:53.530> stick<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.680> in

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
lost the cold go to the car stick it in

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.410 
lost the cold go to the car stick it in
the<00:03:54.890> ignition<00:03:55.480> turn<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:56.720> one<00:03:56.989> tool<00:03:57.739> clicks

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
the ignition turn it one tool clicks

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.729 
the ignition turn it one tool clicks
press<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.480> button<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:00.110> will

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
press a button and that will

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.430 
press a button and that will
resynchronize<00:04:01.670> it<00:04:01.909> to<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:03.260> your

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
resynchronize it to you to your

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.080 
resynchronize it to you to your
particular<00:04:03.739> car<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.489> only<00:04:05.359> works<00:04:05.590> if<00:04:07.090> this

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
particular car that only works if this

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.910 
particular car that only works if this
particular<00:04:08.510> remote<00:04:09.019> has<00:04:09.379> already<00:04:09.799> been

programed<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:10.519> your<00:04:10.760> vehicle<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.810> don't<00:04:12.079> think

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
programed to your vehicle so don't think

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.740 
programed to your vehicle so don't think
you<00:04:12.379> can<00:04:12.560> go<00:04:13.090> programming<00:04:14.090> other<00:04:14.299> people's

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
you can go programming other people's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.650 
you can go programming other people's
keys<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.590> your<00:04:15.739> car<00:04:15.980> because<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:17.209> just<00:04:17.449> it's

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
keys to your car because it just it's

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.150 
keys to your car because it just it's
not<00:04:17.810> going<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.049> happen<00:04:18.139> it<00:04:18.650> needs<00:04:18.859> to<00:04:19.039> have

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
not going to happen it needs to have

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.800
