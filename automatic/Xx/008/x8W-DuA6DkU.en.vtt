you can tell our legs here's the one
thing<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.290> think<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.890> we're<00:00:05.069> kind<00:00:05.730> of

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
thing I think that we're kind of

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.690 
thing I think that we're kind of
starting<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.210> get<00:00:06.420> those<00:00:06.740> two<00:00:07.740> not<00:00:07.919> endure<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
starting to get those two not endure the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.759 
starting to get those two not endure the
practice<00:00:09.240> but<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.690> finish<00:00:10.080> no<00:00:10.260> matter<00:00:10.290> how<00:00:10.710> you

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
practice but to finish no matter how you

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.160 
practice but to finish no matter how you
feel<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.400> thought<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.120> they<00:00:12.389> tried<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.809> push

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
feel I thought that they tried to push

feel I thought that they tried to push
themselves<00:00:13.519> they're<00:00:14.630> obviously<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:16.170> don't

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
themselves they're obviously you don't

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.429 
themselves they're obviously you don't
want<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.590> time<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.039> camp<00:00:17.869> things<00:00:18.869> get<00:00:19.170> but

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439

they're still hot area I guess so just
out<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.840> curiosity<00:02:35.080> rocky<00:02:35.830> long<00:02:36.130> had<00:02:36.370> came<00:02:36.610> out

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
out of curiosity rocky long had came out

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.030 
out of curiosity rocky long had came out
yesterday<00:02:37.450> he<00:02:38.350> said<00:02:38.530> he's<00:02:38.709> kind<00:02:38.950> of

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
yesterday he said he's kind of

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.750 
yesterday he said he's kind of
considering<00:02:39.459> not<00:02:39.820> punting<00:02:40.390> inside<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.050> 50

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
considering not punting inside the 50

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.860 
considering not punting inside the 50
because<00:02:42.760> he<00:02:42.910> feels<00:02:43.150> like<00:02:43.239> they're<00:02:43.480> giving<00:02:43.750> up

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
because he feels like they're giving up

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.720 
because he feels like they're giving up
down<00:02:45.090> yeah<00:02:46.090> another<00:02:46.840> Koecher<00:02:47.830> market<00:02:48.220> oh<00:02:48.250> yeah

field<00:03:09.070> position<00:03:09.670> we<00:03:09.850> can<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:11.350> know<00:03:11.470> not<00:03:11.650> that

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
field position we can you know not that

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.110 
field position we can you know not that
we<00:03:11.950> wouldn't<00:03:12.160> go<00:03:12.370> for<00:03:12.640> it<00:03:12.700> if<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.030> short

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
we wouldn't go for it if it's short

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.729 
we wouldn't go for it if it's short
yardage<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.170> know<00:03:14.260> anything<00:03:14.709> like<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:14.920> but

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
yardage you know anything like that but

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.360 
yardage you know anything like that but
you<00:03:17.739> know<00:03:17.790> your<00:03:18.790> odds<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.329> scoring<00:03:19.870> from

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
you know your odds of scoring from

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.800 
you know your odds of scoring from
different<00:03:21.370> parts<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.940> field<00:03:22.239> yo<00:03:22.630> up

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
different parts on the field yo up

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.949 
different parts on the field yo up
astronomically<00:03:23.260> based<00:03:24.010> on<00:03:24.190> where<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.459> goals

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
astronomically based on where the goals

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.120 
astronomically based on where the goals
so<00:03:25.959> maybe<00:03:26.230> we'll<00:03:26.470> try<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:28.860> does<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:29.980> surprise

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
so maybe we'll try it does it surprise

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.979 
so maybe we'll try it does it surprise
you<00:03:30.370> though<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:31.390> mean<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:31.840> been
