00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.220
 A 50-year-old victim of skin cancer may have sunburned during his teenage years. 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.996
 Those who eat dairy products: milk, cheese and yogurt, may be 2.5 times more likely to develop certain malignant skin cancers. 

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:25.129
 However, these scholars have identified some incredible and powerful things that can reduce the risk of skin cancer to 50 percent. 

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:30.312
 vegetables. Eating dark green leaves can halve our risk. 

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:35.037
 Yes, but how many vegetables do these people need to eat? 

00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:41.870
 Ok, the information is here. The person who eats the most vegetables here will reduce the risk of cancer by half. 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.945
 Compared to those who eat the least vegetables, they only eat six grams of green vegetables a day. 

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:52.212
 That is equal to the weight of the six paper clips! 

00:00:52.212 --> 00:00:58.945
 They must have accidentally eaten some condiments, like the parsley next to the steak. 

00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:04.186
 Which green vegetables do you eat the most? 

00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:14.586
 As long as 31 grams of green vegetables a day, equal to the weight of 31 paper clips can reduce the risk of squamous cell skin cancer 

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:25.895
 That is equivalent to 3 slices of spinach. . . One, two, three slices of leaves a day. This cancer risk is halved. 

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:28.962
 That is. . . The power of green vegetables! 

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:34.470
 My motto is "In your life, eat green vegetables every day until the end of life." 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.170
 Last year, there was a “green vegetable review” in American history. 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.810
 In 1777, General George Washington ordered the US military to go out. 

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:58.180
 A wild vegetable was selected around the military camp to protect the soldiers from rot. It’s a very smart person! 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:08.320
 Eating meat can increase the risk of cancer, and vegetarianism can reduce the risk. 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.860
 The study found that eating a lot of plant foods can reduce the risk of breast cancer by half, thanks to dietary fiber. 

00:02:16.862 --> 00:02:20.360
 Remember, only plants have fiber. 

00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:25.800
 The animals have bones and the plants are supported by fibers. 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.660
 But only whole plant food is a good source of fiber. 

00:02:29.662 --> 00:02:40.540
 Like white flour, white bread, white rice and pasta refined foods, most of their fiber and other nutrients are stripped. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.540
 Like endometrial cancer, our animal protein and fat are nearly twice as high. 

00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:53.040
 A large amount of plant protein, vegetable fat - reduces the risk by nearly half. 

00:02:53.045 --> 00:03:01.390
 Ninety-seven women who were studied. Uterine cancer, another very scary cancer. 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.930
 A large amount of isoflavones reduces our risk by half. 

00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:09.150
 What is the main source of isoflavones? 

00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:10.850
 bean products. 

00:03:10.853 --> 00:03:20.800
 Compare plant and animal bacon, although soy meat usually lacks fiber in whole plant foods. 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:30.670
 But the same weight, bacon is more than four times calories, fifty times fat, forty times full fat, 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.400
 Countless cholesterol and only a quarter of protein, 

00:03:34.403 --> 00:03:43.570
 It increases our risk of cancer, and soy meat or permission to reduce the risk. 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.240
 This is simple, right? Eat more fruits and eat less meat, reducing the chance of cancer. 

00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:50.440
 I am not just selectively selecting these studies. 

00:03:50.444 --> 00:03:57.340
 Over the years, I have challenged others to use experiments to prove that plant-based diets increase the chances of developing cancer. 

00:03:57.344 --> 00:04:00.850
 Frankly, such research does not exist. 

00:04:00.853 --> 00:04:07.320
 Another major study: the National Cancer Institute log shows: eat more plants, less cancer. 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.220
 why? Extraction of lignans from the diet. 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.930
 Lignol is one of thousands of elements called phytonutrients. 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.160
 "Phyto" refers to plants. These are special phytonutrients. 

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.960
 What is the best source of lignans on this planet? 

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:25.560
 It is flaxseed.
