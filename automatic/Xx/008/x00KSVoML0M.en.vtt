00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
this is what I gave her

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.800

it's<00:01:30.720> called<00:01:31.049> party<00:01:31.530> mix<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.270> really

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
it's called party mix and it is really

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.950 
it's called party mix and it is really
good<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.860> her<00:01:34.950> because<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:36.420> has<00:01:36.570> lots<00:01:36.810> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
good for her because it has lots of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.120 
good for her because it has lots of
different<00:01:37.229> kinds<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> didn't<00:01:37.979> want<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
different kinds so I didn't want to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.620 
different kinds so I didn't want to
worry<00:01:38.310> about<00:01:38.369> her<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:38.820> liking<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
worry about her not liking it and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.660 
worry about her not liking it and
they're<00:01:40.170> also<00:01:40.320> soft<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.040> they're<00:01:41.159> easy<00:01:41.340> for

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
they're also soft so they're easy for

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.120 
they're also soft so they're easy for
her<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> eat<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.869> she<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.409> loves<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
tempo so it's kind of like a variety for

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.789

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250
