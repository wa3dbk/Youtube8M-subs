00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600 
together in the form of a story and then
along<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.199> way<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.860> sidebars<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
along the way I have sidebars that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
along the way I have sidebars that
explain<00:01:06.470> what<00:01:07.470> our<00:01:07.590> stead<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.800> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
explain what our stead of the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
are some truths so it's really a book

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.490 
are some truths so it's really a book
that<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.130> debunking<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.790> raw<00:01:15.030> food<00:01:15.330> diet

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500

that is a debunking the raw food diet
but<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.650> providing<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.280> framework<00:01:17.790> for

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
but then providing a framework for

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
but then providing a framework for
healthy<00:01:18.750> eating<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.680> show<00:01:19.860> off<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> show<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
healthy eating to show off the show so I

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.950 
healthy eating to show off the show so I
basically<00:01:20.760> need<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.000> help<00:01:21.090> people<00:01:21.299> avoid<00:01:21.720> this

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the sameness thing I did but also the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.760 
the sameness thing I did but also the
same<00:01:26.010> thing<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.460> saw<00:01:26.640> other<00:01:26.850> people<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.770> the

also show you that well yes the raw food
idea<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:35.100> interesting<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.600> makes<00:01:36.810> sense

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
idea was interesting and it makes sense

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.330 
idea was interesting and it makes sense
but<00:01:37.440> don't<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.640> follow<00:01:38.880> an<00:01:39.150> ideal<00:01:39.510> blindly

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
but don't just follow an ideal blindly

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.940 
but don't just follow an ideal blindly
learn<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:41.700> bit<00:01:41.790> about<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.799> make<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
learn a little bit about it and make it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.640 
learn a little bit about it and make it
work<00:01:44.479> nutritionally<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:46.049> with<00:01:46.439> some

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650
