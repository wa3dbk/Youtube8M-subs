00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
grabs the bait so that will run with it

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.350 
grabs the bait so that will run with it
and<00:01:43.590> swallow<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.220> which<00:01:44.729> gives<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> much

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and swallow it which gives you a much

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.030 
and swallow it which gives you a much
better<00:01:45.600> chance<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> get<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> set<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.860> hook

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
better chance to get the set on the hook

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
better chance to get the set on the hook
a<00:01:47.310> great<00:01:47.759> way<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.299> natural<00:01:48.720> feel<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
a great way to get this natural feel is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.929 
a great way to get this natural feel is
by<00:01:49.320> using<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.649> conventional<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.310> baitcasting

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
by using a conventional or baitcasting

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.149 
by using a conventional or baitcasting
reel<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> real<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.680> gear<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
reel with a real out of gear and the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.219 
reel with a real out of gear and the
clicker<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.490> now<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.750> haven't<00:01:54.960> used

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
clicker on now if you haven't used

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.050 
clicker on now if you haven't used
conventional<00:01:55.500> reels<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.310> clickers<00:01:56.549> before

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
conventional reels with clickers before

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.700 
conventional reels with clickers before
basically<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.869> means<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.560> have

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
basically what that means is you have

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.740 
basically what that means is you have
this<00:01:58.829> little<00:01:59.009> button<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.240> slide

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
this little button here that you slide

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.560 
this little button here that you slide
in<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> real<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> gear<00:02:02.759> clicker<00:02:03.299> on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
in so the real is out of gear clicker on

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.810 
in so the real is out of gear clicker on
so<00:02:04.229> when<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.439> fish<00:02:04.619> picks<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.610> take

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
so when the fish picks it up it can take

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.680 
so when the fish picks it up it can take
line<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.990> clicker<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:08.420> putting<00:02:09.420> enough

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
line but that clicker is putting enough

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.570 
line but that clicker is putting enough
pressure<00:02:09.720> there<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.830> hold<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.250> bait<00:02:11.430> in

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
pressure there to hold your bait in

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.120 
pressure there to hold your bait in
place<00:02:12.379> so<00:02:13.379> with<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> clicker

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
place so with the clicker

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.310 
place so with the clicker
on<00:02:14.280> I'll<00:02:14.520> hear<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.120> when<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> fish<00:02:15.600> hit<00:02:15.930> I'll

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
on I'll hear it when a fish hit I'll

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.210 
on I'll hear it when a fish hit I'll

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
like to use a lever drag reel with a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.500 
like to use a lever drag reel with a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
lever drag reel you can just bump the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.630 
lever drag reel you can just bump the
real<00:02:51.690> slightly<00:02:52.440> into<00:02:52.650> gear<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.130> hold<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.460> big

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
real slightly into gear to hold the big

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.280 
real slightly into gear to hold the big
bait<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:53.970> place<00:02:54.210> but<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:54.870> still<00:02:55.080> loose

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
bait in place but it's still loose

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.140 
bait in place but it's still loose
enough<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.950> fish<00:02:56.130> can<00:02:56.160> hit<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.820> run<00:02:57.030> away

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
enough so the fish can hit and run away

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.420 
enough so the fish can hit and run away
with<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.600> another<00:02:58.500> trick<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.160> don't<00:02:59.310> have

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
with it another trick if you don't have

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.100 
with it another trick if you don't have
a<00:02:59.460> lever<00:02:59.700> drag<00:03:00.000> reel<00:03:00.270> or<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> real<00:03:00.870> with<00:03:01.050> a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
a lever drag reel or a real with a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.050 
a lever drag reel or a real with a
strong<00:03:01.410> enough<00:03:01.680> clicker<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.820> wrap<00:03:03.030> a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
strong enough clicker is to wrap a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.910 
strong enough clicker is to wrap a
rubber<00:03:03.300> band<00:03:03.630> around<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.140> rod<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.680> line

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
rubber band around the rod and the line

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.250 
rubber band around the rod and the line
this<00:03:05.520> will<00:03:05.700> hold<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.030> line<00:03:06.240> tight<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.050> rod

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
this will hold the line tight to the rod

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.470 
this will hold the line tight to the rod
until<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.920> fish<00:03:08.100> hits<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.550> when<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> fish<00:03:09.210> hits

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
until the fish hits it when a fish hits

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.510 
until the fish hits it when a fish hits
it<00:03:09.660> burns<00:03:10.080> through<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.410> rubber<00:03:10.560> band<00:03:10.830> so

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
it burns through the rubber band so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.220 
it burns through the rubber band so
