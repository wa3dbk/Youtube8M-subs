game got another tip for you in 5
minutes<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.130> under<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.540> it's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
minutes and under and this time it's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
minutes and under and this time it's
about<00:00:22.290> these<00:00:23.869> no<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.079> it's<00:00:25.619> not<00:00:25.829> airplane<00:00:26.789> it's

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
about these no is it's not airplane it's

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.419 
about these no is it's not airplane it's
a<00:00:27.270> refractometer<00:00:27.650> it's<00:00:28.650> about<00:00:28.860> when<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.400> use

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
a refractometer it's about when to use

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.330 
a refractometer it's about when to use
them<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:29.910> when<00:00:30.090> not<00:00:30.439> now<00:00:31.439> you've<00:00:32.160> probably

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
them or when not now you've probably

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.189 
them or when not now you've probably
seen<00:00:32.730> quite<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.090> few<00:00:33.180> breweries<00:00:33.540> using<00:00:34.050> them

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
seen quite a few breweries using them

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.430 
seen quite a few breweries using them
and<00:00:34.730> I'm<00:00:35.730> sure<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.390> lot<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> growers<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.290> done

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and I'm sure a lot of growers have done

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.410 
and I'm sure a lot of growers have done
a<00:00:37.470> lot<00:00:37.800> more<00:00:38.010> reading<00:00:38.430> about<00:00:38.670> them<00:00:38.879> than<00:00:39.300> I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
a lot more reading about them than I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.130 
a lot more reading about them than I
have<00:00:39.690> before<00:00:39.900> I<00:00:40.110> start<00:00:40.410> using<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:41.839> these<00:00:42.839> are<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
have before I start using it these are a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.520 
have before I start using it these are a
lovely<00:00:43.830> tool<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.970> measuring<00:00:45.899> gravity<00:00:46.440> in

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
lovely tool for measuring gravity in

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.760 
lovely tool for measuring gravity in
work<00:00:49.530> whilst<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.309> doing<00:00:51.059> your<00:00:51.210> brewed<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
work whilst you doing your brewed a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.610 
work whilst you doing your brewed a
quick<00:00:52.770> couple<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> drops<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:54.320> little<00:00:55.320> screen

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
quick couple of drops on little screen

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.420 
quick couple of drops on little screen
there<00:00:55.920> close<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.800> look<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> business

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
there close it up look in the business

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.529 
there close it up look in the business
end<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.739> straight<00:01:01.739> away<00:01:01.980> you'll<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.789> exactly

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
end and straight away you'll see exactly

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
end and straight away you'll see exactly
what<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.289> gravity<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.100> you've<00:01:05.489> got<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
what your gravity is if you've got a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.090 
what your gravity is if you've got a
meter<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.180> weeds<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.570> gravity<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.259> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
meter that weeds and gravity and it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:23.600 
meter that weeds and gravity and it
looks<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.490> this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.820 

so<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> simple<00:01:25.650> sugar

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so there you go this is a simple sugar

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.040 
so there you go this is a simple sugar
solution<00:01:26.430> I've<00:01:26.580> done<00:01:26.820> I'm<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.270> brewing<00:01:27.690> today

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
solution I've done I'm not brewing today

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.020 
solution I've done I'm not brewing today
so<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.470> haven't<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.920> any<00:01:29.070> work<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.850> show

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so I haven't got any work here to show

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.020 
so I haven't got any work here to show
you<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.640> clearly<00:01:32.940> see

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you it on but that you can clearly see

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.540 
you it on but that you can clearly see
that's<00:01:33.500> 104<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.170> very<00:01:37.170> quick<00:01:37.560> easy<00:01:37.860> no

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
that's 104 one so very quick easy no

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.380 
that's 104 one so very quick easy no
need<00:01:38.730> to<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:39.030> hydrometers<00:01:39.750> Oh<00:01:39.930> cooled<00:01:40.800> down

100 mils of work to get a reading on
anything<00:01:45.470> there<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.620> gotcha<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
anything there is a gotcha with them and

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.260 
anything there is a gotcha with them and
that's<00:01:48.690> as<00:01:48.990> soon<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.650> you've<00:01:49.860> got<00:01:49.890> any<00:01:50.400> alcohol

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
that's as soon as you've got any alcohol

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.469 
that's as soon as you've got any alcohol
in<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:52.260> at<00:01:52.410> all<00:01:53.000> these<00:01:54.000> are<00:01:54.180> no<00:01:54.270> good<00:01:55.460> well

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
in there at all these are no good well

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.580 
in there at all these are no good well
technically<00:01:57.479> they're<00:01:57.840> still<00:01:58.050> good<00:01:58.260> but

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
technically they're still good but

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
technically they're still good but
you've<00:01:58.740> got<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.160> apply<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.550> conversion<00:02:00.180> factor

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you've got to apply a conversion factor

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.710 
you've got to apply a conversion factor
when<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.620> end<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.920> having<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.220> get<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.790> formula

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
when you end up having to get a formula

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
when you end up having to get a formula
or<00:02:03.750> go<00:02:04.140> online<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:05.210> calculator<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:07.170> work<00:02:07.200> out

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
or go online to a calculator to work out

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.300 
or go online to a calculator to work out
what<00:02:08.550> exactly<00:02:09.209> your<00:02:09.450> gravity<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.410> because

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
what exactly your gravity is now because

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.040 
what exactly your gravity is now because
they're<00:02:11.459> no<00:02:11.610> longer<00:02:11.970> accurate<00:02:12.180> as<00:02:12.660> soon<00:02:12.900> as

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
they're no longer accurate as soon as

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.260 
they're no longer accurate as soon as
there's<00:02:13.260> alcohol<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.920> there<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.730> reflects

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
there's alcohol in there that reflects

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.210 
there's alcohol in there that reflects
the<00:02:15.510> likes<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.050> prism<00:02:16.440> differently<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the likes of the prism differently and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.660 
the likes of the prism differently and
the<00:02:17.430> reading<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.880> out<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.430> personally<00:02:20.430> what<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
the reading is out so personally what I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.030 
the reading is out so personally what I
do<00:02:20.820> now<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.209> use<00:02:21.660> these<00:02:21.990> I'm<00:02:22.920> brooding<00:02:23.820> and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
do now I use these I'm brooding and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.720 
do now I use these I'm brooding and
stick<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.220> hydrometer<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:28.280> bottling<00:02:29.280> day<00:02:29.459> or

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
stick to a hydrometer on bottling day or

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
stick to a hydrometer on bottling day or
caking<00:02:30.390> day<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.530> if<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.769> want<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.160> know<00:02:32.510> what<00:02:33.510> my

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
caking day so if I want to know what my

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.590 
caking day so if I want to know what my
original<00:02:34.530> gravity<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:35.250> my<00:02:35.670> pre<00:02:35.910> or<00:02:36.090> post<00:02:36.300> Boyle

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
original gravity is my pre or post Boyle

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.500 
original gravity is my pre or post Boyle
gravity<00:02:37.200> then<00:02:37.670> that's<00:02:38.670> where<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.120> used

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
gravity then that's where this is used

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.050 
gravity then that's where this is used
if<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.650> want<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.950> know<00:02:41.100> if<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.430> bee<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.670> ready

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
if I want to know if the bee is ready

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.080 
if I want to know if the bee is ready
it's<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.750> hydrometer<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.620> could<00:02:44.580> still<00:02:44.850> use<00:02:45.060> this

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it's a hydrometer I could still use this

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.960 
it's a hydrometer I could still use this
but<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:46.140> I'd<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.769> then<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.250> go<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.820> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
but what I'd have to do then is go to a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.479 
but what I'd have to do then is go to a
website<00:02:48.239> putting<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.260> starting<00:02:49.739> gravity<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
website putting the starting gravity and

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.970 
website putting the starting gravity and
the<00:02:50.580> current<00:02:50.910> gravity<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.650> would<00:02:52.830> then

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
the current gravity and it would then

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.040 
the current gravity and it would then
work<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.400> out<00:02:53.519> for<00:02:53.820> me<00:02:53.940> what<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.720> it's

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
work it out for me what it is and it's

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.380 
work it out for me what it is and it's
much<00:02:55.290> easier<00:02:55.320> just<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:56.130> put<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.550> hydrometer<00:02:56.970> in

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
much easier just to put a hydrometer in

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.470 
much easier just to put a hydrometer in
and<00:02:57.540> go<00:02:57.630> yeah<00:02:58.200> okay<00:02:58.830> that's<00:02:59.040> done<00:02:59.330> so<00:03:00.330> there

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and go yeah okay that's done so there

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.630 
and go yeah okay that's done so there
you<00:03:00.600> go<00:03:00.750> simple<00:03:01.290> trip<00:03:01.560> five<00:03:01.980> minutes<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.370> under

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
you go simple trip five minutes in under

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640 
you go simple trip five minutes in under
when<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.600> use<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.019> when<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.320> use<00:03:04.500> a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
when to use and when not to use a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:19.930 
when to use and when not to use a
refractometer<00:03:06.320> chisel

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.000
