00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.370
 He passed two numbers 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.590
 decimals to factions worth 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:14.909
 if a wet 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.029
 threw a finite number of decimal figures finite oduro figures 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.550
 decimals newspaper 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.599
 can be expressed as a phrase a voucher for example 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.899
 25 comma 615 has a finite number decimals there are three 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.430
 tosello lopo doctors like this 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.790
 then I could simplify everything I want but the case has happened here 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.630
 with one with a finite number decimals easy because only in this way 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 a 1 followed by both zero and decimals have 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.620
 this lot does not problem 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 and if that newspaper ran across the pro 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.790
 equal emphasis 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.890
 so it does one more thing for the number 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.360
 bad indecision at home with decimals of the regime 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.160
 the like tenths 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
 takes away the whole part 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.009
 and divide it meanwhile 9 as a number have the period in this case 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.340
 in all this would be 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.330
 this month 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
 the number 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.040
 whole part 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.240
 I will put good 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.480
 and down both 9 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 as decimals in the period 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.900
 that day 8 196 27 park 99 ok we check the calculator 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.900
 827 live 99 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.189
 then the arreÃ³n betrayed bylamar 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.249
 yes tommasi 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.249
 I've been here harder still harder 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.180
 drenthe in the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.779
 rel 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 loren 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.479
 now 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.699
 this one cleric ico uro 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.860
 and is that a newspaper work 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.889
 according to mixed newspaper because it has 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.809
 10th law that are outside the period is worth 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.979
 and a periodic part and a non-periodic part 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.679
 the same is easy 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.289
 list co 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.289
 puts the part that is outside the period 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.500
 and divide it 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.339
 between 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:02.539
 both 9 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.649
 as there were no have them the chosen period nine 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:11.230
 and both 0 and destination to Germany outside the school year 1 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.039
 2-what tozzo 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.919
 the numbers that in the period 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.789
 and these are tenth out of the period there is one per punch 0 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.609
 this is a way of learning what I did not like because the humorist 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.029
 there is another way you can take order and balance 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:35.439
 as the children tell me that it took easily 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.439
 the fine explains it like that but 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.619
 you have uu its logic 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.619
 ll 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.419
 does anyone 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.419
 this is done by anyone 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.259
 but you also have utility to learn a thing of dying 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.159
 from upa 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.159
 to work memory 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.019
 what does
