 Siemanko. Today is another battle on the Bulldog. 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.600
 It's short, that's why I threw it. That's Barnof's muse. 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.900
 Another learning to play with the 9.5 version of the magazine 

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:48.700
 Mother and daughter, I know them! 

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:56.200
 Now the mines are different. 

00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:13.800
 I did not play enough to judge them - recently I am throwing a satellite pile. 

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:28.200
 We shoot what we can. 

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:57.000
 The magazine has amazing potential. 

00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:09.600
 However, it forces a different style of play. 

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:51.000
 Unfaithful detrack 

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:59.200
 Loading in 9.6 takes longer. 

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:13.700
 I love his mobility. 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.800
 And drifty like in NFS 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.400
 Quick fun - nice thing. Greetings
