00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
just poke the screw for the handle

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.590 
just poke the screw for the handle
through<00:02:03.890> here<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.250> figure<00:02:04.460> out<00:02:04.730> how<00:02:05.060> far<00:02:05.390> it

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
through here to figure out how far it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.000 
through here to figure out how far it
pokes<00:02:05.840> through<00:02:05.960> remember<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.470> talked<00:02:06.860> about

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
pokes through remember I talked about

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.410 
pokes through remember I talked about
the<00:02:07.190> fact<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.730> screws<00:02:07.970> are<00:02:08.119> too<00:02:08.240> long

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
the fact that the screws are too long

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.080 
the fact that the screws are too long
and<00:02:08.660> we<00:02:08.720> need<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.020> cut<00:02:09.200> them<00:02:09.350> shorter<00:02:09.820> so<00:02:10.820> as<00:02:10.970> I
