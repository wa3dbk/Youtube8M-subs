my members were with what we did here in

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
my members were with what we did here in
six<00:01:20.850> months<00:01:21.060> basically<00:01:22.020> what<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> meant<00:01:23.009> in

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
six months basically what that meant in

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.710 
six months basically what that meant in
numbers<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.789> we<00:01:23.970> turned<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
numbers is we turned a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.480 
numbers is we turned a
ten-thousand-dollar<00:01:25.319> bankroll<00:01:25.920> into<00:01:26.190> thirty

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
ten-thousand-dollar bankroll into thirty
