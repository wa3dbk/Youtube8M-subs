00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.090 
anyone come up with a cool idea it's a
lot<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:10.209> hard<00:02:10.600> work<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:11.020> make<00:02:11.290> these<00:02:11.530> games<00:02:11.830> and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
lot of hard work to make these games and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.550 
lot of hard work to make these games and
that's<00:02:12.430> what<00:02:12.760> makes<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.120> difference

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
that's what makes the difference

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:34.980 
that's what makes the difference
Oh

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.050
