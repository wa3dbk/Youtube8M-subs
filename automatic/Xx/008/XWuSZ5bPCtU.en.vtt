 what here says that facebook is safe 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.310

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.330
 we are presented with a security question 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.330

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.130
 connected on my facebook 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.510
 but well let's start as if 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.510
 we just turned on the computer 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.230

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.569
 and this is a mail address 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.459

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.459
 normal facebook to enter 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.099
 we put our address 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.720
 and this password 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.489

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.720
 And enter 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.720
 very fast 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.050
 to close this 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.080
 we have here the facebook that taught me 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.680
 that we can manipulate a bit to enlarge 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.150
 check let's put it here 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.260
 they put us 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.629
 What are things that your friends do? 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.390
 put it here like on normal facebook 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.700
 you can enlarge it and shrink here 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.819
 puts three friends connected with those who 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.069
 more talk let's say it like that and it ends 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.569
 all appear 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.569
 you can do a quick search 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.760
 you can drag it to the side 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.560
 and anchor 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.170
 click here to unpin we give it 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.900
 click here and bleed only you can 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.599
 do on the right side of the screen 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.170
 and what is anchoring the / that 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:37.069
 It serves to have it always visible 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.069
 because if we open it google 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.370
 and to be like this and if you want to be 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.130
 talking to your friends while you are 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.000
 are you doing something on youtube or something 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.220
 so what you have to do is 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.930
 drag it rent it 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.000
 or simply where I'm clicking 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.260
 anchor to the right anchored the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.230
 right and you can continue exploring 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.300
 easily 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.300
 without a difficulty 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.530
 when when christian with someone 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.329
 open another window this window you can 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.259
 put 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.259
 agree that 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.490
 We are going to put it here to check you say 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.490
 I do not know what you want 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.000
 and he and if you close them will notify you 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.830
 Then here when he answers you 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.390
 and it closes without any warning 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.140
 because then the 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.140
 conversations 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.560
 also when you have a notification to 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.480
 facebook you will appear here a 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.470
 box like the one that appears 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.190
 normally on this side of facebook it 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.190
 it will appear here 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.850
 very well if you do not like it and want it 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.730
 uninstall is very easy for me there is no 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.100
 no problem is very good program it 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.440
 uses perfectly and apart not 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.580
 it consumes a lot if we see here facebook 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.789
 messenger 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:26.090
 does not occupy as much of cpu is not doing 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.090
 nothing 1441 but it's very fast this 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.520
 this is because it is open what 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.610
 we can also 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.970
 In case you wish, we cry out if we give you 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.970
 close 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.580
 he already answered me 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:48.209
 although he says to err and still could see 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:48.209
 the window this is because it's still here 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.660
 if it is still minimized in the bar 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.660
 of tasks we click and it reopens 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.490
 and she answered me let's close it 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.490
 I answer 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:07.659
 we are not going to anchor and to see so that 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.639
 see what happens we click on 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:13.370
 close 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.420
 but still open is still here 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.790
 it's not going to close 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.110
 if you do not have to click right and 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.950
 after leaving and so it will be done 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.950
 completely 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.680
 when they want to uninstall it there are two 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.289
 ways if you have cyclin 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.940
 is a way that I use to specify all 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.870
 the programs because apart you can 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.630
 erase the bits and defragment what 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:43.120
 what's left on the hard drive can you go 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.280
 per control panel 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.400
 is to install the program 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:52.440
 and here you find 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:54.690
 the facebook messenger 2.044 78.0 le 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.150
 applied and will run the 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:01.460
 uninstaller is sure you decide 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.460
 install facebook messenger is that yes 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.530
 and you can also go for sick liner 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.980
 and you go to facebook tools 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.980
 messenger or selections 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.229
 Yes Yes 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.480
 we wait a while for it to settle 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.220
 the truth I do not have any problem 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.550
 with this problem does not occupy anything of 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:37.800
 memory is not slow the computer is 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:40.610
 very practical and very easy to use 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.610
 Ok here 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.280
 already installed it no longer exists in my 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:47.770
 computer 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.600
 if we leave when managing from behind already 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.480
 will not be and what he did was open us 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:56.260
 one page and we scout and he tells us 

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.030
 who regrets that we leave and that 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.190
 we arrive because we do not want to teach for 

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.030
 windows here if you want you can 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:06.639
 write and if you send it or if nothing else 

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:09.070
 come out and that is good for you that was 

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:11.440
 all I hope you liked it and 

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.980
 has served them is a very easy way 

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:19.470
 to be with your friends and not 

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.470
 the computer is slow thank you very much
