welcome<00:00:01.410> back<00:00:01.530> guys<00:00:01.800> all<00:00:02.129> right

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:44.390 

there<00:00:31.150> we<00:00:31.240> go

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:52.130 

all<00:00:45.400> right<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:49.780> this<00:00:49.960> part<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.320> fairly<00:00:50.560> simple

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
all right now this part is fairly simple

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:11.350 
all right now this part is fairly simple
do<00:00:53.140> what<00:00:53.410> you've<00:00:53.590> been<00:00:53.800> doing

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.200 

see<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.979> why<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> was<00:01:14.369> called<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.670> mini<00:01:14.909> boss

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
see this is why I was called a mini boss

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.359 
see this is why I was called a mini boss
because<00:01:15.600> technically<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.590> doesn't<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
because technically it doesn't have the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
because technically it doesn't have the
ferocity<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.390> normal<00:01:18.630> boss<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.360> why

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
ferocity of a normal boss so that's why

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
ferocity of a normal boss so that's why
I<00:01:21.539> called<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> minibosses<00:01:23.960> because<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:26.610> just

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I called the minibosses because you just

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.029
