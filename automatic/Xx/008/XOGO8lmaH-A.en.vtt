 players the opportunity through the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.730
 slaughtered crazy game of assassination 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.500
 though the bloodthirsty spectacle in 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.630
 first line on online multiplayer

 duelle designed donated seeger 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.099
 In addition, a story mode of us in 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.590
 a dark one of crime and violence 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.750
 plagued world abducts how the

 learn her in the test video 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.860
 the act of anarchy reigns becomes the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.530
 justify the title of the game 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.700
 after between international 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.500
 great powers war has broken out 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.510
 from the earth as we know it today 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.250
 not much left and it is the same 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.920
 a dreary nobody country in which the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.510
 sheer anarchy rules in detail 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.399
 pretty rundown cities 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.070
 the people are saddened 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 being in this historic world the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.390
 in their style to films like sin city 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.460
 We can now choose 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.260
 on which of two pages do we look for the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.720
 former chief of the office for the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.270
 public safety maximilian texts 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.580
 that's what it's going to be looking for 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.350
 murder blamed for selection 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.450
 are the known from mad world 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.400
 Bounty hunter Jack Lemmon and that 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.460
 member of the security office leonard 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.320
 victoria depending on which side you 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.090
 Decisions are also changing 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.090
 mission in story mode of the game 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.229
 in the story mode of the game is ours 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.909
 start the areal city altamira zur 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.950
 free exploration available 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.960
 after we have enough missions in 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.670
 completed one area each 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.220
 we come but also locks in others 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.200
 areas like pottwal countries in the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.840
 But in principle, bidding does not happen 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.330
 a lot except that constantly any dome 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.149
 ki-opponents in balance to run and 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.530
 Waiting for it to be chopped off 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.270
 and also appears at random 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.310
 generated vehicles us flat 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.959
 we want nothing more 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.909
 despite enough enemies eliminated and 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.890
 So that the necessary points collected around 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.330
 we can unlock a mission 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.399
 to a corresponding point on the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.650
 Run the map and start a mission 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.390
 collecting points for the mission 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.340
 after a short time pretty annoying 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.290
 you ask yourself why not easy 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.180
 with the conclusion of a main mission 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.930
 unlock the beginning of the next one 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.730
 can thus forcing a the game outright 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.860
 as many opponents as necessary unnecessarily 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.540
 he kills himself before the actual 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.220
 first with the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.049
 relatively simple control 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.790
 can work in story mode 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.430
 but first the tutorial missions 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.420
 Incidentally, what do you do right out of the box? 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.250
 the main menu is possible 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.680
 but most of the game exists 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.660
 all in it massive opponents in each 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.079
 to turn off only imaginable form 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.519
 in the long run that is pretty monotonous too 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.500
 the main mission it next to the 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.480
 optional free missions exist 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.519
 not overly varied 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.829
 here we fight against inflow 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.160
 worst of all , we drive to a race 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.810
 checkpoints sensual standard poor's 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.269
 the fighting system is, after all, right 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.799
 kept simple with the standard buttons 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.100
 we carry light and heavy punches 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.170
 Throw out the opponents and jump the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.480
 shoulder buttons serves for one thing too 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.710
 block and dodge or our 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.570
 special ability 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.150
 in jacks fall to a chainsaw 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.220
 use has the small indicator 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.020
 We can fill the bottom left money 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.240
 additionally in the rampage minutes 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.240
 change us briefly become stronger 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.810
 besides, it is possible all kinds 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.390
 objects lying around in the area for 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.160
 the struggles purpose alienate and items 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.160
 how to use this rocket launcher 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.470
 the multiplayer mode of anarchy reigns 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.299
 With up to 16 players offers one 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.790
 variety of choices and 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.500
 different fighters over ten 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.150
 Modes are available 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.250
 there are classics deathmatch and 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.959
 text match in which the optional alone 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.750
 or in the team as many opponents 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.730
 turn off but also a survival mode 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.950
 in which it applies together as many as possible 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.900
 opponents horden to survive and that 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.019
 football ajar game of Paul 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.209
 hours available 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.519
 All modes can be online as well 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.979
 played offline in training with bots 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.690
 the multiplayer mode turns out to be 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.550
 itself as the actual core of the 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.289
 Although not the same game 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.970
 I am particularly demanding with 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.690
 friends and online but quite a lot 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.220
 can have fun 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.530
 the technical implementation is in the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.919
 gloomy world of a cranes that well 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.960
 darkest chapter graphic works in the best 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.729
 fall stale and can despite the 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.919
 nice fight animation is not about her 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.450
 obscure dusty scaffolding 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.520
 again and again it comes to violent 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.440
 reload effects while we play 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.270
 then it can be one 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.099
 take half a minute to finish 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.099
 finally all called textures 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.880
 otherwise they work 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.560
 character animations anything but 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.860
 supple and the textures are 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.930
 washed out and madschid a pity that 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.580
 especially in the typical scenario of 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.410
 no longer worth playing on 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.510
 convincing look was laid 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.060
 so the levels just work 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.930
 boring and do not offer more than 1 3 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.670
 Uncertainly there are numerous bugs 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.830
 which will keep us playing on some 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.840
 put simply impossible made 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.210
 here the game decided to test 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.190
 for example, just strike 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.170
 and the image in front of a 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.730
 the musical accompaniment is like 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.410
 usually a matter of taste 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.450
 hip hop fans will probably 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.700
 everyone else is looking forward to it 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.840
 worst battlestar good that one the 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.840
 can also create music 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.740
 Anarchy Reigns is one in many 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.080
 respect double-edged sword 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.120
 On the one hand there are the completely outdated ones 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.740
 and with wax overloaded technology and 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.660
 one too few with the actual 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.730
 related story of the game 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.110
 excessive levels of violence 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.910
 above average taste 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.220
 more noticeable soundtrack the missing 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.500
 German isolation and annoying 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.140
 Kill enemies for the next mission in the 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.640
 unlock story-mode 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.680
 but where shadow is known 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.120
 always not for who over this 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.560
 point can see good way and already 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.900
 always an uncomplicated online 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.030
 browser has searched with anarchy 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.440
 Reigns fun especially in the 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.120
 Multiplayer mode makes the game 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.680
 quite fun and scores with the 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.320
 crazy japanese character design 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.050
 The title is also at budget price 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.220
 of 30 euros available why choose for 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.530
 one or the other adult 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.980
 Waste certainly offers the purchase 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.980
 be worth
