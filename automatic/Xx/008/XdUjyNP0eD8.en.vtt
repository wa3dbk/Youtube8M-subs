00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.430

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.210
 a friend's account 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.880
 which I'm not going to add just 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.870
 As we already did everything we prepared everything 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.480

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.280

 error when adding friends please 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.930
 try again if I give you another 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.970
 I 'm going to put the same thing 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.129
 the solution to this error is very 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.129
 simple and good is the following 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.570
 what the solution is very simple you 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.570
 let's give here in more 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.800
 and we're going to give him block all 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.410
 communication 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.060
 ok first you're about to 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.470
 blocks communication with such person 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.450
 we're going 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.610
 maybe it was not left behind with my helmet or that 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.240
 We will accept it 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.270
 now we turn to our profile in 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.470
 the friends part 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.170
 this portal I will show you ok 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.460
 ok we go to our profile once in 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.799
 our profile we will go down to 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.970
 the good box until the option that 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.330
 says friends here once here 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.940
 we are going to click here ok 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.730
 ok once being here we are going to 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.700
 appear these tabs that all friends 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.740
 blocked users play with played 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.740
 with me recently and followed where 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.220
 We said to the blocked envelopes once 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.120
 that we are here we give in unlock 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.519
 user 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.080
 and we give him here I do not select them 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.350
 and we give you unlock 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.500
 ok we have it unlocked now we 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.420
 we redirect his to his profile again 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.420
 our friend and let's see what is it 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.340
 What happens or that I'm already here and good 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.440
 I'm greece in your profile and if I 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.410
 I give again to add and as a friend now 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.080
 yes it will leave me then this would be the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.180
 solution for this kind of problems 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.870
 because the solution is very difficult to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.880
 find 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.310
 I can find it and well 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.860
 buoys I made them in video for clicks of 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.110
 do not do it and in local chinga and 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.840
 this happens I do not know why this error happens 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.989
 the truth 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.269
 I think it's when I had the first 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.129
 request that you send friendship and if the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.519
 another person rejects it 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.620
 I think that happens or if they block you or you 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.290
 you block someone do not make us believe 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.060
 that is a mistake that is little but this is 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.910
 little this 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.370
 so they spend very few times but good 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.650
 there is the solution and well that would be 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.170
 all in part I hope they are very 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.170
 well and it is improving ciao
