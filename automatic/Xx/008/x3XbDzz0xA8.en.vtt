00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.100
 marcelinho 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.100
 I'm going to start working between June and September. 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.939
 the pound alive in court 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.789
 there are three parts that I did for climbing 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.850
 and make a low say 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.450
 I'm just next year 07 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 You may be wearing a suitcase more than a girl, so she gets more dangerous. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 Are you going to do this because the careers 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 to it to be in good size 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 I'm nearing the end of my career. 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.890
 I go to me 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.570
 was buried and will now be in the third and carrying tracks with a dot in the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.880
 justice 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.170
 I go to my victory by 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.910
 I was very thick 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.910
 they reach high seas 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.930
 not to separate the finishing career 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.960
 but she came in at 12 noon 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.960
 inside the lower leg design 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.990
 and will learn from me what you will use to end 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.830
 giving wrong 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.990
 make a chain 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.870
 Now you're going to work on this one. 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.870
 A little more I'm using the same 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 that I did 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 I have is for every point you will put 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 until arrive 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.880
 to the corner 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 What is the beginning of the decade? 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.030
 Now you're going to pick up the other corner. 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.979
 on the other side the cushion 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.329
 will introduce water 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.019
 and will do 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.599
 a very low point 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.599
 How close is it? 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.579
 and keep working 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.359
 the casualties 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:29.599
 see you later 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.599
 in the corner of pepper 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.859
 We can close 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.579
 put it we have three chains so let's make three points 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.109
 will fall into the chain 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.849
 Let's get to today. 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.849
 start from u 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.779
 jack dorsey next 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.909
 I better observe two points of the rock 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.489
 I'm going to introduce curettage, I'm going to make a good 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.869
 I'll pick it up with one or the little corner of the ball. 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.419
 and make a small point 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.709
 holding on foot 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.709
 I'll keep on 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.189
 the low 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.189
 I found a hundred around the world every 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.169
 is that she can stay 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.789
 pet barrels 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.789
 close up 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.909
 this is the inner part of the track 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:46.800
 she accepts 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.259
 full of income 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:50.399
 of the stadium 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:53.019
 It's part of that time. 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.879
 the impression we have 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.749
 It's just lucky. 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.889
 decided to post a debut outside
