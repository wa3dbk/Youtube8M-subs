 raffaele vadalÃ  scandal envy 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:16.940
 I did well at first that he first 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:16.940
 he immediately gets social Russians inside 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.140
 bettega themes sistri treasures this 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.400
 special episode to cover passion e 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.990
 canales le bois 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.780
 first of all we thank the video for 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.390
 having sent us this fantastic gtx 780 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.730
 cold aid like every 7 80 the card 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.530
 led to 3gb of dedicated ram and a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.540
 cooling system that is mixed 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.520
 in air and then the liquid rushing the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.470
 two rm and the memories with the advent 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.660
 lantern and the processor with the liquid 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.760
 we therefore expect excellent temperatures 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.830
 and good performance we start protesting 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.080
 benchmark heads and kids this wants 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.760
 say start with a bang and do it 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.369
 we will test the two configurations in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.509
 primis with the 3d mark 2013 will come ago 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.250
 exact 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.440
 in fact, thanks to this text we can 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.060
 to notice immediately and above all the way more 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.580
 detailed of the main differences 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.710
 of the two configurations crisis loves why 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.110
 are testing at 780 with amd and with 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.180
 a well because some crazy 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.580
 unleashed will surely be passed for 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.160
 the head of buying a 7 80 and has 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.619
 covered with fx we do n't show them that 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.780
 that you will be able to obtain vi 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.640
 let's remember however that an i7 does not 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.200
 should be compared with fx 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.970
 but this is what we have is that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.160
 that we can offer the difference of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.000
 graphical texts however is about 2 or 3 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.069
 fps 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.959
 but let's go straight to the meter benchmark 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.670
 last light now entered into ours 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.520
 goods library mark as one of the most 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.990
 stressful for the right video cards 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.700
 exact raffa especially in a part a 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.160
 half when a lot of is used 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.310
 physics that is enabled as in 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.119
 our case the 30 40 fps at la7 80 he and 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.069
 lever none 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.349
 the difference in fact in this good but 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.720
 also it is only 4 vs average favors for 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.550
 inter noticing however too many fps 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.860
 in amd not wanting to give anything to 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.899
 no one even used a game 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.240
 decidedly heavy in some cases but that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.030
 it is not frightening our 7 80 if coupled 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.010
 ad inter with amd does not give the best of itself 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.200
 obviously encountering very high peaks 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.000
 drastic to the low and not exceeding 60 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.890
 average fps 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.420
 after all a lot depends also on the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.660
 optimizations of the right things e 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.430
 right but fuck that crap 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.380
 after all a lot depends also on the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.330
 optimizations of things right 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.220
 nothing more true and a striking example is 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.319
 own tomb raider that thanks to his 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.270
 optimization for md manages to do 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.270
 approaching the 130 euro processor a 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.380
 1 from 300 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.940
 obviously the thing is very much in the street and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.460
 sometimes but this makes us understand 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.200
 how much the optimization counts but without 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.240
 dwell too much on these little things 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.870
 of little importance we pass to the last test 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.360
 before via f or 4 to formula 1 2013 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.690
 in formula 1 we also don't understand 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.800
 where all this difference comes from 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.900
 operating system optimization 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.390
 processors clearly more powerful 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.160
 the only thing we know is that if you are 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.680
 of formula 1 lovers 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.760
 think about what you buy 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.260
 finally got to beat files 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.940
 what we notice is a difference 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.040
 almost minimal in most parts 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.959
 quiet instead takes advantage 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.580
 terms of a lot more substantial explosions 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.770
 probably due to management 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.240
 millions of resources and data before 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.280
 move on to what you see back here 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.380
 we send you some nests of 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.900
 images among the difference of the drivers 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.550
 board that we compared to 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.530
 latest beta drivers he released 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.150
 nvidia with the previous ones because according to that 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.940
 of them a better gaming experience 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.040
 in the 3dmark and the minimal difference in 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.830
 last light meter instead we gain in 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.900
 high but we lose a low ransom too 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.150
 in tf where the maximum minimum is earned 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.430
 and medium also follows closely from a raid 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.530
 just like tiff while formula 1 of 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.940
 beta driver loses something great 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.709
 work the one done by the video 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.510
 especially considering the driver 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.130
 still in beta before passing 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.170
 final considerations and to the content 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.209
 of the box we tested the card 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.900
 with three screens at a resolution of 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.720
 5700 60 x 1080i butterfield we have 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.570
 recorded maximum peaks of 45 50 fps 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.910
 of closed places obviously and about 20 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.860
 fps in stations where the explosions 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.660
 they were the masters apart from that 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.489
 what a fantastic experience there 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.229
 offers the enviable card from friends 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.060
 as for the card comes 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.950
 100 percent exploited throughout 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.690
 3 GB of ram are at the limit but the 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.760
 gonzalez processors temperature 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.290
 remember five serious considering that 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.750
 the band's equipment and noise 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.430
 audible and I think acceptable but if 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.350
 you don't have three screens and want to buy 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.729
 this card know for one 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.280
 full hd resolution 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.700
 the card hardly exceeds 40 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.720
 degrees even if used long hours of play 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.610
 particular also in the construction 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.560
 presenting a metal plate which 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.409
 cools the entire motherboard from 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.539
 memoirs 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.110
 m also has two connectors of 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.129
 power supply 8 and 6 and a connector 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.529
 extra for the coming wind 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.269
 supplied within it in fact it goes 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:01.619
 connected to that connector comes 

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:03.149
 adjusted together with the smaller one 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:05.069
 directly from the card to 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:07.559
 optimize temperatures and noise 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.300
 at the same time in the box define 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:12.449
 we find a mouse pad 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.909
 inotre video stickers nvidia various cables of 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.399
 link a vga adapter to want 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.599
 a cd containing the graphic driver and the 

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:20.819
 program for managing the card 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.439
 mother and to conclude a code of 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.110
 activation to redeem the 3dmark 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:27.300
 2013 the benchmark we always use 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.309
 obviously the instructions do not 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.589
 missing this video card 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:33.269
 does not disappoint and server blocked and capable of 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.349
 reach the older sister that is 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:36.269
 from 780 kg 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.579
 hoping this industrial quantity 

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:40.499
 of information you liked and there 

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:42.029
 are served we thank you for the 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.339
 see you see the next video a 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:48.019
 soon the comparison of the card with r 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.019
 92 90 slappa all
