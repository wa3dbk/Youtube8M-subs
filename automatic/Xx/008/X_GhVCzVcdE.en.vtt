00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.510 

so<00:01:51.509> here<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.409> we're<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.680> 3,000

so here you can see that we're at 3,000
rpms<00:01:53.969> and<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.299> seems<00:01:54.570> pretty<00:01:54.960> quiet<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.560> me

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:23.290 

it's<00:01:59.450> got<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.780> nice<00:02:00.070> sporty<00:02:01.070> growl<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:01.430> it

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.270 

hopefully<00:02:23.840> gaze<00:02:24.020> on<00:02:24.230> her<00:02:24.500> own<00:02:24.770> nice<00:02:25.010> that

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
hopefully gaze on her own nice that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:36.890 
hopefully gaze on her own nice that
sounds

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.449 

when<00:02:37.409> you're<00:02:37.530> off<00:02:37.650> throttle<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.250> pretty

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
when you're off throttle it's pretty

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.699 
when you're off throttle it's pretty
quiet<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.510> especially<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:39.989> freeway<00:02:40.379> speeds

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
quiet and especially a freeway speeds

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.800 
quiet and especially a freeway speeds
the<00:02:41.040> wind<00:02:41.340> always<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.000> actually<00:02:42.330> louder<00:02:42.510> than

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the wind always is actually louder than

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.229 
the wind always is actually louder than
the<00:02:42.900> exhaust<00:02:43.200> itself<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.010> really<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:45.060> not

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
the exhaust itself so it really it's not

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.229 
the exhaust itself so it really it's not
it's<00:02:46.170> not<00:02:46.319> droning<00:02:46.860> or<00:02:47.010> anything<00:02:47.159> it<00:02:48.090> only

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
it's not droning or anything it only

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.780 
it's not droning or anything it only
really<00:02:48.480> sounds<00:02:48.900> loud<00:02:49.140> or<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:50.069> know<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
really sounds loud or you know the

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.309 
really sounds loud or you know the
present<00:02:51.299> when<00:02:51.420> you're<00:02:51.569> really<00:02:51.810> jumping<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.290> it

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
present when you're really jumping on it

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.420 
present when you're really jumping on it
like<00:02:52.530> this

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
like this

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.809 
like this
these<00:02:54.879> things<00:02:55.150> enough<00:02:56.019> for<00:02:56.260> about<00:02:56.430> 4500<00:02:57.430> rpm

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
these things enough for about 4500 rpm

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.459 
these things enough for about 4500 rpm
it<00:02:58.000> starts<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.329> taper<00:02:58.540> off<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> little<00:02:59.049> bit<00:02:59.230> too

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
it starts to taper off a little bit too

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.080 
it starts to taper off a little bit too
so<00:02:59.769> it<00:02:59.859> doesn't<00:03:00.189> death<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.790> or<00:03:00.939> anything

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
so it doesn't death and you or anything

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.570 
so it doesn't death and you or anything
like<00:03:01.299> that

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.160 

it's<00:03:03.700> early<00:03:03.940> loudest<00:03:04.390> probably<00:03:04.840> around<00:03:04.960> about

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
it's early loudest probably around about

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.310 
it's early loudest probably around about
2,500<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.010> 3,000<00:03:06.670> kind<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.600> Torquay

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
2,500 and 3,000 kind of in that Torquay

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.589 
2,500 and 3,000 kind of in that Torquay
area<00:03:08.800> below<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.580> Torquay<00:03:09.970> area

area below in Torquay area

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.130 
area below in Torquay area
so<00:03:12.349> let's<00:03:12.499> talk<00:03:12.620> about<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.950> tornado

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
so let's talk about that tornado

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.790 
so let's talk about that tornado
yeah<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.520> can<00:03:16.700> definitely<00:03:16.850> feel<00:03:17.330> it

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
yeah so you can definitely feel it

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.100 
yeah so you can definitely feel it
there's<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.860> little<00:03:19.130> bit<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.960> kind<00:03:20.960> of<00:03:20.990> in

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
there's a little bit of a kind of in

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.140 
there's a little bit of a kind of in
that<00:03:21.260> mid-range

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
that mid-range

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.550 
that mid-range
for<00:03:23.150> daily<00:03:23.360> driving<00:03:23.480> it's<00:03:23.810> not<00:03:23.960> too<00:03:24.200> big<00:03:24.350> fit

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
for daily driving it's not too big fit

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.250 
for daily driving it's not too big fit
deal<00:03:25.210> because<00:03:26.210> you<00:03:26.450> do<00:03:26.600> have<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.780> lot<00:03:26.960> of<00:03:27.050> torque

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
deal because you do have a lot of torque

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
deal because you do have a lot of torque
down<00:03:27.380> low<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.800> don't<00:03:27.950> really<00:03:28.070> need<00:03:28.220> to

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
down low you don't really need to

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.700 
down low you don't really need to
downshift<00:03:28.520> a<00:03:28.910> whole<00:03:29.090> lot<00:03:29.300> or<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.690> shift<00:03:29.960> to

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
downshift a whole lot or of shift to

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.890 
downshift a whole lot or of shift to
really<00:03:30.920> get<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.220> because<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:32.120> have<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.420> on<00:03:32.660> tap

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
really get it because you have it on tap

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.120 
really get it because you have it on tap
for<00:03:33.170> any<00:03:33.350> well<00:03:33.500> whenever<00:03:33.770> you're<00:03:33.950> just

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
for any well whenever you're just

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.390 
for any well whenever you're just
cruising<00:03:34.490> around

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
cruising around

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.710 
cruising around
and<00:03:36.549> one<00:03:36.790> thing<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.030> when<00:03:37.360> we<00:03:37.480> were<00:03:37.569> doing

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
and one thing that when we were doing

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.050 
and one thing that when we were doing
testing<00:03:38.260> with<00:03:38.500> me<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:39.010> take<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.640> nameless

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
testing with me you take the nameless

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.509 
testing with me you take the nameless
intake<00:03:40.629> that<00:03:40.810> they<00:03:40.959> developed<00:03:41.379> a<00:03:41.650> lot<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.400> that

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
intake that they developed a lot of that

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.369 
intake that they developed a lot of that
torque<00:03:42.790> dip<00:03:43.000> did<00:03:43.239> go<00:03:43.450> away<00:03:43.569> so<00:03:43.780> I'm<00:03:44.170> pretty

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
torque dip did go away so I'm pretty

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.180 
torque dip did go away so I'm pretty
excited<00:03:44.709> about<00:03:44.950> seeing<00:03:46.709> what<00:03:47.709> kind<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:47.920> intake

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
excited about seeing what kind of intake

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.850 
excited about seeing what kind of intake
designs<00:03:48.489> we<00:03:48.670> get<00:03:48.879> and<00:03:49.470> seeing<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.590> torque

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
designs we get and seeing that torque

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.530 
designs we get and seeing that torque
dip<00:03:51.040> really<00:03:51.280> go<00:03:51.400> away<00:03:51.459> especially<00:03:51.879> when<00:03:52.209> it

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
dip really go away especially when it

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.080 
dip really go away especially when it
comes<00:03:52.659> out<00:03:52.870> as<00:03:52.959> well

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
comes out as well

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.210 
comes out as well
some<00:03:55.900> pretty<00:03:56.200> interesting<00:03:56.410> things<00:03:56.650> happen<00:03:57.160> to

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
some pretty interesting things happen to

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.970 
some pretty interesting things happen to
that

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.220 

and<00:04:04.069> now<00:04:04.310> they<00:04:04.550> exhaust<00:04:04.849> how<00:04:05.120> do<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.330> has<00:04:06.200> a

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
and now they exhaust how do you has a

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.470 
and now they exhaust how do you has a
feel<00:04:06.680> me<00:04:07.640> like<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:07.940> know<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.269> you<00:04:08.360> have

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
feel me like I know that you have

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.119 
feel me like I know that you have
experienced<00:04:09.050> the<00:04:09.349> torque<00:04:09.560> did<00:04:09.680> when<00:04:09.920> I<00:04:09.950> was

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
experienced the torque did when I was

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.309 
experienced the torque did when I was
stalked<00:04:11.890> out<00:04:12.890> it's<00:04:13.250> less<00:04:13.750> herky-jerky<00:04:14.750> in<00:04:15.230> the

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
stalked out it's less herky-jerky in the

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.090 
stalked out it's less herky-jerky in the
torque<00:04:15.530> tip<00:04:15.739> at<00:04:16.609> stock<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.209> was<00:04:17.329> kind<00:04:17.570> of<00:04:17.630> like

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
torque tip at stock it was kind of like

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.349 
torque tip at stock it was kind of like
and<00:04:19.100> this<00:04:19.250> might<00:04:19.459> have<00:04:19.579> had<00:04:19.669> a<00:04:19.700> break-in<00:04:20.030> issue

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
and this might have had a break-in issue

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.780 
and this might have had a break-in issue
a<00:04:20.570> little<00:04:20.750> bit<00:04:20.930> but<00:04:21.079> it<00:04:21.139> wasn't<00:04:21.410> as<00:04:21.500> smooth<00:04:21.829> the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
a little bit but it wasn't as smooth the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.430 
a little bit but it wasn't as smooth the
exhaust<00:04:23.240> definitely<00:04:23.720> smooth<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.229> out<00:04:24.290> a

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
exhaust definitely smooth that out a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.050 
exhaust definitely smooth that out a
little<00:04:24.590> bit<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:25.040> might<00:04:25.190> not<00:04:25.370> have<00:04:25.550> give<00:04:25.850> much

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
little bit it might not have give much

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.150 
little bit it might not have give much
more<00:04:26.090> power<00:04:26.570> but<00:04:27.290> it's<00:04:27.440> definitely<00:04:27.590> smoothed

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
more power but it's definitely smoothed

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.129 
more power but it's definitely smoothed
it<00:04:28.370> out<00:04:28.490> where<00:04:28.729> it<00:04:28.850> doesn't<00:04:29.060> feel<00:04:29.540> like<00:04:29.600> such<00:04:30.110> a

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
it out where it doesn't feel like such a

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.590 
it out where it doesn't feel like such a
memo<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:31.310> mean<00:04:31.460> they<00:04:31.580> feel<00:04:31.790> kind<00:04:32.479> of<00:04:32.510> a

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
memo you mean they feel kind of a

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.360 
memo you mean they feel kind of a
gliding<00:04:33.020> where<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.620> kind<00:04:33.800> of<00:04:33.830> glides<00:04:34.100> down<00:04:34.250> a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
gliding where it kind of glides down a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.680 
gliding where it kind of glides down a
little<00:04:34.639> bit<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.060> then<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.270> kind<00:04:35.450> of<00:04:35.479> picks

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
little bit and then it kind of picks

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.090 
little bit and then it kind of picks
back<00:04:35.870> up<00:04:36.139> and<00:04:36.380> about<00:04:36.530> 45

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.980 

you<00:04:39.610> can<00:04:39.760> definitely<00:04:39.880> feel<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.630> smoothness

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
you can definitely feel that smoothness

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.379 
you can definitely feel that smoothness
to<00:04:41.260> it

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
to it

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.879 
to it
it's<00:04:42.810> also<00:04:42.960> interesting<00:04:43.289> too<00:04:43.620> because<00:04:43.650> you

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
it's also interesting too because you

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.499 
it's also interesting too because you
can<00:04:44.069> definitely<00:04:44.189> tie<00:04:44.639> it<00:04:44.699> to<00:04:44.969> the<00:04:45.090> sound<00:04:45.360> of

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
can definitely tie it to the sound of

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.270 
can definitely tie it to the sound of
the<00:04:45.599> exhaust<00:04:45.689> a<00:04:46.080> little<00:04:46.110> bit<00:04:46.379> better<00:04:46.500> which<00:04:47.129> is

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
the exhaust a little bit better which is

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.709 
the exhaust a little bit better which is
funny<00:04:47.490> because<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.819> exhaust<00:04:48.060> is<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.419> loudest

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
funny because the exhaust is the loudest

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.959 
funny because the exhaust is the loudest
in<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.050> middle<00:04:49.289> of<00:04:49.379> torque<00:04:49.590> dip

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
in the middle of torque dip

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.359 
in the middle of torque dip
and<00:04:51.449> then<00:04:51.629> you<00:04:51.779> feel<00:04:52.049> the<00:04:52.589> exhaust<00:04:52.919> kinda<00:04:53.219> gets

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:53.369 
and then you feel the exhaust kinda gets

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:54.619 
and then you feel the exhaust kinda gets
quieter<00:04:53.789> when<00:04:54.029> the<00:04:54.119> torque<00:04:54.329> tip<00:04:54.449> goes<00:04:54.599> back

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
quieter when the torque tip goes back

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.899 
quieter when the torque tip goes back
away<00:04:55.049> so<00:04:56.039> it's<00:04:56.399> a<00:04:56.459> little<00:04:56.579> counterintuitive

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
away so it's a little counterintuitive

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:58.489 
away so it's a little counterintuitive
there<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:57.509> it<00:04:57.599> is<00:04:57.689> kind<00:04:57.929> of<00:04:57.959> nice

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 
there but it is kind of nice

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:00.109 
there but it is kind of nice
you<00:04:58.589> get<00:04:58.739> your<00:04:59.069> feedback<00:04:59.279> out<00:04:59.699> of<00:04:59.819> the<00:04:59.909> exhaust

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:00.119 
you get your feedback out of the exhaust

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:08.180 
you get your feedback out of the exhaust
sound

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.499 

that's<00:05:09.190> nice<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.550> aggressive<00:05:09.699> it's<00:05:10.120> not<00:05:10.270> very

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
that's nice and aggressive it's not very

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.879 
that's nice and aggressive it's not very
loud<00:05:10.720> we're<00:05:11.139> able<00:05:11.199> to<00:05:11.409> still<00:05:11.620> hold<00:05:11.740> a

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
loud we're able to still hold a

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.649 
loud we're able to still hold a
conversation<00:05:12.520> in<00:05:12.610> here<00:05:12.849> during<00:05:13.120> when<00:05:13.479> I'm

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
conversation in here during when I'm

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.320 
conversation in here during when I'm
wide<00:05:14.080> open<00:05:14.319> throttle<00:05:14.560> you<00:05:14.889> know<00:05:15.180> so<00:05:16.180> that's

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
wide open throttle you know so that's

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.490 
wide open throttle you know so that's
nice<00:05:16.770> Nosa

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
nice Nosa

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.670 
nice Nosa
you<00:05:20.160> just<00:05:20.340> be<00:05:20.430> like<00:05:20.550> Florida<00:05:21.210> yeah<00:05:22.140> grab<00:05:22.650> a

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
you just be like Florida yeah grab a

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.550 
you just be like Florida yeah grab a
bumper<00:05:22.980> station<00:05:23.250> there's<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.390> two<00:05:25.170> mufflers

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
bumper station there's the two mufflers

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.670 
bumper station there's the two mufflers
they're<00:05:25.980> 5-inch<00:05:26.550> custom-made<00:05:27.420> designs<00:05:28.290> from

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
they're 5-inch custom-made designs from

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.240 
they're 5-inch custom-made designs from
aimless<00:05:29.130> performance<00:05:29.610> on<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.480> axle<00:05:30.810> back<00:05:31.250> and

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
aimless performance on the axle back and

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.190 
aimless performance on the axle back and
they<00:05:32.340> decided<00:05:32.790> to<00:05:32.820> keep<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.150> stock<00:05:33.480> mid<00:05:33.900> pipe

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
they decided to keep the stock mid pipe

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.830 
they decided to keep the stock mid pipe
with<00:05:34.500> resonator<00:05:35.040> because<00:05:35.550> they<00:05:36.390> did

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
with resonator because they did

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.230 
with resonator because they did
fabricate<00:05:37.410> up<00:05:37.560> an<00:05:37.950> aftermarket<00:05:38.430> one<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.120> it

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
fabricate up an aftermarket one and it

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.390 
fabricate up an aftermarket one and it
just<00:05:39.450> made<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:39.720> car<00:05:39.930> sound<00:05:40.350> really<00:05:40.860> loud<00:05:41.100> and

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
just made the car sound really loud and

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.920 
just made the car sound really loud and
crappy<00:05:41.730> and<00:05:42.240> undulating

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
crappy and undulating

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.410 
crappy and undulating
and<00:05:43.590> it<00:05:43.740> didn't<00:05:43.980> make<00:05:44.100> any<00:05:44.310> power<00:05:44.490> at<00:05:44.670> all<00:05:44.730> so

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
and it didn't make any power at all so

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.700 
and it didn't make any power at all so
they're<00:05:45.570> recommending<00:05:46.110> people<00:05:46.380> keep<00:05:46.530> their

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
they're recommending people keep their

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.980 
they're recommending people keep their
stock<00:05:46.950> made<00:05:47.160> pipe<00:05:47.430> they<00:05:48.000> go<00:05:48.180> with<00:05:48.390> an<00:05:48.630> axle

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
stock made pipe they go with an axle

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.650 
stock made pipe they go with an axle
back<00:05:49.080> down<00:05:49.350> pipe<00:05:49.590> combo<00:05:50.100> or<00:05:50.790> ultimately

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
back down pipe combo or ultimately

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.840 
back down pipe combo or ultimately
probably<00:05:51.930> headers<00:05:52.440> because<00:05:52.650> that<00:05:53.340> original

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
probably headers because that original

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.080 
probably headers because that original
the<00:05:54.090> first<00:05:55.190> catalytic<00:05:56.190> converter<00:05:56.490> is<00:05:56.700> sitting

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
the first catalytic converter is sitting

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.250 
the first catalytic converter is sitting
there<00:05:57.270> yet

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.990 

so<00:06:00.860> that's<00:06:01.580> what<00:06:01.760> they're<00:06:01.880> recommending

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
so that's what they're recommending

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.110 
so that's what they're recommending
right<00:06:02.780> now<00:06:02.930> and<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:04.250> think<00:06:04.400> they're<00:06:04.640> axle-back

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
right now and I think they're axle-back

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.390 
right now and I think they're axle-back
we'll<00:06:05.330> start<00:06:05.570> going<00:06:05.690> on<00:06:05.930> sale

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
we'll start going on sale

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.900 
we'll start going on sale
middle<00:06:08.030> of<00:06:08.150> Jude<00:06:08.900> but<00:06:09.650> until<00:06:10.100> then<00:06:10.340> I<00:06:10.669> believe

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
middle of Jude but until then I believe

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.150 
middle of Jude but until then I believe
you<00:06:10.940> can<00:06:11.150> do<00:06:11.300> pre-orders<00:06:11.840> in<00:06:11.990> red

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
you can do pre-orders in red

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.860 
you can do pre-orders in red
I<00:06:13.220> would<00:06:13.700> recommend<00:06:13.970> it<00:06:14.510> looks<00:06:14.720> a<00:06:14.780> little

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
I would recommend it looks a little

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.030 
I would recommend it looks a little
higher<00:06:15.080> quality<00:06:15.530> than<00:06:15.650> some<00:06:15.860> of<00:06:15.980> the

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
higher quality than some of the

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.250 
higher quality than some of the
