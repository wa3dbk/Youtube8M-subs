we<00:01:08.509> also<00:01:08.659> review<00:01:09.500> at<00:01:09.590> another<00:01:09.880> another<00:01:10.900> review

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
we also review at another another review

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.840 
we also review at another another review
on<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.049> site<00:01:12.229> is<00:01:13.009> that<00:01:13.159> this<00:01:13.280> has<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.520> tongue

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
on the site is that this has a tongue

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.480 
on the site is that this has a tongue
that<00:01:14.030> pops<00:01:14.299> in<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:14.600> out<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.920> if<00:01:16.070> you're<00:01:16.249> going

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
that pops in and out so if you're going

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.459 
that pops in and out so if you're going
uphill<00:01:17.259> you<00:01:18.259> can<00:01:18.700> pop<00:01:19.700> your<00:01:19.729> tongue<00:01:20.090> out<00:01:20.469> like

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
uphill you can pop your tongue out like

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.529 
uphill you can pop your tongue out like
that<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:21.829> this<00:01:21.979> comes<00:01:22.249> out<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:23.409> have<00:01:25.539> used

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
that and then this comes out I have used

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.380 
that and then this comes out I have used
the<00:01:26.719> tongue<00:01:26.929> in<00:01:27.109> and<00:01:27.259> tongue<00:01:27.499> out<00:01:27.649> and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
the tongue in and tongue out and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.639 
the tongue in and tongue out and
generally<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.420> just<00:01:29.509> leave<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.869> in<00:01:30.079> I<00:01:30.289> find<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.619> a

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
generally I just leave it in I find it a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.010 
generally I just leave it in I find it a
little<00:01:30.770> bit<00:01:31.009> fussy<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:32.119> pull<00:01:32.299> in<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.509> out<00:01:32.630> so

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
little bit fussy to pull in and out so

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.459 
little bit fussy to pull in and out so
but<00:01:33.619> maybe<00:01:33.770> if<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.069> was<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.219> super<00:01:34.579> long<00:01:35.469> up

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
but maybe if it was a super long up

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.940 
but maybe if it was a super long up
track<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:36.979> might<00:01:37.159> take<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.369> out<00:01:38.530> so<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.560> can<00:01:39.740> see

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
track I might take it out so you can see

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.639 
track I might take it out so you can see
it's<00:01:40.659> fairly<00:01:41.659> easy<00:01:42.079> to<00:01:42.319> get<00:01:42.469> back<00:01:42.619> in<00:01:42.829> there

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
it's fairly easy to get back in there

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.620 
it's fairly easy to get back in there
but<00:01:45.649> this<00:01:45.770> basically<00:01:46.249> is<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.789> boot<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:47.270> use

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
but this basically is a boot that I use

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.580 
but this basically is a boot that I use
at<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.109> resort<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.770> also<00:01:49.840> on<00:01:50.840> touring<00:01:51.319> it's

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
at the resort and also on touring it's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.419 
at the resort and also on touring it's
kind<00:01:51.799> of<00:01:51.920> light<00:01:52.369> enough<00:01:53.289> that<00:01:54.289> you<00:01:54.709> can<00:01:54.889> you

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
kind of light enough that you can you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.669 
kind of light enough that you can you
can<00:01:55.579> tour<00:01:55.819> with<00:01:55.969> it<00:01:56.119> but<00:01:56.240> it's<00:01:56.359> also<00:01:56.679> stiff

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
can tour with it but it's also stiff

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.459 
can tour with it but it's also stiff
enough<00:01:57.829> but<00:01:58.130> it's<00:01:58.249> good<00:01:58.399> for<00:01:58.579> a<00:01:58.609> resort<00:01:58.909> boot

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
enough but it's good for a resort boot

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.749 
enough but it's good for a resort boot
so<00:02:00.469> we're<00:02:00.649> pretty<00:02:00.770> happy<00:02:00.950> with<00:02:01.249> the<00:02:01.369> Dena<00:02:01.549> fit
