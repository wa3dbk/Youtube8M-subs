yes so this is my brand-new max torque
clutch<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.979> just<00:00:07.979> picked<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.219> up<00:00:08.280> today<00:00:08.870> and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
clutch I just picked it up today and

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.600 
clutch I just picked it up today and
I've<00:00:10.080> been<00:00:10.230> trying<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.469> find<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:11.130> dimensions

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
I've been trying to find the dimensions

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.909 
I've been trying to find the dimensions
on<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.990> because<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.019> searched<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.679> searched

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:13.919 
on it because I searched and searched

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.499 
on it because I searched and searched
and<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.070> couldn't<00:00:14.370> find<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.030> dimensions

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
and I couldn't find the dimensions

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.420 
and I couldn't find the dimensions
because<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.870> needed<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.320> know<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> dimensions

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
because I needed to know the dimensions

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.140 
because I needed to know the dimensions
at<00:00:17.610> the<00:00:17.700> clutch<00:00:17.910> harder<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:19.220> finish<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
at the clutch harder to finish up the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.910 
at the clutch harder to finish up the
leg<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:22.170> my<00:00:22.380> shaft<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:23.400> my<00:00:23.660> boat<00:00:24.660> more<00:00:24.920> Benway

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
leg of my shaft for my boat more Benway

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.250 
leg of my shaft for my boat more Benway
but<00:00:26.100> I<00:00:26.130> finally<00:00:26.430> got<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.900> took<00:00:27.900> me<00:00:27.960> forever

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
but I finally got one took me forever

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.299 
but I finally got one took me forever
and<00:00:29.480> this<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.710> pushed<00:00:31.950> all<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.189> way

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and this this is it pushed all the way

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.220 
and this this is it pushed all the way
back<00:00:33.230> towards<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.440> boat<00:00:34.679> engine<00:00:35.129> and<00:00:36.170> this<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
back towards the boat engine and this is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.650 
back towards the boat engine and this is
number<00:00:37.769> three<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:38.070> five<00:00:38.300> sprocket<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.480> right

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
number three to five sprocket and right

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
number three to five sprocket and right
here<00:00:39.839> it's<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.890> had<00:00:41.039> on<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.219> first<00:00:41.640> but

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
here it's what I had on that first but

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.889 
here it's what I had on that first but
someone<00:00:42.329> recommended<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.140> use<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> clutch

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
someone recommended that I use a clutch

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.270 
someone recommended that I use a clutch
rather<00:00:45.899> than<00:00:46.109> just<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.409> sprocket<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:47.190> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
rather than just a sprocket because it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.410 
rather than just a sprocket because it
might<00:00:47.429> stall<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> engine<00:00:47.909> or<00:00:48.179> what<00:00:48.269> have<00:00:48.390> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
might stall the engine or what have you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.669 
might stall the engine or what have you
so<00:00:48.920> if<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.070> look<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.999> exact<00:00:51.539> same

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
so if you look at it it's the exact same

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.610 
so if you look at it it's the exact same
socket<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.899> could<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.350> pull<00:00:55.499> my

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
socket so on I could just pull my

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.340 
socket so on I could just pull my
measurements<00:00:56.010> off<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.159> this<00:00:56.339> basically<00:00:57.350> but

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
measurements off of this basically but

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.610 
measurements off of this basically but
um<00:00:58.499> but<00:00:59.429> I<00:00:59.489> won't<00:00:59.670> no<00:00:59.789> such<00:00:59.999> dimensions<00:01:00.479> and<00:01:00.749> my

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
um but I won't no such dimensions and my

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.000 
um but I won't no such dimensions and my
engine<00:01:01.800> which<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.670> predator<00:01:03.030> engine<00:01:04.010> came

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
engine which is the predator engine came

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:16.580 
engine which is the predator engine came
with<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:08.270> 3/16<00:01:09.320> keyway<00:01:14.240> winnowing<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
with a 3/16 keyway winnowing but the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.030 
with a 3/16 keyway winnowing but the
keeper<00:01:16.800> here<00:01:17.100> these<00:01:18.170> came<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> 3/16

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
keeper here these came with a 3/16

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.700 
keeper here these came with a 3/16
cueing<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.940> which<00:01:21.660> was<00:01:21.840> basically<00:01:22.020> too<00:01:22.470> long

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
cueing and which was basically too long

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
cueing and which was basically too long

in so I wanna say I need to know how far
with<00:01:57.850> my<00:01:57.970> sprockets<00:01:58.509> come<00:01:59.080> from<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.560> back<00:01:59.710> of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
with my sprockets come from the back of

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.460 
with my sprockets come from the back of
this<00:02:00.039> I<00:02:00.280> guess<00:02:00.940> you<00:02:01.060> call<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.450> hub<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:02.409> I

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
this I guess you call it the hub so I

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.590 
this I guess you call it the hub so I
can<00:02:02.619> know<00:02:02.740> how<00:02:02.890> far<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.190> learn<00:02:03.490> place<00:02:03.880> this

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
can know how far to learn place this

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.219 
can know how far to learn place this
piece<00:02:04.869> down<00:02:06.000> anyway<00:02:07.000> me<00:02:07.750> see<00:02:07.960> if<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.080> can

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
piece down anyway me see if I can

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.419 
piece down anyway me see if I can
measure<00:02:08.350> this<00:02:08.590> for<00:02:08.800> y'all

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429
