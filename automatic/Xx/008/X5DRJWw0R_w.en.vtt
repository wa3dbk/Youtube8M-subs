I<00:01:39.369> don't<00:01:39.820> know<00:01:39.880> what<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.149> says<00:01:40.329> about<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.810> six

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
I don't know what it says about the six

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.539 
I don't know what it says about the six
teams<00:01:41.290> that<00:01:41.470> have<00:01:41.560> elected<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.009> run<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.520> be

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
teams that have elected to run to be

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.340 
teams that have elected to run to be
honest<00:01:42.939> maybe<00:01:43.180> they<00:01:43.420> contract<00:01:43.869> early<00:01:44.110> bound

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
honest maybe they contract early bound

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.639 
honest maybe they contract early bound
but<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:46.119> know<00:01:46.240> they<00:01:46.750> they<00:01:47.320> should<00:01:47.380> have

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
but you know they they should have

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
joined up and find a solution to I think

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.090 
joined up and find a solution to I think
they're<00:01:49.659> probably<00:01:49.899> just<00:01:50.140> as<00:01:50.350> guilty<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.860> doing

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
they're probably just as guilty of doing

they're probably just as guilty of doing

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
the wrong things as the guys at the pit

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.310 
the wrong things as the guys at the pit
in<00:01:53.229> many<00:01:53.560> respects<00:01:54.070> because<00:01:54.850> they're<00:01:55.030> here

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in many respects because they're here

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.380 
in many respects because they're here
they<00:01:56.320> failed<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.399> help<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.789> solution<00:01:58.240> be

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
they failed to help the solution be
