00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 hop 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.140
 ooh hello there timo is what you can 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.160
 explain that is what it is this 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.160
 this machine 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.930
 to operate on two batteries at 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.240
 slow loads so we search them 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.700
 every night there you have a small 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.050
 accelerator and after there are two 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.940
 sensors so if we want to hang out at 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.570
 left we press the left foot the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.160
 Machine we right 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.750
 so we have two crates on the side yes 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.730
 in which one will be registered to pick up 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.850
 these are the types of questions 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.650
 no problem we can already very much agree 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:20.380
 on the machine you already sort the 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:25.390
 fat and chinese who complained 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:31.960
 we put them behind so we self 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:34.119
 we know that we can harvest at several 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.420
 on the machine and other people to 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.050
 side who pick up by hand and who poses 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.250
 on the good plus I pick up his eight 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.759
 other people to carry crates 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.710
 full economists to pick up 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.070
 the afternoon we installed a parasol 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.570
 to harvest with sun or rain 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.570
 there is no problem we are safe 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.420
 okay so I understand the purpose 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.030
 of the machine is to go faster and 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.649
 less and less fatigue actually 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.130
 less tired well after that 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.550
 work other muscles in 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.010
 the church behind the back and the shoulders 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.060
 also more is that we 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.090
 pick up with both hands we have them 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.340
 hands free yeah 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.590
 and since we are not from the ground we arrive 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.400
 see the asparagus and we can better 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.580
 pick up the time saving and in 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.260
 fatigue too 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.260
 ok thanks for this explanation
