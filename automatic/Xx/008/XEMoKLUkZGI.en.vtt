00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.080

 days when the sun does not set 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.780
 So we have 24 hours daylight and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.020
 my village is here because in 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.110

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.090

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.940

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.000
 my house is not far from here 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.650
 It is the Santa Claus office there can 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.690
 I meet my visitors 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.340
 if you want to know more about Santa Claus 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.840
 want to find out there 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.709
 watch this video as the bvb 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.810
 comes a post office every year that is 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.590
 differently 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.420
 but the last few years have been between 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.049
 500,000 and 700,000 letters 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.170
 that is a lot of post from which 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.590
 Countries come from all over the letters 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.930
 they come from the world 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.530
 single world i believe last year 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.720
 160 countries were like you 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.910
 Lapland modest, it is its own 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.849
 Land is not a Lapland country 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.110
 the northernmost region in finland where 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.330
 The nature is really unique to us 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.930
 have very different seasons 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.470
 because if you fall more lapland 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.260
 want 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.900
 Watch this video Santa Claus 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.470
 up to rap residence or king of 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.579
 Lapland 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.700
 no, you glorious we have lapland 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.310
 no not at all or presidents though 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.160
 Finland the whole country has one 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.530
 President and he does his job 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.629

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.140
 year over in rovaniemi your home 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.989
 Of course, you can attend a financial visit 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.989
 by car to the train or plane 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.389

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.230

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.170
 visit 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.709
 if you learn more about nirvana 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.810
 would like to 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:47.950
 Watch this video Santa Claus 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.540
 were from toy workshops my 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.209
 toys where we have the whole toy 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.670
 I still lie north of here but that 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.500
 is a secret place of choir maintenance 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.380
 called glasses is there is mine 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.650
 real home and your city of mine 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.950
 but considerate because through all christmas 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.480
 I can unfortunately take secrets 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.730
 invite there 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.250
 That's why we have this beautiful village around 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.099
 Finding people has the word correct 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.079
 and without meaning 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:24.750
 Horvath and really has a meaning 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:27.610
 of jazz means and tundra is one 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.419
 Mine has two peaks 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.250
 if you see him from afar 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.200
 Santa Claus how many reindeer have 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.340
 That's a difficult question 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.190
 because seen would be free to run around 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.460
 handlebar is actually a wild animal 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.190
 like in the forest and in the mountains 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.590
 running around 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.910
 but I would say there are so many 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.190
 how stars in the sky if you have more 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.360
 we take out want to watch 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.360
 look at this video 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:09.260
 Of course, canon reindeers fly 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.590
 you can fly but only on 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:16.000
 Christmas Eve because then we are the Christmas 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.000
 to distribute gifts 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.900
 Santa Claus distributed the 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.350
 Christmas presents to children on the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.410
 whole world in just one night that is 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.680
 a difficult question may not 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.620
 forgot that I'm the imp 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.430
 pay for very long gifts 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.000
 to distribute 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.520
 these gifts are I like we use 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.630
 also the different time zones too 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.140
 our advantage but that remains ours 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.140
 secret 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.590
 now it is in the evening, for example 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:59.030
 nominated but in another part of the 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:02.330
 World kids are just crying for him again 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.130
 sleeping or eating another part 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.520
 for lunch 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.800
 there are also other things and the 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.170
 Do not even tell my story

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.920
