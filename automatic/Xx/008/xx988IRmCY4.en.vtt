00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello everyone and welcome this new one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.990
 video today we see the unboxing of choice 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.630
 xbox one of the last title from ice 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.099
 or butterfield 4 so let's say 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.950
 look at the part packaging 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.780
 front had no game title 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.060
 of particular 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.550
 behind we find myself alone in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.870
 butterfield okay the stresses that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.330
 enhance the title comes only 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.600
 from the fact that at the level of players 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.200
 I don't know if you can read but you know 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.370
 enlarge on xbox live restored 2 to 66 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.370
 players simultaneously 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.850
 inside the package say it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 packaging gives us as much space as necessary 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 up to 40 gigabytes per installation 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.450
 in fact, xbox one games require a lot 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.550
 space for installation other thing to 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.000
 say about the price I have here 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.140
 found 72 euros and 99 list price even though 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.420
 I paid 15 euros 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.590
 as a game the fact is that the price of 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.850
 list with which increased by 3 euros 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.050
 so normally I will ask this question 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.520
 to see also in other chains for the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.530
 moment xbox one game costs a 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.550
 more or less so said this 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.550
 we have the packaging 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.930
 ok after unpacking we open the 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.680
 pack even if something is left 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.980
 attacked then we open we find 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.970
 inverted the position between disc and 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:34.990
 manual so here we have the disc in 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.479
 xbox wan blue ray version practically 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.850
 on the other side the instruction manual 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.860
 let 's look at the packaging it now offers 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.060
 the logo is better seen in the background 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.740
 of the xbox 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.900
 there is also the guarantee seal which 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.229
 I try we have taken away here 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.080
 instruction manual as usual 9 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.280
 with two written pages right advertising 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.080
 so nothing exciting 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.869
 oh well for the moment everything is a 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.060

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.810

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.480
