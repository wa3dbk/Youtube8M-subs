00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello everyone with you sorcerer something 2001 and 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.370
 today I will show you how you can still 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.190
 break bedrock 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.620
 minecraft version 1 7 2 and up i.e. 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.480
 newer version you first think 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.920
 how can you still break bedrock floor 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.689
 it is unrealistic not to break it even 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.000
 you can't break even super for 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.849
 even diamond buttons 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.099
 you see he does not break in any way but there is one 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.390
 super bug with which we can 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.090
 break bedrock 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.090
 doing nothing but doing nothing 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.010
 we don't need any picks or anything 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.559
 some kind of private us nothing 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.410
 no need rams you may need 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.050
 dark oak and bone seedling 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.870
 flour let's collect it all this 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.700
 sin 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.160
 look we dig up 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:59.190
 where we need to break that is 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:04.019
 the most friend you see is that his sammad 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:13.500
 but with this step, the mi-8 is now 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:15.240
 I can't dig it out now 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.750
 crap like you want us to 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.750
 more to be enough not 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.439
 Well, I think that's enough for us 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:39.759
 turned green as we dug out this territory 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:43.539
 we land we expose 4 lands and 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.789
 we put there to 4 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.490
 dark oak saplings then we stood to 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.399
 him back to back and start growing 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.140
 one seedling how do you know if their 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.850
 grow if they stand immediately 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.050
 texet 4 things grow 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.990
 like a jungle tree a tree is very high 4 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.709
 your on very thick here let's go 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.760
 Now let's do that 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.100
 the tree has grown but nothing you think 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.030
 nothing has changed but in fact everything 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.090
 right approach into it is 5 butt and 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:29.690
 break give lower 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:34.010
 trees so petticoats here then we 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:46.660
 again their height h and again we start them 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:46.660
 grow again we break and again we plant in 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.489
 Russia good doctors so that we have 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.829
 I can't get it soon, download us all 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:09.519
 it will turn out so darker about us let's 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:12.739
 so let's put all again somehow so 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.940
 here we have everything turned out you see then 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:22.359
 that we are stuck in benglis 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.359
 from tweed then we just break it and 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.440
 when we broke it 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:36.900
 you can do it yourself 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:40.170
 what is in some places now and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.540
 such an oak if we break it below 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.120
 there will be another oak tree 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.090
 cosmos ie bedrok himself broke we 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.170
 we are left from the tree to look for you 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.850
 see here is no bedrock and you can 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.740
 watch the space bows yes there 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.600
 I don't know any trash 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.610
 it's very cool and it's very me 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.130
 I like it very much 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:08.150
 This tank here as it is generally impossible 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.740
 break bedrock 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.110
 in no other way can there 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.850
 surely squeeze somewhere else in 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.510
 solitary is unfair 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.580
 I can't do this 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.640
 very cool bug and he is very me 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.320

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.560

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.890
 it is desirable that they were good so 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.480
 as most people just write well 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.700

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.410
