00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.869
 that if you have children in the house that do not

 they want to eat fruits and vegetables you want 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.580
 lose weight or level cholesterol and 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.650
 the sugar in your body because you are in the 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.560
 youtube channel indicated and today we are going to 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.109

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.329
 you heard good gorditas light or as 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.519
 they like my South American friends and 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.590
 Central America is the delicious domes 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.910
 they are very similar to the chubby so 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.890
 for today we are going to make the gorditas 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.050
 Mexican but soon we will have the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.420
 pupusas too so get ready here they go 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.820
 the ingredients 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.679
 well this is my personal recipe 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.510
 gorditas because as you know I do not use 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.190
 oil in my the zetas and we have to see 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.739
 the way that is more loving and 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.510
 give it a little bit more textured like this without 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.239
 add thank you very much and next I have 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.960
 over here drier or cornmeal I'm going to 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.210
 place a cup 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.610
 and we go with the dry ingredients to 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.230
 become good, I have here , we are going to 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.960
 place the salt to taste I will place 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.930
 a pinch of salt let's do the same 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.509
 with pepper a pinch of pepper and 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.680
 let's add a pinch of cumin this 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.630
 it is an ingredient that is not very usual 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.000
 old gorditas put us the hints of 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.500
 food but use it to give it more 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.909
 taste like we're not going to fry 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.580
 we need we do two expose a 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.040
 little bit we are going to add half a spoonful 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.670
 of baking powder and let's mix 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.590
 skin these ingredients once 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.950
 our magic powders are fine 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.530
 mixed I will add 32 tablespoons of 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.289
 onion but super well chopped looks is 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.259
 very very technical and each superfie the 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.050
 mind and now let's add 3 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.550
 tablespoons butter or margarine not 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.229
 you have at home remember that the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.539
 butter is a better option because it is a 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.470
 more natural fat than margarine 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.650
 vegetable so here it is and let's go 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.200
 mixing this 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.720
 excellent now is already here mixed the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.510
 butter let's add little by little 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.110
 some water and now do prepare for 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.670
 beat each other, we are putting hands and going 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.280
 mixing this do not go pouring anymore 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.800
 avocado see how the mixture is for 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.320
 have the texture we want so 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.860
 there is evidence that he sees her adding water 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.780
 until your consistency looks like this look 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.480
 that as you can see in my hands is 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.220
 a little bit pegadito but not so much ok 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.310
 then let's make our balls 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.660
 from drier and now we will place well 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.850
 here I have a waxed paper for 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.500
 make life easier for all 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.930
 those geometric figures do not 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.790
 They do very well and have a look dish 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.700
 this is going to give us the shape of the chubby 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.980
 now yes kaboom we crush hard and we 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.390
 the perfect homemade chubby comes out 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.520
 how is it look at what so 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.740
 wonderful we are placing here 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.660
 while we make our other gorditas 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.950
 remember that it inhabits that we put it in 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.030
 the comal the command already has to be 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.459
 very hot 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.080
 I have ricotta or ricotta cheese here 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.819
 remember that this type of cheese is the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.190
 that contain less fat so what 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.020
 let's use and I have two chilies 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.110
 poblanos already previously what we did 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.540
 it was toasting the well take off their skin 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.489
 and now if we are going to cut them we are going to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.160
 take advantage of this poblano chilito and what 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.470
 we're going to cut into lines for this 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.800
 mix it with cottage cheese and with this 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.140
 mix let's fill our 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.709
 gorditas so be prepared for these 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.120
 wonderful gorditas light pretty 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.910

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.650
 what we are going to do is pour it over 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.890
 the cottage cheese we are going to add a pinch 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.020
 of salt that I have here 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.970
 salt to taste and care because there is a 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.280
 ricotta ricotta cheese that already comes with 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.350
