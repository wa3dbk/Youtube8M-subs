you to spot see the little notch on the

and for steering offset to maximum to

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.550 
and for steering offset to maximum to
ten<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:31.390> obviously<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.780> reverse<00:01:32.110> which<00:01:32.350> is

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
ten and obviously the reverse which is

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.859 
ten and obviously the reverse which is
offset<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:33.070> that<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.729> normal<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.850> I'm<00:01:36.970> not<00:01:37.180> set

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
offset to that to normal now I'm not set

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
offset to that to normal now I'm not set
up<00:01:37.900> alone

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
up alone

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.190 
up alone
I've<00:01:40.119> managed<00:01:40.540> my<00:01:41.050> car<00:01:41.650> can<00:01:41.860> run<00:01:41.979> quite<00:01:42.310> quick

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
I've managed my car can run quite quick

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.380 
I've managed my car can run quite quick
can<00:01:44.200> be<00:01:44.289> lucky<00:01:44.440> but<00:01:44.710> runs<00:01:45.039> quite<00:01:45.220> quick<00:01:45.550> okay

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
can be lucky but runs quite quick okay

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.889 
can be lucky but runs quite quick okay
so<00:01:46.450> I'll<00:01:47.020> switch<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.259> on<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.700> car<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.149> you'll

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
so I'll switch it on to car and you'll

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:57.590 
so I'll switch it on to car and you'll
see<00:01:50.020> what<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.200> mean

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:10.200 

I'll<00:01:58.600> put<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.869> camera<00:01:59.140> down<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.320> minute

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.570 

see<00:02:11.210> when<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.420> cars<00:02:11.660> loaded<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.320> ground

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
see when the cars loaded on the ground

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.500 
see when the cars loaded on the ground
or<00:02:13.580> on<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:14.000> flat<00:02:14.420> surface<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:17.120> does<00:02:17.330> have<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.510> kick

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
or on a flat surface it does have a kick

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.860 
or on a flat surface it does have a kick
so<00:02:20.510> expected<00:02:21.170> little<00:02:21.440> kick<00:02:21.650> with<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
so expected little kick with it but the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.020 
so expected little kick with it but the
advantage<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.640> when<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.730> do<00:02:25.850> have<00:02:25.970> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
advantage of that when you do have a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.550 
advantage of that when you do have a
kick<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.070> tarmac<00:02:28.700> surface<00:02:29.570> you'll<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:30.410> get

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
kick on a tarmac surface you'll do get

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.400 
kick on a tarmac surface you'll do get
your<00:02:30.680> girl<00:02:30.890> really<00:02:31.070> easily<00:02:32.140> believe<00:02:33.140> me<00:02:33.290> I've

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
your girl really easily believe me I've

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.100 
your girl really easily believe me I've
done<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.070> already

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.280 

steering<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.370> still<00:02:40.370> right<00:02:43.210> that<00:02:44.210> works<00:02:44.450> looks

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
steering is still right that works looks

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.590 
steering is still right that works looks
fairly<00:02:45.560> quick<00:02:47.740> ok<00:02:48.740> so<00:02:48.800> just<00:02:49.250> check<00:02:49.880> out<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
fairly quick ok so just check out the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.480 
fairly quick ok so just check out the
double<00:02:50.840> check<00:02:50.960> on<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.200> handset<00:02:51.620> controls<00:02:53.140> on

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
double check on the handset controls on

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.330 
double check on the handset controls on
here<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.910> double<00:02:59.300> check<00:02:59.360> again<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:01.190> one

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
here so double check again that one

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.470 
here so double check again that one
which<00:03:01.520> is<00:03:01.670> your<00:03:01.790> steering<00:03:02.390> trim<00:03:04.480> throttle

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
which is your steering trim throttle

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.260 
which is your steering trim throttle
trim<00:03:07.030> dual<00:03:08.030> rate<00:03:08.240> steering<00:03:11.080> jewel<00:03:12.080> rate<00:03:12.260> for

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
trim dual rate steering jewel rate for

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.590 
trim dual rate steering jewel rate for
both<00:03:14.270> -<00:03:14.480> all<00:03:14.570> rates<00:03:14.750> are<00:03:14.900> set<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.170> 10<00:03:15.410> she's<00:03:15.950> max

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
both - all rates are set to 10 she's max

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.880 
both - all rates are set to 10 she's max
yeah<00:03:20.260> yeah<00:03:22.540> see<00:03:23.540> how<00:03:23.660> quick<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.170> was<00:03:24.560> what

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
yeah yeah see how quick that was what

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:34.780 
yeah yeah see how quick that was what

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
happens and the cough stars okay that's

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.520 
happens and the cough stars okay that's
how<00:03:34.970> my<00:03:35.330> one<00:03:35.510> set<00:03:35.750> up<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.660> feel<00:03:38.870> free<00:03:38.900> if<00:03:39.230> we<00:03:39.350> use

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
how my one set up so feel free if we use

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.850
