00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
really existed just think of all the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.210 
really existed just think of all the
good<00:01:22.720> we<00:01:22.780> could<00:01:22.930> do<00:01:23.229> with<00:01:23.320> it<00:01:23.530> like<00:01:23.890> helping

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
the environment and stuff right I guess

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.600 
the environment and stuff right I guess
huh<00:01:28.630> what<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.200> mean<00:01:29.470> is<00:01:29.530> why<00:01:30.070> look<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.460> some

huh what I mean is why look to some
silly<00:01:30.910> magical<00:01:31.540> solution<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:32.200> solve<00:01:32.380> all<00:01:32.590> our

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
silly magical solution to solve all our

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.530 
silly magical solution to solve all our
problems<00:01:32.800> for<00:01:33.460> us<00:01:33.490> that's<00:01:33.850> just<00:01:34.270> wishful

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
problems for us that's just wishful

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.710 
problems for us that's just wishful
thinking<00:01:35.200> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:36.640> it's<00:01:36.790> up<00:01:36.940> to<00:01:37.060> every<00:01:37.390> one<00:01:37.600> of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
thinking I think it's up to every one of

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.870 
thinking I think it's up to every one of
us<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:38.080> make<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.259> difference<00:01:38.560> ourselves<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.580> to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
come up with a real solution for the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.660 
come up with a real solution for the
future<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:42.300> guess<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:43.330> but<00:01:44.050> how<00:01:44.320> like<00:01:45.160> this<00:01:45.399> I

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
future I guess so but how like this I
