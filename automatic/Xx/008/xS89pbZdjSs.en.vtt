00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
shooting building we have a system

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.039 
shooting building we have a system
called<00:01:29.310> pre<00:01:29.520> paths<00:01:29.790> which<00:01:30.090> lets<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.479> build

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
called pre paths which lets you build

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.050 
called pre paths which lets you build
customized<00:01:31.829> structures<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> single

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
customized structures with a single

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.929 
customized structures with a single
click<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.189> unlocks<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> full

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
potential of a first-person shooter when

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.510 
potential of a first-person shooter when
you<00:01:38.610> incorporate<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.539> boxing<00:01:39.990> system<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.130> with

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you incorporate a boxing system so with

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.950 
you incorporate a boxing system so with
the<00:01:41.640> building<00:01:41.970> aspect<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.539> there<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> be

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the building aspect is there going to be

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
the building aspect is there going to be
any<00:01:43.049> defensive<00:01:43.710> capabilities<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.399> forts

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
any defensive capabilities like forts

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
any defensive capabilities like forts
and<00:01:45.090> things<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.509> yes<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and things like that yes so with the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
and things like that yes so with the
prefabs<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.610> go<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.240> build

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
prefabs you can go in and you can build

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.740 
prefabs you can go in and you can build
your<00:01:48.810> own<00:01:48.869> fort<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.530> our<00:01:50.009> editor<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.210> then
