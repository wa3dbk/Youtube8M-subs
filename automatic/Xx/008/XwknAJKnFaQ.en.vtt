00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.900
 people who choose the invisible and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.060

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.590
 Guilherme 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.489
 Boy, do you think the children you make 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.900
 funny 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.459
 look just to be quite honest, I 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.590
 I think some funny think I 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.540
 I did some good videos there in those four 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.950
 years of October but most I do not 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.660
 I like sometimes I have an idea in my 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.430
 I think it's funny after 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.900
 the film after Egypt has not been a bit 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.190
 funny but you do not know what 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.560
 Original screenplay was an original idea 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.360
 so sometimes a video sounds funny 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.920
 for you but in fact of what I 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.570
 thinking about something else then got a 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.160
 little disappointed is a little bad not 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.989

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.610
 video said this bitch is okay sorry 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.590
 because inside I really did not want to 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.680
 that you think that's a video 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.989
 which I found to be super legal so only 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.370
 Sincerely with you, did not you ask your body? 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.489
