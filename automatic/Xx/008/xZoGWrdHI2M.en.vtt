00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
so the reason I got this is kind of in

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.370 
so the reason I got this is kind of in
line<00:02:32.470> with<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.880> quest<00:02:33.880> if<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.240> will<00:02:37.380> all

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380

I<00:02:51.910> just<00:02:52.780> wanted<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.200> see<00:02:53.320> how<00:02:53.560> much<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.100> a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
I just wanted to see how much of a

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.790 
I just wanted to see how much of a
likeness<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.990> this<00:02:55.990> head<00:02:56.170> sculpt<00:02:56.560> would

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
likeness that this head sculpt would

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.340 
likeness that this head sculpt would
have<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.220> her<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.520> didn't<00:02:57.700> expect<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.030> lot<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.420> if

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
have to her I didn't expect a lot and if

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.170 
have to her I didn't expect a lot and if
we<00:02:59.560> take<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.740> closer<00:03:00.010> look<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.730> kind<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.030> get

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
we take a closer look it kind of get

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.640 
we take a closer look it kind of get
into<00:03:01.330> review<00:03:01.660> now<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:03.430> we<00:03:04.050> see<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.470> does

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
into review now that we see that it does

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.100 
into review now that we see that it does
not<00:03:07.080> miss<00:03:08.080> Janssen<00:03:08.710> but<00:03:09.480> definitely<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> female

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
not miss Janssen but definitely a female

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.710 
not miss Janssen but definitely a female
face<00:03:12.070> I<00:03:12.340> would<00:03:12.430> say<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.850> that's<00:03:16.030> good<00:03:16.300> that's

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
face I would say so that's good that's

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.880 
face I would say so that's good that's
that's<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.290> plus<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:23.050> with<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.650> said

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
that's a plus so and with that said

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.680 
that's a plus so and with that said
let's<00:03:24.130> get<00:03:24.250> into<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.730> actual<00:03:25.630> review<00:03:27.690> head

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
let's get into the actual review head

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.140 
let's get into the actual review head
articulation<00:03:29.500> it's<00:03:30.070> really<00:03:30.520> a<00:03:30.550> stiff<00:03:30.850> joint

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
articulation it's really a stiff joint

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.030 
articulation it's really a stiff joint
I've<00:03:31.300> got<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.600> was<00:03:32.140> able<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.350> move<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.650> once<00:03:32.860> I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
I've got I was able to move it once I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.640 
I've got I was able to move it once I
think<00:03:33.390> off<00:03:34.390> camera<00:03:34.780> there<00:03:34.959> we<00:03:35.050> go<00:03:35.140> there<00:03:35.440> we<00:03:35.470> go

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
think off camera there we go there we go

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.710 
think off camera there we go there we go
yes<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:38.010> just<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.250> little<00:03:39.489> bit<00:03:39.580> like<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:40.000> this

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
yes and just a little bit like that this

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.010 
yes and just a little bit like that this
is<00:03:40.870> soft<00:03:41.140> rubber<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.680> guess<00:03:43.140> arms<00:03:46.110> 360<00:03:47.110> go<00:03:47.590> out

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
is soft rubber I guess arms 360 go out

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.370 
is soft rubber I guess arms 360 go out
in<00:03:50.020> a<00:03:50.230> little<00:03:50.380> bit<00:03:50.500> like<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:52.110> elbow<00:03:53.110> has

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
in a little bit like that the elbow has

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.940 
in a little bit like that the elbow has
a<00:03:53.410> swivel<00:03:53.890> 360<00:03:54.520> and<00:03:55.180> AB<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.900> course<00:03:56.140> being

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
a swivel 360 and AB and of course being

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.930 
a swivel 360 and AB and of course being
an<00:03:57.040> elbow<00:03:57.750> hands<00:03:58.770> wrist<00:03:59.770> rather<00:03:59.980> swivel<00:04:00.610> and

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
an elbow hands wrist rather swivel and

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.010 
an elbow hands wrist rather swivel and
they<00:04:01.420> can<00:04:01.570> go<00:04:01.720> in<00:04:01.840> like<00:04:02.050> that<00:04:03.660> this<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:04.840> all

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
they can go in like that this is all

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.910 
they can go in like that this is all
cast<00:04:05.610> like<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.150> can't<00:04:07.920> articulate

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
cast like that so you can't articulate

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.970 
cast like that so you can't articulate
the<00:04:09.190> fingers<00:04:09.519> at<00:04:09.610> all<00:04:09.760> same<00:04:10.330> thing<00:04:10.510> over<00:04:10.630> here

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
the fingers at all same thing over here

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.220 
the fingers at all same thing over here
just<00:04:11.980> below<00:04:12.100> her<00:04:12.580> breasts<00:04:13.180> we<00:04:13.780> have<00:04:13.989> this

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
just below her breasts we have this

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.599 
just below her breasts we have this
articulation<00:04:15.010> point<00:04:15.780> right<00:04:16.780> those<00:04:17.109> are<00:04:17.290> my

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
articulation point right those are my

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.940 
articulation point right those are my
thumbnail<00:04:18.609> iasts<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.390> we<00:04:19.510> got<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.989> up<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.859> down

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
thumbnail iasts so we got to up and down

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.490 
thumbnail iasts so we got to up and down
move<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.250> side<00:04:21.580> to<00:04:21.609> side<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.910> little<00:04:22.030> bit<00:04:22.500> waist

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
move it side to side a little bit waist

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.060 
move it side to side a little bit waist
articulation

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
articulation

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.950 
articulation
and<00:04:25.760> if<00:04:26.180> we<00:04:26.300> take<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.510> look<00:04:26.660> up<00:04:26.780> your<00:04:26.930> skirt<00:04:26.960> here

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
and if we take a look up your skirt here

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.700 
and if we take a look up your skirt here
you<00:04:29.960> can<00:04:30.110> see<00:04:30.320> that<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.800> leg<00:04:31.100> swivels<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:32.710> I

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
you can see that the leg swivels and I

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.910 
you can see that the leg swivels and I
suppose<00:04:34.160> there's<00:04:34.940> not<00:04:35.720> it's<00:04:36.290> either<00:04:36.530> stiff

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
suppose there's not it's either stiff

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.790 
suppose there's not it's either stiff
it's<00:04:38.020> not<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.050> lot<00:04:39.650> not<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.920> lot<00:04:40.070> of<00:04:40.510> articulation

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
it's not a lot not a lot of articulation

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.370 
it's not a lot not a lot of articulation
side<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:42.920> side<00:04:43.100> or<00:04:43.130> front<00:04:43.730> to<00:04:43.790> back<00:04:47.260> then<00:04:48.260> of

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
side to side or front to back then of

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.320 
side to side or front to back then of
course<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:48.680> got<00:04:48.800> this<00:04:49.070> joined<00:04:49.820> at<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.090> knee

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
course you got this joined at the knee

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.140 
course you got this joined at the knee
if<00:04:50.600> we<00:04:50.690> can<00:04:50.810> take<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:50.990> look<00:04:51.170> at<00:04:51.290> that

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
if we can take a look at that

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.330 
if we can take a look at that
there<00:04:56.050> wow<00:04:57.050> it's<00:04:57.410> actually<00:04:57.500> goes<00:04:57.770> far<00:04:58.010> there

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
there wow it's actually goes far there

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.150 
there wow it's actually goes far there
back<00:04:58.870> once<00:04:59.870> I<00:05:00.020> forced<00:05:00.350> a<00:05:00.440> little<00:05:00.710> bit<00:05:00.830> went

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
back once I forced a little bit went

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.790 
back once I forced a little bit went
back<00:05:01.340> past<00:05:02.180> 90<00:05:02.540> degrees<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:02.870> that's<00:05:03.290> cool

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
back past 90 degrees so that's cool

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.930 
back past 90 degrees so that's cool
and<00:05:04.270> then<00:05:05.680> at<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.890> ankle<00:05:07.400> we<00:05:07.520> just<00:05:07.670> got<00:05:07.820> that

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
and then at the ankle we just got that

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.440 
and then at the ankle we just got that
single<00:05:08.240> swivel<00:05:09.080> joining<00:05:09.470> if<00:05:09.560> you<00:05:09.680> call<00:05:09.920> it<00:05:10.450> no

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
single swivel joining if you call it no

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.200 
single swivel joining if you call it no
side<00:05:11.780> to<00:05:11.930> side<00:05:12.170> just<00:05:12.200> like<00:05:13.100> that<00:05:13.340> she<00:05:13.970> stands
