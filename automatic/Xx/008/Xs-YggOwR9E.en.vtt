30 degrees below ambient temperature

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.390 
30 degrees below ambient temperature
depending<00:00:26.740> on<00:00:26.859> the<00:00:26.949> model

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
depending on the model

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.070 
depending on the model
now<00:00:27.760> ambient<00:00:28.300> temperature<00:00:28.660> that<00:00:28.779> we<00:00:28.869> talked

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
now ambient temperature that we talked

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.019 
now ambient temperature that we talked
about<00:00:29.109> is<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.710> temperature<00:00:30.039> around<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.730> unit

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
about is the temperature around the unit

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.060 
about is the temperature around the unit
the<00:00:31.150> air<00:00:31.269> temperature<00:00:31.840> so<00:00:32.380> you<00:00:32.770> can<00:00:32.890> imagine

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
the air temperature so you can imagine

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.800 
the air temperature so you can imagine
inside<00:00:33.460> a<00:00:33.520> vehicle<00:00:33.850> with<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.060> aircon<00:00:34.390> on<00:00:34.570> it's

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
inside a vehicle with the aircon on it's

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.450 
inside a vehicle with the aircon on it's
nice<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.170> cool<00:00:35.320> so<00:00:35.770> inside<00:00:36.100> here<00:00:36.280> we're<00:00:36.370> going

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
nice and cool so inside here we're going

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.369 
nice and cool so inside here we're going
to<00:00:36.520> be<00:00:36.640> much<00:00:36.790> much<00:00:36.940> cooler<00:00:37.300> if<00:00:37.690> you<00:00:37.809> leave<00:00:38.140> the

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
to be much much cooler if you leave the

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.220 
to be much much cooler if you leave the
unit<00:00:38.980> in<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.309> vehicle

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
unit in the vehicle

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.170 
unit in the vehicle
not<00:00:41.230> running<00:00:41.500> no<00:00:41.770> aircon<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.579> course<00:00:42.879> it's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
not running no aircon of course it's

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.520 
not running no aircon of course it's
going<00:00:43.270> to<00:00:43.329> be<00:00:43.390> about<00:00:43.629> could<00:00:43.930> be<00:00:43.960> up<00:00:44.110> to<00:00:44.230> 70

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
going to be about could be up to 70

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.110 
going to be about could be up to 70
degrees<00:00:44.590> in<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:44.980> vehicle<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.610> it's<00:00:45.730> not<00:00:45.910> going

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
degrees in the vehicle so it's not going

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.790 
degrees in the vehicle so it's not going
to<00:00:46.210> be<00:00:46.300> really<00:00:46.660> really<00:00:46.780> cool<00:00:47.079> inside<00:00:47.350> here<00:00:47.559> but

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
to be really really cool inside here but

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.350 
to be really really cool inside here but
still<00:00:48.039> cooler<00:00:48.370> than<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.670> internal<00:00:48.969> temp<00:00:49.270> of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
still cooler than the internal temp of

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.779 
still cooler than the internal temp of
the<00:00:49.420> vehicle<00:00:49.780> so<00:00:50.289> who's<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:50.949> ideal<00:00:51.309> for<00:00:51.340> then

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
the vehicle so who's it ideal for then

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.520 
the vehicle so who's it ideal for then
those<00:00:52.390> people<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:52.780> are<00:00:52.899> working<00:00:53.079> from<00:00:53.350> their

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
those people that are working from their

that are heading away picnicking as well

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.869 
that are heading away picnicking as well
they're<00:01:01.629> a<00:01:01.660> good<00:01:01.870> option<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.399> I<00:01:03.430> won't<00:01:03.609> freeze

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
they're a good option so I won't freeze

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.490 
they're a good option so I won't freeze
but<00:01:04.210> down<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.600> about<00:01:04.809> 30<00:01:05.080> degrees<00:01:05.170> below
