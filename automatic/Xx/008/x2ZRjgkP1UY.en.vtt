00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.710
 live is the first means of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.960
 communication that manages to interview two 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.089
 living legends of television 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.160
 quico and chilindrina who after 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.560
 of more than three decades they are again 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000
 friends like in the neighborhood putting him 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.250
 final point to all the stories 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.050
 unpleasant and in the problems that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.689
 they could have existed between them 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.179
 Carlos and I had no introduction 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.430
 together we have met sometimes in 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.760
 the airports on the planes in the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.879
 restaurant but we would have been 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.969
 participating for a program and that we 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.360
 could take together really is a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.030
 notification because we were never going to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.640
 I hope neither he nor I can be in a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:58.379
 program and we were very pleased to see us 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.870
 after 34 years because I interview 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.640
 I had the honor of interviewing Latinos and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.979
 the truth yes because we had not 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 seen we had talked we saw each other in 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.090
 peru I think twice 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.759
 but it's been such a formal interview and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.840
 that people realize that they do not 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.009
 we are fighting and not inventing 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 exactly then it is very 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.840
 satisfactory to start the year like that because 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.759
 my first interview is with Carlos and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.530
 he says this will give me a lot of joy 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.909
 and it will give me good luck and there are no subs 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.679
 surprise that we will have them after a while 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.679
 you can not tell a little bit of that 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.520
 we imagine you television 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.409
 was the cause of the enmity that 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.229
 existed for decades between quico and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.569
 chilindrina but the same television was 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.880
 the one that returned them to unite maría antonieta 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.830
 of the snows the chilindrina and Carlos 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.020
 villagrán quico tell us what 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.119
 happy they were before roberto 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.700
 gómez bolaños stripped of her 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.250
 characters 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.600
 they have talked a lot we do not have the same as 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.019
 any human being many flaws 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.150
 but we had the Latino to do the best 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.340
 comedy program and I think that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.060
 come back it's called future that are the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.790
 children we must take care of ourselves first of 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.430
 they talk to us like that because they do not and 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.260
 media you have to take care your 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.319
 children and not force audience we see 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.810
 Both Kiko and Chilindrina have very 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.750
 present as if it were yesterday the recording 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.390
 of the last program the last program 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.720
 that the soft carlos with us was the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.079
 of acapulco and it was an ending has been the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.370
 best end of programs that we have 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:48.250
 had in 40 years what happens is that the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.680
 people do not think about that 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.269
 as long as they see us on television and that 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.150
 it is the memory that has to be left 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.700
 to all of you and to the viewers the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.220
 the years that we work together and what 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.240
 happy that we saw each other and how happy we were 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.030
 we were 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.550
 you do not think about people 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.950
 think of the characters because what 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.780
 they continue to see and they continue to see and 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.970
 they continue living that happiness that 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.700
 we had the people sometimes 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.250
 We change sometimes change the way 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.160
 think about looking but the characters 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.560
 there they are but what we can be 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.560
 sure is that very soon we will return to 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.260
 see together the chilindrina and akiko in 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.540
 a new facet that God invites us 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.940
 to all who remain very happy and 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.490
 keep watching the show really 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.130
 it is worthwhile to see such a neighborhood 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.850
 how was everyone together and happy 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.180
