organization of our room and I wanted to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.470 
organization of our room and I wanted to
rearrange<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.310> something<00:00:17.670> that

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
rearrange that and have something that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.980 
rearrange that and have something that
looked<00:00:18.750> similar<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.910> cubbies<00:00:20.910> as<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.660> you'll

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
looked similar to cubbies as you you'll

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
looked similar to cubbies as you you'll
see<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.380> most<00:00:22.529> preschool<00:00:23.279> classrooms<00:00:23.699> and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
see in most preschool classrooms and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.300 
see in most preschool classrooms and
also<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> idea<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.380> my<00:00:25.740> older<00:00:26.070> daughter

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310

extravagant<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.099> didn't<00:00:32.369> cost<00:00:32.520> me<00:00:32.759> much

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
extravagant but it didn't cost me much

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.160 
extravagant but it didn't cost me much
and<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> nice<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.690> thing<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.020> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and it's a nice little thing that I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.420 
and it's a nice little thing that I
threw<00:00:34.380> together<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.890> thought<00:00:35.040> I'd<00:00:35.190> share

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
threw together and I thought I'd share

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.549 
it with you I thought it was a great
idea<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:38.660> transforming<00:00:39.660> something<00:00:40.170> really

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
idea for transforming something really

ordinary and to you know something that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.360 
ordinary and to you know something that
may<00:00:45.210> cost<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.989> pretty<00:00:46.620> penny<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
may cost you a pretty penny if you

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.119 
may cost you a pretty penny if you
purchased<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.680> Target<00:00:50.070> or

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

thing that I did that made a tremendous
difference<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.739> how<00:00:58.739> things<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
difference and how things are going to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
difference and how things are going to
go<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.489> our<00:00:59.550> home<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> purchased<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> see

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710 
not really sure i can't remember but i
know<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.520> i<00:01:11.549> paid<00:01:11.970> less<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:12.270> thirty

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
dollars for all six of these so imagine

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.690 
dollars for all six of these so imagine
one<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.229> these<00:01:16.880> crates<00:01:17.880> okay<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.310> on<00:01:20.310> its

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
one of these crates okay just one on its

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.640 
one of these crates okay just one on its
flat<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.630> its<00:01:21.659> bottom<00:01:21.960> right<00:01:22.290> now<00:01:22.439> they're

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
flat on its bottom right now they're

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.560 
flat on its bottom right now they're
stacked<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.729> other<00:01:23.850> way<00:01:24.030> against<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
stacked up the other way against the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.990 
stacked up the other way against the
wall<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:26.520> they<00:01:26.670> look<00:01:26.970> like

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
wall but this is what they look like

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.080 
wall but this is what they look like
they're<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.479> storage<00:01:27.780> crates<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.700> just

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
they're just storage crates and I just

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.450 
they're just storage crates and I just
have<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.450> idea<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:31.200> stacking<00:01:31.619> them<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
have this idea of stacking them up the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.289 
have this idea of stacking them up the
other<00:01:32.640> way<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.509> using<00:01:34.350> yarn<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:35.790> secure

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
other way and then using yarn to secure

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.490 
other way and then using yarn to secure
each<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.979> each<00:01:38.100> other<00:01:38.390> okay<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.170> see<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
each one to each other okay so you see I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
each one to each other okay so you see I
have<00:01:40.710> six<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.280> could<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:41.670> many<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
have six and I could have as many as I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.020 
have six and I could have as many as I
wanted<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:42.840> against<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.290> entire<00:01:43.649> wall

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
wanted really against this entire wall

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.399 
wanted really against this entire wall
but<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:46.920> yarn<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.729> or

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
but if you if you use yarn and or

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.210 
but if you if you use yarn and or
something<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> tie<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.100> together

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
something you know to tie them together

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.760 
something you know to tie them together
that<00:01:51.000> way<00:01:51.149> they're<00:01:51.299> more<00:01:51.450> secure<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> they<00:01:52.710> do

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that way they're more secure and they do

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.620 
that way they're more secure and they do
sort<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.310> neatly<00:01:53.520> stack<00:01:53.909> into<00:01:54.119> each<00:01:54.390> other

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
sort of neatly stack into each other

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.569 
sort of neatly stack into each other
anyway<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.079> that's<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:55.950> kind<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> neat<00:01:56.430> but

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
anyway so that's that's kind of neat but

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.789 
anyway so that's that's kind of neat but
just<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> give<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.210> security<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.680> I'm

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
just to give it more security I what I'm

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.459 
just to give it more security I what I'm
doing<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.219> these<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.299> top<00:02:00.540> 3<00:02:00.990> i'm<00:02:01.170> using

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
doing with these are the top 3 i'm using

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.580 
doing with these are the top 3 i'm using
for<00:02:01.619> my<00:02:01.710> daughter<00:02:01.950> by<00:02:02.310> nine<00:02:02.460> year<00:02:02.640> olds<00:02:03.590> locker

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
for my daughter by nine year olds locker

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.700 
for my daughter by nine year olds locker
i<00:02:04.740> suppose<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.820> first<00:02:06.270> crate<00:02:06.689> or<00:02:07.049> bin<00:02:07.290> will

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
i suppose this first crate or bin will

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.559 
i suppose this first crate or bin will
be<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.250> her<00:02:08.399> daily<00:02:09.470> homeschool

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
be for her daily homeschool

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.449 
be for her daily homeschool
things<00:02:12.049> that<00:02:12.230> she<00:02:12.409> does<00:02:12.650> like<00:02:12.890> language<00:02:13.189> arts

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
things that she does like language arts

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.970 
things that she does like language arts
and<00:02:13.579> math<00:02:13.819> so<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.930> her<00:02:15.049> daily<00:02:15.260> work<00:02:15.709> and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and math so this is her daily work and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.800 
and math so this is her daily work and
then<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.159> one<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.519> middle<00:02:16.639> are<00:02:17.120> things

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
then the one in the middle are things

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.720 
then the one in the middle are things
that<00:02:17.870> she<00:02:18.049> does<00:02:18.230> predominantly<00:02:18.980> once<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.549> week

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
that she does predominantly once a week

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.349 
that she does predominantly once a week
only<00:02:19.939> and<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.349> last<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.980> have<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.579> far<00:02:22.609> up<00:02:23.060> just

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359 
only and the last I have so far up just

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.420 
only and the last I have so far up just
her<00:02:23.510> Bible<00:02:23.900> things<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.799> she<00:02:24.950> does<00:02:25.099> and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
her Bible things that she does and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.199 
her Bible things that she does and
probably<00:02:25.999> I<00:02:26.510> will<00:02:27.079> use<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:27.849> for<00:02:28.849> her<00:02:28.909> to<00:02:29.030> put

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
probably I will use that for her to put

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.420 
probably I will use that for her to put
like<00:02:29.450> her<00:02:29.959> paperwork<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.950> some<00:02:31.219> other<00:02:31.370> things

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.550 
like her paperwork and some other things
I'll<00:02:31.790> have<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.269> figure<00:02:32.359> that<00:02:32.599> out<00:02:32.659> like<00:02:33.409> I<00:02:33.500> said

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
I'll have to figure that out like I said

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.020 
I'll have to figure that out like I said
I<00:02:33.709> just<00:02:33.769> went<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.189> store<00:02:34.250> this<00:02:34.549> weekend

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and did all of this really quickly

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.580 
and did all of this really quickly
yesterday<00:02:37.370> as<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.819> matter<00:02:37.909> of<00:02:38.180> fact<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:39.200> bottom

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
yesterday as a matter of fact the bottom

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.569 
yesterday as a matter of fact the bottom
three<00:02:39.859> are<00:02:40.040> going<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.219> be<00:02:40.310> for<00:02:40.489> my

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
three are going to be for my

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.489 
three are going to be for my
pre-schooler<00:02:40.819> so<00:02:41.329> she<00:02:41.389> has<00:02:41.540> her<00:02:41.629> puzzles<00:02:42.139> and

pre-schooler so she has her puzzles and

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.059 
pre-schooler so she has her puzzles and
one<00:02:43.459> if<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.209> remember<00:02:44.540> in<00:02:44.689> my<00:02:44.930> two<00:02:45.769> videos<00:02:46.040> ago

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
one if you remember in my two videos ago

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.479 
one if you remember in my two videos ago
I<00:02:46.519> believe<00:02:47.349> my<00:02:48.349> preschoolers<00:02:48.950> puzzles<00:02:49.400> were

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
I believe my preschoolers puzzles were

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.659 
I believe my preschoolers puzzles were
all<00:02:49.639> in<00:02:49.790> these<00:02:50.260> bends<00:02:51.260> but<00:02:51.650> we<00:02:51.889> are<00:02:52.159> at<00:02:52.549> the

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
all in these bends but we are at the

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:53.860 
all in these bends but we are at the
moment<00:02:52.790> rearranging<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.569> there<00:02:53.689> will<00:02:53.840> be

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
moment rearranging and there will be

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.759 
moment rearranging and there will be
labels<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:54.949> labels<00:02:55.760> are<00:02:55.879> forthcoming<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.769> of

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
labels so labels are forthcoming and of

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.000 
labels so labels are forthcoming and of
course<00:02:57.799> I'll<00:02:58.129> be<00:02:58.250> finishing<00:02:58.549> out<00:02:59.389> my

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
course I'll be finishing out my

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.319 
course I'll be finishing out my
organizing<00:03:01.010> for<00:03:01.459> these<00:03:01.579> because<00:03:02.060> I'm<00:03:02.180> not

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
organizing for these because I'm not

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.179 
organizing for these because I'm not
quite<00:03:02.510> done<00:03:02.659> with<00:03:02.719> that<00:03:03.049> portion<00:03:03.560> yet<00:03:03.709> what<00:03:04.159> I

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
quite done with that portion yet what I

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.030 
quite done with that portion yet what I
really<00:03:04.579> like<00:03:04.760> about<00:03:04.790> these<00:03:05.419> bins<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:06.040> if

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
really like about these bins is if

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.009 
really like about these bins is if
you'll<00:03:07.189> notice<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:07.669> the<00:03:07.760> top<00:03:07.790> because<00:03:08.599> this<00:03:08.900> is

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
you'll notice in the top because this is

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.890 
you'll notice in the top because this is
really<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.439> side<00:03:09.709> it's<00:03:10.579> on<00:03:10.669> its<00:03:10.879> side<00:03:11.060> but<00:03:11.719> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
really the side it's on its side but it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.530 
really the side it's on its side but it
has<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.139> flat<00:03:12.620> space<00:03:13.010> here<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.209> can<00:03:14.329> set

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
has a flat space here that you can set

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.270 
has a flat space here that you can set
things<00:03:14.689> on<00:03:14.870> top<00:03:15.049> so<00:03:15.290> i<00:03:15.319> have<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.560> globe<00:03:15.859> on<00:03:16.099> top

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
things on top so i have a globe on top

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.550 
things on top so i have a globe on top
of<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.609> and<00:03:16.639> then<00:03:17.000> i<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.840> marker<00:03:18.229> board

of it and then i have the marker board

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.059 
of it and then i have the marker board
which<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.430> really<00:03:19.639> neat<00:03:20.259> because<00:03:21.259> it<00:03:21.769> fits

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
which is really neat because it fits

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.890 
which is really neat because it fits
right<00:03:22.310> on<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.729> and<00:03:23.120> i<00:03:23.209> don't<00:03:23.359> have<00:03:23.419> to<00:03:23.629> secure

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
right on it and i don't have to secure

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.830 
right on it and i don't have to secure
the<00:03:24.019> marker<00:03:24.290> board<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.650> wall<00:03:25.060> okay<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:26.120> you

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
the marker board to the wall okay so you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.449 
the marker board to the wall okay so you
can<00:03:27.019> place<00:03:27.259> things<00:03:27.530> on<00:03:27.709> top<00:03:27.889> you<00:03:28.159> can<00:03:28.250> place

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
looking i think way better than it did

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.560 
looking i think way better than it did
when<00:04:45.350> I<00:04:45.410> first<00:04:45.500> showed<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.280> our<00:04:46.690> setup<00:04:47.690> and

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
not only does it look better but the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.070 
not only does it look better but the
function<00:04:52.250> of<00:04:52.400> everything<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.300> coming

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
function of everything is coming

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.820 
function of everything is coming
together<00:04:54.380> more<00:04:55.070> so<00:04:55.810> that's<00:04:56.810> always<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.500> plus

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830
