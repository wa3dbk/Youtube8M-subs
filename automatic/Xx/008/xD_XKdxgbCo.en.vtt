00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.799 

well<00:00:11.040> today<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.550> will<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:11.969> showing<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.360> exactly

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
well today I will be showing you exactly

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.530 
well today I will be showing you exactly
how<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.230> fix<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.799> issue<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:15.150> actually

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
how to fix this issue and it's actually

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:31.400 
how to fix this issue and it's actually
pretty<00:00:15.780> easy<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> let's<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.060> started<00:00:18.539> okay<00:00:30.410> so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
pretty easy so let's get started okay so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.060 
pretty easy so let's get started okay so
this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.700> main<00:00:32.969> reason<00:00:33.300> why<00:00:33.620> it's<00:00:34.620> causing

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
this is the main reason why it's causing

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.590 
this is the main reason why it's causing
double<00:00:35.370> clicking<00:00:35.690> is<00:00:37.850> because<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.450> if

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
double clicking is because of this so if

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.869 
double clicking is because of this so if
I<00:00:39.750> go<00:00:39.960> into<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.469> thing<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:43.430> as<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.760> can

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I go into this thing here and as you can

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.119 
I go into this thing here and as you can
see<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> upper<00:00:45.930> right<00:00:46.200> corner<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.890> tells

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
see in the upper right corner it tells

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.900 
see in the upper right corner it tells
me<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:47.579> much<00:00:47.730> memory<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> allocated<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.910> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
me how much memory is allocated and it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.810 
me how much memory is allocated and it
says<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.449> I've<00:00:51.989> allocated<00:00:52.370> 50%<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
says I'm I've allocated 50% of the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.200 
says I'm I've allocated 50% of the
maximum<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.710> that's<00:00:56.309> point<00:00:56.820> five

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
maximum I can so that's point five

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.270 
maximum I can so that's point five
gigabytes<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.670> for<00:00:59.670> me<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.000> maximum<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:01.109> be

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
gigabytes so for me the maximum would be

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
gigabytes so for me the maximum would be
to<00:01:02.280> only<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.149> gigabyte<00:01:03.840> others<00:01:04.589> may

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
to only have one gigabyte others may

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.359 
to only have one gigabyte others may
have<00:01:04.949> higher<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.360> will<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.409> will<00:01:07.650> also<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
have higher so I will be I will also I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.730 
have higher so I will be I will also I
will<00:01:08.640> leave<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.180> things<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> paste

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
will leave the things you have to paste

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.429 
will leave the things you have to paste
into<00:01:11.010> your<00:01:11.210> batch<00:01:12.210> file<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.869> you'll<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
into your batch file that you'll have to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.490 
into your batch file that you'll have to
make<00:01:13.590> that'll<00:01:14.250> help<00:01:14.580> reduces<00:01:15.150> lag<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.320> want

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
make that'll help reduces lag if we want

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.010 
make that'll help reduces lag if we want
to<00:01:16.590> allocate<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.250> RAM<00:01:17.939> with<00:01:18.180> different<00:01:18.540> so

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to allocate the RAM with different so

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.200 
to allocate the RAM with different so
that's<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> main<00:01:19.500> issue<00:01:19.650> why<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.670> are<00:01:20.759> exactly

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that's the main issue why we are exactly

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.350 
that's the main issue why we are exactly
seeing<00:01:21.600> there's<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> double<00:01:22.259> clicking<00:01:22.500> issue

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
seeing there's a double clicking issue

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.270 
seeing there's a double clicking issue
and<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.369> quite<00:01:26.490> bothersome<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.280> first

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and it can be quite bothersome so first

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.810 
and it can be quite bothersome so first
you<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.710> put<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:31.950> minecraft<00:01:32.579> at

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you will have to put your minecraft at

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.899 
you will have to put your minecraft at
your<00:01:33.420> minecraft<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.500> Exe<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.820> have

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
your minecraft that Exe or if you have

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.440 
your minecraft that Exe or if you have
to<00:01:36.000> crack<00:01:36.180> launcher<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:36.930> jar<00:01:37.740> file<00:01:38.100> on

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
to crack launcher your jar file on

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.940 
to crack launcher your jar file on
somewhere<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.530> create<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> new

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
somewhere or we can just create a new

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.520 
somewhere or we can just create a new
folder<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:43.110> named<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.350> minecraft<00:01:44.220> Ram

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
folder and I named it minecraft Ram

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.980 
folder and I named it minecraft Ram
upgraded<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.950> something<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> open

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
upgraded or something like that so open

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.319 
upgraded or something like that so open
up<00:01:49.049> notepad<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.040> then<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.210> you're

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
up notepad and then this is what you're

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.749 
up notepad and then this is what you're
going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.200> paste<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.189> will<00:01:53.520> leave

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
going to have to paste in I will leave

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.719 
going to have to paste in I will leave
the<00:01:54.409> text<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.649> there<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.280> one

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the text in there so this is one

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.510 
the text in there so this is one
gigabyte<00:01:57.180> which<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.500> will<00:01:58.619> allocate<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
gigabyte which so it will allocate up to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.429 
gigabyte which so it will allocate up to
124<00:02:00.299> megabytes<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.110> do

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
124 megabytes and so what you have to do

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.310 
124 megabytes and so what you have to do
here<00:02:04.829> next<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.700> type<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.939> location<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
here next is to type the location of the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.410 
here next is to type the location of the
minecraft<00:02:07.890> file<00:02:08.130> so<00:02:08.729> we'll<00:02:08.820> be<00:02:08.940> doing<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.300> with

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
minecraft file so we'll be doing it with

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.780 
minecraft file so we'll be doing it with
the<00:02:09.540> dot<00:02:09.750> jar<00:02:10.020> file<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.590> you'll<00:02:11.550> probably

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the dot jar file because you'll probably

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.240 
the dot jar file because you'll probably
guess<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.270> already<00:02:12.510> works<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.230> Exe<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
guess it already works it's a Exe so the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.760 
guess it already works it's a Exe so the
first<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.760> type<00:02:17.970> C<00:02:18.540> Drive<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.760> then<00:02:20.760> users

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
first you type C Drive and then users

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.310 
first you type C Drive and then users
and<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.920> type<00:02:23.130> your<00:02:23.280> name<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.810> will<00:02:25.170> be

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
and you type your name so that will be

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.830 
and you type your name so that will be
my<00:02:25.500> username<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.220> then<00:02:27.410> desktop<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:30.030> then

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
my username and then desktop and then

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.450 
my username and then desktop and then
you<00:02:30.930> type<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.380> file<00:02:31.800> name<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.250> mine<00:02:32.430> is

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
you type the file name so mine is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.900 
you type the file name so mine is
minecraft<00:02:33.110> SP<00:02:34.110> jar<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.940> then<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.570> save<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.440> as

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
minecraft SP jar and then you save it as

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.250 
minecraft SP jar and then you save it as
whatever<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.120> want<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.570> I'll<00:02:39.720> save<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.020> as

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
whatever you want so I'll save it as

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.260 
whatever you want so I'll save it as
minecraft<00:02:41.270> one<00:02:42.270> gigabyte<00:02:42.720> RAM<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:44.270> I'll

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270

so<00:03:22.030> multiplayer<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:25.430> this<00:03:25.579> is<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.790> good<00:03:26.030> place

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
so multiplayer so this is a good place

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.940 
so multiplayer so this is a good place
to<00:03:26.299> demonstrate<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.079> because<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.439> have<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> lot

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
to demonstrate it because I have a lot

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.619 
to demonstrate it because I have a lot
of<00:03:28.099> issues<00:03:28.219> on<00:03:28.579> there<00:03:28.819> so<00:03:29.290> already<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:35.239> it

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
of issues on there so already and I it

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.630 
of issues on there so already and I it
might<00:03:35.870> still<00:03:36.230> happen<00:03:36.439> because<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:36.920> am<00:03:37.159> using<00:03:37.370> a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
might still happen because I am using a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.809 
might still happen because I am using a
screen<00:03:37.970> recorder<00:03:38.540> but<00:03:39.349> otherwise<00:03:39.859> it<00:03:40.280> will

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
screen recorder but otherwise it will

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:50.800 
screen recorder but otherwise it will
work<00:03:41.349> fine<00:03:42.349> so<00:03:42.680> I'll<00:03:43.430> log<00:03:43.700> in<00:03:49.299> okay<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:50.720> you

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
work fine so I'll log in okay so you

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.399 
work fine so I'll log in okay so you
should<00:03:50.959> see<00:03:51.169> it<00:03:51.290> it's<00:03:51.439> now<00:03:51.620> fixed<00:03:53.290> but<00:03:54.290> of

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
should see it it's now fixed but of

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.009 
should see it it's now fixed but of
course<00:03:55.000> because<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.180> fact<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.659> I<00:03:56.780> am

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
course because of the fact that I am

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.149 
course because of the fact that I am
using<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.500> screen<00:03:58.280> recorder<00:03:59.709> Camtasia<00:04:00.709> it

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
using a screen recorder Camtasia it

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.039 
using a screen recorder Camtasia it
causes<00:04:01.909> a<00:04:01.939> lot<00:04:02.209> of<00:04:02.359> lag<00:04:02.599> and<00:04:03.579> so<00:04:04.579> if<00:04:05.180> it's<00:04:05.720> it's

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
causes a lot of lag and so if it's it's

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.059 
causes a lot of lag and so if it's it's
like<00:04:06.470> right<00:04:06.769> now<00:04:06.919> 15<00:04:07.669> FPS<00:04:08.629> per<00:04:08.959> second<00:04:09.349> so<00:04:10.010> I

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
like right now 15 FPS per second so I

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.030 
like right now 15 FPS per second so I
would<00:04:10.250> say<00:04:10.430> about<00:04:10.639> 20<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.540> below<00:04:12.019> it<00:04:12.379> will

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
would say about 20 and below it will

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.039 
would say about 20 and below it will
happen<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:13.669> make<00:04:13.939> sure<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.689> are<00:04:14.810> getting

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
happen so make sure that you are getting

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.099 
happen so make sure that you are getting
above<00:04:15.500> 20<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.370> then<00:04:16.970> now<00:04:17.090> if<00:04:17.209> we<00:04:17.329> also<00:04:17.479> open<00:04:17.989> up

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
above 20 and then now if we also open up

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.500 
above 20 and then now if we also open up
the<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:21.099> f3<00:04:22.099> thing<00:04:22.400> you<00:04:22.820> can<00:04:22.970> see<00:04:23.120> now<00:04:23.270> I've

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
the the f3 thing you can see now I've

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.189 
the the f3 thing you can see now I've
allocated<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:24.139> 100%<00:04:24.979> memory<00:04:25.400> so<00:04:26.120> now<00:04:26.630> you

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
allocated a 100% memory so now you

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.409 
allocated a 100% memory so now you
should<00:04:27.229> not<00:04:27.710> experience<00:04:28.190> any<00:04:28.520> more<00:04:28.580> if<00:04:28.970> we<00:04:29.210> do

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
should not experience any more if we do

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.290 
should not experience any more if we do
I<00:04:29.690> am<00:04:30.260> honestly<00:04:30.770> not<00:04:31.010> sure<00:04:31.070> try<00:04:31.639> allocating

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
I am honestly not sure try allocating

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.610 
I am honestly not sure try allocating
more<00:04:32.710> but<00:04:33.710> if<00:04:33.949> it's<00:04:34.220> not<00:04:34.490> working<00:04:34.940> -<00:04:35.210> ah<00:04:35.620> you

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
more but if it's not working - ah you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.589 
more but if it's not working - ah you
probably<00:04:36.770> allocated<00:04:37.550> too<00:04:37.729> much<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.180> go<00:04:38.360> one

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
probably allocated too much so go one

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.379 
probably allocated too much so go one
gigabyte<00:04:39.080> lower<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:40.669> hope<00:04:40.940> this<00:04:41.120> guy's
