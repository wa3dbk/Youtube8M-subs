00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.639
 one 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.889
 always wanted to live in soap 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.219
 when they culminate gigi in he moved 40 years ago to the old part of the city 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.099
 the channeling problems in the city had not yet been unleashed 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.279
 now he has to pour the water from the pool down the channel where the rain 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.760
 often the water in the toilet lacks the cesaria section, so here 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.430
 there are culverts that goes down this low drain to a septic tank 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.820
 excavated under the building 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.710
 the husband my husband and I built this house four years ago still not 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.510
 we had the possibility of emptying the septic tank 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.480
 very well 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.100
 most septic tanks let it go 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.430
 they have not been walked 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.600
 and when it happens to happen the waste is simply transported to 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.000
 deposits without any control 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.870
 far from the city 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.140
 For many inhabitants, transportation is too expensive 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.390
 now several scientists are investigating how to use this waste to 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 get that energy 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.100
 will also try to improve the average water quality 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 that each device 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.800
 the population grows vertiginously five years ago they lived three million 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.800
 of people in heat 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.960
 today they are six and a half million 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 in 2030 will be 10 million 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.090
 large quantities of biological waste to stop on the street without 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.520
 no control notwithstanding all these remains the garbage of the markets of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.540
 food and water that end up in septic tanks 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.160
 we could make excellent sources of heat 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.530
 electricity okumo puno for the fields 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.020
 German scientists 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.560
 they investigate how to make it possible 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.600
 a group of skate engineers built an experimentation center with water in 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.520
 the outskirts of ankara are not 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.189
 in your reactor occurs 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.750
 a clay that can be used as fertilizer 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.049
 in biogas that is used to gain electricity 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.260
 Peter Corner developed this concept of water supply and withdrawal 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
 for fast-growing cities 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.319
 we call a country but we do not follow the pattern of jano and because 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.899
 we collaborate with that city 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:26.689
 so we take the numbers leave today and we try to reproduce here the 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.449
 composition of your garbage but actually we could use the same 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.449
 concept for any city of mar del plata 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.889
 this particular mix they hear 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.340
 both your biological waste and your garbage 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.760
 pd approaching the real one so that the bacteria do their work as in 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.339
 Vietnam 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:46.260
 in the future 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.560
 the drinking water will also be recycled 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.560
 for example for toilets cisterns 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.889
 these German scientists have assembled a similar infantile device 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.249
 in collaboration with their Vietnamese colleagues want to check how 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.649
 the system works in the real world 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.199
 the university engineer let hear 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.549
 he works on behalf of his government 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.009
 the act 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.599
 the premises were five years has not concluded conscious that the biogas 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.289
 can serve to produce energy but we are still working on that project 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.329
 loose 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.309
 It's been 30 years since Peter Corner works there, don Teodoro costs 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.459
 the waste water that overflows from the septic tanks to the sewer 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.619
 restless engineer 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:36.819
 especially because people cook and eat a few meters from where and this 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.169
 happens 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.539
 the engineer considers that it is an untenable situation 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:45.759
 Cornel that his Vietnamese colleague share a great concern about the 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.199
 Health of Jalapa's neighbors 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.709
 I prepared nothing until three years for whom the old part is where more 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.259
 There is a clear risk that the faecal waste in 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:01.359
 food specialized engineers refer to this as short circuit 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.319
 anal or oral 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.819
 refers to the short path that faecal bacteria have to travel 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:06.230
 here 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.230
 to contaminate food 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.090
 Pisano and 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.090
 there is not a single water treatment plant 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.959
 the liquid waste reaches the river without filter 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.890
 every day 900 tons of mud are extracted 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.309
 of chaos and fluvial 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.639
 this must change 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.920
 holiday 2 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.890
 p the typhoon came before this river armed earthquake so the 100 years when the 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.240
 King could walk and again through the water or not say it but with the growth 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.200
 fast the city of ourense began to be the sewer dv all its 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.460
 waste 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.550
 in fact that's why now its color is nick 2 valley 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.499
 although the eleven ovalles the ecc 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.740
 in the past you could approach a recreational fluvial area that is our 

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.319
 vision for the future the neighbor 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.379
 because another 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:07.180
 engineers want to start in a newly built residential area 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.180
 there are also septic tanks 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.250
 The concept is the reuse of water 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.300
 the water in the shower and the toilet will have different treatments 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.369
 In addition, all biological waste will be collected 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.870
 the removal of fecal waste and garbage could be amortized 

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:33.869
 widely because they become raw materials 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.750
 smaller plants will convert them into electricity was good 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.750
 for agriculture and in heat for houses 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.060
 when the city continues to grow more plants will be built 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.930
 when the waste ferments plutus sent cash estes become 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.840
 electricity and heat for the houses so an almost closed circuit between 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.840
 Households and management plants 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.009
 a residential area for 20 thousand people 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.009
 It would be perfect to start the experience 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:19.240
 is still denying a megaphone in peace do you want many new houses 

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:23.439
 construction in which many thousands of people will have their homes now 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:26.660
 it is logical that a management center is built here 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.660
 of waste and supplies pahor 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.419
 is a concept that interests many 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.240
 so they complain today 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.069
 it could be the first world megalopolis 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.610
 where this innovative hydraulic supply and water plan is applied 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.280
 residual
