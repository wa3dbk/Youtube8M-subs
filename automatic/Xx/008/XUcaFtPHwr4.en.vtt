00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.570
 let's go for a fee test 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.570
 well on the wet 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.950
 totally get into this game makes you laugh 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.500
 the curve and we say that the deceleration 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.600
 according to the time and so there we can 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.460
 see that braking and on the wet and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.210
 not bad because we go up to 8 g of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.520
 deceleration go to the next I'm in 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.960
 train to install the system from him 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.940
 measure the distance of the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.520
 motorbike 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.220
 braking think an accelerometer there 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.430
 that a measure of motorcycle speed 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.050
 deceleration on everything and what is 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.840
 interesting it's coopers also extract 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.400
 movements like getting started from 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.490
 the decline which differentiates 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.090
 a little the tire work of the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.090
 hand work 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.720
 it does not have more than to analyze 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.450
 all that cold or the king is now 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.250
 finished cheese were worth to the workshop 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.250
 handling right now 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.710
 of this double goal test mans there is no 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.570
 no winner no father who we are 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.400
 right there to measure the behavior of the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.320
 little and its impact on the hand 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.060
 deities of the bike there are tires that 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.560
 fall quickly others who are rather 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.200
 heavy and progressive 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.740
 I see there is the purpose of this food 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.970
 which was made about 40 km later 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.090
 it's up to you to choose the tires according to your 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.090
 preferences 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.640
 behavior on the criterion habitat 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.860
 essential for the tires brought to be 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.090
 used summer and winter so on this 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.520
 constant watering track 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.460
 we checked the motricity the follower 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.610
 in the rain from the angle the 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.960
 progressivity of stalling then all 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.150
 these results are to be found in the 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.070
 hero of motorcycle magazine 199 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.070
 the July issue of August very soon
