00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
realize that you know if you're in a bad

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.070 
realize that you know if you're in a bad
relationship<00:04:30.430> because<00:04:31.390> he<00:04:31.780> doesn't<00:04:31.960> know

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
relationship because he doesn't know

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.800 
relationship because he doesn't know
that<00:04:32.260> she's<00:04:32.440> matching<00:04:32.800> your<00:04:32.890> vampire<00:04:33.810> you

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
that she's matching your vampire you

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.330 
that she's matching your vampire you

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
know what what I can do but it so it's

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.640 
know what what I can do but it so it's
really<00:04:36.790> I<00:04:36.970> guess<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.630> relationship<00:04:38.470> between

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.330 
really I guess a relationship between
those<00:04:39.040> three<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:40.240> essential<00:04:40.840> people<00:04:41.340> and

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
that's kind of I mean it's kind of a

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.260 
that's kind of I mean it's kind of a
small<00:04:44.890> scale<00:04:45.160> pants<00:04:45.430> there's<00:04:45.610> no<00:04:45.760> way<00:04:45.970> about

jokes and things like that so that isn't

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.600

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
gonna be for everyone and then I say the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.630 
gonna be for everyone and then I say the
story<00:05:34.180> isn't<00:05:34.720> even<00:05:35.200> a<00:05:35.230> huge<00:05:35.890> sprawling<00:05:36.160> story

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
story isn't even a huge sprawling story

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.760 
story isn't even a huge sprawling story
it's<00:05:36.790> a<00:05:36.850> very<00:05:36.880> very<00:05:37.240> small<00:05:37.630> story<00:05:38.380> it's

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
it's a very very small story it's

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.290 
it's a very very small story it's
obviously<00:05:39.010> a<00:05:39.100> low-budget<00:05:39.430> film<00:05:39.850> but<00:05:40.090> I<00:05:40.120> have

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
obviously a low-budget film but I have

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.690 
obviously a low-budget film but I have
to<00:05:40.420> say<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:41.500> know<00:05:41.650> for<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.370> bunny<00:05:42.550> that

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
to say you know for the bunny that

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.700 
to say you know for the bunny that
they've<00:05:42.880> got<00:05:43.150> they<00:05:43.390> they<00:05:43.600> they<00:05:44.230> did<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:44.500> right

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
they've got they they they did it right

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.480 
they've got they they they did it right
I<00:05:44.740> think<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.400> kind<00:05:45.610> of<00:05:46.650> didn't<00:05:47.650> try<00:05:47.920> to<00:05:47.980> do

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
I think and kind of didn't try to do

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.740 
I think and kind of didn't try to do
anything<00:05:48.520> that<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.030> budget<00:05:49.330> wouldn't<00:05:49.630> sort

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
anything that the budget wouldn't sort

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.230 
anything that the budget wouldn't sort
of<00:05:49.870> stretch<00:05:50.770> to<00:05:50.800> if<00:05:51.070> that<00:05:51.100> makes<00:05:51.430> sense<00:05:51.580> so<00:05:51.850> I

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
of stretch to if that makes sense so I

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.520 
of stretch to if that makes sense so I
actually<00:05:52.630> think<00:05:52.840> that<00:05:52.990> was<00:05:53.080> pretty<00:05:53.260> good<00:05:53.350> all

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
actually think that was pretty good all

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.900 
actually think that was pretty good all
the<00:05:53.710> effects<00:05:54.040> I<00:05:54.130> thought<00:05:54.340> work<00:05:54.550> with<00:05:54.760> them

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
the effects I thought work with them

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.390 
the effects I thought work with them
were<00:05:55.450> final<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.500> kind<00:05:56.710> of<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.890> plan<00:05:57.070> effects

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
were final the kind of the plan effects

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.520 
were final the kind of the plan effects
the<00:05:57.610> kind<00:05:58.090> of<00:05:58.180> vampire<00:05:58.300> effects<00:05:58.810> they're<00:05:59.380> not

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
the kind of vampire effects they're not

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.860 
the kind of vampire effects they're not
overly<00:05:59.920> extenuating<00:06:00.610> so<00:06:01.000> she<00:06:01.060> kind<00:06:01.360> of<00:06:01.450> know

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
overly extenuating so she kind of know

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.780 
overly extenuating so she kind of know
she<00:06:01.930> have<00:06:02.170> to<00:06:02.290> find<00:06:02.500> a<00:06:02.590> lot<00:06:02.800> huge<00:06:03.190> fangs<00:06:03.520> you

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
she have to find a lot huge fangs you

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.790 
she have to find a lot huge fangs you
just<00:06:03.910> got<00:06:04.270> these<00:06:04.360> like<00:06:04.570> contacts<00:06:05.200> on<00:06:05.350> the

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
just got these like contacts on the

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.160 
just got these like contacts on the
whole<00:06:06.010> time<00:06:06.310> so<00:06:07.300> they<00:06:07.420> know<00:06:07.570> the<00:06:07.720> effects<00:06:08.020> I

whole time so they know the effects I

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.660

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
think no sir the story and they were

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.350 
think no sir the story and they were
they<00:06:10.090> were<00:06:10.150> pretty<00:06:10.420> pretty<00:06:11.020> decent<00:06:12.240> he's<00:06:13.240> not

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
they were pretty pretty decent he's not

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.300 
they were pretty pretty decent he's not
gonna<00:06:13.510> be<00:06:13.600> Fred<00:06:13.840> ones<00:06:14.050> everyone's<00:06:14.800> taste<00:06:15.100> as<00:06:15.220> I

saw<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.490> humor<00:06:15.880> he's<00:06:16.060> gonna<00:06:16.180> be<00:06:16.330> one<00:06:16.480> of

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
saw the humor he's gonna be one of

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.600 
saw the humor he's gonna be one of
dividing<00:06:17.260> bond<00:06:17.440> here<00:06:17.680> and<00:06:17.830> it<00:06:18.280> certainly

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
dividing bond here and it certainly

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.180 
dividing bond here and it certainly
maybe<00:06:19.210> isn't<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:19.720> most<00:06:19.930> complex<00:06:20.560> plot<00:06:20.920> in<00:06:21.100> the

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
maybe isn't the most complex plot in the

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.310 
maybe isn't the most complex plot in the
world<00:06:21.430> but<00:06:22.000> overall<00:06:22.300> actually<00:06:22.960> that<00:06:23.110> it<00:06:23.200> was

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
world but overall actually that it was

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.990 
world but overall actually that it was
quite<00:06:23.560> an<00:06:23.680> enjoyable<00:06:24.040> film<00:06:24.430> there's<00:06:24.880> some
