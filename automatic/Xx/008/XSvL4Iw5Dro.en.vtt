wondering I have my dance concert this
Saturday<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:35.360> we<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.660> doing<00:00:36.960> kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
Saturday and we are doing kind of a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.549 
Saturday and we are doing kind of a
contemporary<00:00:38.270> type<00:00:39.270> thing<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.870> our<00:00:40.050> points

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
contemporary type thing for our points

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.220 
contemporary type thing for our points
so<00:00:40.770> that's<00:00:41.309> why<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.940> these<00:00:42.180> elastics<00:00:42.960> on

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
so that's why I have these elastics on

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.220 
so that's why I have these elastics on
them<00:00:43.410> usually<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:45.420> ribbons<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
them usually I have the ribbons and I

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.650 
them usually I have the ribbons and I
tie<00:00:46.440> them<00:00:46.649> around<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.329> sake<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
tie them around but just for the sake of

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.160 
tie them around but just for the sake of
the<00:00:48.989> performance<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.280> these<00:00:51.170> thick

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the performance I have these thick

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.990 
the performance I have these thick
elastic<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.370> call<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.850> with

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
elastic and then just call it in with

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.569 
elastic and then just call it in with
the<00:00:54.090> foundation<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> theme<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the foundation so the theme is what you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.939 
the foundation so the theme is what you
wear<00:00:57.120> inside<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.960> pointe<00:00:58.890> shoes<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.949> try

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
wear inside your pointe shoes so I try

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.700 
wear inside your pointe shoes so I try
not<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> stuff<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.300> lot<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.660> things<00:01:03.899> inside<00:01:04.260> my

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
not to stuff a lot of things inside my

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.350 
not to stuff a lot of things inside my
pointe<00:01:04.949> shoes<00:01:05.159> because<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> find<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.119> more

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pointe shoes because I find the more

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.300 
pointe shoes because I find the more
that<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.659> stuff<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.320> higher<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.070> feel

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that you stuff the higher it is to feel

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.330 
that you stuff the higher it is to feel
the<00:01:08.490> ground<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.630> actually<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> only<00:01:10.860> thing<00:01:11.100> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the ground so actually the only thing I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
the ground so actually the only thing I
use<00:01:11.960> what's<00:01:12.960> called<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:14.010> toe<00:01:14.670> pad<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.750> call<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
use what's called a toe pad or I call it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.760 
use what's called a toe pad or I call it
an<00:01:16.619> ounce<00:01:16.799> pouch<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
an ounce pouch and so this one is a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.270 
an ounce pouch and so this one is a
medium<00:01:20.189> I'm<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.630> exact<00:01:22.320> name<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.830> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
medium I'm not sure the exact name of it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.630 
medium I'm not sure the exact name of it
but<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.270> only<00:01:24.750> got<00:01:25.110> gel<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.340> side

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
but it's only got gel on the one side

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.280 
but it's only got gel on the one side
this<00:01:27.030> side<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:28.520> really<00:01:29.520> thin<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> decide<00:01:31.110> is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
this side is really thin and decide is

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.310 
this side is really thin and decide is
quite<00:01:31.680> thick<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.970> actually<00:01:33.210> used<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> wear

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
quite thick and I actually used to wear

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.420 
quite thick and I actually used to wear
these<00:01:34.619> ones<00:01:35.009> which<00:01:36.049> had<00:01:37.049> gel<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.680> both<00:01:38.040> sides

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
these ones which had gel on both sides

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
these ones which had gel on both sides
but<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> found<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.840> was<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.290> really

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
but I found that it was really really

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.590 
but I found that it was really really
hard<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.220> fill<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> floor<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.479> they

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
hard to fill the floor just because they

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.770 
hard to fill the floor just because they
were<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.990> thick<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.540> much

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
were so thick and it was just so much

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
were so thick and it was just so much
harder<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.040> fill<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> floor<00:01:47.640> because

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
harder to fill the floor because

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.090 
harder to fill the floor because
sometimes<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.540> would<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.720> practice<00:01:49.560> warm<00:01:49.920> up

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
sometimes I would just practice warm up

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.319 
sometimes I would just practice warm up
without<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:51.000> toe<00:01:51.600> pads<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.170> while<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.920> was

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
without my toe pads and while it was

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.749 
without my toe pads and while it was
painful<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.509> actually<00:01:55.079> felt<00:01:55.409> better<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.490> then

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
painful it actually felt better so then

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.760 
painful it actually felt better so then
when<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> went<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.869> my<00:01:57.899> next<00:01:58.320> point<00:01:58.530> shoe

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
when I went for my next point shoe

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.370 
when I went for my next point shoe
fitting<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.219> decided<00:01:59.640> to<00:02:00.000> ask<00:02:00.570> about<00:02:01.110> what

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
fitting I decided to ask about what

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.160 
fitting I decided to ask about what
would<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.590> better<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.340> lady<00:02:03.090> suggested<00:02:03.899> these

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
would be better and lady suggested these

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.940 
would be better and lady suggested these
so<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.759> I've<00:02:06.030> been<00:02:06.420> wearing

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
so this is what I've been wearing

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.400 
so this is what I've been wearing
sometimes<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.670> don't<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.750> any<00:02:09.899> with<00:02:10.140> me<00:02:10.170> at

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
sometimes I don't have any with me at

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.619 
sometimes I don't have any with me at
the<00:02:10.590> moment<00:02:10.619> but<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.099> do<00:02:11.220> wear<00:02:11.520> toe<00:02:11.819> separators

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
the moment but I do wear toe separators

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.089 
the moment but I do wear toe separators
they're<00:02:12.870> kind<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.500> these<00:02:14.000> rubber

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
they're kind of just like these rubber
