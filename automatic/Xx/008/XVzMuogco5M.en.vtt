 hello my loves welcome to my channel 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.299
 one more week today I bring you a recipe 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.549
 a bit on the tonic that we are 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.859
 following that they are easy recipes and 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.650
 very tasty recipes so today 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.840
 I bring a recipe with Chinese pasta the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 Chinese coast has the peculiarity that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.460
 It is done very quickly and also 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.610
 It has a peculiar flavor that does not look like 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.270
 nothing like the pasta that normally 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.149
 we consume forgiveness 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.730
 let's use green pepper 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.589
 red beef broth and this is very 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.809
 important or beef broth 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.239
 so that we understand each other does not work 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.710
 chicken so do not even try it now know 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.010
 well but it will not be like the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.019
 recipe and finally prawns prawns 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.359
 can be frozen can be fresh 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.190
 and you can even use prawns what 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.750
 make it more comfortable for you than what 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.520
 which best fits our economy 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.830
 now the first step what we're going to 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.420
 to do is put water to heat and when 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.489
 is boiling let's submerge our 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.340
 pasta to be made in four minutes 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.020
 then let's make grilled with 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.750
 a little oil can be 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.850
 ground sunflower our vegetables and 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.470
 finally let's skip the with the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.470
 prawns let's see the steps 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.450
 good girls here we have already the ha 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.609
 commented we have simply mixed a 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.069
 little pepper with prawns with 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.409
 the pasta as I told you this recipe is 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.299
 very easy to do that you do not need 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.249
 add absolutely nothing else because 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.009
 it is a very peculiar flavor to which the 

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:03.319
 contrasts of the pepper and the ranges 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.869
 they go great to encourage you to try them you will see 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.000
 how are you going to love more or less the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.739
 ration is like for two or three people 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.900
 It depends on what you eat but rather 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.239
 towards three people I hope that I have 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.310
