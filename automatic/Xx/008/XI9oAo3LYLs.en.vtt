00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.120
 hi to all with that of tess 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.900
 mobile.fr play mw 2015 on the stand of 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.389
 zte and I have in front of me the blade s6 plus 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.799
 it's not the device that zte goes the most 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.960
 the but will not put themselves forward they 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.360
 will focus more on sii on 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.650
 blade is 6 but I thought it was 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.340
 interesting as to show you what 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.680
 looks and 7 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.330
 this fable is finally under android 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.320
 then with a 5-point 5-inch screen 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.970
 full hd so 1080 by 1920 a battery 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.500
 of 3000 billion loses 13 megapixels 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.840
 at the back 5 at the front a processor 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.580
 octo core 5 giga hertz of giga of ram 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.510
 a gigabytes of internal memory with microphone 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.760
 sd to go up to 128 giga more 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.989
 they and 4g category 4 it turns under 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.260
 android 5.0 it has a design that looks 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.870
 to quite the bled if what we have 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.730
 already taken in hand also a little bit 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.440
 different maybe I do not know no no 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.910
 no it's frozen next I look it's 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.519
 exactly the same thing so on the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.740
 side there you have volume 1 to lock 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.159
 unlock where you have the camera 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.229
 frontal and some sensors the touch 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.420
 here with my on the sides it's going to be 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.880
 menu and back on the water the jack and port 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.619
 infrared I think of nothing on that side 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.100
 on that side we have already watched the microphone 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.569
 usb onu at the interface whose 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.899
 that turns under the pop bed it's rather 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.630
 cool 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.749
 here we see a body keeping the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.259
 drawer here and then after that's from 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.389
 classical 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.709
 ZTE ie not bah menu where 

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:39.790
 all voice applications be 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:42.910
 stored you have there an overlay 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.090
 which seems to have a theme at the level 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.130
 launcher which allows access by 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.530
 example to icons a little nice 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.540
 that sort of thing if I stay supported the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.910
 g google now which is displayed if i stay 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.720
 pressed on menuge and the multitasking that 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.620
 are displayed in the format carrousel lo 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.820
 they sabers have the age and the 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.380
 protection it's not practical to take 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.790
 in hand but it's a big terminal by 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.100
 against it looks anyway smaller 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.050
 because I have the feeling that he is a little 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.399
 smaller than an iphone 6 more we will do 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.140
 necessarily the parallel between the two 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.660
 breasts would only be in terms of 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.520
 design but I think it is a little 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.880
 smaller I'm not sure so here we have 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.709
 skied message 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.900
 the good gallery is classic 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.970
 it's classic android music 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.620
 music player that looks like that with 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.580
 milk on the side to access 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.230
 to the good pieces there is nothing in it 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.790
 tac tac tac I imagine that the mails are 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.640
 not configured so it's not great 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.780
 thing 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.370
 why is not much to say it's a 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.900
 device that is interesting that is 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.459
 interesting in not if we have to 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.870
 easily obtain in France by cons 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.209
 that's a bit of a problem here too 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.820
 will probably be easier but the one 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.400
 I have one I have no idea actually 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.910
 is there we have different modes and in mode 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.130
 simple and dyed expert mode 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.730
 with different parameters i 6o has 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.100
 whale 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.780
 we can settle so that must be for 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.880
 the exhibition that's going to be for the focus 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.890
 we will see if his rights or not 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.690
 it's top that's pretty complete as 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.190
 involvement at level 1 level photo 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.510
 that's about all we have also 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.940
 that masters that helps clean 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.560
 different different things the Arabic to 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.940
 the memory used this stuff 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.019
 that was it for my little catch in 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.100
 s6 hand over at mwc 2015 if you have 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.330
 questions of course do not hesitate where 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.610
 I have the impression that it is dual sim 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.250
 also I see it in the taskbar 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.510
 tasks there oh there the 2 6 mhz 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.820
 have to finish making things fall 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.400
 the thing yeah I think we can 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.510
 remove the hull and access the 2.6 mhz 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.510
 see you soon
