from a Christian he said I've heard that

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.240 
from a Christian he said I've heard that
Muslims<00:00:15.780> respect<00:00:16.170> Jews<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.680> Christians<00:00:17.070> as

that the one unforgivable sin is shirk

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960 
that the one unforgivable sin is shirk
which<00:00:22.109> involves<00:00:22.650> equating<00:00:23.220> anyone<00:00:23.609> with<00:00:23.760> God

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
Trinity this seems to lead to a

as people at the book and on the other

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
as people at the book and on the other
hand<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.320> say<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.770> shirk<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> one

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
hand we say that shirk is the one

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.569 
hand we say that shirk is the one
unforgivable<00:00:45.180> sin<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.860> when<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.070> gets<00:00:47.280> into

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
unforgivable sin and when one gets into

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.060 
unforgivable sin and when one gets into
the<00:00:47.700> details<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.750> shirk<00:00:49.289> entails<00:00:49.739> it

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.270 
the details of what shirk entails it
seems<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:51.110> taking<00:00:52.110> Jesus<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.920> Son<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
seems that taking Jesus as the Son of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.770 
seems that taking Jesus as the Son of
God<00:00:53.430> literally<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.860> Christian<00:00:56.250> Trinity

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
God literally and the Christian Trinity

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.170 
God literally and the Christian Trinity
must<00:00:57.780> fall<00:00:58.289> under<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.649> belief<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.730> Muslims

must fall under that belief of Muslims
that<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.469> classified<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.250> shirk<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:04.170> how<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.350> we

due<00:01:24.060> only<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.420> God<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.500> confuse<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
due only to God to confuse the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.200 
due only to God to confuse the
categories<00:01:26.460> between<00:01:26.610> God<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> His<00:01:27.180> creation

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
categories between God and His creation

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
categories between God and His creation
all<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.170> referred<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.770> shirk

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
all of this is referred to as shirk

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120 
all of this is referred to as shirk
so<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.509> how<00:01:30.689> do<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.079> reconcile<00:01:31.799> these<00:01:31.829> two

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
so then how do we reconcile these two

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.569 
so then how do we reconcile these two
apparently<00:01:32.970> conflicting<00:01:33.360> things<00:01:33.890> mmm<00:01:34.890> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
apparently conflicting things mmm it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.789 
apparently conflicting things mmm it
seems<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> me<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.299> best<00:01:36.390> way<00:01:36.600> of

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
seems to me that the best way of

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.760 
seems to me that the best way of
reconciling<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.369> say<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.790> God<00:01:39.770> is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
reconciling this is to say that God is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.520 
reconciling this is to say that God is
more<00:01:41.070> broad-minded<00:01:41.310> than<00:01:41.729> than<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.570> when

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
more broad-minded than than we are when

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.469 
more broad-minded than than we are when
he<00:01:43.860> revealed<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> Quranic<00:01:44.790> message<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
he revealed the Quranic message to the

I've<00:02:36.510> had<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.780> think<00:02:36.930> about<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.650> some<00:02:37.800> of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
I've had to think about this and some of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.620 
I've had to think about this and some of
them<00:02:38.069> said<00:02:38.310> well<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.819> common<00:02:39.150> people<00:02:39.420> won't

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
them said well the common people won't

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.440 
them said well the common people won't
be<00:02:39.810> responsible<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:40.670> their<00:02:41.670> beliefs<00:02:42.090> which

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450

which are outside of the parameters of
acceptable<00:02:45.000> Islamic<00:02:45.480> belief<00:02:46.100> because<00:02:47.100> this

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
acceptable Islamic belief because this

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.890 
acceptable Islamic belief because this
is<00:02:47.970> what<00:02:48.120> they<00:02:48.239> have<00:02:48.330> been<00:02:48.360> taught<00:02:48.690> through

since childhood and and they know

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.970 
since childhood and and they know
nothing<00:02:51.239> better<00:02:51.420> than<00:02:51.630> than<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:52.680> their

nothing better than than this but their

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.640 
nothing better than than this but their
leaders<00:02:53.730> who<00:02:53.940> should<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.269> known<00:02:54.420> better<00:02:54.650> who
