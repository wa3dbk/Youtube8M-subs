and<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.890> actual<00:01:35.250> stick<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> probably

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and the the actual stick is probably

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
and the the actual stick is probably
very<00:01:36.329> very<00:01:36.420> comfortable<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.189> especially<00:01:38.189> for

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
very very comfortable and especially for

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.830 
very very comfortable and especially for
the<00:01:38.460> thumb<00:01:38.700> which<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.360> actually<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> be

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the thumb which are actually going to be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.420 
the thumb which are actually going to be
using<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.770> control<00:01:41.130> freaks

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
using it with a lot of control freaks

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.249 
using it with a lot of control freaks
and<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> lot<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> dimples<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.170> this

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and have a lot of dimples on but this

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.960 
and have a lot of dimples on but this
one's<00:01:43.530> got<00:01:43.649> quite<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> smooth<00:01:44.280> design<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
one's got quite a smooth design but the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.240 
one's got quite a smooth design but the
rubber<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.360> very<00:01:45.450> very<00:01:45.840> textured<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
rubber is very very textured and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.889 
rubber is very very textured and
definitely<00:01:47.640> will<00:01:47.820> add<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.299> more<00:01:48.450> grip<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
definitely will add for more grip and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.840 
definitely will add for more grip and
obviously<00:01:49.110> quicker<00:01:49.470> movement<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:50.280> far<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
obviously quicker movement as far as the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
obviously quicker movement as far as the
actual<00:01:50.970> base<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> stick<00:01:51.899> goes<00:01:52.110> where

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
actual base of the stick goes where

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.649 
actual base of the stick goes where
obviously<00:01:52.950> these<00:01:53.070> are<00:01:53.220> made<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> ps4<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
obviously these are made for the ps4 the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.840 
obviously these are made for the ps4 the
actual<00:01:54.899> base<00:01:55.079> has<00:01:55.320> been<00:01:55.350> lowered<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> bring

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
actual base has been lowered to bring

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.370 
actual base has been lowered to bring
the<00:01:57.000> stick<00:01:57.270> closer<00:01:57.509> together<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.200> base

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the stick closer together to the base

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.530 
the stick closer together to the base
you've<00:01:58.680> actually<00:01:58.829> got<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> the<00:02:00.000> connectors

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you've actually got the the connectors

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.539 
you've actually got the the connectors
here<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:00.990> been<00:02:01.140> badly<00:02:01.439> brought<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.369> because

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
here have been badly brought in because

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.819 
here have been badly brought in because
the<00:02:02.850> obviously<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.390> sticks<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> ps4

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the obviously the sticks on the ps4

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.170 
the obviously the sticks on the ps4
controller<00:02:05.189> are<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.369> lot<00:02:05.490> smaller<00:02:05.759> than<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
controller are a lot smaller than the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.900 
controller are a lot smaller than the
ps3<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.619> generally<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.250> been<00:02:08.580> shrunk

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
ps3 but generally it's just been shrunk

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.850 
ps3 but generally it's just been shrunk
down<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.599> fit<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> ps4<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:10.679> we're<00:02:10.770> going

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
down to fit the ps4 so now we're going

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.949 
down to fit the ps4 so now we're going
to<00:02:10.920> install<00:02:11.250> them<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> controller<00:02:11.970> ok

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
to install them on the controller ok

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.820 
to install them on the controller ok
guys<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.319> I'm<00:02:13.379> not<00:02:13.530> sure

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
guys so I'm not sure

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.110 
guys so I'm not sure
many<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.460> actually<00:02:14.550> installed

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
many of you have actually installed

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.420 
many of you have actually installed
control<00:02:15.480> freaks<00:02:15.720> before<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.260> they<00:02:16.380> are

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
control freaks before but they are

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.310 
control freaks before but they are
incredibly<00:02:17.430> easy<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.940> install<00:02:18.150> literally<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
incredibly easy to install literally you

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.710 
incredibly easy to install literally you
just<00:02:19.500> press<00:02:19.860> down<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.490> side<00:02:20.540> which<00:02:21.540> will

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
just press down on one side which will

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.880 
just press down on one side which will
then<00:02:21.840> connect<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> other<00:02:22.380> two<00:02:22.650> sides

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
then connect the other two sides

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.830 
then connect the other two sides
together<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.210> just<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.540> same

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
together and then you just do the same

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.720 
together and then you just do the same
with<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> left<00:02:25.410> analog<00:02:25.830> stick<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.400> obviously

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
with the left analog stick to obviously

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.940 
with the left analog stick to obviously
fit<00:02:27.060> them<00:02:27.240> both<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.870> tandem<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.620> as<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.860> can

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
fit them both in tandem so as you can

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.220 
fit them both in tandem so as you can
see<00:02:29.010> these<00:02:29.760> sticks<00:02:30.090> are<00:02:30.240> now<00:02:30.390> fitted<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
see these sticks are now fitted to the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.690 
see these sticks are now fitted to the
ps4<00:02:31.470> controller<00:02:31.950> as<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.310> see<00:02:32.460> in<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
ps4 controller as you can see in the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.090 
ps4 controller as you can see in the
design<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.330> actual<00:02:34.170> sticks<00:02:34.650> are<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> little

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
design the actual sticks are a little

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.680 
design the actual sticks are a little
bit<00:02:35.280> lower<00:02:35.460> down<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.060> actual<00:02:36.180> base<00:02:36.480> as

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
bit lower down to the actual base as

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.180 
bit lower down to the actual base as
well<00:02:36.870> these<00:02:37.080> don't<00:02:37.260> seem<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.620> stand<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:38.070> as

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
well these don't seem to stand up as

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.130 
well these don't seem to stand up as
much<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:38.640> obviously<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.510> needs<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.990> happen

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
much but obviously that needs to happen

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.570 
much but obviously that needs to happen
because<00:02:40.380> obviously<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.890> sticks<00:02:41.220> aren't<00:02:41.430> as

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
because obviously the sticks aren't as

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.030 
because obviously the sticks aren't as
big<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.420> ps4<00:02:42.690> compared<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.410> ps3<00:02:43.650> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
big on the ps4 compared to the ps3 so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.010 
big on the ps4 compared to the ps3 so
everything<00:02:44.490> looks<00:02:44.610> smaller<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:45.690> contrast

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
everything looks smaller but in contrast

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.080 
everything looks smaller but in contrast
to<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.530> actual<00:02:46.800> controller<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.580> does<00:02:47.760> feel

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
to the actual controller it does feel

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.150 
to the actual controller it does feel
normal<00:02:48.390> for<00:02:48.540> control<00:02:48.990> freaks<00:02:49.230> now<00:02:49.410> what<00:02:49.980> these

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
normal for control freaks now what these

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.740 
normal for control freaks now what these
sticks<00:02:50.490> allow<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.390> when<00:02:51.600> you're

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
sticks allow you to do is when you're

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.810 
sticks allow you to do is when you're
using<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.140> long-range<00:02:52.500> weapon<00:02:52.650> they<00:02:53.520> allow<00:02:53.760> you

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
using a long-range weapon they allow you

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.280 
using a long-range weapon they allow you
to<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:54.150> more<00:02:54.360> movement<00:02:54.870> which<00:02:55.020> will<00:02:55.140> allow

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
to have more movement which will allow

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.560 
to have more movement which will allow
you<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.590> basically<00:02:56.100> scope<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.910> or<00:02:57.090> zoom<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.480> on

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
you to basically scope in or zoom in on

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.810 
you to basically scope in or zoom in on
your<00:02:57.720> target<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.200> lot<00:02:58.350> faster<00:02:58.890> control<00:02:59.550> freaks

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
your target a lot faster control freaks

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.520 
your target a lot faster control freaks
always<00:03:00.240> give<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> better<00:03:01.020> range<00:03:01.350> of

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
always give you a better range of

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.930 
always give you a better range of
movement<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.580> good<00:03:02.700> thing<00:03:02.880> about

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
movement and the good thing about

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.150 
movement and the good thing about
control<00:03:03.420> freaks<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.810> even<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.620> give

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
control freaks is even that it do give

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160 
control freaks is even that it do give
you<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.459> more<00:03:05.850> range<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.300> movement<00:03:06.780> they

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
you this more range of movement they

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.780 
you this more range of movement they
don't<00:03:07.410> actually<00:03:07.560> touch<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.220> controller<00:03:08.580> in

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
don't actually touch the controller in

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.580 
don't actually touch the controller in
any<00:03:08.940> way<00:03:09.090> shape<00:03:09.390> or<00:03:09.510> form<00:03:09.570> which<00:03:09.959> allows<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.560> to

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
any way shape or form which allows it to

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.920 
any way shape or form which allows it to
use<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.550> actual<00:03:11.910> analog<00:03:12.540> stick<00:03:12.780> that's

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
use the actual analog stick that's

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.800 
use the actual analog stick that's
underneath<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:14.459> circulate<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.240> rotate<00:03:15.660> as

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
underneath to circulate and rotate as

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.740 
underneath to circulate and rotate as
much<00:03:16.140> as<00:03:16.410> possible<00:03:16.770> obviously<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:18.209> these

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
much as possible obviously this these

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.820 
much as possible obviously this these
sticks<00:03:19.050> obviously<00:03:19.350> give<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.650> lot<00:03:19.800> more

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
sticks obviously give you a lot more

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.620 
sticks obviously give you a lot more
grip<00:03:20.160> as<00:03:20.340> well<00:03:20.550> these<00:03:20.760> are<00:03:20.820> definitely<00:03:21.480> more

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
grip as well these are definitely more

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.870 
grip as well these are definitely more
grippy<00:03:22.019> than<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.650> original<00:03:23.280> analog<00:03:23.580> sticks

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
grippy than the original analog sticks

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.460 
grippy than the original analog sticks
underneath<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.900> they<00:03:25.050> obviously<00:03:25.140> have<00:03:25.440> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
underneath and they obviously have a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.759 
underneath and they obviously have a
comm<00:03:25.739> convex<00:03:26.489> design<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.180> basically<00:03:27.769> it

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
comm convex design so basically it

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.020 
comm convex design so basically it
extrudes<00:03:29.670> out<00:03:29.970> rather<00:03:30.300> than<00:03:31.489> goes<00:03:32.489> in<00:03:32.790> light

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
extrudes out rather than goes in light

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.060 
extrudes out rather than goes in light
up<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.480> then<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.350> generally<00:03:34.739> allow<00:03:35.010> us

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
up and then in so it generally allow us

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.590 
up and then in so it generally allow us
to<00:03:35.250> sit<00:03:35.489> better<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:35.910> your<00:03:36.060> thumbs<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.570> I

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
to sit better on your thumbs and I

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.360 
to sit better on your thumbs and I
definitely<00:03:36.959> think<00:03:37.080> control<00:03:37.470> freaks<00:03:37.739> suit<00:03:38.190> a

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
definitely think control freaks suit a

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.759 
definitely think control freaks suit a
ps4<00:03:39.000> controller<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.750> lot<00:03:40.260> better<00:03:40.500> than<00:03:40.709> the

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
ps4 controller a lot better than the

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.580 
ps4 controller a lot better than the
Xbox<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.519> don't<00:03:41.730> think<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.840> actual

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
Xbox I just don't think the the actual

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.890 
Xbox I just don't think the the actual
analog<00:03:43.950> sticks<00:03:44.280> on<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.610> ps4<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.360> great<00:03:45.690> to

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
analog sticks on the ps4 that great to

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.150 
analog sticks on the ps4 that great to
be<00:03:45.989> honest<00:03:46.170> with<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.320> but<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.769> control

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
be honest with you but with control

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.009 
be honest with you but with control
freaks<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.670> definitely<00:03:48.570> very<00:03:48.840> very

freaks on definitely very very

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.750 
freaks on definitely very very
comfortable<00:03:49.230> they<00:03:49.739> don't<00:03:49.769> extrude<00:03:50.400> too<00:03:50.610> much

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
comfortable they don't extrude too much

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.699 
comfortable they don't extrude too much
they<00:03:50.910> don't<00:03:51.000> set<00:03:51.300> up<00:03:51.390> too<00:03:51.600> much<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.620> is

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
they don't set up too much so that is

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.470 
they don't set up too much so that is
basically<00:03:52.920> my<00:03:53.220> review<00:03:53.519> guys<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.150> control
