maybe has had a little too much but you
know<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.219> their<00:00:44.370> last

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
know this is going to be their last

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.560 
know this is going to be their last
drink<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:44.969> already<00:00:45.270> called<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
drink because they already called the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.240 
drink because they already called the
cab<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.260> you're<00:00:46.379> making<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.829> more<00:00:46.980> drink

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
cab so you're making them one more drink

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.619 
cab so you're making them one more drink
and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.730> don't<00:00:47.850> want<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.120> them<00:00:48.239> too<00:00:48.390> drunk

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and you don't want to get them too drunk

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
and you don't want to get them too drunk
I<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.559> give<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:49.860> example<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> do

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
I will give you an example what to do

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.200 
I will give you an example what to do
we're<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> fill<00:00:51.360> our<00:00:51.390> glass<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.220 

this<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.329> another<00:01:00.510> reason<00:01:00.719> why<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.079> really

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this is another reason why it's really

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.450 
this is another reason why it's really
important<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> fill<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.800> glass<00:01:01.949> all<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> way

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
important to fill the glass all the way

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.009 
important to fill the glass all the way
to<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> top<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.090> because<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.539> leaves<00:01:03.750> less

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
to the top it's because it leaves less

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.539 
to the top it's because it leaves less
room<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.439> alcohol<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.949> leave<00:01:05.070> less<00:01:05.309> room<00:01:05.519> for

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
room for alcohol it leave less room for

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.670 
room for alcohol it leave less room for
mixer<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> chill<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
mixer and it's just going to chill the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.960 
mixer and it's just going to chill the
glass<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:08.159> well<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.580> we're<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> make

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
glass really well so we're going to make

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.690 
glass really well so we're going to make
a<00:01:09.000> drink<00:01:09.210> real<00:01:09.420> quick<00:01:10.340> now<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
a drink real quick now this is the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
a drink real quick now this is the
secret<00:01:11.880> what<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.270> typically<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.110> you'd

the stir in but for example if you would
like<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.850> make<00:01:17.850> someone<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.330> they're

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
you're just going to put the stirrer

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.850 
you're just going to put the stirrer
right<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> top<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.170> when<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> pour<00:01:22.710> the

alcohol you're going to pour it right
over<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> straw<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.650> kind<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
over the straw so this can be kind of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.249 
over the straw so this can be kind of
tricky<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:27.630> great<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
tricky it's great to do this if the

tricky it's great to do this if the
person's<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.680> looking<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.159> even<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.430> they

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
person's not looking but even if they

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.649 
person's not looking but even if they
are<00:01:29.640> they'll<00:01:29.880> think<00:01:30.030> you're<00:01:30.150> doing<00:01:30.360> some<00:01:30.540> sort

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
of a trick so now at the first sip they

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
of a trick so now at the first sip they
take<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.170> pretty<00:01:34.380> strong<00:01:34.650> so

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
take is going to be pretty strong so

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
take is going to be pretty strong so
