loom specifically a Stratocaster trim
line<00:00:26.990> now<00:00:27.350> this<00:00:27.470> requires<00:00:27.680> some<00:00:28.040> setup<00:00:28.700> what

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
line now this requires some setup what

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.760 
line now this requires some setup what
you<00:00:29.060> want<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.300> have<00:00:29.450> it<00:00:29.660> is<00:00:30.140> have<00:00:30.440> your<00:00:30.619> guitar

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
you want to have it is have your guitar

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.890 
you want to have it is have your guitar
trim<00:00:31.640> allow<00:00:31.790> to<00:00:31.850> set<00:00:32.090> up<00:00:32.210> two<00:00:32.300> intervals<00:00:32.630> so

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
trim allow to set up two intervals so

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.350 
trim allow to set up two intervals so
that<00:00:32.930> when<00:00:33.170> I<00:00:33.200> play<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.530> E<00:00:33.680> string<00:00:37.030> it<00:00:38.030> goes<00:00:38.210> to

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
that when I play the E string it goes to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.460 
that when I play the E string it goes to
an<00:00:38.450> F<00:00:38.570> note<00:00:40.210> B<00:00:41.210> goes<00:00:41.450> up<00:00:41.720> so<00:00:41.900> that's<00:00:42.020> a<00:00:42.260> half

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
an F note B goes up so that's a half

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.350 
an F note B goes up so that's a half
step<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.010> want<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:43.370> e<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.850> go<00:00:44.090> up<00:00:44.270> a

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
step so you want you to e to go up a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.060 
step so you want you to e to go up a
half<00:00:44.540> step<00:00:44.720> your<00:00:45.290> B<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:45.559> go<00:00:45.710> up<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.890> whole<00:00:46.010> step

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
half step your B to go up a whole step

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.420 
half step your B to go up a whole step
so<00:00:46.550> B<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.879> C<00:00:47.000> sharp<00:00:50.800> energy<00:00:51.800> to<00:00:51.920> go<00:00:52.040> up<00:00:52.129> a<00:00:52.220> minor

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
so B to C sharp energy to go up a minor

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.200 
so B to C sharp energy to go up a minor
third<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:52.970> G<00:00:53.150> to<00:00:53.269> B<00:00:53.390> flat<00:00:57.729> this<00:00:58.729> takes<00:00:58.970> a<00:00:59.059> little

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
third so G to B flat this takes a little

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.610 
third so G to B flat this takes a little
setup<00:00:59.690> but<00:00:59.809> it's<00:00:59.930> simple<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:00.320> takes<00:01:00.500> about

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
setup but it's simple it takes about

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.200 
setup but it's simple it takes about
thirty<00:01:00.920> minutes<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.339> I'll<00:01:01.460> link<00:01:01.670> in<00:01:01.940> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
thirty minutes and I'll link in the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.600 
thirty minutes and I'll link in the
description<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.989> link<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> video<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.489> I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
description a link to a video that I

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.700 
description a link to a video that I
learned<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.089> from

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
learned it from

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.350 
learned it from
super<00:01:06.710> simple<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.220> guys<00:01:07.370> names<00:01:07.700> Freud<00:01:08.090> Jeff

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
super simple the guys names Freud Jeff

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.690 
super simple the guys names Freud Jeff
so<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:08.870> have<00:01:09.020> said<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.770> wrong<00:01:09.890> he's<00:01:10.370> an<00:01:10.490> Italian

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
so I have said it wrong he's an Italian

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.590 
with you and he really shows me how to
set<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.650> up<00:01:12.740> it's<00:01:13.040> simple<00:01:13.430> easy<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:13.850> do<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.420> it

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
set it up it's simple easy to do and it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.060 
set it up it's simple easy to do and it
really<00:01:14.630> opens<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:15.229> up<00:01:15.350> for<00:01:15.560> some<00:01:15.680> licks<00:01:15.890> like

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
really opens you up for some licks like

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.950 
really opens you up for some licks like
I<00:01:16.250> was<00:01:16.370> playing<00:01:16.640> in<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.850> beginning<00:01:17.180> so

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
I was playing in the beginning so

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.289 
I was playing in the beginning so
basically<00:01:18.830> what<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.760> need<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.030> do<00:01:20.150> is

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
basically what you need to do is

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.600 
basically what you need to do is
envision<00:01:20.900> your<00:01:21.020> guitar<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.770> little

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
envision your guitar a little

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.370 
envision your guitar a little
differently<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.180> have<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.509> think<00:01:23.780> about

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
differently you have to think about

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.649 
differently you have to think about
different<00:01:25.250> chord<00:01:25.729> shapes<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.240> have<00:01:26.329> to<00:01:26.479> think

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
different chord shapes you have to think

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.480 
different chord shapes you have to think
about<00:01:26.780> different<00:01:27.170> positions<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:27.770> start<00:01:28.340> with

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
about different positions so start with

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.850 
about different positions so start with
will<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.000> go<00:01:29.119> at<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.329> simple<00:01:29.659> lick<00:01:29.810> here<00:01:30.020> so

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
will just go at the simple lick here so

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.109 
will just go at the simple lick here so
since<00:01:31.219> I<00:01:31.430> know<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:33.009> my<00:01:34.009> E<00:01:34.219> string<00:01:34.909> at<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
since I know that my E string at the

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.660 
since I know that my E string at the
bottom<00:01:35.509> goes<00:01:35.869> up<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.109> half-step<00:01:36.490> well<00:01:37.490> let's

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
bottom goes up a half-step well let's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.910 
bottom goes up a half-step well let's
say<00:01:37.850> this<00:01:38.090> link<00:01:38.329> I<00:01:38.390> played<00:01:38.630> here<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.840> second<00:01:39.200> ago

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.440 

what<00:01:42.920> I'm<00:01:43.039> doing<00:01:43.310> there<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.700> I'm<00:01:43.969> targeting

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
what I'm doing there is I'm targeting

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.510 
what I'm doing there is I'm targeting
this<00:01:44.659> B<00:01:44.990> no<00:01:45.049> we're<00:01:45.380> an<00:01:45.469> E<00:01:45.560> minor<00:01:45.799> here<00:01:46.159> or<00:01:46.310> G

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
this B no we're an E minor here or G

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.999 
this B no we're an E minor here or G
either<00:01:46.880> one

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
either one

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.810 
either one
what<00:01:49.009> I'm<00:01:49.130> doing<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.549> targeting<00:01:49.969> this<00:01:50.119> beat

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
what I'm doing is targeting this beat

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.280 
what I'm doing is targeting this beat
well<00:01:52.820> since<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.120> know<00:01:53.180> that<00:01:53.540> if<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:53.750> play<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:53.990> half

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
well since I know that if I play a half

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.780 
well since I know that if I play a half
step<00:01:54.620> below<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.040> then<00:01:55.159> pull<00:01:55.400> up<00:01:55.430> on<00:01:55.670> my

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
step below it and then pull up on my

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.580 
step below it and then pull up on my
trimmer<00:01:56.000> or<00:01:56.210> I'm<00:01:56.450> going<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.659> hit<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.870> note

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.480 

it's<00:02:00.590> what<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.800> can<00:02:00.920> do<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.130> cool<00:02:01.370> little

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
it's what you can do is a cool little

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.000 
it's what you can do is a cool little
pull<00:02:01.790> off<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.600> lick<00:02:02.840> without<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.770> tremolo

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
pull off so the lick without the tremolo

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.940 
pull off so the lick without the tremolo
would<00:02:04.550> be

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.500 

B<00:02:07.640> G<00:02:07.970> F<00:02:08.119> sharp<00:02:08.860> but<00:02:09.860> since<00:02:10.550> I'm<00:02:10.729> pulling<00:02:11.120> up<00:02:11.300> I

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
B G F sharp but since I'm pulling up I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.830 
B G F sharp but since I'm pulling up I
can<00:02:11.780> go<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.350> B<00:02:12.470> flat<00:02:12.500> note<00:02:12.980> pull<00:02:13.250> up<00:02:13.840> F

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
can go to the B flat note pull up F

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.610 
can go to the B flat note pull up F
sharp<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:19.180> like<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.300> finish<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.600> out<00:02:20.870> by<00:02:21.470> going

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
sharp I like to finish it out by going

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.080 
sharp I like to finish it out by going
down<00:02:21.950> here<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> D<00:02:22.490> note<00:02:22.670> on<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.910> B<00:02:23.030> string

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
down here to the D note on the B string

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.360 
down here to the D note on the B string
pulling<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.930> up<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.320> e<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.950> really<00:02:28.220> cool

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
pulling it up to the e it's really cool

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.949 
pulling it up to the e it's really cool
about<00:02:28.550> right<00:02:28.790> there<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.540> play<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> D

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
about right there is you can play the D

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:40.960 
about right there is you can play the D
in<00:02:30.200> our<00:02:30.350> sharp<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.370> it's<00:02:40.489> basically<00:02:40.880> like

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
in our sharp so it's basically like

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:52.229 
in our sharp so it's basically like
going<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:50.690> all<00:02:50.870> together<00:02:50.959> now<00:02:51.350> I'm<00:02:51.620> going<00:02:51.950> to

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
going so all together now I'm going to

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.280 
going so all together now I'm going to
hear<00:02:54.430> 1568<00:02:55.430> teen<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.880> fret<00:02:56.150> going<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.959> 18th

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
hear 1568 teen to fret going to the 18th

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.860 
hear 1568 teen to fret going to the 18th
fret<00:02:57.620> which<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:57.860> actually<00:02:58.510> targeting<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.690> be

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
fret which is actually targeting this be

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.210 
fret which is actually targeting this be
known<00:03:00.080> but<00:03:00.410> it's<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.620> bit<00:03:00.769> pulling<00:03:01.400> up

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
known but it's a bit pulling up

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:21.800 
known but it's a bit pulling up
releasing<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.430> 14

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.100 

so<00:03:23.520> this<00:03:24.520> another<00:03:25.240> way<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.600> looking<00:03:25.720> at<00:03:25.990> this

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
so this another way of looking at this

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.460 
so this another way of looking at this
is<00:03:26.350> using<00:03:27.280> chord<00:03:27.550> shapes<00:03:27.910> so<00:03:28.750> basically<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.350> can

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
is using chord shapes so basically I can

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.860 
is using chord shapes so basically I can
fade<00:03:29.860> one<00:03:30.190> chord<00:03:30.550> into<00:03:30.850> another<00:03:31.210> kind<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:31.750> like

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
fade one chord into another kind of like

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.410 
fade one chord into another kind of like
a<00:03:31.900> steel<00:03:32.290> guitar<00:03:32.410> might<00:03:32.800> do<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.850> basically<00:03:34.060> I'm

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
a steel guitar might do so basically I'm

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.690 
a steel guitar might do so basically I'm
gonna<00:03:34.570> take<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.050> right<00:03:35.290> here<00:03:38.160> pull<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.190> up<00:03:39.430> so

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
gonna take this right here pull it up so

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.460 
gonna take this right here pull it up so
what<00:03:39.850> I'm<00:03:40.000> doing<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.360> way<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.510> think<00:03:40.750> about<00:03:41.140> it

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
what I'm doing the way I think about it

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.980 
what I'm doing the way I think about it
is<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.710> take<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.040> D<00:03:42.250> triad<00:03:42.610> are<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.660> familiar

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
is I take the D triad are you familiar

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.680 
is I take the D triad are you familiar
with<00:03:44.290> down<00:03:44.680> here<00:03:44.710> and<00:03:45.580> I'm<00:03:45.640> sliding<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.210> up<00:03:46.330> to

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
with down here and I'm sliding it up to

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.270 
with down here and I'm sliding it up to
the<00:03:47.140> two<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:48.550> if<00:03:48.820> I'm<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.120> G<00:03:49.360> that<00:03:49.810> will<00:03:49.960> be<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.280> if

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
the two so if I'm in G that will be a if

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.030 
the two so if I'm in G that will be a if
I'm<00:03:51.580> in<00:03:51.850> C<00:03:52.240> that<00:03:52.480> would<00:03:52.870> be<00:03:53.050> D<00:03:53.290> but<00:03:53.740> right<00:03:53.890> now

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
I'm in C that would be D but right now

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.790 
I'm in C that would be D but right now
we're<00:03:54.220> sticking<00:03:54.490> to<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.610> key<00:03:54.820> of<00:03:54.910> G<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.360> G<00:04:01.800> and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
we're sticking to the key of G a G and

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.310 
we're sticking to the key of G a G and
because<00:04:03.130> this<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.520> going<00:04:03.760> up<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:04.030> here<00:04:04.210> this<00:04:05.200> is

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
because this is going up to here this is

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.580 
because this is going up to here this is
going<00:04:05.560> up<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.890> this<00:04:06.850> is<00:04:07.000> going<00:04:07.210> up<00:04:07.270> to<00:04:07.420> you

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
going up to you this is going up to you

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:25.020 
going up to you this is going up to you
I'm<00:04:08.590> now<00:04:08.800> forming<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:09.430> try

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.750 

so<00:04:26.030> it's<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.180> cool<00:04:26.330> little<00:04:26.390> trick<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:26.870> fade

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
so it's a cool little trick to fade

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.620 
so it's a cool little trick to fade
chords<00:04:28.760> say<00:04:29.000> if<00:04:29.150> you're<00:04:29.270> playing<00:04:29.480> a

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
chords say if you're playing a

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:46.940 
chords say if you're playing a
progression<00:04:29.960> inside

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.420 

little<00:04:47.950> trick

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
little trick

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.670 
little trick
one<00:04:49.270> more<00:04:49.450> court<00:04:49.750> position<00:04:50.200> that<00:04:50.350> I<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.590> to

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
one more court position that I like to

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.580 
one more court position that I like to
think<00:04:50.920> of<00:04:51.100> is<00:04:51.690> basically<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.990> bottom<00:04:53.200> of<00:04:53.470> an

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
think of is basically the bottom of an

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.540 
think of is basically the bottom of an
a7<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.860> 2/3

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
a7 to 2/3

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.300 
a7 to 2/3
but<00:04:57.910> I'm<00:04:58.030> sliding<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.540> up<00:04:58.630> to<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.110> sharp<00:04:59.470> 1<00:04:59.740> flat

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
but I'm sliding it up to a sharp 1 flat

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.670 
but I'm sliding it up to a sharp 1 flat
2<00:05:00.550> basically<00:05:01.450> if<00:05:01.630> I'm<00:05:01.750> in<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:01.960> key<00:05:02.080> of<00:05:02.200> G<00:05:02.440> I

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
2 basically if I'm in the key of G I

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.800 
2 basically if I'm in the key of G I
want<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.190> slide<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.670> G<00:05:03.880> sharp<00:05:04.180> so<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.690> can

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
want to slide it to G sharp so I can

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.429 
want to slide it to G sharp so I can
either<00:05:04.900> do<00:05:05.110> it<00:05:05.140> down<00:05:05.320> here

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:09.439 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.869 

slide<00:05:10.439> it<00:05:10.590> up<00:05:10.680> here<00:05:10.919> to<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.400> starting<00:05:11.759> of<00:05:11.819> the

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
slide it up here to the starting of the

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:16.460 
slide it up here to the starting of the
13th<00:05:12.330> fret<00:05:14.479> that's<00:05:15.479> working<00:05:15.990> because<00:05:16.139> this

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
13th fret that's working because this

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:25.129 
13th fret that's working because this
nuts<00:05:16.740> going<00:05:19.430> forming<00:05:20.430> this

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.929 

that<00:05:25.830> one<00:05:25.979> gives<00:05:26.099> you<00:05:26.249> a<00:05:26.310> little<00:05:26.430> bit<00:05:26.610> more<00:05:26.819> of

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:26.939 
that one gives you a little bit more of

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.719 
that one gives you a little bit more of
a<00:05:27.030> Discordian<00:05:27.659> sound<00:05:27.930> but<00:05:28.770> basically<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.520> hope

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
a Discordian sound but basically I hope

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.890 
a Discordian sound but basically I hope
you<00:05:29.849> take<00:05:30.060> something<00:05:30.389> out<00:05:30.449> of<00:05:30.509> this<00:05:30.659> lesson

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
you take something out of this lesson

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.779 
you take something out of this lesson
basically<00:05:31.409> saying<00:05:31.650> there's<00:05:32.219> a<00:05:32.280> lot<00:05:32.460> you<00:05:32.490> can

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
basically saying there's a lot you can

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.029 
basically saying there's a lot you can
do<00:05:32.909> with<00:05:33.389> the<00:05:33.509> tremolo<00:05:33.719> arm<00:05:34.020> just<00:05:34.379> beside<00:05:34.740> your

do with the tremolo arm just beside your

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:45.649 
do with the tremolo arm just beside your
typical<00:05:35.270> shimmer<00:05:43.610> there's<00:05:44.610> a<00:05:44.729> lot<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:45.360> can<00:05:45.479> do

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
the method that I linked to to where

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:10.459 
the method that I linked to to where
you're<00:06:02.819> using<00:06:03.270> intervals<00:06:09.080> if<00:06:10.080> you<00:06:10.169> think

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:10.469 
you're using intervals if you think

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.170 
you're using intervals if you think
about<00:06:10.650> it<00:06:11.009> you<00:06:11.189> got<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:11.490> think<00:06:11.669> about<00:06:11.849> it<00:06:12.120> a

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
about it you got to think about it a

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.519 
about it you got to think about it a
little<00:06:12.330> different<00:06:12.750> you<00:06:12.810> got<00:06:12.960> to<00:06:13.080> approach<00:06:13.289> the

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
little different you got to approach the

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.879 
little different you got to approach the

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
guitar differently you got a chord start

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.129 
guitar differently you got a chord start
with<00:06:17.129> and<00:06:17.370> then<00:06:17.520> go<00:06:17.879> to<00:06:17.939> you<00:06:18.120> go<00:06:18.870> to<00:06:18.900> your

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
with and then go to you go to your

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
target pull it up to you tie yourself

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:40.999 
target pull it up to you tie yourself
this<00:06:21.029> is<00:06:39.139> there's<00:06:40.139> a<00:06:40.229> whole<00:06:40.409> world<00:06:40.740> of

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
this is there's a whole world of

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.980 
this is there's a whole world of
possibilities<00:06:41.759> there<00:06:41.789> I<00:06:42.240> know<00:06:42.479> this<00:06:42.689> isn't

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
possibilities there I know this isn't

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.499 
possibilities there I know this isn't
the<00:06:43.020> greatest<00:06:43.520> lesson<00:06:44.520> but<00:06:45.029> hopefully<00:06:45.300> it<00:06:45.389> can

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
the greatest lesson but hopefully it can

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.959 
the greatest lesson but hopefully it can
just<00:06:45.719> open<00:06:45.870> your<00:06:46.050> mind<00:06:46.259> to<00:06:46.669> no<00:06:47.669> one<00:06:47.819> there's

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:52.399 
just open your mind to no one there's
more<00:06:48.060> you<00:06:48.479> can<00:06:48.659> do<00:06:48.779> with<00:06:48.960> this<00:06:49.139> so<00:06:49.860> enjoy
