00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
alright guys Richard from the RC network

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.850 
alright guys Richard from the RC network
and<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> quick<00:00:10.590> little

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
and this is going to be a quick little

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.830 
and this is going to be a quick little
unboxing<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.759> some<00:00:12.090> new<00:00:12.240> batteries<00:00:12.690> I

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
unboxing of some new batteries I

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.880 
unboxing of some new batteries I
received<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.440> yesterday<00:00:13.980> these<00:00:14.580> are<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.179> SMC

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
received in yesterday these are the SMC

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.599 
received in yesterday these are the SMC
lipo<00:00:16.890> batteries<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:18.439> got<00:00:19.439> these<00:00:19.590> end<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.279> my

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
lipo batteries I got these end for my

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.570 
lipo batteries I got these end for my
team<00:00:21.150> associated<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:22.289> forty<00:00:22.769> four<00:00:22.980> point<00:00:23.250> two

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
team associated be forty four point two

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.029 
team associated be forty four point two
now<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.300> difference<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> b44<00:00:25.529> two<00:00:25.769> is

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
now the difference on the b44 two is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.779 
now the difference on the b44 two is
that<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.820> uses<00:00:27.180> saddle<00:00:27.960> pack<00:00:28.800> batteries<00:00:29.609> or

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that it uses saddle pack batteries or

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.440 
that it uses saddle pack batteries or
saddle<00:00:30.689> lipo's<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.219> basically<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
saddle lipo's and and basically the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.720 
saddle lipo's and and basically the
difference<00:00:33.840> between<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.590> standard<00:00:35.160> lipo<00:00:35.489> like

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
difference between a standard lipo like

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.150 
difference between a standard lipo like
something<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.160> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
something like this right here is the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.490 
something like this right here is the
saddle<00:00:38.700> packs<00:00:38.940> split<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.809> basically<00:00:40.290> in

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
saddle packs split it up basically in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.880 
saddle packs split it up basically in
half<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.700> places<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.870> two<00:00:43.050> lipo's<00:00:43.710> on

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
half and it places the two lipo's on

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.549 
half and it places the two lipo's on
either<00:00:44.190> side<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.239> drive<00:00:45.450> line<00:00:45.719> giving

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
either side of the drive line giving

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.479 
either side of the drive line giving
basically<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> better<00:00:48.050> balance<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> car<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
basically a better balance to the car so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.450 
basically a better balance to the car so
I<00:00:50.879> haven't<00:00:51.780> personally<00:00:52.289> had<00:00:52.800> any<00:00:53.100> saddle

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
I haven't personally had any saddle

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.720 
I haven't personally had any saddle
packed<00:00:53.820> cars<00:00:54.270> before<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.320> now<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.100> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
packed cars before but now I do and I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.580 
packed cars before but now I do and I
went<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> these<00:00:57.270> guys<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.870> pick<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.469> of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
went to these guys to pick up some of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.310 
went to these guys to pick up some of
their<00:00:58.680> lipos<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.629> let's<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.870> unbox<00:01:01.170> this

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
their lipos so let's go and unbox this

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.750 
their lipos so let's go and unbox this
thing<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:01.710> show<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.340> inside

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
thing will show you what you get inside

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.899 
thing will show you what you get inside
the<00:01:02.940> box<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.660> we'll<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.229> from<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.589> so

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
the box and we'll go from there so

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.330 
the box and we'll go from there so
pretty<00:01:05.909> much<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.270> white<00:01:06.510> box<00:01:06.750> no<00:01:07.530> markings<00:01:07.979> at

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
pretty much a white box no markings at

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.850 
pretty much a white box no markings at
all<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:10.610> your<00:01:11.610> your<00:01:11.850> typical<00:01:12.260> battery<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
all on it your your typical battery or a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.450 
all on it your your typical battery or a
lipo<00:01:14.250> box<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:16.130> inside<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> looks

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
lipo box that you get in inside it looks

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.630 
lipo box that you get in inside it looks
like<00:01:17.549> there's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> label<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.240> top<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:19.640> 3.87

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
like there's a label on top here 3.87

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.090 
like there's a label on top here 3.87
and<00:01:20.880> 3.87<00:01:21.810> looks<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.350> check<00:01:22.680> these

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and 3.87 looks like they check these

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.940 
and 3.87 looks like they check these
cells<00:01:23.460> before<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:23.939> shipped<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> out<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
cells before they shipped it out and the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.649 
cells before they shipped it out and the
date<00:01:26.189> they're<00:01:26.369> five<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.909> thirteen<00:01:27.270> not<00:01:27.450> sure

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
date they're five to thirteen not sure

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.550 
date they're five to thirteen not sure
if<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:27.930> check<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.799> cells<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.340> five<00:01:29.549> two<00:01:29.850> or

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
if they check the cells on five two or

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
if they check the cells on five two or
that's<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.860> got<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.880> know

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that's when they got it in I don't know

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.550 
that's when they got it in I don't know
hopefully<00:01:33.960> when<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.200> shipped<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.470> out

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
hopefully when they shipped it out

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.649 
hopefully when they shipped it out
that'd<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:35.040> cool<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.119> check<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.479> right

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that'd be cool that they check it right

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.410 
that'd be cool that they check it right
before<00:01:36.810> they<00:01:37.079> send<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.970> let's<00:01:39.299> look

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
before they send it out and let's look

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.319 
before they send it out and let's look
at<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> lipos<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.909> once<00:01:41.909> again<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> comes

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
at the lipos here once again it comes

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.340 
at the lipos here once again it comes
with<00:01:42.540> two<00:01:42.720> lipos<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.380> makes<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:45.350> 17.4

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
with two lipos that makes up the 17.4

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.050 
with two lipos that makes up the 17.4
volt<00:01:46.860> lipo<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:48.180> car<00:01:48.950> 5600<00:01:49.950> milliamp<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
volt lipo for my car 5600 milliamp and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
volt lipo for my car 5600 milliamp and
it<00:01:51.360> looks<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.840> 70<00:01:52.320> C<00:01:52.530> constant<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it looks like it's a 70 C constant and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.920 
it looks like it's a 70 C constant and
140<00:01:54.060> C<00:01:54.299> burst<00:01:54.659> which<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> huge<00:01:56.670> spec<00:01:57.570> for

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
140 C burst which is a huge spec for

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.280 
140 C burst which is a huge spec for
such<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> small<00:01:59.100> little<00:01:59.159> battery<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.850> this

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
such a small little battery like this

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.420 
such a small little battery like this
has<00:02:01.290> some<00:02:01.500> other<00:02:01.820> constants<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:04.430> have

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
has some other constants up there I have

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.560 
has some other constants up there I have
the<00:02:05.549> part<00:02:05.790> number<00:02:06.030> right<00:02:06.180> there<00:02:06.210> hopefully

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the part number right there hopefully

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.109 
the part number right there hopefully
you<00:02:06.750> guys<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.860> will<00:02:08.550> put<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.789> link

so<00:02:29.670> all<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:30.120> these<00:02:30.630> two<00:02:30.870> batteries

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
so all in all these two batteries

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.610 
so all in all these two batteries
together<00:02:32.340> are<00:02:33.150> about<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.870> same<00:02:34.050> size<00:02:34.110> as<00:02:34.590> a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
together are about the same size as a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.070 
together are about the same size as a
normal<00:02:35.190> white<00:02:36.120> bone<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.480> happen<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.900> one

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
normal white bone I happen to have one

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.200 
normal white bone I happen to have one
here<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:37.950> check<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.030> look

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
here that we can check out if you look

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.790 
here that we can check out if you look
at<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.390> two<00:02:42.570> right<00:02:42.780> they're<00:02:42.960> about<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.620> same

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
at the two right they're about the same

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.990 
at the two right they're about the same
size<00:02:43.860> almost<00:02:44.850> identically<00:02:45.800> as<00:02:46.800> far<00:02:47.160> as<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
size almost identically as far as the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.790 
size almost identically as far as the
height<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.930> battery<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.290> happen<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.680> have

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
height of the battery I happen to have

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.050 
height of the battery I happen to have
my<00:02:49.860> calipers<00:02:50.580> here<00:02:50.880> let's<00:02:51.810> check<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.200> out

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.120 

and<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.300> looks<00:02:57.540> like<00:02:57.870> right<00:02:58.380> about<00:02:58.620> twenty

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
and it looks like right about twenty

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.370 
and it looks like right about twenty
four<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.700> half<00:03:00.890> millimeters<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:04.230> if

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
four and a half millimeters so just if

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.170 
four and a half millimeters so just if
you're<00:03:04.500> doing<00:03:04.709> some<00:03:04.890> planning<00:03:05.160> for<00:03:05.520> your<00:03:05.610> car

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.660 
you're doing some planning for your car
I<00:03:06.209> know<00:03:06.570> on<00:03:07.050> mine<00:03:07.590> I've<00:03:07.830> already<00:03:08.070> kind<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.340> test

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
I know on mine I've already kind of test

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.050 
I know on mine I've already kind of test
fitted<00:03:09.060> these<00:03:09.240> I<00:03:09.540> know<00:03:09.870> without<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.530> guys<00:03:10.680> and

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
fitted these I know without you guys and

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.080 
fitted these I know without you guys and
it<00:03:12.060> ended<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:13.160> had<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.280> move<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.550> strap<00:03:14.880> up

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
it ended up I had to move the strap up

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.610 
it ended up I had to move the strap up
just<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.390> little<00:03:15.690> bit<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.990> get<00:03:16.080> these<00:03:16.230> things<00:03:16.410> to

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
just a little bit to get these things to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.100 
just a little bit to get these things to
fit<00:03:16.800> in<00:03:16.920> perfectly<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.330> there's<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.959> two<00:03:19.080> I

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
fit in perfectly so there's the two I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.390 
fit in perfectly so there's the two I
posed<00:03:19.440> let's<00:03:19.680> see<00:03:19.769> what<00:03:19.890> else<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.070> get<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.340> the

far<00:03:51.480> as<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.840> way<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:51.989> want<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.880> run<00:03:53.880> them

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
far as the way you want to run them

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.030 
far as the way you want to run them
there<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:57.140> connector<00:03:58.140> wire<00:03:58.320> they<00:03:58.590> basically

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
there is a connector wire they basically

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.630 
there is a connector wire they basically
goes<00:03:59.430> on<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.390> two<00:04:00.600> Center<00:04:01.019> ones<00:04:01.049> right<00:04:01.380> here

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
goes on the two Center ones right here

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.120 
goes on the two Center ones right here
it<00:04:02.640> does<00:04:02.880> have<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.360> balance<00:04:03.959> port<00:04:04.320> for<00:04:04.860> the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
it does have a balance port for the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.780 
it does have a balance port for the
little<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:06.120> believe<00:04:06.780> two<00:04:07.080> millimeter<00:04:07.790> little

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
little I believe two millimeter little

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.090 
little I believe two millimeter little
balance<00:04:09.150> plug<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:10.320> then<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.560> outer<00:04:10.739> ones

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
balance plug and then the outer ones

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.310 
balance plug and then the outer ones
would<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.519> go<00:04:11.670> on<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.209> outer<00:04:12.420> configuration

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
would just go on the outer configuration

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.370 
would just go on the outer configuration
right<00:04:13.500> here<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.299> then<00:04:15.299> obviously<00:04:15.660> up<00:04:16.140> tier

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
to my battery so I probably won't be

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.779 
to my battery so I probably won't be
running<00:04:24.510> these<00:04:24.840> but<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.590> will<00:04:25.800> use<00:04:26.010> these<00:04:26.280> for

safety warnings on lipo batteries which

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.750 
safety warnings on lipo batteries which
is<00:04:37.120> definitely<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.900> nice<00:04:38.710> item<00:04:39.010> considering<00:04:39.669> a

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
breathing body watching over it so looks

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.580 
breathing body watching over it so looks
like<00:04:56.440> it's<00:04:56.620> two<00:04:57.490> big<00:04:57.699> pages<00:04:58.000> soft<00:04:58.750> cases<00:04:59.050> goes
