00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 now I bring you how to make salts 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.349
 aromatic we can make grain salt or 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.299
 be aromatic salts of this type of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.210
 forms or salts of this type that already 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.730
 they are as more processed as more the two 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.189
 forms are very easy 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.359
 I'll show you this is done with 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.390
 grain salt and this makes more forgiveness this 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.510
 It is made with normal salt 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.660
 but we can use this same salt of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.660
 grain and liquefy we can put it in the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.489
 blender liquefy the and remains the same 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.399
 so I 'm going to show you the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.680
 procedure with grain salt what 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.680
 we need is a container 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.810
 with lid can be a jar 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.310
 anything preferably glass 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.070
 we are going to occupy 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.670
 sales are going to be very little 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.909
 they are happy but if it works 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.409
 artificial food 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.719
 and oils of any type of oils 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.509
 I in my case will use several types of 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:21.219
 oil between more oils put is a lot 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:24.039
 better the consistency is better and gives 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:28.000
 better smells we can also use 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.729
 flowers or leaves to give them a more 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.250
 natural but in my case I use more oils 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.009
 and then he taught them how to make oils 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.500
 homemade so that they fit better in the 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.460
 container I will empty what I have left 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.729
 of salt that is very little 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.180
 but if what they want to do for example 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.090
 to make a room 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.760
 that this is more or less a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.270
 fourth I occupy 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.580
 12 drops of artificial coloring 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.410
 we start with artificial coloring 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.540
 let me remove some fish so that 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:11.790
 see better 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:14.969
 what I do is I put 1 2 3 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.209
 or preferably always put in 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:20.010
 less are we calculating if what 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.270
 they want is to have a consistency 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.010
 stronger 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.530
 what we are going to do now is 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.330
 stirring is stirred then well of 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.030
 simple the procedure is very easy 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.040
 very cheap and very fast or not 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.530
 it costs nothing and in fact you can even 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.190
 sell in fact I sell then 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.820
 want is an incredible taste 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.820
 we open it and realize it changes the 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.580
 color if we wanted it more intense more 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.160
 strong then we put more dye to 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.960
 I like it like that so I 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:04.100
 regular so I leave it after that and what 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.560
 next would be to put oils on him 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.180
 I put several types of oil right now 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.390
 I'm going to put what I have normally 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.160
 I put more this castor oil and 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:20.060
 I put three drops I'm going to put oil 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.950
 almonds that I love because it serves 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.390
 for many things here I put 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.750
 I put more like six droplets 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.950
 I put him 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.950
 more oils 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.830
 This is a homemade oil of mine 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.170
 that this base of flowers and herbs and 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.990
 it has a particular fear smell very 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.750
 nice to me I like after good 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.770
 then I tell them how to do it and apart 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.620
 the consistency is very very good and for 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.959
 latest 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.830
 this one that has a chewing gum smell when making 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:02.250
 the mixture and the smell of 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:06.490
 me but good what we do now is the 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.430
 same procedure we revolve everything 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.319
 well in the same way we did with the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.260
 Colorant 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.680
 we open it well if they realize it has not 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.680
 taken a lot 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.860
 and the smell is already in fact 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:29.740
 the smell is perceived and very good 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:33.229
 and now what follows is in a container 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.990
 we put it we extend it because 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.249
 it is already but what they do is put it in 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.909
 a container extending the 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:45.129
 Do not hit the sun and leave it 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:47.019
 stand for a few hours from 6 to 8 hours 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.559
 the same depending on your climate if your 

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:55.599
 climate is quite strong or there is quite 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:57.939
 air then with about 24 hours and already 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.579
 from there they take it out and they put it in a 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:03.039
 container they cover it very well and so 

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:06.459
 we have the salts either of the two 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.259
 sales see how easy is good happens to them and 

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:09.519
 there if you like them later I teach them to 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.860
 do more things 

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:13.269
 and you know if they like it because they put a 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.089
 like and if not then keep leaving 

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:18.089
 comments and thank you that's all
