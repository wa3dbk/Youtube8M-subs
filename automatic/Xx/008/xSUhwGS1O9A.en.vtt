00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.670
 dear friends and fellow referees of all sections 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.650
 we are all at the end of the year 2010 one year 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.619
 that everyone involved has seen it 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.449
 snow give our association great enthusiasm and vitality 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.189
 association that is always becoming 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.819
 larger also numerically 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:27.769
 and I think we can draw a balance of this first glimpse of old hey 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:28.849
 season 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.729
 which concerns the management of the championships 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.469
 ranging from professional championships to amateur championships 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:36.910
 basic stitchery 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.770
 our referees on Thursday certainly reached the big names 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.710
 technical results they are 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.960
 I indeed appreciate for the contribution 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.080
 of great level that have given to their directions to the service of the game of 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.310
 football, that is you, fans take all the basic clothes they are 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.100
 they were just as good 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.260
 in following in the footsteps of trying to learn from them 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.580
 better teachings to make their growth more and more 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.170
 fast and complete 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.480
 I believe to interpret 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.580
 the thought of the whole national committee 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.630
 if today I want to thank you all for what you have done 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.350
 That's what you're going to do 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.120
 but in a particular way 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.670
 I want to thank all the leaders of the laughing national leaders 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.780
 senior executives 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.070
 peripheral 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.170
 which 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.500
 are bringing more and more enthusiasm to our young people 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.820
 they are getting protected from any kind of danger 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.210
 I believe that the time has come for all of us 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.140
 d also dedicate a few days of relaxation and rest 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.680
 you see our families thank all our women 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.080
 my mother's girlfriends wives 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.680
 that have always supported fish in corason an exhibition 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.589
 but passionate activity 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.610
 I hope that the year that is about to begin 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.109
 the new year resumes from these positivity that have emerged 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.889
 in this first part of the championship in the last year we spent 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:30.670
 together we will prepare x immediately to celebrate a two thousand eleven 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:32.849
 who will still see us as protagonists 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.569
 where we will also have to 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.869
 and we will have the honor of celebrating the 100th anniversary of our association 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.140
 to continue to reap results that have been 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.249
 let's say 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:45.669
 inpdap and it was reached until today 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.250
 a heartfelt thanks to all and to hear from you again 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.509
 for when the activity will start 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.179
 for the same commitment 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:59.799
 which distinguishes us all and key shifts united in a single objective 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.290
 that of protecting our young people more and more 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.239
 this affection and this consideration deserve this protection 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.909
 on the outskirts I simply say bigger thanks because they are the ones who 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.970
 in the shadow I work more that create the conditions for someone tomorrow 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.309
 can 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:28.609
 we say bring high is always the name of our association in 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.139
