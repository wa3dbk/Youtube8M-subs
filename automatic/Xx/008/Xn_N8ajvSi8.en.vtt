00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.220
 mark the blade for this 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.849
 here here with the help of scotch stencil 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.610
 fortified here connected plus well 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.960
 principle doesn't matter plus or minus 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.490
 I will connect that is, one cream 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 the price of the blade on the 2nd terminal 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:37.940
 there is a cotton wool dipped in electrolyte 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:37.940
 turn on the device and start marking 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.890
 You see, you fixed it openly 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.079
 nine stencil why 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.720
 it's us now and it is direct current 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.230
 He is eating, that is, with the help of 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.150
 electro-corrosion makes indentation in 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.520
 metal 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.150
 now if we so rest it will 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:30.590
 just deepen well we need it yet 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:36.619
 why do we translate to variable 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:39.890
 current to alternating current and using 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.790
 AC it turns out leaves 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.950
 no rope here is blackened 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.950
 scientifically obscures in other words 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:01.320
 that should be enough the same thing 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.560
 on the other hand here we are putting 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.280
 inscription 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.280
 ats-34 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.440
 same thing first with direct current 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:33.660
 to make a hollow in the metal 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.660
 then alternating current to compose 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.660
 or 3000 climb for direct current on 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.660
 alternating current turning 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.200
 that's what happened as a result of it 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.200
 ats-34 on the one hand and 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:32.060
 such a logo 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:36.110
 in the other side there could have been more 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.370
 work with alternating current in order 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:44.079
 so black came out here I am this side 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.079
 better seen but more contracted
