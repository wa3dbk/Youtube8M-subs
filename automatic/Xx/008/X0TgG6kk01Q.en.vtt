00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
like it a lot I like it a lot more than
the<00:00:55.050> bloom<00:00:55.260> there's<00:00:55.649> those<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.219> say<00:00:56.550> that

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the bloom there's those that say that

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.900 
the bloom there's those that say that
they<00:00:57.510> actually<00:00:57.539> don't<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.500> much<00:00:58.910> but

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

they actually don't like it as much but
I<00:00:59.940> completely<00:01:00.329> argue<00:01:00.660> against<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
I completely argue against it this is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.549 
I completely argue against it this is
more<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:02.190> Halo<00:01:02.609> 3<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> previous<00:01:04.049> halos

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
more like Halo 3 like the previous halos

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
more like Halo 3 like the previous halos
and<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> way<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> game<00:01:05.850> should<00:01:06.060> be

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and that's the way the game should be

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
and that's the way the game should be
I<00:01:06.420> know<00:01:06.540> 343<00:01:07.260> has<00:01:07.350> already<00:01:07.560> said<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.890> they're

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I know 343 has already said that they're

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.740 
I know 343 has already said that they're
not<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.430> put<00:01:08.580> bloom<00:01:08.880> into<00:01:09.090> Halo<00:01:09.330> 4<00:01:09.600> or

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

run<00:04:45.780> across<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.320> whole<00:04:46.500> map<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:46.800> get<00:04:47.070> away

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
run across the whole map and get away

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.950 
run across the whole map and get away
from<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.970> you'll<00:04:48.539> go<00:04:48.690> through<00:04:48.720> this

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
from you and you'll go through this

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.360 
from you and you'll go through this
routine<00:04:49.169> three<00:04:49.560> or<00:04:49.620> four<00:04:49.860> times<00:04:50.039> sometimes

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
routine three or four times sometimes

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.920 
routine three or four times sometimes
with<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.760> same<00:04:51.000> guy<00:04:51.270> where<00:04:51.479> you<00:04:51.539> drop<00:04:51.780> his

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
with the same guy where you drop his

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.200 
with the same guy where you drop his
shield<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.380> win<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.830> battle<00:04:53.070> three<00:04:53.880> times

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
shield you win that battle three times

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.940 
shield you win that battle three times
but<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.600> guy<00:04:54.750> couldn't<00:04:55.020> run<00:04:55.289> away<00:04:55.530> from<00:04:55.590> you

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
but the guy couldn't run away from you

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.250 
but the guy couldn't run away from you
and<00:04:56.610> then<00:04:56.789> one<00:04:57.000> time<00:04:57.210> he<00:04:57.539> happens<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.110> catch

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
and then one time he happens to catch

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.840 
and then one time he happens to catch
you<00:04:58.410> off<00:04:58.560> guard<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:59.010> finish<00:04:59.280> you<00:04:59.430> off<00:04:59.580> it's

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
you off guard and finish you off it's

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.000 
you off guard and finish you off it's
like<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.060> know<00:05:00.150> what<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.450> beat<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.350> four<00:05:01.710> times

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
like you know what I beat you four times

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.340 
like you know what I beat you four times
in<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.280> row<00:05:02.310> but<00:05:02.789> because<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.419> this<00:05:03.900> some<00:05:04.169> of<00:05:04.200> the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
in a row but because of this some of the

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.719 
in a row but because of this some of the
mechanics<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:04.860> have<00:05:04.950> come<00:05:05.220> into<00:05:05.370> Halo<00:05:05.610> Reach

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
mechanics that have come into Halo Reach

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.029 
mechanics that have come into Halo Reach
with<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.090> Sprint<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.960> armor<00:05:07.470> lock<00:05:07.650> and

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
with the Sprint and the armor lock and

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.850 
with the Sprint and the armor lock and
all<00:05:08.190> these<00:05:08.310> getaway<00:05:08.880> weapons<00:05:09.650> you've<00:05:10.650> been

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
all these getaway weapons you've been

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.110 
all these getaway weapons you've been
able<00:05:10.979> to<00:05:11.280> get<00:05:11.400> away<00:05:11.490> from<00:05:11.639> me<00:05:11.880> in<00:05:12.030> the

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
able to get away from me in the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.550 
able to get away from me in the
inaccuracy<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.020> bloom<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:13.500> the

inaccuracy of the bloom and the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.200 
inaccuracy of the bloom and the
randomization<00:05:14.280> of<00:05:14.370> shots<00:05:14.610> because<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.120> the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
randomization of shots because of the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.090 
randomization of shots because of the
bloom<00:05:15.419> but<00:05:15.870> now<00:05:16.080> that<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.740> games<00:05:16.889> a<00:05:16.979> lot

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
bloom but now that the games a lot

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.550 
bloom but now that the games a lot
faster<00:05:17.580> pays<00:05:17.850> you<00:05:18.120> every<00:05:18.570> single<00:05:19.169> freaking

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
faster pays you every single freaking

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.230 
faster pays you every single freaking
bolt<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:19.950> comes<00:05:20.130> out<00:05:20.280> of<00:05:20.370> my<00:05:20.460> gun<00:05:20.639> if<00:05:20.850> I'm<00:05:21.210> a

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
bolt that comes out of my gun if I'm a

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.909 
bolt that comes out of my gun if I'm a
good<00:05:21.450> enough<00:05:21.570> player<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.229> I'm<00:05:22.350> able<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.650> make

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
good enough player and I'm able to make

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.760 
good enough player and I'm able to make
that<00:05:23.160> perfect<00:05:23.580> five<00:05:23.820> shot<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.419> now<00:05:24.750> most<00:05:25.650> of

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
that perfect five shot and now most of

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.640 
that perfect five shot and now most of
the<00:05:25.830> times<00:05:26.010> six<00:05:26.310> shot<00:05:26.520> even

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
the times six shot even

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.530 
the times six shot even
you<00:05:28.130> know<00:05:28.220> right<00:05:28.430> actually<00:05:28.699> it's<00:05:29.000> not<00:05:29.060> six<00:05:29.330> I

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
you know right actually it's not six I

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.900 
you know right actually it's not six I
miss<00:05:29.840> a<00:05:29.870> shot<00:05:30.169> so<00:05:30.650> it<00:05:30.710> takes<00:05:30.889> me<00:05:31.009> six<00:05:31.490> shots<00:05:31.759> to

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
miss a shot so it takes me six shots to

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.570 
miss a shot so it takes me six shots to
kill<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.210> person<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:33.800> doesn't<00:05:34.040> matter<00:05:34.340> the

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
kill the person it doesn't matter the

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.900 
kill the person it doesn't matter the
game<00:05:35.120> pace<00:05:35.509> is<00:05:35.810> that<00:05:35.990> if<00:05:36.169> you<00:05:36.470> get<00:05:37.250> into<00:05:37.490> a<00:05:37.520> 1v1

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
game pace is that if you get into a 1v1

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.999 
game pace is that if you get into a 1v1
battle<00:05:38.449> with<00:05:38.539> me<00:05:38.720> it's<00:05:39.289> gonna<00:05:39.500> be<00:05:39.650> determined

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
battle with me it's gonna be determined

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.100 
battle with me it's gonna be determined
at<00:05:40.340> that<00:05:40.550> point<00:05:40.910> who's<00:05:41.180> gonna<00:05:41.419> live<00:05:41.690> it's<00:05:41.930> not

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
at that point who's gonna live it's not

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.379 
at that point who's gonna live it's not
going<00:05:42.259> to<00:05:42.320> be<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.830> dropped<00:05:43.550> your<00:05:43.729> shield<00:05:44.000> you

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
going to be I dropped your shield you

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.939 
going to be I dropped your shield you
run<00:05:44.630> away<00:05:44.780> and<00:05:45.229> then<00:05:45.410> we<00:05:45.500> go<00:05:45.650> through<00:05:45.860> this

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
run away and then we go through this

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.770 
run away and then we go through this
whole<00:05:46.130> routine<00:05:46.310> three<00:05:46.729> or<00:05:46.820> four<00:05:46.970> times<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.600> so

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
whole routine three or four times and so

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.290 
whole routine three or four times and so
that's<00:05:48.139> what<00:05:48.500> I<00:05:48.680> want<00:05:49.039> from<00:05:49.220> Halo<00:05:49.520> that<00:05:49.789> was<00:05:50.060> in

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
that's what I want from Halo that was in

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.680 
that's what I want from Halo that was in
Halo<00:05:50.570> 3<00:05:50.930> it's<00:05:51.350> all<00:05:51.500> about<00:05:51.680> these<00:05:51.860> strafing<00:05:52.690> 1v1

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
Halo 3 it's all about these strafing 1v1

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.020 
Halo 3 it's all about these strafing 1v1
battles<00:05:54.440> right<00:05:54.770> where<00:05:55.009> it's<00:05:55.130> like<00:05:55.280> one<00:05:55.610> person

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
battles right where it's like one person

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.060 
battles right where it's like one person
versus<00:05:56.419> another<00:05:56.660> person<00:05:57.169> in<00:05:57.289> this<00:05:57.650> game<00:05:57.919> it

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
versus another person in this game it

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.279 
versus another person in this game it
comes<00:05:58.220> in<00:05:58.460> two<00:05:58.580> it's<00:05:58.940> become<00:05:59.330> like<00:05:59.479> this<00:05:59.690> I<00:05:59.840> win
