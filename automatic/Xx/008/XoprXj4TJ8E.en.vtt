00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.690
 well this video will be unboxing and 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.740
 first view of a couple of watches the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.740
 brand tokyo flash 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.320
 and here is the box with the watches that 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.059
 the tokyo flash company sent me the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.279
 packaging is very simple but at the same time 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.439
 It has style and I know that this is not very 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.119
 relevant to the video but from my 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.279
 point of view packing everything 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.130
 product always lets us know a lot 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.470
 about it now I will start to open 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 this box and for this obviously it is 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.090
 necessary the pirate saber 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.850
 and apparently this will be a triple on 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.770
 boxing then inside this box 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.690
 we have two more boxes 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.030
 and here we have the two boxes of the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.970
 watches and I'll start by opening that of the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.239
 right it should be noted that these watches 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.730
 they come very well protected here is the 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.340
 First watch box the style is very 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.520
 elegant and on one side we can read the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.770
 phrase change the we think about time what 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.830
 which in Spanish means change your 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.750
 thinking about time off 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.020
 this is not much more to see in the box 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.510
 so let's go open the brand of 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.250
 these watches is tokyo flash but at 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.790
 it seems the company maybe there too 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.080
 is involved in these devices 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.810
 inside the box the first thing that we 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.130
 we found is this little manual the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.800
 which will help us understand the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.170
 clock operation and believe me that 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.240
 This manual will be very important as 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.990
 all these watches do not operate in a manner 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.840
 traditional 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.250
 later they will understand this better than 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.800
 he mentions them 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 now we remove this little piece of the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.410
 foam and here we have the first clock the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.770
 First impression looks amazing and from 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.930
 great quality this watch is the sea model 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.260
 or which is available in 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.910
 three colors silver black and the one 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.300
 they are seeing on screen what is this 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.369
 species of chocolate or brown color to 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.680
 simple view it might seem that the clock 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.520
 It weighs a lot but it's really very 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.890
 lightweight the finish is impressive of 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.470
 truth the watch looks great 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.150
 and surely they will be asking about 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.610
 there are no numbers or hands in the 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.300
 screen this is because with these 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.530
 watches the time will be otherwise 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.780
 honestly I do not know how they operate 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.880
 at this time but when you perform the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.410
 complete review of these watches without 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.750
 I will certainly show you in detail 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.120
 to finish with this clock and move to 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.100
 next I just want to highlight again 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.520
 the quality in every aspect of this 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.890
 device the design is unique the color 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.750
 I find it very elegant and original and the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.730
 construction quality can be felt 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.310
 from the moment you load it on your 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.459
 hand 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.110
 now let's go with the other box of equal 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.660
 it forms the first thing with what we come across 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.360
 is a small manual on how to use the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.849
 watch so I'll put it aside for 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.180
 then remove this or the foam and here 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.250
 is the device in this box apart 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.260
 of the clock we found this little 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.260
 screwdriver that I guess will be to adjust 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.530
 the strap and there's also this cable that 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.180
 will surely be to charge the clock to 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.160
 same as with the previous model 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.130
 this watch at first sight looks 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.319
 amazing just watch the color 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.480
 black and the design this may vary 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.910
 according to tastes but from my point of 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.140
 seen the designs of these watches are 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.730
 excellent this model is the rpm which 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.190
 we can find it in different 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.640
 physical colors and also with different 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.739
 colors of light this watch is heavier 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.620
 that the model maro but continues to be 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.630
 a very comfortable weight for a watch and in 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.700
 how much quality of truth am I 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.040
 impressed these watches are 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.709
 physically very beautiful and their designs 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.750
 they seem unique to me I hope the camera 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.880
 can capture 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.550
 incredibly elegant and original 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.860
 that these watches are undoubtedly 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.720
 Tokyoflash deserves a round of applause 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.260
 quality of construction and design in 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.260
 These devices 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.060
 the price of the maru watch that is the 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:17.169
 chocolate color is 149 dollars and the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.060
 rpm model costs 199 dollars 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.459
 they seem very fair prices for the 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.470
 quality of these watches and in case of 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.570
 who want one or see more models of 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.240

 found in the description as already 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.960
 I mentioned before I have no idea how 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.270
 the time is read in each of these 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.490
 models but it will surely be very 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.889
 simple so I'll start reading the 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.860
 manuals of use and very soon I will bring you
