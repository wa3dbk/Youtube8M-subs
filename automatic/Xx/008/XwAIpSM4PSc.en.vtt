00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.090 
there's been no change the doctor says
it<00:04:20.209> takes<00:04:20.480> six<00:04:20.780> months<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.230> year<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.739> mean<00:04:21.980> I'm

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
it takes six months to a year I mean I'm

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.100 
it takes six months to a year I mean I'm
at<00:04:22.310> five<00:04:22.610> months<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.180> it's<00:04:23.330> pretty<00:04:23.600> prominent

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
at five months and it's pretty prominent

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.190 
at five months and it's pretty prominent
so<00:04:24.920> it's<00:04:25.280> probably<00:04:25.700> gonna<00:04:25.880> take<00:04:25.970> me<00:04:26.200> another

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
so it's probably gonna take me another

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.590 
so it's probably gonna take me another
five<00:04:27.560> months<00:04:27.980> or<00:04:28.130> six<00:04:28.370> seven<00:04:28.580> months<00:04:28.850> to

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
five months or six seven months to

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.930 
five months or six seven months to
completely<00:04:29.960> go<00:04:30.230> away<00:04:30.440> if<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:30.950> does<00:04:31.130> which<00:04:31.550> I'm

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
completely go away if it does which I'm

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.900 
completely go away if it does which I'm
hoping<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:32.840> does<00:04:33.140> but<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:35.950> that<00:04:36.950> at<00:04:37.370> this

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
hoping it it does but it that at this

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.180 
hoping it it does but it that at this
point<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.570> for<00:04:39.290> me<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.500> don't<00:04:39.800> know<00:04:40.010> if<00:04:40.130> it

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
point and for me I don't know if it

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.680 
point and for me I don't know if it
would<00:04:40.250> be<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.490> same<00:04:40.700> case<00:04:40.880> for<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.270> but<00:04:41.510> I

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
would be the same case for you but I

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.930 
would be the same case for you but I
used<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.140> have<00:04:42.200> straight<00:04:42.590> teeth<00:04:42.730> now<00:04:43.730> they're

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
used to have straight teeth now they're

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.850 
used to have straight teeth now they're
all<00:04:44.090> wavy<00:04:45.250> they're<00:04:46.250> all<00:04:46.600> wavy<00:04:47.600> wavy<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.680> know

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
all wavy they're all wavy wavy you know

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.190 
all wavy they're all wavy wavy you know
and<00:04:50.200> they<00:04:51.200> used<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.500> be<00:04:51.590> straight<00:04:52.930> so<00:04:53.930> I<00:04:53.960> guess

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
and they used to be straight so I guess

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.810 
and they used to be straight so I guess
that's<00:04:54.470> a<00:04:54.620> big<00:04:54.650> gripe<00:04:55.040> it's<00:04:55.250> it's<00:04:55.610> like<00:04:55.760> it's

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
that's a big gripe it's it's like it's

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.690 
that's a big gripe it's it's like it's
not<00:04:56.240> my<00:04:56.510> teeth<00:04:56.900> it's<00:04:57.380> like<00:04:57.590> somebody<00:04:58.340> else's

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
not my teeth it's like somebody else's

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.040 
not my teeth it's like somebody else's
teeth<00:04:58.940> are<00:04:59.150> in<00:04:59.240> my<00:04:59.270> mouth<00:04:59.570> now

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
teeth are in my mouth now

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.580 
teeth are in my mouth now
but<00:05:00.530> my<00:05:00.800> bite<00:05:01.160> is<00:05:01.400> good<00:05:01.640> I<00:05:01.940> mean<00:05:02.360> they<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.260> lines

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
but my bite is good I mean they it lines

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.750 
but my bite is good I mean they it lines
up<00:05:03.830> everything<00:05:04.370> but<00:05:05.330> it's<00:05:05.630> like<00:05:05.840> summer

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
up everything but it's like summer

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.230 
up everything but it's like summer
height-wise<00:05:07.760> are<00:05:08.090> taller<00:05:08.900> than<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.500> others

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
height-wise are taller than the others

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.210 
height-wise are taller than the others
so<00:05:11.240> it's<00:05:11.540> kind<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.840> weird<00:05:11.990> but<00:05:12.380> I'm<00:05:12.920> gonna<00:05:13.070> have

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
so it's kind of weird but I'm gonna have

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.100 
so it's kind of weird but I'm gonna have
to<00:05:13.310> do<00:05:13.430> orthodontic<00:05:13.910> so<00:05:14.180> I<00:05:14.210> have<00:05:14.390> to<00:05:14.510> do<00:05:14.630> braces

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
to do orthodontic so I have to do braces

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.420 
to do orthodontic so I have to do braces

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
straighten all that out but that's a

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.780 
straighten all that out but that's a
small<00:05:16.550> price<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.970> pay<00:05:17.260> or<00:05:18.310> for<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.370> surgery

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790

upper and lower jaw and moved it forward
eight<00:05:33.710> millimeters<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.940> was<00:05:35.090> a<00:05:35.230> highly

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
eight millimeters it was a highly
