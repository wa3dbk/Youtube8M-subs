not enough to use in place of the foot
curls<00:04:33.530> because<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.130> just<00:04:34.250> doesn't<00:04:34.550> replace<00:04:35.000> it

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
curls because it just doesn't replace it

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.140

but<00:04:36.140> what<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.350> find<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.400> eco<00:04:37.700> styler<00:04:37.940> gel

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
but what I find that the eco styler gel

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.900 
but what I find that the eco styler gel
does<00:04:38.690> is<00:04:38.990> it<00:04:39.200> really<00:04:39.530> clumps<00:04:40.190> my<00:04:40.520> curls

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
does is it really clumps my curls

does is it really clumps my curls

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
together so what I do is after I apply

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.470 
together so what I do is after I apply
