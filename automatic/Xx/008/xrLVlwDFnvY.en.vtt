what I think

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.889 
what I think
metallic<00:00:57.360> highlights<00:00:58.350> should<00:00:58.620> look<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.899> now

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
metallic highlights should look like now

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.660 
metallic highlights should look like now
if<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.469> wanted<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.190> ultra

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
if I really wanted to make this ultra

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.929 
if I really wanted to make this ultra
believable<00:01:03.710> then<00:01:04.710> I'm<00:01:04.920> gonna<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> would<00:01:05.580> grab

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you know whatever kind of metal I'm I'm

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.649 
you know whatever kind of metal I'm I'm
trying<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> make<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.970> look<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.600> would

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
trying to make this look like I would

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.260 
trying to make this look like I would
get<00:01:16.259> reference<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.130> actual<00:01:17.520> thing<00:01:17.880> but

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
get reference for that actual thing but

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.530 
get reference for that actual thing but
again<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:20.070> working<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.549> deadlines<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
again I'm working with deadlines and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.679 
again I'm working with deadlines and
time<00:01:21.750> constraints<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.939> I'm<00:01:23.939> better<00:01:24.240> off<00:01:24.450> just

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
time constraints so I'm better off just

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.840 
time constraints so I'm better off just
going<00:01:24.930> back<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> something<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> I've<00:01:26.220> done<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
going back to something that I've done a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
going back to something that I've done a
million<00:01:27.180> times

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.170 

and<00:01:41.860> some<00:01:42.070> of<00:01:42.190> this<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.520> going<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.790> be<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:42.940> little

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
and some of this is going to be a little

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.120 
and some of this is going to be a little
bit<00:01:43.420> sloppy<00:01:43.870> but<00:01:44.350> it<00:01:44.530> doesn't<00:01:44.860> matter<00:01:44.980> I<00:01:45.070> can

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
bit sloppy but it doesn't matter I can

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.920 
bit sloppy but it doesn't matter I can
go<00:01:45.400> back<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.180> fix<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.900> be

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
go back in and fix it I have to be

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.690 
go back in and fix it I have to be
mindful<00:01:50.260> with<00:01:50.620> about<00:01:50.860> what<00:01:51.130> I'm<00:01:51.250> doing<00:01:51.280> I

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
don't want to just go nuts either but I

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.660 
don't want to just go nuts either but I

sometimes you'll get a book and look at

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
exact colors but you know something

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.900

changed<00:04:26.020> very<00:04:26.289> slightly<00:04:26.800> on<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.370> printing

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
changed very slightly on the printing

changed very slightly on the printing
press<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:29.130> now<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.870> know<00:04:32.020> it's<00:04:32.830> just<00:04:33.100> things

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
press and now you know it's just things

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.180 
press and now you know it's just things
just<00:04:34.630> don't<00:04:34.810> look<00:04:35.050> exactly<00:04:35.229> how<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:35.770> want<00:04:36.070> it

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
just don't look exactly how you want it

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.189 
just don't look exactly how you want it
so<00:04:36.400> it's<00:04:36.639> good<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:36.910> have<00:04:37.150> an<00:04:37.300> idea<00:04:37.389> of<00:04:37.690> how

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
so it's good to have an idea of how

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.950 
so it's good to have an idea of how
things<00:04:38.440> are<00:04:38.620> gonna<00:04:38.800> print<00:04:39.539> and<00:04:40.539> that<00:04:40.750> comes

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
things are gonna print and that comes

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.650 
things are gonna print and that comes
with<00:04:41.050> experience<00:04:41.530> how<00:04:42.100> much<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:43.060> can<00:04:43.210> expect

with experience how much you can expect

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.810 
with experience how much you can expect
things<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.050> change<00:04:44.260> in<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.220> printing<00:04:45.550> process

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
things to change in the printing process

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.450 
things to change in the printing process
and<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:49.360> know<00:04:49.479> as<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:50.320> become<00:04:50.680> more<00:04:50.710> seasoned

you<00:04:52.030> become<00:04:52.389> more<00:04:52.690> aware<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:53.050> that<00:04:53.289> as<00:04:53.590> you're

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
you become more aware of that as you're

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.250 
you become more aware of that as you're
