00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello my name is martin saddler 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.200
 today I am repairing 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.290
 a glass door on a building of 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.360
 60s the technique that was used 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.639
 originally is not at all the one that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.230
 today we would use with him the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.000
 do the top for glass door 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.350
 so I have to go according to the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.730
 techniques of the time 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.670
 in a way the board at 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.060
 lunar is no the coach rather at a re 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:37.170
 during recent 2 3 tenths of stock market or 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:39.930
 about ten centimeters and I 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.940
 want to reproduce this meeting I 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.840
 could use teen nam try me 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 practically three times that I was 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.780
 just a soul 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.539
 so I'm blown out that I'm going to use 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.850
 my usual lady for is able to 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.539
 make a bed with groove I use 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.930
 a blade that at one of five on the bottom 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.730
 flat the others are in india may with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.320
 one in five leaves with flat bottom what 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.100
 does that when until that makes me 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.510
 dreaming about the fauna full of kids i will you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.790
 back up how to do 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.189
 the reason is simple all white 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.439
 time every time because if we 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.390
 share the measures and instructions this talent 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.640
 firstly it's the width the blade 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 is not necessarily the width of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 grooves that we want to do me in my 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.630
 body is hardly wider than 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 madam so I did what was enough for me 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.310
 brand and I go to the simple and the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.040
 technique happened the return we speak 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.640
 in a sense 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.340
 by the way on aa lifts any form of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.229
 separators behind knife got 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.730
 rare fact partly triggered in a 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.230
 meaning 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:00.130
 we turn it and we go back to it 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.840
 result makes a groove probably 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.090
 a little wider plains soul saves if 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.740
 she was exactly present but 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.540
 she makes me a groove exactly 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.540
 the whole of my class I show you 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.580
 olam with van hulle exactly in the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.060
 sense of match if I want a little more 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.310
 large 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.140
 I only have to pass my guide a little 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.599
 little more and it'll make me a rumor 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.299
 wider wide good if you have a break 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.480
 more than a quarter of an inch to make 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.040
 it's not a good idea because even 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.959
 if you put a blade of 8 so there 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.430
 still it's not my limit it's 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.010
 excellent for making light more 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.489
 small than a quarter of an inch or even 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.470
 excuse me an inch body that's 7 mm 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.400
 therefore 7 mm maximum 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.980
 it plays it works more than that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.420
 uses a technique 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.420
 I hope you enjoyed thank you
