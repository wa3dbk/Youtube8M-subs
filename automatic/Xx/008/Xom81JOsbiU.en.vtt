00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.489
 Well 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.760
 Hello, my name is Viktor Saltykov 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.489
 and watch the video on the map dot com 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:13.959
 today in our review 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.029
 for the first time we have a nagagaki media player 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.220
 the team will be released a model called Oleg is able 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.259
 Annuka Rosoez 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.519
 and is such a completely 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.829
 small box 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.329
 the size of the cd scene even 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.519
 probably smaller 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.000
 In addition to the package and charging instructions 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.180
 which we are not particularly interesting as well as 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.250
 before the shots are still such 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.960
 remote control and he 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 curious features 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.440
 volume control done 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 like its android smartphones then if 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.690
 such a key rocker more 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.940
 less here is nothing but fun 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.340
 as well as hersk fits keys 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.080
 call the context menu 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.160
 and the key that calls 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.570
 Russian on the menu in many other ways 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.330
 fourth is right 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.910
 the bottom corner of the screen and if im we look 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.110
 horizontal tablet 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 orientation and return button 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.500
 we have the previous name but this one 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.040
 navigation center but four keys on 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.910
 directions and a button in Kiev 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.540
 Rosatom media player 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.140
 Well, not badly equipped, he has Wi fi 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.570
 which for me is critical for example because 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.990
 do not be afraid and did not think I was not allowed 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 don't see 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.970
 plainly and he supports 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.649
 micro memory cards from the day if still around 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.320
 called translation 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.940
 this is a very old marking principle 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.490
 which was independence 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.430
 microsievert hour many years ago he has three 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.860
 am3 connector beat in addition to two 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.000
 us 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.860
 on the left panel one more behind we to this 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.990
 my idea 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.920
 input to disperse in the chamber if suddenly 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 you home is not a wireless network 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.250
 there is one more 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.040
 system reset keys 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.420
 but let's all beaver 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 meet him the same factory 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.350
 so let's go in blood 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.539
 the main function of the media player itself 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.139
 watching movies 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.759
 and in the player already provided 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.859
 application called movie player 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.339
 but there were fresh contents 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.579
 internal memory of the player and I connected 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.209
 a string of beaten a large one and a half 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.929
 gigabyte hard drive 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.059
 external 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.789
 and now we 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.959
 would move in decline 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.959
 I have here such an action has become 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:33.680
 copy 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.069
 surprise drive 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.629
 and as you see 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.659
 everything runs rubber departments 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.119
 not to watch captions about 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.649
 first tragedy 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.649
 priority need to be 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.079
 what are the functions view transition to 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.139
 in the evening therefore 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.829
 there is a possibility 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 running 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.069
 after many years 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.859
 during the feast of grain based on it 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.559
 which instrument soundtracks 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.559
 Defense Valery Ivaschenko 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.850
 there you can choose 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.340
 power management all taxes we don't know 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.540
 as for the league 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.340
 we have already created an organism system 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.909
 after construction where on radiation 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.579
 virus exposure can choose a solution 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.069
 about prompt working on various 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.579
 provide safety for the season 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.339
 rainy see passport data 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.229
 200 Lozinsky idea promotes Firtash 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.799
 stock exchanges on Monday June 29 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.929
 that's how it is controlled from the remote 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.909
 funny volume 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.489
 but you can also be a world for beginners 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.680
 picture by the way publicly normal 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.539
 everything goes well claim puppies 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.869
 and you can still look 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.189
 some sort of full resolution video 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.189
 money 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.799
 for example star wars 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.799
 unexpected 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.579
 here we run 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.959
 also offered to stay 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.309
 memorized place 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:17.590
 and see 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.749
 also a great clear picture 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:21.609
 Skis and quality do not slow down 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.839
 despite the fact that the process by the standards 

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.399
 modern street smartphones are coming 

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.009
 in Libya 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.589
 in such consequences but as you can see for 

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:31.589
 video playback is quite enough 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.860
 and you can also see how 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.170
 media player works 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.840
 and home and visit for this truth 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.600
 will have to use 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.189
 percentage set by me to applications 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.139
 it's called mediahouse 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.270
 I am sure that on request making mei 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.499
 Anyone can find a mass of similar 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:51.550
 applications 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.819
 to the head 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.149
 the marketplace here he connected serves 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:58.210
 my laptops and actually now 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.740
 n we see the folders placed by me 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.139
 laptops are open region and serbia 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.409
 Now you can browse by folders 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.089
 here is a secret vol yes there 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:11.279
 I will let my water flow 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:12.819
 so whip 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.909
 the freshest 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.909
 in the year we have here for example 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.770
 but for example the performer is fresh 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.770
 version 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.139
 at the same time as you saw the percentage 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.280
 Bravo won gold medals this 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.569
 just the same media player 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:29.529
 watch 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.079
 This is a clear picture of this. 

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.319
 gigabyte by which 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.389
 broadcast via wireless network 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.999
 everything is fine as you can see 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.879
 but in this tournament 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.650
 but to me promoter yes 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.460
 no rewind therefore 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.419
 on this will be determined 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.180
 thank you for attention 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.639
 yes in a meeting stay with us 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.159
