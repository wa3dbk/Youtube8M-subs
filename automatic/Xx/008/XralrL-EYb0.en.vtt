00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.270
 good people good today I bring you a 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.610
 tutorial on how to install the ader module 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.220
 of minecraft inah game for what 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.369
 the ader module serves as it is a manager 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.849
 it is worth doing so that they do not have 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.400
 problems different ways that we go 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:26.150
 installing that is like a manager 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.820
 machine that avoids having 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.329
 problems between them when installed 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.320
 the other mods good as it is installed 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.500
 this then first we go to this page of 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.500
 here 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.710
 I'll put it here in the description 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.280
 down 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.489
 in a 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.120
 so we upload firefox we go to 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.120
 that page 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.910
 and we got here 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.640
 here on the page where created by the 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:05.000
 mold mod and good 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.570
 we go down more and put molds of 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.230
 version 132 is worth it we get off 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.740
 To who 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.590
 download direct 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.899
 to go directly and save it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.750
 where we store in any folder 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.280
 and create a ki-moon loader 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.990
 in a 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.340
 and even save 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.340
 we left here 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.800
 and now what you have to do is go to 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.200
 this folder that we have downloaded 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.659
 loader and extract the files 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.580
 you do not extract all this amount of 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.030
 good files 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.030
 Now you have to go here to the app data vale 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:58.730
 we are going to 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.820
 here at the beginning and we put here app data 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.230
 with the percentages on the sides we give 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.100
 to ok 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.710
 and it opens up to highlight this folder there 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.980
 to go to the point minecraft to install 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.019
 this 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.800
 we give it to him and then we see here that several 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.730
 folders we give min 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.100
 and well we got here at least let 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.130
 this has to be modified and you have to 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.320
 open it with the winrar program or 7 zip 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.130
 the one that we have so good I'm going to 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.190
 open with owen rap 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.250
 and these are the files that we have in 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.230
 the winrar 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.440
 in the good minister here you have to 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.470
 do then copy all the files that 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.630
 we have downloaded the mold and good here 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.840
 we have all the files of the module 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.840
 fairies 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.630
 and let's put it a little big 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.000
 OK 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:13.900
 then we copy everything we remove this and 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.900
 we passed all these files to winrar 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.740
 It is worth to spend everything like this 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.130
 yes, if you have a folder here 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:27.760
 called goal and you have to delete it because 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.840
 if it will not be done 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.090
 the client and you can not execute it 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.269
 well once we have here the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.510
 mont loader we check that it does not grow 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.860
 to the 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.970
 the normal minecraft and you're 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:51.430
 so let's go to here to minecraft what 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.090
 we execute we achieve 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.920
 full 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.840
 here 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.840
 we entered any server 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.710
 and here we are like no to creation or 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.750
 nothing would be working 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:15.110
 perfectly good this has been all 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.320
 I hope this mold goes well 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.250
 loader 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.500
 since it's a pretty good gesture was 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.390
 good to subscribe if you do not pay in another 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.390
 life come to dv
