 Thank you very much to the boat for being with us because you will not eat the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.220
 Caprese salad ingredients 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.780
 yes basically 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.650
 percent the cherry tomato 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.230
 full, we have not advanced 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.190
 round the second got 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.260
 came alba 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.790
 compass 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.450
 and how are they going 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.720
 obviously 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 percent and feelings 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.770
 caprese salad or I think it's going to be 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.540
 Mythical respect to be able to surprise 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 our friends then what we do is what 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 we throw little chamo to the sector 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.920
 olive oil that will serve us 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.280
 the serrano ham glue and does not serve to cook judge in the oven 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.620
 let's go to father 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.160
 one of them we already have it 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.600
 seasoning 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.280
 sprinkle 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 and so we will very easily support the cherry tomato 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.760
 joel ramos serrano 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.760
 look how when taking 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.840
 obviously press the oil helps us a lot 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.740
 that camus in two 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.770
 if they entertain diversity or put 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.369
 it is an event a stick anything like in the forest that prepares us racing 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.899
 so 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.139
 this is the third not much 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:16.930
 Well obviously takes time but look and we'll know the lactose out 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.059
 so what happens that which effect we're going to do sometimes 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.809
 Here we have the Serrano ham ing as it comes 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.349
 the effect of heat 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.640
 start to pick up with the oil before picking up the serrano ham and start 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.639
 hug the tomato is true if they say it is to bet 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.819
 that bet today on the other side of the Atlantic and the form the way to take 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.999
 yes that goes that marked the beginning of the end to disrupt the tomato 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.339
 percent 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.910
 we already talked about keeping the effect what is needed right now 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.519
 what gamón serrano do 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.579
 become as before 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.640
 to be very careful based on this because the heat that keeps the 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.259
 tomato from behind impresses when we have the tomatoes ready 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.189
 sprinkle with basil 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.519
 finally spicy and chiffon 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.039
 I will explain them in red compost and we have it here match 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:16.439
 the Vatican as it is and how good is involved then the court does not 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.540
 only of him of basil but of any ortiz and children 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.199
 of any vegetable heritage of these 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.309
 percent the work is exposed 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.829
 yesterday they used 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.299
 cut 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.069
 remove the center offers the lens the basil Alava basil the truth is that 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.539
 for this work I have here 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.189
 I do not see it as very significant and the truth that does not appear with it 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:44.139
 I do not see that there is a greater problem there are a few short periods, the regular one 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.209
 times 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.309
 This is very good if it is convenient to play sports parallel to the 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.650
 come to 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.039
 to side and side and get him out they know 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.379
 we train 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.239
 in a kind of god we can ride two by three we carry a cigarette 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.089
 we make a cigarette 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:04.269
 we started it 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.629
 to chop in chicontepec the tip 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.629
 We started spicy and finely chopped 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.989
 and look that we are staying 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.989
 it's getting finely chopped 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.729
 and that some way 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.729
 well these communities that is not that is the team itself 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.640
 there are layers squares makes a recount of how to prepare the caprese salad 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.819
 if we take the cherry tomato 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:35.159
 we're leaving with Libyan transition ascendancy 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.939
 we miss the 500 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.839
 and with the musicians there is no human being mullen we return 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.249

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.340
 we wear it with pride 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.800
 all those minutes 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800
