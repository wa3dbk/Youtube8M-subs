00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
five buckets and I'm proud to say it was

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.710 
five buckets and I'm proud to say it was
only<00:02:14.170> about<00:02:14.410> six<00:02:14.980> or<00:02:15.400> six-and-a-half<00:02:16.060> buckets

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
only about six or six-and-a-half buckets

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.170 
only about six or six-and-a-half buckets
and<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.990> did<00:02:17.230> get<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.590> filled<00:02:17.860> up<00:02:18.070> when<00:02:19.060> you're

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
and I did get it filled up when you're

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.730 
and I did get it filled up when you're
working<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> excavator<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.530> this

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
working with the excavator like this

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.920 
working with the excavator like this
well<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.640> motion<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:22.180> controlled<00:02:22.450> by<00:02:22.750> two

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
well the motion is controlled by two

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.200 
well the motion is controlled by two
joysticks<00:02:23.380> one<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.130> each<00:02:24.250> hand<00:02:24.280> forward

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
joysticks one in each hand forward

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.420 
joysticks one in each hand forward
backward<00:02:25.990> left<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.530> right<00:02:26.709> with<00:02:26.950> each<00:02:27.130> one

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
backward left and right with each one

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.480 
backward left and right with each one
and<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.810> beginner<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.620> can<00:02:29.890> be<00:02:30.010> pretty<00:02:30.250> hard

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
and for a beginner it can be pretty hard

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.460 
and for a beginner it can be pretty hard
to<00:02:30.610> keep<00:02:30.880> track<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.420> which<00:02:31.690> one<00:02:31.930> that's<00:02:32.380> a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
to keep track of which one that's a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.350 
to keep track of which one that's a
squat<00:02:34.020> bowling<00:02:35.020> anyone<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:36.459> one<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.760> found<00:02:37.090> to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
squat bowling anyone this one I found to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.900 
squat bowling anyone this one I found to
be<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.660> toughest<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.230> all<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.590> channelings

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
be the toughest of all the channelings

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.790 
be the toughest of all the channelings
that's<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.030> pretty<00:02:40.270> small<00:02:40.660> maze

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
that's a pretty small maze

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.420 
that's a pretty small maze
waise<00:02:42.390> move<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.630> bowling<00:02:44.110> ball<00:02:44.140> around<00:02:44.680> but

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
waise move that bowling ball around but

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.800 
waise move that bowling ball around but
I<00:02:45.460> did<00:02:45.700> get<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.090> through<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.420> whole<00:02:46.600> maze

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
I did get it through the whole maze

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.530 
I did get it through the whole maze
although<00:02:47.380> what<00:02:47.710> time<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.190> buried<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.120> ball<00:02:49.300> and

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
although what time I buried the ball and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.110 
although what time I buried the ball and
I<00:02:49.600> had<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.930> dig<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.470> up<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.710> game<00:02:50.890> for<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.910> maze

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
I had to dig it up and game for the maze

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.460 
I had to dig it up and game for the maze
but<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:55.270> know<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:55.690> keep<00:02:55.930> moving<00:02:56.320> those

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
but you know you just keep moving those

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.850 
but you know you just keep moving those

way<00:03:01.990> down<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> end<00:03:02.770> give<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> little

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
way down to the end give it a little

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.960 
way down to the end give it a little
whack<00:03:03.550> there<00:03:03.850> go<00:03:04.120> ahead<00:03:04.270> there<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.930> go<00:03:05.970> now

we've<00:03:07.180> switched<00:03:07.300> over<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.050> Bobcat<00:03:08.560> here

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
we've switched over to the Bobcat here

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.610 
we've switched over to the Bobcat here
we<00:03:09.430> have<00:03:09.610> an<00:03:09.760> obstacle<00:03:09.940> course<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.500> took

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
we have an obstacle course and it took

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.410 
we have an obstacle course and it took
me<00:03:11.830> about<00:03:12.040> five<00:03:12.460> minutes<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.970> get<00:03:13.150> through

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
me about five minutes to get through

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.350 
me about five minutes to get through
here<00:03:14.230> we're<00:03:14.380> pushing<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.860> tire<00:03:15.100> into<00:03:15.520> a<00:03:15.670> space

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
here we're pushing a tire into a space

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.380 
here we're pushing a tire into a space
that<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:17.500> marked<00:03:17.830> off<00:03:17.980> over<00:03:18.490> there<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.240> it's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
that is marked off over there and it's

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.970 
that is marked off over there and it's
pretty<00:03:19.750> tight<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.260> move<00:03:20.410> this<00:03:20.620> thing<00:03:20.860> around

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
pretty tight to move this thing around

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.150 
pretty tight to move this thing around
in<00:03:21.370> there<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.930> didn't<00:03:23.680> want<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:23.950> be

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
in there so I didn't want it to be

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.740 
in there so I didn't want it to be
running<00:03:24.460> five<00:03:24.790> minutes<00:03:25.210> so<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.360> can<00:03:25.570> see

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
running five minutes so you can see

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.690 
running five minutes so you can see
we're<00:03:25.930> going<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.350> kind<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.650> fast<00:03:26.890> motion<00:03:27.400> here

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
we're going and kind of fast motion here

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.910 
we're going and kind of fast motion here
so<00:03:28.210> we'll<00:03:28.330> get<00:03:28.420> through<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:28.810> five<00:03:29.080> minutes<00:03:29.500> a

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
so we'll get through this five minutes a

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.210 
so we'll get through this five minutes a
lot<00:03:30.730> quicker<00:03:31.000> this<00:03:31.810> one<00:03:32.110> is<00:03:32.290> really<00:03:33.010> a

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
lot quicker this one is really a

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.510 
lot quicker this one is really a
challenge<00:03:33.640> six<00:03:34.630> bowling<00:03:35.170> balls<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.800> six

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
challenge six bowling balls and six

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.220 
challenge six bowling balls and six
little<00:03:36.850> holes<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.420> got<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.690> push<00:03:37.900> them<00:03:38.050> into

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
little holes you got to push them into

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.730 
little holes you got to push them into
so<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.570> took<00:03:40.810> me<00:03:40.960> a<00:03:40.990> little<00:03:41.110> while<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.590> is

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
so it it took me a little while this is

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.800 
so it it took me a little while this is
probably<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.160> bulk<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.700> five<00:03:43.390> minutes

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
probably the bulk of the five minutes

00:03:43.810 --> 00:04:14.880 
probably the bulk of the five minutes
was<00:03:44.020> getting<00:03:44.350> those<00:03:44.500> bowling<00:03:44.950> balls<00:03:45.220> and

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.610 

well<00:04:15.490> we're<00:04:15.700> not<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.030> last<00:04:16.239> ball<00:04:16.600> win<00:04:16.840> then

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
well we're not that last ball win then

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.940 
well we're not that last ball win then
it's<00:04:17.769> off<00:04:17.920> to<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.250> parallel<00:04:18.670> parking<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:20.230> got

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
it's off to the parallel parking and got

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.500 
it's off to the parallel parking and got
to<00:04:21.040> get<00:04:21.130> around<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.760> back<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.180> in<00:04:22.300> between

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
to get around and back it in between

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.730 
to get around and back it in between
those<00:04:22.900> cones

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
those cones

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.220 
those cones

there's our Philip crew guy back there

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.920 
there's our Philip crew guy back there

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
getting every last bit of it can't wait

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.370
