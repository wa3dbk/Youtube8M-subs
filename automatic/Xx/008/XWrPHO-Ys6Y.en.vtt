00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hi guys, how are you, a tutorial today? 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.770
 different here is not a toral that I 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.200
 I never did hair capital 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.200
 but calm that it is very simple to do and 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.010
 I be you like flour braid 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.349
 built in that many people ask me 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.570
 It came to become a long country is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.930
 very simple to do you can believe 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.890
 because I suck and make hairstyles 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.829
 choose a little bit but I'm not 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 very good in hair and France managed to 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.180
 make a good and super fast is by 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 come here a little bit for you to see 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.070
 as what it is is a braid that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.129
 for him up here 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.710
 there you can leave behind you can 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.070
 play from now on I think it stayed 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.079
 well cool are you sure you are going 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.290
 I need very few things to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.720
 making this tutorial okay and then gives to you 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 to use on a day-to-day basis, you can 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.680
 tuft together and use a night event 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.330
 that looks beautiful too 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.330
 So you come with me to this dance at school? 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.890
 Then I'll get a grinder from that one. 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.939
 I always feel very well I 'm going to spend 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.840
 the ends are just not to stay the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.840
 The 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:47.200
 now let's get the kid I go 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.420
 take half of my hair like it was 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.300
 one half slightly less 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.490
 half is in half I always go 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.230
 send it up front as well 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.550
 I'll divide it into three equal parts 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.700
 after I divided it into three parts 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.810
 same as I'm going to start throwing myself 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:12.190
 first normal part 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.980
 So I made the first part now I go 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.740
 start every strand I braid myself 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.680
 I have to get some hair 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.370
 arriving here some hair spots 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:32.830
 together with the side wick and passes through 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:37.800
 in the same way the hair along with the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.800
 side lock means in a step 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:50.200
 and so is forming the transaction 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.360
 The secret is not to bind a lot of hair 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.060
 when joining the picked up this average that 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.240
 along this side and through the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.240
 medium 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:27.220
 and then you keep on going 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:31.780
 usually as low arm fatigues 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.790
 when it was getting too down 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.740
 brakes keep on going 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.620
 is for you to continue advancing just the same 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.680
 You dance back, you'll stay in the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.590
 same sense that you were making of 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.480
 back 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:55.600
 Then I'll get one of those good elastics. 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:04:02.350
 I 'll learn and I'll like these 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:07.120
 challenges because it has not appeared for four 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.690
 here and ready you can use her to 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.920
 That way , I'm bringing you here. 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.920
 or you can use back 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.130
 so saw how easy it is to do 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.740
 people that braid the deal are you 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.419
 I train and my arm got tired a little bit 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.669
 Also sometimes you get a lot with 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.500
 arm back but this tip is that when 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.360
 You finished the France you play there. 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.090
 and continues to do so here in 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.280
 It works fine, we use this 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.950
 braid use in day to day use for 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.470
 get out someone already the super simple to do 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.270
 but I find it very beautiful and hope 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.400
