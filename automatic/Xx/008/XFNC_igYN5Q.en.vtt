ugly<00:04:59.229> performance<00:04:59.560> to<00:05:00.070> say<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.370> least

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
ugly performance to say the least

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.089 
ugly performance to say the least
because<00:05:01.300> Fulham<00:05:01.750> did<00:05:02.229> get<00:05:02.349> on<00:05:02.440> top<00:05:02.680> in<00:05:02.889> that

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
because Fulham did get on top in that

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.610 
because Fulham did get on top in that
second<00:05:03.400> half<00:05:03.520> but<00:05:03.729> decide<00:05:04.419> to<00:05:04.539> fended<00:05:04.840> well<00:05:04.990> it
