things about this telescope that you
won't<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.449> any<00:00:54.989> telescopes<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:56.070> know

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
won't see on any telescopes that we know

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.590 
won't see on any telescopes that we know
that<00:00:56.399> are<00:00:56.489> eight<00:00:56.640> inches<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.660> ability<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
that are eight inches is the ability to

that are eight inches is the ability to
stay<00:01:00.600> perfectly<00:01:01.050> balanced<00:01:02.120> with<00:01:03.120> any

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
stay perfectly balanced with any

stay perfectly balanced with any
eyepiece<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> 31<00:01:04.979> millimetre<00:01:05.430> Nagler<00:01:05.820> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
eyepiece up to a 31 millimetre Nagler so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.640 
eyepiece up to a 31 millimetre Nagler so
I<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.299> wanted<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.659> take<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> moment<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.439> show
