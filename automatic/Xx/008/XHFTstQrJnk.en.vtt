00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
sift it as much as possible scrape down

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.719 
sift it as much as possible scrape down
the<00:01:34.320> sides<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.010> bowl<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> ensure<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the sides of the bowl to ensure that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.000 
the sides of the bowl to ensure that
everything<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.450> well<00:01:36.690> mixed<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.860> we're

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
everything is well mixed and then we're

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.890 
everything is well mixed and then we're
going<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.190> put<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.580> in<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.910> piping<00:01:39.360> bag<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
going to put this in a piping bag I

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.810 
going to put this in a piping bag I
preheated<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:43.170> oven<00:01:43.260> at<00:01:43.680> 180<00:01:44.340> degrees

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
preheated the oven at 180 degrees

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.859 
preheated the oven at 180 degrees
Celsius<00:01:44.850> by<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.660> way<00:01:45.900> then<00:01:46.200> start<00:01:46.560> piping<00:01:47.869> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
Celsius by the way then start piping and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.510 
Celsius by the way then start piping and
make<00:01:49.110> sure<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.470> there's<00:01:49.710> enough<00:01:49.890> gap

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
make sure that there's enough gap

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.460 
make sure that there's enough gap
between<00:01:51.000> each<00:01:52.790> language<00:01:53.790> ghetto<00:01:54.510> because

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
between each language ghetto because

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.330 
between each language ghetto because
this<00:01:55.710> will<00:01:55.950> spread<00:01:57.440> don't<00:01:58.440> make<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:58.800> too<00:01:59.010> thick

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
this will spread don't make it too thick

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.200 
this will spread don't make it too thick
as<00:01:59.850> well<00:02:00.150> so<00:02:00.480> just<00:02:01.340> pipe<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.640> right<00:02:02.820> amount

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
as well so just pipe the right amount

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.520 
as well so just pipe the right amount
before<00:02:03.540> baking<00:02:03.900> give<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.380> good<00:02:04.560> tap

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.650 

bake<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.770> for<00:02:12.040> about<00:02:12.220> eight<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:13.210> twelve

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
bake it for about eight to twelve

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.170 
bake it for about eight to twelve
minutes<00:02:14.470> or<00:02:14.830> until<00:02:14.980> when<00:02:15.460> you<00:02:15.580> see<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
minutes or until when you see that the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.970 
minutes or until when you see that the
sides<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.870> language<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.380> ghetto<00:02:17.620> is

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
sides of the language the ghetto is

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.830 
sides of the language the ghetto is
golden<00:02:18.520> brown<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.890> like<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.970> then

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
golden brown just like this and then

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.780 
golden brown just like this and then
once<00:02:23.170> you've<00:02:23.350> done<00:02:23.410> baking<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:24.100> let<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.460> sit

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
once you've done baking just let it sit

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.290 
once you've done baking just let it sit
in<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.480> pan<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:26.230> about<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> minute<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.610> if<00:02:27.940> you

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
in the pan for about a minute so if you

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.410 
in the pan for about a minute so if you
can<00:02:28.450> easily<00:02:28.630> peel<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.230> off<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:30.210> this<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:31.270> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
can easily peel it off and this is the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.480 
can easily peel it off and this is the
finished<00:02:31.960> product<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.680> hope<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.070> give<00:02:33.220> them<00:02:33.400> a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.710 
finished product I hope you give them a
try<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:34.210> really<00:02:34.540> easy<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:35.050> make<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:36.720> once

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
try this is really easy to make and once

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.620 
try this is really easy to make and once
you<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.530> has<00:02:39.250> cooled<00:02:39.610> down<00:02:39.760> make<00:02:40.330> sure<00:02:40.510> that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
you it has cooled down make sure that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.990 
you it has cooled down make sure that
you<00:02:40.810> put<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.200> in<00:02:41.440> an<00:02:41.560> airtight<00:02:41.770> container<00:02:42.010> so

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
you put it in an airtight container so

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.449 
you put it in an airtight container so
it<00:02:43.210> will<00:02:43.480> maintain<00:02:44.380> its<00:02:44.880> crispiness<00:02:45.880> on<00:02:47.459> a

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
it will maintain its crispiness on a

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.530 
it will maintain its crispiness on a
closer<00:02:48.790> look<00:02:49.209> this<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.780> what<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:50.080> looks<00:02:50.320> like<00:02:50.620> I

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
closer look this is what it looks like I
