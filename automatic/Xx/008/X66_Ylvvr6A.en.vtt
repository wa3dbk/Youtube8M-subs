minecraft tutorial today with everybody
have<00:00:10.410> built<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.889> bell<00:00:11.750> ah-1z<00:00:12.750> viper<00:00:13.549> so<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
have built the bell ah-1z viper so I

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.369 
have built the bell ah-1z viper so I
have<00:00:14.759> made<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> little<00:00:15.450> bit<00:00:15.570> wide<00:00:16.170> it

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
have made this one a little bit wide it

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.830 
have made this one a little bit wide it
is<00:00:16.410> actually<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> meter<00:00:17.910> thick<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.449> it

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
is actually about a meter thick so it

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.529 
is actually about a meter thick so it
would<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.050> be<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.380> base<00:00:19.560> they<00:00:19.680> aligned<00:00:20.480> so<00:00:21.480> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
would just be a base they aligned so I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
would just be a base they aligned so I
have<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.769> made<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.100> wider<00:00:23.279> by<00:00:23.519> two<00:00:23.580> blocks

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
have I have made it wider by two blocks

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.310 
have I have made it wider by two blocks
on<00:00:24.090> each<00:00:24.150> side<00:00:24.269> just<00:00:24.449> because<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.930> gives<00:00:25.080> if<00:00:25.199> it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
on each side just because it gives if it

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.679 
on each side just because it gives if it
would<00:00:25.699> definition<00:00:26.699> otherwise<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
would definition otherwise is just a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.540 
would definition otherwise is just a
line<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.920> straight<00:00:28.949> back

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550

block<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.720> back<00:01:51.869> by<00:01:51.990> seven<00:01:52.290> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
block on this one go back by seven to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.190 
block on this one go back by seven to
one<00:01:52.619> two<00:01:52.950> three<00:01:53.310> four<00:01:53.670> five

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
one two three four five

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.030 
one two three four five
seven<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.520> seven<00:01:55.549> including<00:01:56.119> this<00:01:56.450> one<00:01:56.630> here

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
seven so seven including this one here

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.780 
seven so seven including this one here
comes<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.220> next<00:01:58.340> part

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
comes the next part

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.120 
comes the next part
okay<00:01:59.450> so<00:01:59.509> just<00:01:59.750> place<00:01:59.900> a<00:01:59.930> slab<00:02:00.290> on<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.560> end<00:02:00.710> I'm

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
okay so just place a slab on the end I'm

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.590 
okay so just place a slab on the end I'm
not<00:02:01.280> gonna<00:02:01.430> backfire<00:02:01.820> here<00:02:02.060> as<00:02:02.270> we<00:02:02.390> do<00:02:02.509> the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
not gonna backfire here as we do the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.740 
not gonna backfire here as we do the
rotor<00:02:02.780> next<00:02:03.470> one<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.740> walk<00:02:04.130> there<00:02:04.720> place<00:02:05.720> a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
rotor next one to walk there place a

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.620 
rotor next one to walk there place a
light<00:02:06.250> grey<00:02:07.250> ball<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.700> put<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.909> slab<00:02:08.239> on<00:02:08.270> top<00:02:08.539> of

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
light grey ball and put a slab on top of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.719 
light grey ball and put a slab on top of
it<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.500> time<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.950> rotor<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.489> actually

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
it and this time the rotor is actually

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.770 
it and this time the rotor is actually
on<00:02:10.789> this<00:02:11.030> side<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.480> it

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
on this side of it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.430 
on this side of it
take<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.709> pencil<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.220> top<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.850> bottom<00:02:14.440> and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
take a pencil on top and the bottom and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.750 
take a pencil on top and the bottom and
fence<00:02:15.830> gates<00:02:16.190> on<00:02:16.640> either<00:02:17.120> side<00:02:18.340> it's<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.400> really

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
fence gates on either side it's a really

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.940 
fence gates on either side it's a really
easy<00:02:19.970> build

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
easy build

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.259 
easy build
no<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.069> need<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.370> put<00:02:22.819> your<00:02:22.910> button<00:02:23.060> on<00:02:23.180> the

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
no you need to do put your button on the

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.250 
no you need to do put your button on the
other<00:02:23.420> side<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.810> we'll<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:23.930> keep<00:02:24.140> them

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
other side and we'll just keep them

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.960 
other side and we'll just keep them
build<00:02:24.440> another<00:02:24.590> body<00:02:24.860> okay<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:25.610> come<00:02:25.819> around

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
build another body okay so come around

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.520 
build another body okay so come around
to<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.180> back<00:02:26.209> just<00:02:26.360> good<00:02:26.690> place<00:02:26.870> these<00:02:27.050> side

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
to the back just good place these side

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.970 
to the back just good place these side
parts<00:02:27.830> here<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.690> you've<00:02:29.780> got<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.080> hapless

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
parts here so you've got this hapless

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.559 
parts here so you've got this hapless
slab<00:02:31.640> here<00:02:31.850> then<00:02:31.970> you've<00:02:32.060> got<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> full<00:02:32.239> block

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
slab here then you've got a full block

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.150 
slab here then you've got a full block
in<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.019> it's<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.200> something<00:02:33.470> up<00:02:33.590> off<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.799> are

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
in and it's just something up off of are

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.180 
in and it's just something up off of are
these<00:02:34.340> two<00:02:34.549> it's<00:02:35.420> two<00:02:35.630> here<00:02:35.870> as<00:02:36.019> well<00:02:36.230> just
