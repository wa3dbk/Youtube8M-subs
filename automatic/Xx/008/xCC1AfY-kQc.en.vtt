00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello to all today we will see 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.610
 how to draw a sosinski icon and 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.400
 so we'll do three tutorials that one 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.140
 it's the first one so we're going 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.520
 on a relatively simple icon in 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.119
 a first time you open your 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.380
 software whose kim script you are using 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.720
 a default document it's going to be a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.230
 format a4 and then we will start with 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.020
 open the layers palette and then the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.260
 pallet filling are two pallets 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.379
 that we use frequently 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 so we'll take them away 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.600
 icon pattern so whose files 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.370
 imported here we will resize in 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.760
 Now the control key down to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.910
 way to legs deform the image 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.710
 and then we go a little bit played in a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.780
 first time we will create a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.609
 layer one so as to isolate the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.840
 elements we will create a layer that will 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.159
 we use to draw in fact 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.810
 the yellow background 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.689
 so I'm going to call it yellow all 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.090
 simply and then I'm going I 'm already doing 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.030
 actually went looking for my color 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.840
 so here I am recovering by the pipette the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.930
 default color of the icon and then 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.380
 via the tool rector jedessine en 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.380
 background 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.579
 so then I can hide this call 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.960
 that is the whole point of creating 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.659
 layers actually we can really isolate 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.920
 the elements the masks and easily 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.380
 and then I go a little zoom is 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.150
 a way to have because I am 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.700
 now drawn actually this eye 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.090
 this form so the same I will add 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.530
 a call that I call form then I'm going 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.630
 to fetch 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.700
 so the short run of beziers so for 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.820
 use the plot to deflect it's 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 simple if you make a single click 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.509
 you connect your fists by 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.580
 straight lines if by clicking 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.259
 you hold down left click and 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.280
 you move the mouse you create some 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.229
 tangents so you get to do some 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.320
 curves here I close the form 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.200
 and then I'll actually draw 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.120
 a circle that I will come to place at 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.770
 center because in fact it's the eye in 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.650
 it's a form that goes 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.160
 to be punched and emptied by the center 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.920
 so I create a circle and then I 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.390
 am going to use the path combination 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.340
 for actually they have served themselves 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.250
 to punch the shape that I just 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.650
 draw so I start with 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.450
 select the first form and then the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.640
 circle because the circle to come 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.880
 punch this first form and 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.560
 then in path I will create a 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.239
 difference here's so I punched my 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.300
 form so here I have more than one a 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.550
 only form instead of having two objects 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.350
 which allows me to be able to manage the 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.810
 filling and contours easier 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.549
 I will come now draw the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.860
 central shape so the same I draw a 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.959
 circle so roughly the size here 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.200
 I center it we know it has seen moreover 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.329
 I really do things quickly 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.880
 and then I'm actually going to duplicate this 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.140
 circle that I will then reduce 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.940
 always with the control key 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.760
 now darken I place it in light 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.480
 shift and I 'm going to finish punch 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.540
 with the small circle 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:21.239
 the first form so I have a species 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.260
 of moon that simulates a reflection here is good 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.630
 now I will resume the first 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.600
 form i'm going to remove moncontour and then 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.519
 especially add a fund way to see 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.430
 the same as the second form and 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.459
 I will come 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.810
 bind these two forms so at union the 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.640
 two forms I have more than one form so 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.700
 like that if I need to change the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.290
 color is fast I take the form 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.519
 I'm going so I go into a fund and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.239
 then I can change the color 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.950
 quickly here and I can hide for 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.480
 look if I'm pretty good ben 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.209
 if I needed to edit the plot 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.480
 I can actually remodel point 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.790
 by point the form it is if you have 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.750
 followed a little bit related tutorials 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.609
 previous you know how to do 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.530
 that's when I'm a 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.790
 little bit planted because my shapes 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.629
 they are not quite in the good 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.510
 time so I need to change 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:14.409
 the order of my tracing I am a 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.409
 little bit of order in there 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:25.030
 so yes yes I do not want fame 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.360
 who I think is that I think his 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.800
 trained counselors well above jones 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.449
 and good nickel here is so if I mask 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.949
 the starting image 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.199
 the starting matrix image that was 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.690
 in fact my model is good I'm going 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.090
 now closed my cam i'm going to open 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.129
 at least my palette aligned so 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.479
 to be able to select my background 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.599
 yellow and my form 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.449
 and then aligned in its first 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.750
 horizontally then vertically tak 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.940
 tak like that I'm stalled pile hair 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.159
 so the idea is that if I need to 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.530
 change the color of my background 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.860
 it's super fast and the same for the 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.650
 form 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.000
 so that's the ideal I can grow from where 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.979
 the interest of using a software of 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.539
 vector drawing 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.120
 I'm not dependent on the 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.750
 resolution my drawing here so we 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.789
 remains to save my work 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.919
 and then to thank you for having followed 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:31.259
 my tutorial here I hope that you 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.259
 will help soon
