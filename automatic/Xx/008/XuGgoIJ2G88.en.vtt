out fixing this spot in the landscape is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.900 
out fixing this spot in the landscape is
possibly<00:00:42.470> pretty<00:00:42.830> typical<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.580> something

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
possibly pretty typical of something

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.090 
possibly pretty typical of something
that<00:00:43.940> might<00:00:44.030> be<00:00:44.300> going<00:00:44.540> on<00:00:44.660> in<00:00:44.840> yours<00:00:45.110> I<00:00:45.350> see<00:00:46.070> a

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
that might be going on in yours I see a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.450 
that might be going on in yours I see a
lot<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.340> bare<00:00:46.850> areas<00:00:47.150> here<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.070> at<00:00:49.070> first

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
lot of bare areas here and at first

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.490 
lot of bare areas here and at first
glance<00:00:49.970> it<00:00:50.300> could<00:00:50.450> be<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.630> lot<00:00:51.020> of<00:00:51.080> different

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
glance it could be a lot of different

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.870 
glance it could be a lot of different
things<00:00:51.530> but<00:00:51.890> considering<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.430> fact<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.730> we

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
things but considering the fact that we

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.640 
things but considering the fact that we
have<00:00:53.060> these<00:00:53.090> trees<00:00:53.570> here<00:00:53.810> that<00:00:54.050> block<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.290> lot

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
have these trees here that block a lot

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.950 
have these trees here that block a lot
of<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.920> Sun<00:00:55.160> pretty<00:00:56.150> fair<00:00:56.360> assumption<00:00:56.720> that's

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
of the Sun pretty fair assumption that's

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.620 
of the Sun pretty fair assumption that's
just<00:00:57.230> not<00:00:57.410> getting<00:00:57.650> enough<00:00:57.860> and<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:58.910> we<00:00:59.480> need

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
just not getting enough and so we need

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.940 
just not getting enough and so we need
to<00:00:59.720> work<00:00:59.900> with<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.080> a<00:01:00.230> little<00:01:00.530> bit<00:01:00.650> there's<00:01:00.890> a

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
to work with that a little bit there's a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.380 
to work with that a little bit there's a
couple<00:01:01.100> ways<00:01:01.280> we<00:01:01.550> could<00:01:01.670> do<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:01.970> first<00:01:02.210> of<00:01:02.330> all

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
couple ways we could do it first of all

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.119 
couple ways we could do it first of all
we<00:01:02.480> can<00:01:02.510> cut<00:01:02.720> down<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.050> tree<00:01:03.290> I<00:01:03.470> don't<00:01:03.890> think<00:01:03.950> I

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
we can cut down the tree I don't think I

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.310 
we can cut down the tree I don't think I
really<00:01:04.369> want<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.640> do<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:05.020> second<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.080> all<00:01:06.170> we

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
really want to do that second of all we

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.630 
really want to do that second of all we
could<00:01:06.409> try<00:01:06.619> a<00:01:06.650> little<00:01:06.890> bit<00:01:07.070> more<00:01:07.220> shade

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
could try a little bit more shade

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.459 
could try a little bit more shade
resistant<00:01:08.240> grass<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.749> I<00:01:08.780> think<00:01:08.869> that<00:01:09.200> might<00:01:09.439> be

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
resistant grass so I think that might be

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.560 
resistant grass so I think that might be
a<00:01:09.649> good<00:01:09.710> solution<00:01:10.100> in<00:01:10.549> order<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.210> work<00:01:11.390> with

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
a good solution in order to work with

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.569 
a good solution in order to work with
that<00:01:11.749> okay<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:12.710> how<00:01:12.859> do<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.009> get<00:01:13.159> that<00:01:13.310> grass

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
that okay so how do you get that grass

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.399 
that okay so how do you get that grass
into<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.969> ground<00:01:14.210> it's<00:01:14.539> a<00:01:14.749> step-by-step

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
into the ground it's a step-by-step

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.620 
into the ground it's a step-by-step
process<00:01:15.649> really<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:17.060> first<00:01:17.210> thing<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:17.450> want

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
process really the first thing you want

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.899 
process really the first thing you want
to<00:01:17.659> do<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:18.079> get<00:01:18.320> some<00:01:18.590> bare<00:01:18.890> soil<00:01:19.219> showing<00:01:19.789> now

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
to do is get some bare soil showing now

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.730 
to do is get some bare soil showing now
in<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:20.179> area<00:01:20.539> we've<00:01:20.749> got<00:01:20.960> some<00:01:21.259> bare<00:01:21.499> soil

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
in this area we've got some bare soil

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.529 
in this area we've got some bare soil
showing<00:01:22.189> what<00:01:22.670> we've<00:01:22.789> also<00:01:22.909> got<00:01:23.179> a<00:01:23.210> bunch<00:01:23.420> of

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
showing what we've also got a bunch of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.749 
showing what we've also got a bunch of
dead<00:01:23.719> plants<00:01:24.020> I'm<00:01:24.920> going<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.159> want<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.399> rip<00:01:25.579> out

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
dead plants I'm going to want to rip out

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.690

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.120 
the dead plants but also you know kind
of<00:01:28.759> fluff<00:01:29.090> up<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.329> bare<00:01:29.659> soil<00:01:29.960> it's<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.740> common

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
of fluff up the bare soil it's a common

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.340 
of fluff up the bare soil it's a common
misconception<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:32.539> bare<00:01:32.780> soil<00:01:33.049> is

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
misconception that this bare soil is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.609 
misconception that this bare soil is
already<00:01:33.770> ready<00:01:34.600> already<00:01:35.600> suitable<00:01:36.259> for

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
already ready already suitable for

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.709 
already ready already suitable for
throwing<00:01:36.950> seat<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.789> it<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:37.909> isn't<00:01:38.569> it

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
throwing seat on it and it just isn't it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.569 
throwing seat on it and it just isn't it
needs<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:39.109> be<00:01:39.229> roughed<00:01:39.770> up<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:40.100> little<00:01:40.130> bit<00:01:40.429> so

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
needs to be roughed up a little bit so

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.980 
needs to be roughed up a little bit so
that<00:01:40.609> seed<00:01:41.030> can<00:01:41.210> get<00:01:41.359> down<00:01:41.539> into<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.960> ground

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
that seed can get down into the ground

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.109 
that seed can get down into the ground
and<00:01:42.409> get<00:01:42.469> a<00:01:42.530> toehold<00:01:42.770> okay<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:43.639> that's<00:01:43.909> step

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
and get a toehold okay so that's step

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.359 
and get a toehold okay so that's step
number<00:01:44.179> one<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.020> can<00:01:45.229> use<00:01:45.259> a<00:01:45.439> power<00:01:45.889> rake<00:01:46.189> for

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
number one you can use a power rake for

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.770 
number one you can use a power rake for
that<00:01:46.490> if<00:01:46.670> it's<00:01:46.789> a<00:01:46.850> big<00:01:47.030> area<00:01:47.240> but<00:01:47.509> just<00:01:47.689> a

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
that if it's a big area but just a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.840 
that if it's a big area but just a
regular<00:01:47.990> stiff<00:01:48.439> tine<00:01:48.679> rate<00:01:48.920> can<00:01:49.399> work<00:01:49.609> for<00:01:49.789> a

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
regular stiff tine rate can work for a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.239 
regular stiff tine rate can work for a
small<00:01:49.999> patch<00:01:50.389> like<00:01:50.689> this<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.859> second<00:01:52.159> thing

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
small patch like this the second thing

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:53.590 
small patch like this the second thing
then<00:01:52.429> of<00:01:52.520> course<00:01:52.759> is<00:01:52.909> putting<00:01:53.209> them<00:01:53.299> out<00:01:53.420> the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
then of course is putting them out the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.719 
then of course is putting them out the
right<00:01:53.780> amount<00:01:54.049> of<00:01:54.170> seed<00:01:54.499> in<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.459> shade

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
right amount of seed in and a shade

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.609 
right amount of seed in and a shade
resistant<00:01:56.509> type<00:01:56.659> of<00:01:56.810> seed<00:01:56.990> for<00:01:57.469> this

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
resistant type of seed for this

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.679 
resistant type of seed for this
particular<00:01:58.159> problem<00:01:58.429> is<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> good<00:01:58.969> one<00:01:59.149> we

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
particular problem is a good one we

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.139 
particular problem is a good one we
could<00:01:59.840> be<00:01:59.929> using<00:02:00.079> some<00:02:00.439> fine<00:02:00.709> fescue<00:02:01.279> and<00:02:01.459> even

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
could be using some fine fescue and even

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.969 
could be using some fine fescue and even
the<00:02:02.240> turf<00:02:02.479> type<00:02:02.749> tall<00:02:03.049> fescues<00:02:03.529> work<00:02:03.740> pretty

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
the turf type tall fescues work pretty

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.099 
the turf type tall fescues work pretty
good<00:02:04.069> in<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.969> shade<00:02:05.209> so<00:02:05.420> we'll<00:02:05.569> be<00:02:05.659> using<00:02:05.869> that

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
good in the shade so we'll be using that

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.740 
good in the shade so we'll be using that
material<00:02:06.590> then<00:02:07.520> go<00:02:07.850> ahead<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.149> put<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:08.509> now

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
material then go ahead and put it on now

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.180 
material then go ahead and put it on now
usually<00:02:09.020> when<00:02:09.350> you're<00:02:09.500> seeding<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.950> drop

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
usually when you're seeding a drop

usually when you're seeding a drop
spreader<00:02:10.550> is<00:02:10.970> probably<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.480> best<00:02:11.720> material

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
spreader is probably the best material

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.170 
spreader is probably the best material
to<00:02:12.379> go<00:02:12.530> ahead<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.860> put<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:13.189> or<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:14.000> best

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
to go ahead and put in or the best

to go ahead and put in or the best
device<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.720> use<00:02:14.840> because<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.140> drops<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.040> seed

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
device to use because it drops the seed

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.900 
device to use because it drops the seed
low<00:02:16.549> to<00:02:16.610> the

up<00:02:21.920> by<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.160> wind<00:02:22.370> or<00:02:22.940> if<00:02:23.240> it's<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.480> an<00:02:23.600> area

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
up by the wind or if it's in an area

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.450 
up by the wind or if it's in an area
like<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.440> it's<00:02:24.560> not<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.710> very<00:02:24.890> windy<00:02:25.280> day

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
like this and it's not a very windy day

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.140 
like this and it's not a very windy day
if<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.450> hold<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:27.470> circle<00:02:28.310> circular<00:02:28.880> or

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
if you hold a a circle circular or

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.330 
if you hold a a circle circular or
rotary<00:02:29.600> handheld<00:02:30.170> spreader<00:02:30.620> low<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
rotary handheld spreader low to the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.680 
rotary handheld spreader low to the
ground<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.730> probably<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.210> very<00:02:32.480> similar

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
ground you probably have very similar

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.840 
ground you probably have very similar
results<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.890> point<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.310> make<00:02:34.520> sure<00:02:34.550> that

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
results so the point is make sure that

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.630 
results so the point is make sure that
the<00:02:35.030> sea<00:02:35.540> doesn't<00:02:35.930> drip<00:02:36.310> after<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.430> it's

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
the sea doesn't drip after that it's

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.130 
the sea doesn't drip after that it's
good<00:02:37.760> idea<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.090> go<00:02:38.210> back<00:02:38.390> over<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.870> area

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
good idea to go back over that area

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.860 
good idea to go back over that area
again<00:02:39.380> with<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.250> stiff<00:02:40.550> tine<00:02:40.790> rate<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.450> order<00:02:41.750> to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
again with a stiff tine rate in order to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.450 
again with a stiff tine rate in order to
just<00:02:42.080> work<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.470> seed<00:02:42.680> into<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.040> ground<00:02:43.070> a

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
just work the seed into the ground a

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.180 
just work the seed into the ground a
little<00:02:43.580> bit<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.540> way<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.990> can<00:02:45.260> really<00:02:46.040> be

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
little bit and that way it can really be

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.580 
little bit and that way it can really be
settled<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.420> course<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:47.870> like<00:02:48.200> any<00:02:48.380> other

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
settled in of course then like any other

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.110 
settled in of course then like any other
seed<00:02:48.890> you're<00:02:49.070> going<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.370> water<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.940> little

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
seed you're going to water it a little

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.320 
seed you're going to water it a little
bit<00:02:50.360> afterwards<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.440> with<00:02:51.710> grass<00:02:52.280> seed<00:02:52.580> light

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
bit afterwards and with grass seed light

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.960 
bit afterwards and with grass seed light
and<00:02:53.600> frequent<00:02:54.140> in<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.920> first<00:02:55.160> few<00:02:55.400> days<00:02:55.670> after

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
and frequent in the first few days after

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.750 
and frequent in the first few days after
seeding<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.720> really<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.530> key<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.980> then<00:02:58.640> of

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
seeding is really the key and then of

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.070 
seeding is really the key and then of
course<00:02:58.790> once<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.390> starts<00:02:59.630> growing<00:02:59.810> a<00:02:59.990> little

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
course once it starts growing a little

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.300 
course once it starts growing a little
bit<00:03:00.320> it's<00:03:00.440> going<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.590> be<00:03:00.710> hungry<00:03:00.860> it's<00:03:01.190> going

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
bit it's going to be hungry it's going

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.950 
bit it's going to be hungry it's going
to<00:03:01.370> need<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:01.520> little<00:03:01.640> bit<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.850> nutrition<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.450> a

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
to need a little bit of nutrition and a

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.290 
to need a little bit of nutrition and a
good<00:03:03.140> starter<00:03:03.500> fertilizer<00:03:03.680> will<00:03:04.640> really<00:03:04.970> fit

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
good starter fertilizer will really fit

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.630 
good starter fertilizer will really fit
the<00:03:05.360> bill
