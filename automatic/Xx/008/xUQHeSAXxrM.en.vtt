that<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> was<00:00:49.230> nice<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> little

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that and it was nice like in the little

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.459 
that and it was nice like in the little
villages<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.510> think<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:52.140> may<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
villages like I think there may be a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.439 
villages like I think there may be a
little<00:00:52.680> quieter<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> them<00:00:53.820> because<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
little quieter some of them because the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.760 
little quieter some of them because the
weather<00:00:54.600> wasn't<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.079> great<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.500> still

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
weather wasn't that great but still

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.500 
weather wasn't that great but still
there<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.010> people<00:00:56.370> coming<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.030> locals

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
there was people coming out like locals

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.479 
there was people coming out like locals
and<00:00:57.870> cheering<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.460> nice<00:01:00.289> and

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.119 
and cheering you on which was nice and
yeah<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.520> mean<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.539> hard<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> enjoy<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.860> views

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
yeah I mean it's hard to enjoy the views

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
yeah I mean it's hard to enjoy the views
particularly<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.570> know<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.750> you're

everyone<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.119> went<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:15.570> fast<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
everyone I went out pretty fast and I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
everyone I went out pretty fast and I
knew<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> wasn't<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.759> was

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
knew I wasn't going to because it was

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
knew I wasn't going to because it was
uphill<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.750> was<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> start<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.770> never

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
uphill and it was the start and I never

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.620 
uphill and it was the start and I never
go<00:01:20.159> fast<00:01:20.430> either<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.909> star<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.210> her<00:01:21.509> up

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
go fast either at the star on her up

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.730 
go fast either at the star on her up
hill<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:23.330> yeah<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> ran<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:24.869> more<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.439> go<00:01:25.530> Bev

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
hill and yeah I ran with more to go Bev

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800 
hill and yeah I ran with more to go Bev
sort<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.759> off<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.180> she<00:01:27.659> would

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
sort of on and off for a bit she would

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.440 
sort of on and off for a bit she would
tend<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.460> faster<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> downhills<00:01:30.210> like

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
tend to go faster on the downhills like

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.350 
tend to go faster on the downhills like
she<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:30.750> super<00:01:31.049> fast<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.909> kind<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
she was super fast so that I kind of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.289 
she was super fast so that I kind of
picked<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.900> early<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.909> we're

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
picked up on early on that like if we're

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.780 
picked up on early on that like if we're
close<00:01:36.630> towards<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.320> end<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.460> know<00:01:38.579> could

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
close towards the end I you know could

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.219 
close towards the end I you know could
potentially<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> need<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
potentially you know I need to be

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.929 
potentially you know I need to be
careful<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.799> there's<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.100> downhill<00:01:41.310> at<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> end

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
careful if there's a downhill at the end

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.060 
careful if there's a downhill at the end
because<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.740> didn't<00:01:43.920> catch

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
because I don't think I'm didn't catch

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.499 
because I don't think I'm didn't catch
her<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.549> also<00:01:44.670> taking<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> little

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
her but I was also taking it a little

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.870 
her but I was also taking it a little
easier<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.799> start<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.610> was<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
easier to start with because it was to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.719 
easier to start with because it was to
start<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> race<00:01:48.979> yeah<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.130> then<00:01:50.280> when<00:01:50.490> there

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
start the race yeah and then when there

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.310 
start the race yeah and then when there
were<00:01:50.850> flattered<00:01:51.270> sections<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.200> were

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
were flattered sections which there were

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.899 
were flattered sections which there were
a<00:01:52.350> fair<00:01:52.710> chunk<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.579> runnable<00:01:54.450> sections

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
a fair chunk of like runnable sections

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.789 
a fair chunk of like runnable sections
that's<00:01:56.539> obviously<00:01:56.960> where<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.200> tried<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.649> put

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
that's obviously where I tried to put

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.160 
that's obviously where I tried to put
speed<00:01:58.159> in<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.880> felt<00:01:59.179> pretty<00:01:59.390> slow<00:01:59.840> on<00:02:00.049> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
speed in and I felt pretty slow on the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.279 
speed in and I felt pretty slow on the
hills<00:02:00.229> i<00:02:00.859> am<00:02:01.609> not<00:02:01.850> quite<00:02:02.119> sure<00:02:02.179> if<00:02:02.420> my<00:02:02.780> uphill

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
hills i am not quite sure if my uphill

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.690 
hills i am not quite sure if my uphill
training<00:02:03.799> has<00:02:03.920> paid<00:02:04.219> off<00:02:05.380> yeah<00:02:06.609> there's<00:02:07.609> also

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
training has paid off yeah there's also

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.170 
training has paid off yeah there's also
quite<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:08.000> bit<00:02:08.269> of<00:02:08.420> uphill<00:02:08.920> there<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.429> yeah<00:02:10.970> I've

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
quite a bit of uphill there is yeah I've

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.330 
quite a bit of uphill there is yeah I've
not<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.930> say<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.140> haven't<00:02:12.709> even<00:02:12.890> looked<00:02:13.129> at

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
not I have say I haven't even looked at

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.339 
not I have say I haven't even looked at
the<00:02:13.430> staff<00:02:13.670> I've<00:02:13.970> downloaded<00:02:14.269> my<00:02:14.720> garments<00:02:15.230> I

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
the staff I've downloaded my garments I

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.080 
the staff I've downloaded my garments I
I<00:02:15.560> mean<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.950> was<00:02:16.010> meant<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.310> be<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.700> think<00:02:16.879> five

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
I mean it was meant to be I think five

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.670 
I mean it was meant to be I think five
thousand<00:02:17.540> nine<00:02:17.629> hundred<00:02:17.660> meters<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.590> ascent

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
thousand nine hundred meters of ascent

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.059 
thousand nine hundred meters of ascent
it<00:02:19.549> was<00:02:19.879> obviously<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.900> think<00:02:21.200> considerably

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
it was obviously I think considerably

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.479 
it was obviously I think considerably
less<00:02:22.340> than<00:02:22.549> that<00:02:22.670> but<00:02:22.940> I'm<00:02:23.000> not<00:02:23.150> sure<00:02:23.180> how<00:02:23.540> much

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
less than that but I'm not sure how much

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.319 
less than that but I'm not sure how much
yeah<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.790> middle<00:02:26.060> maybe<00:02:26.269> about<00:02:27.220> 45<00:02:28.220> 50<00:02:28.610> k<00:02:29.000> I

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
yeah in the middle maybe about 45 50 k I

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.600 
yeah in the middle maybe about 45 50 k I
felt<00:02:30.079> I<00:02:30.230> was<00:02:30.379> going<00:02:30.560> very<00:02:30.620> slowly<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.340> couple

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
felt I was going very slowly in a couple

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.410 
felt I was going very slowly in a couple
of<00:02:31.640> days<00:02:31.700> overtook<00:02:32.540> me<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:34.940> don't<00:02:35.150> think<00:02:35.269> I

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
of days overtook me but I don't think I

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.589 
of days overtook me but I don't think I
lost<00:02:35.569> really<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.500> guess<00:02:36.769> that<00:02:37.010> much<00:02:37.220> ground<00:02:37.599> can

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
lost really I guess that much ground can

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.660 
lost really I guess that much ground can
you<00:02:38.989> can<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:39.769> Matt<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.069> originally<00:02:40.489> signed

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
you can you Matt you originally signed

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.490 
you can you Matt you originally signed
up<00:02:40.819> for<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.120> fall<00:02:41.329> voltage<00:02:41.989> element<00:02:42.349> bowl

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
up for the fall voltage element bowl

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.430 
up for the fall voltage element bowl
yeah<00:02:42.879> what<00:02:43.879> are<00:02:43.940> your<00:02:44.030> thoughts<00:02:44.180> about<00:02:44.440> that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
yeah what are your thoughts about that

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.380 
yeah what are your thoughts about that
whole<00:02:45.709> distance<00:02:46.220> on<00:02:46.430> his<00:02:46.790> train<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:49.549> now<00:02:50.209> I've

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
whole distance on his train and now I've

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.030 
whole distance on his train and now I've
definitely<00:02:50.569> got<00:02:50.840> more<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.109> a<00:02:51.200> feel<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.470> what

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
definitely got more of a feel of what

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.339 
definitely got more of a feel of what
it's<00:02:52.099> like<00:02:52.430> obviously<00:02:53.060> yeah<00:02:53.359> it's<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.230> huge

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
it's like obviously yeah it's a huge

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.289 
it's like obviously yeah it's a huge
amount<00:02:55.040> difference<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:55.609> don't<00:02:55.819> think<00:02:56.150> I

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
amount difference and I don't think I

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.640 
amount difference and I don't think I
think<00:02:56.569> it's<00:02:56.720> easy<00:02:56.840> for<00:02:57.019> people<00:02:57.440> not<00:02:57.620> to

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
think it's easy for people not to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.720 
think it's easy for people not to
appreciate<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.900> like<00:02:59.900> utmb<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.470> actually<00:03:00.769> 168

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
appreciate it like utmb is actually 168

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.680 
appreciate it like utmb is actually 168

k or erase CCC's meant to be 100 k ended
up<00:03:05.810> i<00:03:06.019> think<00:03:06.049> being

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
up i think being

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.339 
up i think being
about<00:03:07.780> 92<00:03:08.409> or<00:03:08.439> so<00:03:08.859> so<00:03:09.370> it's<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:10.000> lot<00:03:10.359> longer<00:03:10.900> like

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
about 92 or so so it's a lot longer like

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.050 
about 92 or so so it's a lot longer like
we're<00:03:11.530> not<00:03:11.680> talking<00:03:11.980> about<00:03:12.159> hey<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.939> know

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.149 
we're not talking about hey you know
just<00:03:13.450> another<00:03:13.750> 60<00:03:14.290> k<00:03:14.439> it's<00:03:14.650> probably<00:03:14.950> more

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
just another 60 k it's probably more

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.220 
just another 60 k it's probably more
like<00:03:15.400> another<00:03:15.989> 70<00:03:16.989> or<00:03:17.140> class<00:03:17.769> cake<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:19.599> would

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
like another 70 or class cake I would

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.690 
like another 70 or class cake I would
like<00:03:20.379> to<00:03:20.439> do<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.859> it's<00:03:20.980> not<00:03:21.129> that<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.310> don't<00:03:21.400> like

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
maybe I still need more practice at it

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.099 
maybe I still need more practice at it
this<00:03:27.760> was<00:03:27.969> good<00:03:28.239> practice<00:03:28.569> learning<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:31.109> yeah

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109
