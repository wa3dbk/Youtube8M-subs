00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.370
 to watch bike material is fine he 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.030
 cycled wonderfully automatic shifting 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.030
 really a great bike 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.970
 no idea of the weight 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.950
 that you carry on your bike 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.850
 he is just very strong 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.850
 management could cycle 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.000
 you really have a super beautiful and yes me 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.000
 like it better than me too 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.610
 the Dutch designer Jan Gunneweg is 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.400
 crazy about wood it inspired him to it 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.480
 design of a unique wooden bicycle 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.950
 epee 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.950
 wonderful to ride 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.040
 wonderful to 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.110
 from the moment I can walk yes 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.870
 I'm already working on wood and I have one first 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.180
 small beans built afterwards 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.250
 cabins built and and mine and so is 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.390
 something arose on caliper 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.860
 it soon became clear that it was from 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.860
 very good bikes are ours 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.990
 how solid it was and yes, almost ten 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.590
 so I have my first wooden bike for years 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.260
 he has now wanted to move the time 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.410
 the strength of the flexibility they love 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.350
 heat also on the yes the power 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.729
 this is a huge job 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.220
 it excited me for that old bike 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:29.350
 was huge big yes then I will see if 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.000
 we can do a little more with that 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.310
 used to be incredibly nice for something 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.830
 I had developed myself by building 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.160
 to nothing beautiful that people like 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.160
 can enjoy 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.670
 the first time I tattoo on the bike 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.400
 have that feeling so confirm this is one 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.860
 kind of happiness the you the ball this is 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.800
 this is so different 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.600
 so special maybe there is feeling too 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.180
 as if we took it too 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.979
 if slogan be moved by nature it is 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.979
 they have roughly helped nature 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.760
 bicycle is produced by comfort 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.700
 woodwork in staphorst 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.000
 the cyclists made from in country 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.520
 French oak when we were naturally one 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.570
 bike that will last for years and years and then 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.480
 will you come out? 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.110
 soak and it is sustainable wood comes out 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.510
 France 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.220
 sustainably managed forests and simply whole 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.320
 well resistant to the loot and 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.030
 weather conditions 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.130
 then just come to our company 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.489
 doing and keeping piles was shifting 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.560
 the wood is granted 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.000
 we make it the frame in two parts 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.570
 you will be directed to our computer 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.840
 machines where in your ass learn two 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.800
 built up means that those two parts 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.480
 not everyone 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.910
 as a natural product are separate 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.360
 powers have been granted from one 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.340
 large thick part and therefore each other's 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.690
 lifting forces and together a huge one 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.690
 stable frame formation 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.260
 more whose loving vision i think 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.620
 nevertheless that it is from real European oak 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:16.680
 wood is it is keeps it has live 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.680
 something primal feeling comes back a bit 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.150
 due to its natural appearance the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.400
 bike not only suitable for the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.500
 private market also very interesting 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.480
 for business 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.650
 for example, there are 16 bicycles on it 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.319
 Schiphol 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.200
 you can use to make appointments 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.469
 appointment to cycle or own and terminal 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.939
 lens cycle 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.579
 it's also had to draw them sting 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:45.359
 from neighboring mine it's a statement from 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:48.019
 otherwise dare just think the world 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.019
 change 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.620
 there are disbelief many aspects each 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.629
 moment when we deliver and bicycles 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.669
 we do not yet know what will happen 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.590
 with the bike only one thing know that 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.689
 it becomes a kind of oil slick every time 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.730
 gets bigger gets a big brakes and 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:06.510
 which ignites other people 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.239
 because yes very special 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.780
 the construction biker that is someone who has the courage 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:17.659
 has to get on a bike but 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.659
 everyone amazement to lose
