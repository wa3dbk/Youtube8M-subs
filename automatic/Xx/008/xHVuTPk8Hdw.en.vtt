moment<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.320> we'll<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.470> look<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.860> man

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
moment so we'll have a look for a man

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.740 
moment so we'll have a look for a man
who<00:01:17.159> fits<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.939> same<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.479> two<00:01:18.720> three

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
who fits is the same one one two three

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.620 
who fits is the same one one two three
and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.500> four<00:01:19.680> five<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.400> back<00:01:20.630> probably

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and then four five at the back probably

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.929 
and then four five at the back probably
won't<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> probably<00:01:22.110> balled<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.500> completely

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
won't be I probably balled up completely

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.810 
won't be I probably balled up completely
so<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.780> stong<00:01:25.380> key<00:01:25.590> staff<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so then we have a stong key staff with a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.560 
so then we have a stong key staff with a
comb<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.080> buneary<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.820> golden<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570

bad<00:01:34.409> space<00:01:34.759> speed<00:01:35.759> Stadium<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:37.400> reverse<00:01:38.400> holo

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
bad space speed Stadium a reverse holo

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.300 
bad space speed Stadium a reverse holo
cking<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:40.740> non<00:01:41.100> hollow<00:01:41.430> bit<00:01:41.820> allow<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.570> is

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
cking and a non hollow bit allow this is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.630 
cking and a non hollow bit allow this is
so<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> guess<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.180> too<00:01:45.390> bad<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:47.090> centre-backs

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640
