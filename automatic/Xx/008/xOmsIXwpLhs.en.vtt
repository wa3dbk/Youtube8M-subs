00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.580
 yes started when I was 15 years old 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.650
 yes the biggest winners no guitar can be a full here 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.860
 because the highest goal 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 prevent a major win 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.719
 it can't play, of course, but good, so real and organ piece 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.019
 then of course beatles beatles collision but 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.460
 the reality is 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.630
 the owner of the winter games in vancouver with 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.070
 Hussein 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.070
 however, complaints arrived 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.010
 what you are not allowed to see if you see further inside is still too little 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.070
 but that was definitely my concern this day 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.540
 he recently expressed a number of berths and the low sun has and 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.540
 of course 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.410
 is going to happen 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.030
 always great 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.219
 but then again the titles of course later 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.560
 idols 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.090
 yes I think too far a nice piece of garden but one day and that is actually one 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.680
 never turn around yourself 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.879
 hotel room for rich even a little sperm 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.509
 it is not actually places 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.509
 I may have I was not so beautiful 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.589
 and they especially wore apple beautifully 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.489
 yes and it's very weird 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.899
 if it pulls all the way but now, for example 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:55.590
 the court now also a few years ago but that is not really 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.529
 the last where I make it you want that from me 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:02:59.679
 and that is 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.949
 an hour 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.369
 I do that is good for that I did not know who it was 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:09.399
 but and it is I hear the uefa cup to turn on the car radio 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.629
 so well produced especially 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.019
 also a nice one will make the production started 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.679
 and the fia it is the number of britney players 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:20.930
 I'm your baby one more time 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.760
 it is fun 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.039
 I have a 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:26.299
 and all booklet boxes written last year 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.620
 m yes and 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.949
 the greeks link 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.849
 it's the moment that I can 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.869
 A man in Rotterdam wants to save his life because he is with another 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:39.329
 trend that ticks the disease lights and I read in your eyes 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.699
 from that man the concern the loneliness 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.559
 not on the same day 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:49.289
 the single tip about support to want to avoid girlfriend and with my whole 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:53.029
 family i went to buy that sentence of britney's pierce that i wanted there 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:53.899
 buy and 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.649
 they thought it was so terrible that I loved it 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.649
 and in the car on the return trip 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:05.019
 since that time there are ten weeks to sing along, they became something 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.559
 nauseous 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.509
 until I become one sentence on one 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.659
 whatever the time in your eyes of that old man was ridiculous, then one after the other 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.219
 the service 7 this is the first one in 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:19.219
 but three people who screening in that old man 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.250
 the politically big one took a look for that trend that I have I also saw that 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.460
 I also could not see clearly what it already was 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.520
 but I was afterwards 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.419
 but login has appeared in lonely man 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.319
 I thought that actually brought everything together all that day 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.849
 then they the one customer the songs 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.559
 a british your muscles x i know started i do what i do i am me 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.509
 ad 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.509
 I'd say we should listen 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.699
 participate 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.219
 this to stand 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.750
 through the work of god no more 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.630
 m actually strange enough to see that number also not in bass town one 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.629
 moment not only the element that I compete heavily 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.189
 that was incredibly good at the time, well put together was played well at 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.800
 the fall 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.900
 and then to give up as a market in the girl's hedge last week 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.080
 really so awful 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.550
 so that is a whim but well that whim it there I also like 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.830
 suspect to hold on to what you did on the subject 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.380
 and yes right there at the moment I have to say I don't really have it 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.639
 call it the favorite 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.960
 I am unfortunately not so much to radio and 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.289
 for that matter music it is very weird 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.289
 I also couldn't really tell anything 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.580
 what is right now and a huge favorite for me there are what 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.960
 reality I don't know I find you in some worries singer songwriters 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.849
 this moment 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.639
 interested I want to be called 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.029
 or I do very good things and I thought the man was over 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.919
 twente like a few titles a bit or I know a lot of pigeons 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.650
 i was a little bit 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.050
 from quickenborne 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.790
 but it is not being no longer knew day by week especially he came up with 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.509
 you know what i thought you just pull me 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.019
 so I have to go there again
