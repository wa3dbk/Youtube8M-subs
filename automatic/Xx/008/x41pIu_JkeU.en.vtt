00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
love it as well it's a little bit

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.460 
love it as well it's a little bit
overexposed<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:30.709> that's<00:02:31.709> pretty<00:02:32.099> much<00:02:32.220> it

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
overexposed but that's pretty much it

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.460 
overexposed but that's pretty much it
that<00:02:34.470> I've<00:02:34.739> still<00:02:35.010> got<00:02:35.099> my<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.489> knee<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:36.470> so

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
that's a bit depressing but he seems to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.970 
that's a bit depressing but he seems to
be<00:02:40.500> doing<00:02:40.530> all<00:02:40.799> right

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
be doing all right

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.390 
be doing all right
actually<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:42.470> my<00:02:43.470> pregnant<00:02:43.860> guppy<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.280> can

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
actually and my pregnant guppy you can

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.990 
actually and my pregnant guppy you can
see<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.700> my<00:02:44.849> female<00:02:45.269> up<00:02:45.720> there<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:47.700> mouths

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
see that my female up there and I mouths

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.650 
see that my female up there and I mouths
looking<00:02:48.420> really<00:02:48.780> nice<00:02:48.989> as<00:02:49.500> well<00:02:50.390> as<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.540> can

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
looking really nice as well as you can

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.410 
looking really nice as well as you can
see<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:52.079> very<00:02:52.319> active<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.269> weird

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
see is very active and that's weird

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.930 
see is very active and that's weird
because<00:02:54.510> they're<00:02:54.810> all<00:02:54.930> grouping<00:02:55.500> together

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
because they're all grouping together

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.979 
because they're all grouping together
for<00:02:56.940> some<00:02:57.150> reason<00:02:57.510> they<00:02:57.660> don't<00:02:57.810> really

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
for some reason they don't really

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.470 
for some reason they don't really
summarize<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> tank<00:02:58.890> as<00:02:59.190> much<00:02:59.849> as<00:03:00.030> they<00:03:00.120> used<00:03:00.299> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
summarize a tank as much as they used to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.199 
summarize a tank as much as they used to
maybe<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.890> change<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> new

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
maybe it's just the change of the new

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.110 
maybe it's just the change of the new
background<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:04.489> think<00:03:05.489> it's<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:05.879> that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
background and I think it's like that

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.420 
background and I think it's like that
but<00:03:06.390> yeah<00:03:07.349> they<00:03:07.500> would<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.980> they<00:03:08.280> get

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
but yeah they would like to they get

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.640 
but yeah they would like to they get
they<00:03:08.609> all<00:03:08.700> get<00:03:08.849> along<00:03:08.940> quite<00:03:09.209> well<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:10.410> Rams

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
they all get along quite well the Rams

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.550 
they all get along quite well the Rams
