00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
all of the insulation I'm gonna put over

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.890 
all of the insulation I'm gonna put over
the<00:02:46.519> greenhouse<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.180> around<00:02:47.480> as<00:02:47.599> you<00:02:47.660> can<00:02:47.780> see

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the greenhouse and around as you can see

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.800 
the greenhouse and around as you can see
I<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.940> reflective<00:02:49.940> insulation<00:02:50.299> on<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
I have this reflective insulation on the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.369 
I have this reflective insulation on the
inside<00:02:51.489> that<00:02:52.489> will<00:02:52.700> keep<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.480> beds<00:02:53.690> warmer

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.250 

the<00:02:59.010> fishtank<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.939> us<00:03:00.090> down<00:03:00.299> here<00:03:00.569> foolish

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
the fishtank is us down here foolish

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.699 
the fishtank is us down here foolish
they<00:03:01.829> continue<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.730> eat<00:03:02.939> and<00:03:03.569> be<00:03:04.290> real<00:03:04.469> happy

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
they continue to eat and be real happy

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.699 
they continue to eat and be real happy
at<00:03:05.069> about<00:03:05.310> 76<00:03:05.819> degrees

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
at about 76 degrees

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.199 
at about 76 degrees
so<00:03:07.709> they<00:03:08.159> seem<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.519> doing<00:03:08.760> well<00:03:08.909> you<00:03:09.090> can

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
so they seem to be doing well you can

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.699 
so they seem to be doing well you can
see<00:03:09.329> I<00:03:09.359> have<00:03:10.549> girl<00:03:11.549> lights<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.999> here<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.480> are

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
see I have girl lights in here that are

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.349 
see I have girl lights in here that are
keeping<00:03:13.709> things<00:03:13.889> really<00:03:14.310> warm<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:14.760> toasty<00:03:14.969> in

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.699 
keeping things really warm and toasty in
here<00:03:15.389> now<00:03:17.900> certainly<00:03:18.900> these<00:03:19.170> lights<00:03:19.439> don't

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
here now certainly these lights don't

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.509 
here now certainly these lights don't
stay<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:21.170> 24<00:03:22.170> hours<00:03:22.409> a<00:03:22.439> day<00:03:22.530> but<00:03:23.159> they're<00:03:23.400> just

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
kind of kind of make up for the shorter

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.830 
kind of kind of make up for the shorter
days<00:03:35.069> that<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.430> have<00:03:35.609> on<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.000> wrong<00:03:36.569> side<00:03:36.810> so

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
I'm still letting in natural light to

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.670 
I'm still letting in natural light to
really<00:03:44.419> grow<00:03:45.419> all<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.750> plants<00:03:46.079> in<00:03:46.139> here<00:03:46.319> so

happening with the with the Greenleaf

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.580 
happening with the with the Greenleaf
aquaponics<00:03:53.459> system<00:03:53.849> in<00:03:54.000> our<00:03:54.120> backyard<00:03:54.599> it's

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
aquaponics system in our backyard it's

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.890 
aquaponics system in our backyard it's
definitely<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.159> project<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.510> it's<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.689> fair
