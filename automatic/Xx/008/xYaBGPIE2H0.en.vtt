00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.450
 his heart bent on new comments 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.370
 a canal 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.770
 I welcome you today right again 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.470
 welcome to the new comments and no 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.150
 it's not like a comment what I mean 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 actually still so about topics 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.010
 Today it's about the tactics team 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.570
 deathmatch yes and we have one 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 to stir up the gameplay 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.369
 nice fabi so a good friend 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.350
 you have some gameplay from me 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.570
 the trainer has ski properly and it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.390
 to stir up and to the classical nothing because 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.390
 I also talk about the tactics 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.450
 Great what the perfect free and so on 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.640
 continue driving at the maps or 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.219
 just once at the fashion team 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.210
 deathmatch team will be deathmatch 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.699
 months do not know you have to 7500 points 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.609
 I believe that bill through 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.859
 gravel per opponent 100 points I think so 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.699
 exactly 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.950
 and yes you have to stop it right 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.510
 master and there are no questions 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.750
 no bombs or anything else 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.210
 So it's only two tables and yes 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.220
 love color has a beautiful well 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.740
 a beautiful moore plays with his 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 tactics I actually personally good 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.100
 for beginners, they are not so on the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.189
 not no wall in procuring it 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.710
 just so it does not say bad 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.600
 mohr so ​​far is not so important 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.290
 not at all important but nothing 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.479
 no matter 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.820
 In any case , he will become a tactician 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.979
 Looks nice here a and bs with it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.189
 I mean now the two things where he 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.320
 running back and forth and at a like 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.020
 For example, longer time is on 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.210
 was then I do a lot of kills boah there 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.340
 I'll stay mine who will not 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.340
 I make my say a few writhes 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.450
 but I say that has to do with tactics 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.799
 and that's no joke for Ampfing 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.229
 This tactic is super he is not a 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.319
 at the beginning but he uses tactics because he 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.450
 just has liked and yes I'm just 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.100
 always a tactic and as you can see 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.020
 he runs 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.150
 always back and forth sometimes countries again 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.890
 back was that i just think that 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.860
 is just my position there can 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.210
 not hot and on the map mission 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.610
 is that just beautiful with the 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.110
 long walk with the smaller gears goes 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.020
 that just beautiful 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.710
 he really fits another one on the other 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.990
 left aisle 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.500
 and yes he always tries 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.850
 on the right, but he knows that's the one 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.650
 come from the left so why should it 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.720
 then I do mine who will do that though 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.830
 he knows that there are some on the left and 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.350
 who will then turn right and 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.530
 then maybe die behind 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.060
 after 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.290
 nobody will forgive that 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.240
 can be something to weapons 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.500
 I would say something with the weapon 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.450
 you should be able to play best too 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.660
 play it does not bring anything if you have one 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.680
 girlfriend wants to prove something 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.560
 some can be good with any weapon 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.170
 i do not play mine that bad and bad 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.680
 he plays here with the m1 16 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.360
 affiris the same or three with 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.060
 silencers I personally find synonymous 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.380
 but it is not that wet 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.640
 it is necessary , but sometimes I am 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.200
 only sometimes if I really have one 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.870
 I play mobile games with me 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.510
 simply with the weapon the team 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.130
 because yes then I still like to play parts 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.890
 Spheres did that very well 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.800
 I could also recommend for sportback 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.960
 concept deficit is not too much and should 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.590
 quite good but I personally soundtrack 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.270
 not so much 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.440
 or I do not like the weapon too much 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.720
 I said as before 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.910
 favorite throws best choose the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.050
 Most of us now ca or a pc or pp 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.390
 I believe it to be 90 or more 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.500
 g36 he also counts hardly any delay or ak 74 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.390
 as they are called 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.630
 fr 9 or that one is not so 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.240
 at all on akin 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.830
 yes what so far about secondary 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.230
 I can really weapon you such a weapon 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.850
 I'll call her a little girl 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:16.570
 actually that's crazy again 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:17.590
 going off main fm g9 is strong anyway 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.560
 in my opinion even stronger 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.080
 sometimes at a distance it goes off like 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.870
 schmidts cat even if such a small one 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.630
 Power is not what trans centimeters 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.440
 long and ten feet thick or what that 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.330
 is madness so achieved by doing so 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.250
 in the ear off and the tactics I can stop 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.830
 recommend every beginner 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.330
 the real moore picture or one 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.040
 good player also no moore when 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.280
 Giving didactics is just great 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.520
 the clocks can also be seen on which maps 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.410
 can still make exit but that 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.180
 is then recognize if you so yes yes no 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.580
 Actually it also tactics if you have the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.830
 middle is always between the tube 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.620
 front entrance b if you now from 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:05.110
 domination in it and then direction a 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:08.650
 I think the tricycle is patriot you 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.130
 day was the march started and me 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.410
 do not apologize 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.600
 then you can always run stupid 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.840
 I can speak to that from August 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.610
 and the gameplay is coming to an end 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.010
 I say thank you people really fat thank you 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.780
 Really big thank you are half 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:35.020
 from the month ca and we have already over 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.090
 6,000 video views with two with 300 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.730
 subscribers I think that's awesome 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.790
 I now with an average of 300 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.710

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.260
 say thank you people are the best 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.820
 and then you get a few more 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.960
 viewers to then it will be even hotter 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.330
 as will get even winning games 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.040
 and it is just awesome, I say 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.040
 Chances with the hard rain to nothing
