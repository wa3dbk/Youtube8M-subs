 Globe offers and enjoys the best 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.140
 Brazilian television 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.690
 you will need the following items 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.110
 an external installation antenna one 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.470
 converter coaxial enough to 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.329
 connect your antenna to the TV connector 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:50.489
 male insulating tape the clamp and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:54.079
 clips a drill and hdmi cable or 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.489
 the cable rc depending on your TV 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.410
 prudence money chicken soup and

 security do not hurt anyone is 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.829
 marcelinho 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.149
 The first step is to install the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.310
 antenna you need to put the antenna 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.940
 pointed to the signal transmitter 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.399
 digital 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.289
 The tip is to simply look at where the 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.440
 neighbors' digital antennas are 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.970
 pointing looks in the broken car the spot 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.670
 the fixing of the support for the installation 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.890
 of the antenna must be free of obstacles 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.039
 that may disrupt the reception of the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.190
 sign like trees walls and boxes 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.190
 water 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.390
 the base must be firmly installed 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.670
 only this way you prevent the wind from bending 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.069
 its antenna and a signal is weak the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.679
 Step two is to install the cable that 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.750
 make the connection between the antenna and your 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:50.060
 converter for this you need 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.399
 install its male connector 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.280
 installed the tip connector is to protect the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.739
 connecting to a tape avoiding 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.289
 that water enters the connector now 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:03.959
 third step is to take the car to 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.789
 inside your home the less cable you 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.460
 best used for the signal of your 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.130
 TV so save 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.560
 a tip is to thread the thread through a hole 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.340
 that you can do the same for yourself 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.980
 window 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.180
 the antenna cable can not be near the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.700
 electrical wiring 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.650
 this interferes with the signal and 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.900
 your schedule marcelinho hold the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.910
 cord with clamps clamps is one 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.490
 way to protect it loose ends 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.910
 wear out more quickly and are not 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.910
 beautiful 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.970
 Calm down, we 're already finishing the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.140
 fourth step is to install an effective connector 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.410
 male and plug it into the converter 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.280
 in the case of plasma and 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.160
 lcd 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.040
 The cable to be used is the hdmi 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.860
 ensures a better signal quality if 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.880
 your TV is the cable to be 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.160
 used is the rc 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.890
 we reached the last step to tune the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.890
 signal through the options menu on your tv 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.650
 saw the scene was easy and now you can 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.900
 enjoy the best of HDTV and 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.710
 programming the globe in the comfort of your 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.140
 sofa 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.760
 if you need a little shake in the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.760
 antenna to improve the signal
