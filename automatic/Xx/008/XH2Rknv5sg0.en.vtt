one<00:04:26.470> step<00:04:26.740> closer<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.370> getting<00:04:27.490> out<00:04:27.760> of<00:04:27.910> here

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
one step closer to getting out of here

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.910 
one step closer to getting out of here
though<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.300> that's<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:29.200> know<00:04:29.350> making<00:04:29.620> these

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
though and that's you know making these

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.270 
though and that's you know making these
episodes<00:04:30.280> more<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:30.910> more<00:04:32.280> nerve-wracking

episodes more and more nerve-wracking

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.400 
episodes more and more nerve-wracking

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410
