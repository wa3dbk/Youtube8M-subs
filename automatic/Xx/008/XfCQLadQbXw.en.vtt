00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
outside of room well that is why the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.660 
outside of room well that is why the
lighting<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.500> massive<00:00:34.500> stuff<00:00:36.590> right

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
lighting is so but massive stuff right

March came to see the Dursleys and much
to<00:00:48.480> her<00:00:48.570> chakra<00:00:49.020> Harry<00:00:49.739> Potter<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.870> proceeded

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to her chakra Harry Potter and proceeded

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.250 
to her chakra Harry Potter and proceeded
to<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:52.110> inflated<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.760> proceeded<00:00:54.239> also<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to be inflated and proceeded also to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.840 
to be inflated and proceeded also to
rise<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.940> air<00:00:57.090> now<00:00:58.250> question<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.430> how<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
rise into the air now question is how is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.760 
rise into the air now question is how is
that<00:01:00.090> possible<00:01:00.570> now<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.870> I've<00:01:00.989> done<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.469> base

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that possible now what I've done is base

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.820 
that possible now what I've done is base
this<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.640> Pam<00:01:03.329> Ferris<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.110> actor<00:01:04.470> who<00:01:04.589> played

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this on Pam Ferris the actor who played

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590 
this on Pam Ferris the actor who played
her<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> film<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.330> just

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
her in the film I know it's not just

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.080 
her in the film I know it's not just
about<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.930> film<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.350> there<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.610> because

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
about the film but there you go because

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.899 
about the film but there you go because
the<00:01:09.210> question<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.600> how<00:01:10.320> much<00:01:10.670> Liberty<00:01:11.670> would

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the question is how much Liberty would

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.840 
the question is how much Liberty would
you<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:14.159> rise<00:01:14.430> from

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you have to have to actually rise from

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
you have to have to actually rise from
the<00:01:15.060> surface<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> earth<00:01:15.630> how<00:01:16.020> much<00:01:16.259> would

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the surface of the earth how much would

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
the surface of the earth how much would
you<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> weigh<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> answer<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.750> all

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
you have to weigh the answer is it's all

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.370 
you have to weigh the answer is it's all
about<00:01:18.990> your<00:01:19.290> density<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:20.159> Pam<00:01:20.670> Ferris<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.390> 1.7

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
about your density now Pam Ferris is 1.7

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.490 
about your density now Pam Ferris is 1.7
meters<00:01:22.830> tall<00:01:23.189> I've<00:01:24.150> assumed<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:26.090> Aunt<00:01:27.090> March

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
meters tall I've assumed that Aunt March

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.090 
meters tall I've assumed that Aunt March
is<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.210> obesity<00:01:30.930> graph<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.009> I'm

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
is here on the obesity graph that I'm

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.630 
is here on the obesity graph that I'm
showing<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> now<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:34.740> will<00:01:34.979> give<00:01:35.159> her<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
showing you now that will give her a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.200 
showing you now that will give her a
mass<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> 90<00:01:36.630> kilos<00:01:37.110> now<00:01:37.670> we<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> she

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
mass of 90 kilos now we see that she

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.030 
mass of 90 kilos now we see that she
becomes<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:39.900> less<00:01:39.960> spherical<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.770> by

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
becomes more or less spherical it's by

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380 
becomes more or less spherical it's by
the<00:01:41.100> way<00:01:41.280> easier<00:01:41.820> than<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.090> Violet

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the way easier than that Violet

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.719 
the way easier than that Violet
Beauregarde<00:01:42.479> because<00:01:43.229> her<00:01:43.530> fingers<00:01:44.159> swell<00:01:44.579> up

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
Beauregarde because her fingers swell up

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.340 
Beauregarde because her fingers swell up
and<00:01:45.000> obviously<00:01:45.329> her<00:01:45.450> extremities<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:46.020> well<00:01:46.170> as

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and obviously her extremities as well as

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.899 
and obviously her extremities as well as
well<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> way<00:01:47.130> she's<00:01:47.340> portrayed<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
well so the way she's portrayed in the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.530 
well so the way she's portrayed in the
film<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> little<00:01:48.659> bit<00:01:48.780> inaccurate<00:01:49.229> um<00:01:50.540> but

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
film is a little bit inaccurate um but

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.740 
film is a little bit inaccurate um but
in<00:01:52.200> order<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> sphere<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.030> size<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
in order for a sphere of that size to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840 
in order for a sphere of that size to
have<00:01:54.960> neutral<00:01:55.439> buoyancy<00:01:55.619> with<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> pattice

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
have neutral buoyancy with the pattice

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.020 
have neutral buoyancy with the pattice
fear<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.140> need<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.340> density

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
fear it would need to have a density

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.350 
fear it would need to have a density
well<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.619> same<00:02:01.860> are<00:02:02.130> there<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.909> order<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.299> it

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
well the same are there in order for it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.389 
well the same are there in order for it
to<00:02:03.390> have<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> density<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.110> same<00:02:04.320> was<00:02:04.439> there<00:02:04.619> as

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
to have a density the same was there as

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.089 
to have a density the same was there as
a<00:02:05.460> sphere<00:02:05.880> she<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.770> mass

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
a sphere she would have to have a mass

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.150 
a sphere she would have to have a mass
of<00:02:08.129> two<00:02:08.759> kilos<00:02:09.270> now<00:02:10.170> that's<00:02:10.619> not<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> case

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
of two kilos now that's not the case

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.809 
of two kilos now that's not the case
because<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.849> reckon<00:02:12.360> she<00:02:12.510> weighs

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
because I reckon she weighs

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.679 
because I reckon she weighs
about<00:02:12.909> 90<00:02:13.420> kilos<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.799> question<00:02:15.579> is<00:02:15.730> how<00:02:16.480> big

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
about 90 kilos so question is how big

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.770 
about 90 kilos so question is how big
would<00:02:16.840> she<00:02:17.019> have<00:02:17.139> to<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.469> in<00:02:18.040> order<00:02:18.249> to<00:02:18.780> float

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
would she have to be in order to float

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.619 
would she have to be in order to float
well<00:02:20.730> she<00:02:21.730> would<00:02:21.849> actually<00:02:22.030> have<00:02:22.389> to<00:02:22.480> have<00:02:22.569> a

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
well she would actually have to have a

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.020 
well she would actually have to have a
diameter<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.109> five<00:02:23.439> point<00:02:23.859> one<00:02:24.129> six<00:02:24.459> meters

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
diameter of five point one six meters

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.129 
diameter of five point one six meters
now<00:02:25.719> here's<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.170> diagram<00:02:26.409> or<00:02:27.359> on<00:02:28.359> March<00:02:28.719> she

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:29.139 
now here's a diagram or on March she

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.250 
now here's a diagram or on March she
doesn't<00:02:29.319> normally<00:02:29.379> look<00:02:29.650> like<00:02:29.739> that<00:02:29.950> does<00:02:30.129> she

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
doesn't normally look like that does she

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.449 
doesn't normally look like that does she
are<00:02:32.260> March<00:02:33.510> as<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.569> sphere<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.069> diameter

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
are March as a sphere with the diameter

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.909 
are March as a sphere with the diameter
of<00:02:36.489> 1.7<00:02:37.209> meters<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.989> aren't<00:02:38.439> March<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.889> a

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:38.919 
of 1.7 meters and aren't March as a

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.740 
of 1.7 meters and aren't March as a
sphere<00:02:39.219> with<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:39.849> diamond<00:02:40.269> set<00:02:40.419> of<00:02:40.510> five

point<00:02:41.079> one<00:02:41.230> six<00:02:41.500> meters<00:02:41.919> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.040> see<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.400> is

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
point one six meters you can see this is

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.800 
point one six meters you can see this is
actually<00:02:42.700> quite<00:02:42.999> big<00:02:43.120> she's<00:02:43.629> actually

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
actually quite big she's actually

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.619 
actually quite big she's actually
basically<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.069> size<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.489> this<00:02:45.609> room<00:02:45.909> now<00:02:46.569> we

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
basically the size of this room now we

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.629 
basically the size of this room now we
don't<00:02:46.989> know<00:02:47.230> obviously<00:02:48.099> in<00:02:48.219> the<00:02:48.280> film<00:02:48.489> she's

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
don't know obviously in the film she's

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.559 
don't know obviously in the film she's
not<00:02:48.760> portrayed<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.299> but<00:02:49.450> we<00:02:49.540> don't

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
not portrayed like that but we don't

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.970 
not portrayed like that but we don't
know<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.079> she<00:02:50.200> didn't<00:02:50.409> magically<00:02:50.530> get<00:02:50.829> that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
know that she didn't magically get that

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.089 
know that she didn't magically get that
pig<00:02:51.189> a<00:02:51.489> couple<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.180> other<00:02:52.329> things<00:02:52.650> one<00:02:53.650> she's

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
pig a couple of other things one she's

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.129 
pig a couple of other things one she's
wearing<00:02:54.129> tweed<00:02:54.669> now<00:02:55.239> at<00:02:55.510> first<00:02:55.719> I<00:02:55.930> thought

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
wearing tweed now at first I thought

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.110 
wearing tweed now at first I thought
this<00:02:56.680> wouldn't<00:02:57.129> be<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.519> very<00:02:57.790> suitable

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
this wouldn't be a very suitable

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.089 
this wouldn't be a very suitable
material<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.689> be<00:02:58.810> inflated<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.500> but<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.769> fact

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
material to be inflated in but in fact

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.860 
material to be inflated in but in fact
it<00:03:00.400> works<00:03:00.579> quite<00:03:00.819> well<00:03:00.909> because<00:03:01.299> it's<00:03:01.419> a<00:03:01.510> twill

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
it works quite well because it's a twill

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.879 
it works quite well because it's a twill
fabric<00:03:02.609> is<00:03:03.609> it<00:03:04.060> doggies<00:03:04.719> fibers<00:03:05.500> as<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.769> goes

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
fabric is it doggies fibers as it goes

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.619 
fabric is it doggies fibers as it goes
up<00:03:05.919> and<00:03:06.189> down<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.849> as<00:03:06.939> a<00:03:06.969> result<00:03:07.329> is<00:03:07.419> quite

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
up and down and as a result is quite

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.990 
up and down and as a result is quite
supple<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.319> stretchy<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.370> actually<00:03:09.730> works

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
supple and stretchy so it actually works

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.689 
supple and stretchy so it actually works
quite<00:03:10.239> well<00:03:10.949> it's<00:03:11.949> quite<00:03:12.099> suitable<00:03:12.400> clothing

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:12.699 
quite well it's quite suitable clothing

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.020 
quite well it's quite suitable clothing
for<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.209> purpose<00:03:13.599> and<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:15.250> other<00:03:15.579> thing<00:03:15.879> is

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
for that purpose and the other thing is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.740 
for that purpose and the other thing is
that<00:03:16.949> um<00:03:17.949> the<00:03:18.790> Minister<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.180> Magic<00:03:19.269> talks

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that um the Minister of Magic talks

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.969 
that um the Minister of Magic talks
about<00:03:20.019> her<00:03:20.199> being<00:03:20.470> punctured<00:03:21.269> now<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:23.709> means

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979 
about her being punctured now that means

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.780 
about her being punctured now that means
that<00:03:24.189> she<00:03:24.609> would<00:03:24.790> reduce<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.829> amount<00:03:26.859> of<00:03:27.129> gas

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
that she would reduce the amount of gas

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.030 
that she would reduce the amount of gas
inside<00:03:28.180> her<00:03:28.389> would<00:03:28.780> actually<00:03:29.049> escape<00:03:29.739> through

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
inside her would actually escape through

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.860 
inside her would actually escape through
the<00:03:30.099> puncture<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.790> she'd<00:03:31.120> be<00:03:31.239> okay<00:03:31.540> wouldn't

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
the puncture and she'd be okay wouldn't

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.289 
the puncture and she'd be okay wouldn't
actually<00:03:32.199> cause<00:03:32.379> catastrophic<00:03:33.090> rupture

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
actually cause catastrophic rupture

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.420 
actually cause catastrophic rupture
she<00:03:34.540> wouldn't<00:03:34.750> pop<00:03:35.109> so<00:03:36.009> that's<00:03:36.220> quite

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
she wouldn't pop so that's quite

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.830 
she wouldn't pop so that's quite
interesting<00:03:36.909> and<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.359> wonder<00:03:37.569> what<00:03:37.629> that<00:03:37.810> means

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
interesting and I wonder what that means

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.719 
interesting and I wonder what that means
but<00:03:38.439> I<00:03:38.500> think<00:03:38.709> in<00:03:38.799> fact<00:03:39.009> the<00:03:39.189> best<00:03:39.459> way<00:03:39.609> of

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:39.729 
but I think in fact the best way of

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.520 
but I think in fact the best way of
looking<00:03:40.090> at<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.269> whole<00:03:40.479> thing<00:03:40.509> is<00:03:41.169> that<00:03:41.409> it's

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
looking at this whole thing is that it's

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.860 
looking at this whole thing is that it's
magic<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.159> that<00:03:42.759> there<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.239> some<00:03:43.479> form<00:03:43.720> of

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
magic and that there is some form of

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.420 
magic and that there is some form of
levity<00:03:44.409> pushing<00:03:44.769> her<00:03:44.889> up<00:03:45.009> like<00:03:45.129> there's<00:03:45.310> an

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
levity pushing her up like there's an

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.610 
levity pushing her up like there's an
opposite<00:03:45.819> force<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.239> gravity<00:03:46.629> then<00:03:47.379> what<00:03:47.530> has

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
opposite force of gravity then what has

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.289 
opposite force of gravity then what has
been<00:03:47.859> bad<00:03:48.069> happening<00:03:48.370> she's<00:03:48.609> rising<00:03:49.060> into<00:03:49.269> the

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
been bad happening she's rising into the

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.679 
been bad happening she's rising into the
air<00:03:49.389> as<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.079> result<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.650> magic<00:03:50.979> and<00:03:51.689> possibly

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:52.689 
air as a result of magic and possibly

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.729 
air as a result of magic and possibly
reduces<00:03:53.290> mass<00:03:53.500> as<00:03:53.709> well<00:03:53.949> so<00:03:55.739> similar

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
reduces mass as well so similar

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.530 
reduces mass as well so similar
situation<00:03:57.250> in<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.430> way<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.609> Violet<00:03:58.000> Beauregarde

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
situation in a way to Violet Beauregarde

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.749 
situation in a way to Violet Beauregarde
but<00:03:59.049> also<00:03:59.259> a<00:03:59.500> very<00:03:59.680> different<00:04:00.219> situation

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:00.759 
but also a very different situation

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.280 
but also a very different situation
because<00:04:00.909> she's<00:04:01.269> lighter<00:04:01.599> than<00:04:01.900> air<00:04:02.079> in<00:04:02.199> this

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
because she's lighter than air in this
