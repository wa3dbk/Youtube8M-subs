00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:17.310
 or yes highlight network movie to a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.990
 another video on a channel and today 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.090
 there is a whole new series 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.770
 from me I have considered the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.770
 actually could be quite cool and 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.390
 Although energy is called yes and 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.070
 today we just start with that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 league mode of how should it currently 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.300
 also be different because currently turns 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.140
 all cod youtube somehow around league 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.429
 comparative and any more yes if 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.260
 you may consider talks should 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.210
 First, start with what is 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 generally again in the league 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.649
 general should so to speak that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.679
 competitive gaming right now soon from 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 represent black ops 2 and so that quasi 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.670
 reflect what the pros actually 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.620
 played against each other every day 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.179
 for many who are now at all 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.739
 ask what is this at all 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.089
 complete gaming that actually 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.850
 very easy to explain 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.929
 it's just that it's one 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.390
 goal-oriented play is playing 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.740
 almost on the victory or for the victory that 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.600
 Whole makes the stop mostly in one 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.969
 at least it is four in the cod so cod 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.619
 you play four against four in three 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.659
 different modes it is once 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.729
 search and destroy capture the flag 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.380
 and position the whole is now 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.969
 course based on black ops 2 in 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.590
 Of course there are other games as well 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.630
 Other modes are played 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.750
 in mw3, for example, was still 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.909
 there is dominance and in rwe there is yes 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.469
 this so-called uplink mode and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.600
 it was just capture the flag 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.549
 rausgenommen 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.590
 we now come to the moody's, 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.460
 position there is once the map take 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.399
 raid stendorf and slums in position there 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.229
 It's a goal to reach 250 points 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.450
 These points you get if you have the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.460
 the one currently marked is with 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.620
 his team mates defends running 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.270
 this green 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.730
 you get a point every second 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.950
 you can see that on the bottom left 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.630
 the orange lights up that means one 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.060
 team with and an opponent in the hill 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.280
 and thus at this time 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.660
 no one gets a point if then the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.210
 opponents from the taken out 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.550
 will or will run your points 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.140
 quite normal in position there are 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.900
 two ways to win the game 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.790
 once reached 250 points and wins 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.440
 thereby the play or wins the play 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.710
 after ten minutes if that if the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.810
 score is too scarce, for example 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.190
 There is then 176 275 attitude 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.750
 of course many tactics like 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.030
 you can win the game who who 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.710
 position plays that would be for the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.360
 first guide I say a bit 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.280
 asking too much because I want that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.860
 today for the first time guessed that you know 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.060
 What league is the most 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.650
 you know it probably anyway 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.790
 but for the people this time do not know 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.740
 that's probably all right 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.880
 interesting so we come to now 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.440
 search and destroy 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.680
 there are also four maps again 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.900
 in once meltdown stendorf express and 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.520
 Raid a search and destroy game 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.920
 one can decide for oneself by one 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.030
 six rounds in succession you pick up 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.190
 Of course , the rounds do not have to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.170
 brutally in a row now pick that 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.940
 the opponent gets a round but it 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.920
 until then until a team has six 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.209
 one can of course get that 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.130
 quite logically calculate 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.760
 looking for and destroying league then goes 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.350
 each maximum to round eleven people the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.940
 Do not destroy yourself with league and search 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.209
 Sometimes it seems like I know it 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.500
 would people camp there or simply 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.060
 have no play and just the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.770
 Of course, sitting is not the corner 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.140
 if you are on the defensive side 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.730
 since as well as on the attacker side 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.989
 You can be very good at both 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.120
 entrench or 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.280
 just certain spots from m and 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.380
 of course this is just cover 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.510
 tactical thought and that's got 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.330
 no case to do something with him so 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.620
 that's already in search in advance 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.250
 and you play very destructively 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.560
 different classes you can virtually with 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.720
 Therefore, a dual band play through 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.310
 No one comes to see smogs 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.470
 could 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.330
 looking to put quasi all play there 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.530
 is really all that is allowed 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.200
 opponent surprised and what he maybe 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.150
 not thinking of you 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.680
 so now we come to the third and 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.260
 Last time this is capture the flag 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.930
 here are three maps that 1 x raid 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.700
 slums and stendorf capture the flag is 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.040
 a very simple mode it is almost 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.810
 just about the enemy flag 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.650
 to conquer and to his question 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.690
 bring back 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.370
 this sounds a bit easier than 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.440
 it's actually because you have one 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.940
 respawn timer if you die you have to 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.160
 five seconds to wait for you on the web 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.810
 Respawn can give that to the opposing team 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.700
 of course immense benefits if yours 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.350
 team just died because she is 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.790
 simply do not have five seconds 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.160
 Watch out and be the first time the flag 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.930
 bring to a secured territory 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.970
 And then you can set your flag on everyone 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.280
 case chains capture the flag always goes 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.139
 over two rounds to complete the five minutes 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.910
 that means we are at the end of this ten 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.840
 minutes most conquests have conquered 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.970
 win the game 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.160
 this extension also works in principle 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.990
 first again ten minutes a2 customers 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.120
 say five minutes per round 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.650
 However, if a team before the flag 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.910
 the five minutes cap will be the time 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.570
 stopped and it goes to the next one 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.640
 round 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.039
 Let's say you have the flag now 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.510
 conquered in three minutes 20 then it goes 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.669
 in the next round and the opposing team 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.890
 must try this time to undercut 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.900
 does not make it that opponent team or 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.740
 your cap might still have a flag 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.229
 her the game in the extension 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.090
 won yes so that was it with the first 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.039
 consequence of energy I hope 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.150
 Of course I liked you 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.310
 I've got that a bit for the first time 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.850
 what is trying so seriously 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.100
 close 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.660
 I hope it worked and was not 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.530
 quite as daunting for you i wanted 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.430
 Just explain the league mode because 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.960
 of course, right now is turning 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.280
 everything about league and i think a lot of people 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.810
 we just do not quite understand each other 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.550
 and that's why I just wanted you to 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.570
 explain it 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.889
 yes, if then it just works 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.720
 a thumbs up then looks at 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.740
 next video over again and me 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.750
 would say see you next time 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.750
 I'll see you guys until next time
