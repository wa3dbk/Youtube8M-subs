the<00:00:28.630> pressure<00:00:29.590> test<00:00:29.980> we've<00:00:30.160> done

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:01:10.320 

paper<00:00:41.010> cut<00:00:42.010> them<00:00:42.130> off<00:00:43.470> it's<00:00:44.470> kind<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.770> paper

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.820 

the<00:01:11.330> moment<00:01:11.659> of<00:01:11.720> technical<00:01:12.200> grass<00:01:12.409> box<00:01:12.650> each

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
the moment of technical grass box each

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.380 
the moment of technical grass box each
and<00:01:13.130> probably<00:01:13.580> on<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.700> second<00:01:14.000> pass<00:01:14.120> will<00:01:14.270> get

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
and probably on a second pass will get

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.149 
and probably on a second pass will get
another<00:01:14.630> alcohol<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.350> we'll<00:01:15.680> do<00:01:15.770> our<00:01:15.890> box<00:01:16.040> and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
another alcohol so we'll do our box and

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.649 
another alcohol so we'll do our box and
our<00:01:16.340> beach<00:01:16.550> today<00:01:16.790> that's<00:01:17.210> just<00:01:17.360> taking<00:01:17.570> in

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
our beach today that's just taking in

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:29.230 
our beach today that's just taking in
the<00:01:17.720> middle<00:01:17.900> of<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:18.650> entire<00:01:18.920> surface<00:01:19.130> you

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.640 

pulling<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.300> strings<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.230> you<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.440> start

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
pulling the strings out so you can start

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
pulling the strings out so you can start
to<00:01:31.770> my<00:01:31.920> across<00:01:32.220> make<00:01:32.460> sure<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.630> brain<00:01:33.900> is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
to my across make sure that the brain is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.460 
to my across make sure that the brain is
is<00:01:34.470> tight<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:36.050> making<00:01:37.050> sure<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.260> launch<00:01:37.410> of

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
is tight and making sure the launch of

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
is tight and making sure the launch of
strike<00:01:37.680> really<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.670> double<00:01:39.000> move<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
strike really I would double move it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.390 
strike really I would double move it
full<00:01:39.690> cut<00:01:39.900> blowing<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.470> once<00:01:40.740> first<00:01:41.100> time<00:01:41.250> be

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
full cut blowing so once first time be

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.970 
full cut blowing so once first time be
length<00:01:41.640> second<00:01:42.090> will<00:01:42.330> be<00:01:42.450> across<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.860> it

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
length second will be across and it

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.830 
length second will be across and it
gives<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.220> checkerboard<00:01:44.610> effect<00:01:45.000> looking

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
gives that checkerboard effect looking

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
gives that checkerboard effect looking
