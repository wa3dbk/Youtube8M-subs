00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:18.449
 Hello friends, today we will consider 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:21.019
 Soviet heavy tank 9 level st1 but 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.340
 first small historical background 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.439
 development of the tank began in the forty-fifth 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.269
 year as a chassis for a new tank 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.210
 it was planned to use similar 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.850
 from object 701 which turned into from 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.310
 4 and the tower was designed by the ganin itself 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.250
 im the main idea of ​​creating a new tank 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.530
 Ganin thought was about creating a new 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.600
 and more reliable tank direction 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.340
 Corps Finishing Ganin set a goal 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.380
 improve the reliability of tank equipment 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.750
 adapt everything for use under 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.940
 water to optimize the diameter of the rollers and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.260
 the location of the track chain tower 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.450
 it was supposed to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.100
 seal but that case if the tank 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.770
 will need to overcome the water barrier 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.440
 fords 160 millimeters should have been 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.019
 lower frontal armor plate then 40 up forehead 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.969
 the board and the stern of the roof and the bottom of 30 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.520
 millimeters booking a tower should 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:11.539
 it was 250 and 300 millimeters 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.979
 forehead feed and sides of 160 millimeters 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.770
 tank armament was to consist of 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.359
 122 mm gun drive tank 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.810
 the movement had to engines with power 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:23.939
 850 horsepower power reserve 150 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.299
 kilometers along the highway at an average speed 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.329
 45 kilometers per hour but what is St-1 y 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.189
 us in the game let's recognize the gun from us 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.700
 high- quality possessing average alpha strike 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.619
 am 420 units breaking through 258 badges and 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.420
 340 millimeters gold at 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.729
 rate of fire almost five shots in 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.109
 minute we have a dpm equal to two thousand 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.380
 units of damage per minute 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.329
 data time is 3.4 seconds and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.299
 let's just say this is not comme il faut 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.270
 and the spread is 0 38 normal 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.280
 Soviet cannon with mass of tanks 61 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.319
 a ton we have 700 engines 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.939
 horsepower it gives a maximum 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.459
 speed equal to 40 kilometers per hour 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.049
 chassis turning speed is 20 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.970
 degrees per second and turning speed 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.450
 towers equal to 16 degrees per second 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.990
 about the armor let's just say it is from the forehead 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.270
 and 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.820
 from the sides we have 140 millimeters with 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.450
 aft 100 millimeters booking towers 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:29.020
 is 250 250 millimeters in the forehead 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:31.720
 board 160 and feed 160 so friends here we are 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.570
 already in battle we drive 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.580
 on the left let's go probably to the center closer to 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.910
 the center because there is a ekshon we top 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.390
 and as they say if we are in the top 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:55.000
 that opponent team will experience 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:58.030
 difficulties what a terrible it sits kv-3 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.720
 kv-3 he knows something friends he can he 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.240
 thinks he is pt 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.910
 but he is storming the stormy crust 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.620
 together with isu-152 of course isu-152 for 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.510
 us priority target we shoot and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.840
 impenetrable is success successful 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.190
 again our teammates helps her 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.290
 disassemble as she rolled shooting 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.630
 in quadra ignition it rolls out 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.989
 objects with a4 and not punches us 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.850
 breaks through our armor and soup 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.750
 punches isa punches them because 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.830
 similar gun 704 us a little not 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.430
 I was not lucky 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.230
 to tighten now we need to suck 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.269
 isu-152 so let's say get the trunk 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.400
 as drying rather dangerous 704 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.130
 not paying attention to us at all 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.250
 enough hijacking i roll out give it to him 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.370
 alpha friends give him alpha 700 traits 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:52.060
 understands that to his right is st1 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.070
 st1 top tank i'm trying to roll 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.570
 draw attention to yourself but still 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.519
 I ignore the author comes with him 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.720
 animations finally notices me 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.569
 too late too late friends yes 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.129
 it's because you know 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.439
 with scoop i can't deal damage 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.829
 There is such a belief, but I put and 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.900
 getting 8 friends picking up 8 see 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.150
 route tiger already I just pray 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.440
 so that nobody would tell him nobody 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:25.349
 could have collected, I think almost all of its 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.900
 pore with all its speed which 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:32.340
 equal to 20 kilometers at the moment and 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.289
 suck up game friends suck up game 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.810
