"speaker 1: I think that bio-medical research
is worth exploring in the sense that it's

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.700
the mechanism through which we're asking questions
that are gonna help people.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.130
My name's Joseph Foster.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.051
I've been working here at the Hussman Institute
for Human Genomics at the Miller School of

00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:40.540
Medicine at the University of Miami, under
the tutelage of Dr. Mustafa Tekin for about

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.820
two and a half years now, primarily focusing
on the research of genetics of deafness

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.820
The main instrument of investigation that
we've been using is whole exome sequencing,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.880
in the sense that we're look for novel genes
associated with genetics of deafness.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.760
Our ultimate goal is to be able to discover
novel deafness genes.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.970
We're in the hunt for the remaining deafness
genes that are yet to be discovered.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:19.560
My role in that right now, as it is, is basically
running experiments that are confirming potential

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.670
variations that may lead us to novel deafness
genes.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.750
I was born in Denver, Colorado, and my father
at the time and still is an electrical engineer,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.930
so science has been around me my entire life.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.810
I'll do what I just did.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.530
My interest in bio-medical research started
when I was a little bit younger.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.799
One of my close family members was born with
cystic fibrosis, and that kind of really kickstarted

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.530
my interest in understanding a little bit
more thoroughly about genetics and how it's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.000
impacting this really important person in
my life.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.330
When I reached high school and I, and I took
my first introductory course to biology as

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.760
a freshman, I just remember being very intrigued
by the process of DNA replication and some

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.010
of the basic concepts that were introduced
at that course.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.620
I've played saxophone and I've always been
involved with music really since I was very

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.480
young, probably eight or nine years old, and
I guess it was a moment of serendipity when

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.810
I came here and it was genetics of deafness
and I was able to understand the ear, which

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.010
was obviously pivotal to being able to play
music.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.200
What I find interesting about working in the
lab is the dynamic nature of what's actually

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.910
going on and what's being investigated.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.830
Mutation in your DNA can result in a faulty
part of your body, and so in our case we're

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.190
looking at mutations in genetic and, and deafness
genes that result in congenital deafness,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.940
so the patients are born without the ability
to hear.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.850
I think what's really been rewarding for me
in this whole process is really just the whole

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.769
idea that once we find something new or something
really neat, you know, we're able to give

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.590
that to a patient.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.560
Okay, double click on that cube of data lines.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.550
The neat thing about bio-medical research
and specifically about genetics research is

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.800
you need to have the ability to collaborate
with people who are working in different fields.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.410
You're not operating in a vacuum.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.900
You're a person that's part of a team.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.260
I think success for me is very much wrapped
up in how what I've done is benefiting other

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.810
people."
