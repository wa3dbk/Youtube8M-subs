00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.759 
truth-o-meter Tuesday question
this<00:00:14.570> week<00:00:14.750> we're<00:00:14.930> talking<00:00:15.049> about<00:00:15.320> scar

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
this week we're talking about scar

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.109 
this week we're talking about scar
management<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:16.490> trying<00:00:16.759> to<00:00:16.849> get<00:00:17.000> the

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
management and trying to get the

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.429 
management and trying to get the
best-looking<00:00:17.660> scar<00:00:17.930> after<00:00:18.110> you've<00:00:18.320> had

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
best-looking scar after you've had

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:19.960 
best-looking scar after you've had
surgery<00:00:18.680> because<00:00:19.189> it's<00:00:19.369> something<00:00:19.550> that's<00:00:19.790> on

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
surgery because it's something that's on

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.540 
surgery because it's something that's on
the<00:00:20.090> mind<00:00:20.270> of<00:00:20.420> all<00:00:20.599> of<00:00:21.050> our<00:00:21.200> patients<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:21.890> our

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
the mind of all of our patients and our

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.420 
the mind of all of our patients and our
question<00:00:22.910> was<00:00:23.000> this<00:00:23.180> that<00:00:23.450> other<00:00:23.660> than<00:00:23.960> time

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
question was this that other than time

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.740 
question was this that other than time
the<00:00:25.430> thing<00:00:25.730> that's<00:00:25.970> going<00:00:26.149> to<00:00:26.300> make<00:00:26.450> the<00:00:26.570> most

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
the thing that's going to make the most

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.659 
the thing that's going to make the most
improvement<00:00:27.230> in<00:00:27.529> terms<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:28.009> scars<00:00:28.340> is

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
improvement in terms of scars is

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.210 
improvement in terms of scars is
external<00:00:29.480> compression<00:00:30.439> or<00:00:30.619> external

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
external compression or external

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.490 
external compression or external
pressure<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:31.820> answer<00:00:32.149> that<00:00:32.300> is<00:00:32.599> true<00:00:32.960> all

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
pressure the answer that is true all

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.530 
pressure the answer that is true all
scars<00:00:34.160> get<00:00:34.340> better<00:00:34.550> with<00:00:34.730> time<00:00:34.760> think<00:00:35.329> of<00:00:35.450> the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
scars get better with time think of the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.990 
scars get better with time think of the
scar<00:00:35.780> that<00:00:35.989> you<00:00:36.140> had<00:00:36.410> say<00:00:37.219> a<00:00:37.250> week<00:00:37.579> or<00:00:37.730> two<00:00:37.880> ago

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
scar that you had say a week or two ago

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.670 
scar that you had say a week or two ago
versus<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:38.809> one<00:00:38.989> that's<00:00:39.170> been<00:00:39.320> there<00:00:39.500> for

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
versus the one that's been there for

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.740 
versus the one that's been there for
several<00:00:39.920> years<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.579> you<00:00:40.670> can<00:00:40.820> see<00:00:40.969> a<00:00:41.000> drastic

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
several years and you can see a drastic

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.540 
several years and you can see a drastic
difference<00:00:42.250> but<00:00:43.250> plastic<00:00:43.730> surgeons<00:00:44.210> for

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
difference but plastic surgeons for

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.000 
difference but plastic surgeons for
decades<00:00:46.550> have<00:00:47.179> used<00:00:47.480> external<00:00:48.260> compression

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
decades have used external compression

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.130 
decades have used external compression
to<00:00:49.550> help<00:00:49.760> with<00:00:50.179> scarring<00:00:50.739> this<00:00:51.739> has<00:00:51.920> been<00:00:52.160> the

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
to help with scarring this has been the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.899 
to help with scarring this has been the
basis<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.469> treatment<00:00:54.980> of<00:00:55.129> burn<00:00:55.399> scars

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
basis of the treatment of burn scars

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.790 
basis of the treatment of burn scars
people<00:00:56.420> with<00:00:56.539> burns<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.140> had<00:00:57.289> a<00:00:57.320> lot<00:00:57.469> of<00:00:57.499> skin

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
people with burns and had a lot of skin

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.739 
people with burns and had a lot of skin
grafts<00:00:58.039> have<00:00:58.550> more<00:00:58.940> problems<00:00:59.269> with<00:00:59.420> scarring

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
grafts have more problems with scarring

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:01.419 
grafts have more problems with scarring
than<00:01:00.109> any<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.499> the<00:01:00.589> patients<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.010> you'll<00:01:01.219> see

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
than any of the patients that you'll see

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.189 
than any of the patients that you'll see
they've<00:01:01.969> always<00:01:02.300> been<00:01:02.510> treated<00:01:03.079> with

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
they've always been treated with

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.649 
they've always been treated with
external<00:01:03.920> compression<00:01:04.460> garments<00:01:04.940> which<00:01:05.390> put

external compression garments which put

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.320 
external compression garments which put
pressure<00:01:06.020> on<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.350> scar<00:01:06.620> and<00:01:06.920> physically<00:01:07.760> help

to mold and change the scars we utilize

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.040 
to mold and change the scars we utilize
that<00:01:11.810> same<00:01:12.140> phenomenon<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:13.070> treating<00:01:13.640> our

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
thing to do and that's why we use it in

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.850 
thing to do and that's why we use it in
all<00:01:56.030> our<00:01:56.210> patients<00:01:56.450> it's<00:01:57.290> hard<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.680> know<00:01:57.830> if

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
all our patients it's hard to know if
