possible and that's the same - for the

possible and that's the same - for the
Philippines<00:01:19.840> in<00:01:20.079> the<00:01:20.200> next<00:01:20.469> 48<00:01:21.009> hours<00:01:21.039> we

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
Philippines in the next 48 hours we

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.429 
Philippines in the next 48 hours we
could<00:01:21.880> see<00:01:22.119> typhoon<00:01:22.569> conditions<00:01:23.049> occurring

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
could see typhoon conditions occurring

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.679 
could see typhoon conditions occurring
especially<00:01:23.609> towards<00:01:24.609> the<00:01:24.700> eastern<00:01:25.149> visayas

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
especially towards the eastern visayas

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.160 
especially towards the eastern visayas
region<00:01:26.109> in<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.159> next<00:01:27.280> 48<00:01:27.880> hours<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.810> obviously

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
region in the next 48 hours so obviously

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.569 
region in the next 48 hours so obviously
it's<00:01:29.350> not<00:01:29.380> too<00:01:29.649> good<00:01:29.829> a<00:01:29.859> situation<00:01:30.399> out<00:01:30.549> there

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
it's not too good a situation out there

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.859 
it's not too good a situation out there
so<00:01:30.969> it's<00:01:31.090> certainly<00:01:31.240> something<00:01:31.509> to<00:01:31.719> keep

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
so it's certainly something to keep

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.300 
so it's certainly something to keep
track<00:01:32.109> of<00:01:32.259> and<00:01:32.469> we'll<00:01:32.710> be<00:01:32.799> doing<00:01:33.009> updates

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
track of and we'll be doing updates

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.469 
Philippines and then South China Sea it
will<00:01:48.429> get<00:01:48.579> a<00:01:48.609> little<00:01:48.880> bit<00:01:48.969> cooler<00:01:49.299> for<00:01:49.329> the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
will get a little bit cooler for the

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.809 
will get a little bit cooler for the
storm<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.380> may<00:01:50.649> begin<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:51.039> weaken<00:01:51.369> as<00:01:51.579> it

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
storm so it may begin to weaken as it

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.569 
storm so it may begin to weaken as it
approaches<00:01:52.209> at<00:01:52.329> Vietnam<00:01:52.709> the<00:01:53.709> CMC<00:01:54.159> model<00:01:54.429> and

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
approaches at Vietnam the CMC model and

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.399 
approaches at Vietnam the CMC model and
has<00:01:54.969> the<00:01:55.179> storm<00:01:55.450> moving<00:01:55.659> through<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.049> Visayas

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
has the storm moving through the Visayas

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.440 
has the storm moving through the Visayas
region<00:01:56.859> out<00:01:57.159> over<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.639> South<00:01:57.850> China<00:01:57.880> Sea<00:01:58.240> and

region out over the South China Sea and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.419 
region out over the South China Sea and
then<00:01:58.749> into<00:01:59.229> Vietnam<00:01:59.649> pretty<00:02:00.039> much<00:02:00.159> as<00:02:00.310> the

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
then into Vietnam pretty much as the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.069 
then into Vietnam pretty much as the
forecast<00:02:00.819> stays<00:02:01.060> with<00:02:01.539> another<00:02:01.780> storm

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
forecast stays with another storm

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.569 
forecast stays with another storm
following<00:02:02.469> after<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.920> moving<00:02:03.249> a<00:02:03.340> little<00:02:03.459> bit

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
following after that moving a little bit

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.519 
following after that moving a little bit
further<00:02:03.880> south<00:02:04.119> into<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.479> Philippines<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:05.139> a

further south into the Philippines and a

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:06.989 
further south into the Philippines and a
storm<00:02:05.799> forming<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.249> the<00:02:06.310> Bay<00:02:06.459> of<00:02:06.490> Bengal<00:02:06.700> as

storm forming in the Bay of Bengal as

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.150 
storm forming in the Bay of Bengal as
well<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:07.689> GFS<00:02:08.110> model<00:02:08.140> has<00:02:08.590> something<00:02:08.920> fairly

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
well the GFS model has something fairly

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.370 
well the GFS model has something fairly
similar<00:02:09.610> in<00:02:09.640> terms<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.119> first<00:02:10.330> storm<00:02:10.720> that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
similar in terms of the first storm that

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.559 
similar in terms of the first storm that
is<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> Haiyan<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.400> course<00:02:12.640> moving<00:02:13.150> through<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
Philippines a bit further south actually

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.550 
Philippines a bit further south actually
by<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.390> looks<00:02:16.629> of<00:02:16.720> things<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.170> north<00:02:17.409> of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
by the looks of things just north of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.559 
by the looks of things just north of
Mindanao<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.310> sudden<00:02:18.580> vissaeus<00:02:18.939> region<00:02:19.420> and

Mindanao in a sudden vissaeus region and

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.110 
Mindanao in a sudden vissaeus region and
then<00:02:19.930> in

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
then in

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.850 
then in
to<00:02:20.180> vietnam<00:02:20.569> eventually<00:02:21.019> in<00:02:21.080> another<00:02:21.530> storm

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
to vietnam eventually in another storm

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.680 
to vietnam eventually in another storm
forming<00:02:22.250> after<00:02:22.549> that<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.970> could<00:02:23.390> strike

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
forming after that and could strike

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.140 
forming after that and could strike
southern<00:02:24.080> Vietnam<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> latest<00:02:25.970> satellite

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
southern Vietnam so the latest satellite

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.149 
southern Vietnam so the latest satellite
imagery<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.230> see<00:02:27.500> how<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.709> eye<00:02:27.799> has<00:02:28.129> been

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
imagery you can see how the eye has been

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.890 
imagery you can see how the eye has been
developing<00:02:29.060> over<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.330> past<00:02:29.569> few<00:02:29.780> hours

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
developing over the past few hours

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.839 
developing over the past few hours
certainly<00:02:30.409> a<00:02:30.440> very<00:02:30.620> intense<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.370> bad<00:02:31.580> looks

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
certainly a very intense one bad looks

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.030 
certainly a very intense one bad looks
of<00:02:32.030> things<00:02:32.180> very<00:02:32.900> close<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.560> island<00:02:33.920> of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
of things very close to the island of

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.710 
of things very close to the island of
power<00:02:34.250> which<00:02:34.549> is<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:35.060> little<00:02:35.299> area<00:02:35.569> of

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
power which is just that little area of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.259 
power which is just that little area of
islands<00:02:36.080> towards<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.920> west<00:02:37.459> southwest<00:02:37.670> of

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
islands towards the west southwest of

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.390 
islands towards the west southwest of
the<00:02:38.390> storm<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.620> still<00:02:39.829> looks<00:02:40.069> like<00:02:40.250> it's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
the storm and the still looks like it's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.100 
the storm and the still looks like it's
going<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:40.640> pass<00:02:40.819> just<00:02:41.120> north<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.690> but<00:02:42.049> we

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
going to pass just north of that but we

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.449 
going to pass just north of that but we
could<00:02:42.290> certainly<00:02:42.620> see<00:02:42.860> some<00:02:42.890> typhoon

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
could certainly see some typhoon

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.160 
could certainly see some typhoon
conditions<00:02:43.970> certainly<00:02:44.329> heavy<00:02:44.510> rainfall<00:02:45.019> that

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
conditions certainly heavy rainfall that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.949 
conditions certainly heavy rainfall that
will<00:02:45.260> occur<00:02:45.530> over<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.370> region<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:47.629> central

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
will occur over that region the central

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.330 
will occur over that region the central
core<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.290> storm<00:02:48.560> appears<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.159> will

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
core of the storm appears that it will

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.699 
core of the storm appears that it will
pass<00:02:50.269> over<00:02:50.540> at<00:02:50.720> least<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.019> northern<00:02:51.140> half<00:02:51.530> of

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
pass over at least the northern half of

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.309 
pass over at least the northern half of
that<00:02:51.829> region<00:02:52.220> as<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.420> moves<00:02:53.599> towards<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.079> west

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
that region as it moves towards the west

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.949 
that region as it moves towards the west
we've<00:02:54.500> already<00:02:54.650> had<00:02:54.890> some<00:02:55.420> some<00:02:56.420> spiral<00:02:56.780> bands

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
we've already had some some spiral bands

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.170 
we've already had some some spiral bands
passing<00:02:57.799> through<00:02:58.069> that<00:02:58.099> region<00:02:58.459> over<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
passing through that region over the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.059 
passing through that region over the
past<00:02:59.269> few<00:02:59.810> hours<00:02:59.870> as<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.349> can<00:03:00.500> see<00:03:00.709> there<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
past few hours as you can see there the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.800 
past few hours as you can see there the
white<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.519> black<00:03:01.670> areas<00:03:02.090> which<00:03:02.420> show<00:03:02.660> the

white and black areas which show the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.569 
white and black areas which show the

most intense part of the storm at the

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.099 
most intense part of the storm at the
moment<00:03:05.000> obviously<00:03:05.090> we<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.569> wind<00:03:05.750> speeds<00:03:06.019> of

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109
