00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
kept on the outer reach because it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.999 
kept on the outer reach because it
requires<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> lot<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.759> space<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.680> because<00:01:34.680> as

requires a lot of space and because as

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
requires a lot of space and because as
you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.909> animals<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.570> move

you can see the animals can move

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.800 
you can see the animals can move
themselves<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.820> do<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:38.970> require<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.600> much
