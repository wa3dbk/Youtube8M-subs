stop and break the neutral so you should

stop and break the neutral so you should

whip from the curb and you should appear

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.000 
whip from the curb and you should appear

no more than two car limps away from

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
that part cut in front of you now a few

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.380 
that part cut in front of you now a few
things<00:04:47.100> that<00:04:47.460> you<00:04:47.550> need<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.850> consider<00:04:48.210> when

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
things that you need to consider when

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.600 
things that you need to consider when
you're<00:04:48.480> doing<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.780> maneuver<00:04:49.140> is<00:04:50.040> what<00:04:50.400> do<00:04:50.550> you

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
you're doing the maneuver is what do you

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.030 
you're doing the maneuver is what do you
do<00:04:50.790> with<00:04:50.910> vehicles<00:04:51.360> come<00:04:51.570> towards<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.110> or<00:04:52.950> you

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
do with vehicles come towards you or you

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.420 
do with vehicles come towards you or you
need<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.280> stop<00:04:53.700> it's<00:04:53.940> their<00:04:54.120> priority

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
need to stop it's their priority

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.100 
need to stop it's their priority
now<00:04:56.430> it's<00:04:56.580> better<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:57.030> start<00:04:57.390> find<00:04:57.810> out<00:04:57.960> what

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
now it's better to start find out what

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.740 
now it's better to start find out what
they're<00:04:58.260> doing<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:59.130> then<00:05:00.030> carry<00:05:00.330> on<00:05:00.510> if

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
they're doing and then carry on if

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.210 
they're doing and then carry on if
they're<00:05:01.050> waiting<00:05:01.350> for<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.590> rather<00:05:02.130> than

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
they're waiting for you rather than

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.400 
they're waiting for you rather than
finding<00:05:02.760> out<00:05:02.880> when<00:05:03.090> they<00:05:03.180> go<00:05:03.330> past<00:05:03.540> you<00:05:03.900> so

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
finding out when they go past you so

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.290 
finding out when they go past you so
that's<00:05:04.560> why<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.740> recommend<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:05.280> just<00:05:05.310> stop<00:05:05.790> when

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
that's why I recommend to just stop when

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.350 
that's why I recommend to just stop when
you<00:05:06.390> see<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.690> vehicles<00:05:07.020> coming<00:05:07.290> towards<00:05:07.650> you

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
you see the vehicles coming towards you

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
you see the vehicles coming towards you
other<00:05:09.360> things<00:05:09.660> you<00:05:09.780> need<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:09.990> bear<00:05:10.170> in<00:05:10.200> mind

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
other things you need to bear in mind

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.890 
other things you need to bear in mind
this<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:11.520> timing<00:05:11.970> if<00:05:12.090> your<00:05:12.210> right<00:05:12.390> shoulders

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
this the timing if your right shoulders

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.380 
this the timing if your right shoulders
are<00:05:13.020> important<00:05:13.470> as<00:05:13.560> well<00:05:13.940> when<00:05:14.940> you<00:05:15.060> turn<00:05:15.300> the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
are important as well when you turn the

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.350 
are important as well when you turn the
steering<00:05:15.600> wheel<00:05:15.720> one<00:05:15.990> full<00:05:16.230> turn<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.800> left

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
steering wheel one full turn to the left

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.550 
steering wheel one full turn to the left
the<00:05:18.360> front<00:05:18.630> of<00:05:18.720> your<00:05:18.780> cars<00:05:19.020> going<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.290> swing

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
the front of your cars going to swing

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.190 
the front of your cars going to swing
out<00:05:19.740> so<00:05:20.190> before<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.670> do<00:05:20.850> that<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.930> need<00:05:22.050> to

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
out so before you do that you need to

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.110 
out so before you do that you need to
look<00:05:22.290> over<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:22.710> right<00:05:22.920> shoulder<00:05:23.220> because

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
look over that right shoulder because

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.610 
look over that right shoulder because
you'll<00:05:24.270> notice<00:05:24.630> your<00:05:24.930> front<00:05:25.140> of<00:05:25.230> your<00:05:25.350> car<00:05:25.530> is

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
you'll notice your front of your car is

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.080 
you'll notice your front of your car is
going<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:25.830> swing<00:05:26.100> out<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.670> that<00:05:26.820> could<00:05:27.000> affect

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
going to swing out and that could affect

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
going to swing out and that could affect
pedestrians<00:05:27.930> walking<00:05:28.560> party<00:05:29.160> or<00:05:30.030> cars<00:05:30.780> coming

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
pedestrians walking party or cars coming

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.720 
pedestrians walking party or cars coming
towards<00:05:31.470> your<00:05:31.530> cars<00:05:31.830> coming<00:05:32.190> off<00:05:32.280> driveway

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
towards your cars coming off driveway

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
towards your cars coming off driveway
sometimes<00:05:34.490> when<00:05:35.490> you're<00:05:35.730> doing<00:05:36.150> them<00:05:36.420> Oliva

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
sometimes when you're doing them Oliva

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.110 
sometimes when you're doing them Oliva
let's<00:05:37.620> say<00:05:37.860> you've<00:05:38.400> got<00:05:38.430> your<00:05:38.760> technique

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
let's say you've got your technique

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.570 
let's say you've got your technique
slightly<00:05:39.600> wrong<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:40.800> you<00:05:40.920> wind<00:05:41.040> up<00:05:41.130> too<00:05:41.370> close

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
slightly wrong and you wind up too close

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.650 
slightly wrong and you wind up too close
to<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:41.970> curb<00:05:42.180> or<00:05:42.840> too<00:05:43.110> far<00:05:43.410> away<00:05:43.590> from<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:44.010> car

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
to the curb or too far away from the car

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.360 
to the curb or too far away from the car
well<00:05:45.660> rather<00:05:45.960> than<00:05:46.080> going<00:05:46.320> up<00:05:46.530> it<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:47.160> should

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
well rather than going up it you should

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.150 
well rather than going up it you should
take<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.610> tion<00:05:47.970> now<00:05:48.630> what<00:05:48.840> I<00:05:48.870> mean<00:05:49.020> by<00:05:49.080> a<00:05:49.230> tion<00:05:49.620> is

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
take a tion now what I mean by a tion is

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.900 
take a tion now what I mean by a tion is
when<00:05:50.520> you<00:05:51.120> take<00:05:51.560> you<00:05:52.560> move<00:05:53.040> the<00:05:53.220> car<00:05:53.400> forwards

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
when you take you move the car forwards

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.360 
when you take you move the car forwards
again<00:05:54.030> to<00:05:54.780> give<00:05:54.930> yourself<00:05:55.290> space<00:05:55.500> so<00:05:56.130> when<00:05:56.280> you

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
again to give yourself space so when you

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.250 
again to give yourself space so when you
go<00:05:56.490> into<00:05:56.760> reverse<00:05:56.790> you<00:05:57.240> can<00:05:57.270> correct<00:05:57.720> your

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
go into reverse you can correct your

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.070 
go into reverse you can correct your
position<00:05:58.710> in<00:05:58.800> your<00:05:58.860> vehicle<00:05:59.840> now<00:06:00.840> when<00:06:00.990> you

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
position in your vehicle now when you

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.920 
position in your vehicle now when you
take<00:06:01.260> a<00:06:01.320> tion<00:06:01.880> try<00:06:02.880> not<00:06:03.000> to<00:06:03.120> take<00:06:03.300> like<00:06:03.540> one<00:06:03.810> or

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
take a tion try not to take like one or

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.840 
take a tion try not to take like one or
two<00:06:03.960> inches<00:06:04.500> because<00:06:05.070> you'll<00:06:05.370> probably<00:06:05.400> end

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
two inches because you'll probably end

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.570 
two inches because you'll probably end
up<00:06:06.000> in<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.240> same<00:06:06.420> position<00:06:06.920> so<00:06:07.920> go<00:06:08.130> forwards

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
up in the same position so go forwards

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.030 
up in the same position so go forwards
like<00:06:08.790> three<00:06:09.120> or<00:06:09.240> four<00:06:09.420> feet<00:06:09.660> bit<00:06:10.620> more<00:06:10.800> if<00:06:10.920> you

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
like three or four feet bit more if you

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.430 
like three or four feet bit more if you
need<00:06:11.190> to<00:06:11.430> and<00:06:12.060> then<00:06:12.090> you've<00:06:12.840> got<00:06:12.930> that<00:06:12.960> space

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
need to and then you've got that space

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.310 
need to and then you've got that space
to<00:06:13.980> maneuver<00:06:14.100> your<00:06:14.520> car<00:06:14.790> and<00:06:15.030> hopefully<00:06:15.570> get

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
to maneuver your car and hopefully get

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.340 
to maneuver your car and hopefully get
into<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:16.620> space<00:06:16.890> required<00:06:17.960> before<00:06:18.960> you<00:06:19.110> take

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
into the space required before you take

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.930 
into the space required before you take
your<00:06:19.380> shunt<00:06:19.760> remember<00:06:20.760> it's<00:06:20.880> really

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
your shunt remember it's really

so it could be that you front your car
sticking<00:06:42.420> out<00:06:42.570> it<00:06:42.960> could<00:06:43.170> be<00:06:43.200> that<00:06:43.440> you<00:06:44.000> took

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
forwards a little bit you could be too

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.380
