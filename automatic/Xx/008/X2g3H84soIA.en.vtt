00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
and then they had water issues again so

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.380 
and then they had water issues again so

they had to dig out the basement and

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.330 
they had to dig out the basement and
start<00:04:26.660> all<00:04:26.810> over<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.650> they<00:04:27.740> couldn't<00:04:27.980> decide

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
start all over so they couldn't decide

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.400

indoor<00:04:28.820> swimming<00:04:29.090> our<00:04:29.630> finished<00:04:29.960> basement

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
indoor swimming our finished basement

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.180 
indoor swimming our finished basement
all<00:04:30.980> right<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.730> cost<00:04:32.590> $25,000<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.770> finish<00:04:34.040> off

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
all right it cost $25,000 to finish off

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.710 
all right it cost $25,000 to finish off
this<00:04:34.370> area<00:04:34.850> I<00:04:35.090> think<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.420> does<00:04:35.540> add<00:04:35.690> value

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
this area I think it does add value

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.110 
this area I think it does add value
probably<00:04:36.380> at<00:04:36.740> least<00:04:37.040> break<00:04:37.310> even<00:04:37.460> yeah<00:04:38.090> I

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
probably at least break even yeah I

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.760 
probably at least break even yeah I
think<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.540> break-even<00:04:39.020> is<00:04:39.230> pretty<00:04:39.500> good<00:04:39.620> in

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
think a break-even is pretty good in

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.350 
think a break-even is pretty good in
this<00:04:39.860> situation<00:04:39.920> it's<00:04:40.760> certainly<00:04:41.000> gonna<00:04:41.150> make

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
this situation it's certainly gonna make

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.210 
this situation it's certainly gonna make
the<00:04:41.480> house<00:04:41.630> more<00:04:41.660> appealing<00:04:42.230> and<00:04:42.530> I<00:04:42.980> think

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
the house more appealing and I think

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.800 
the house more appealing and I think
buyers<00:04:43.400> in<00:04:43.760> this<00:04:43.880> market<00:04:44.270> are<00:04:44.360> gonna<00:04:44.450> expect

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
buyers in this market are gonna expect

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.270 
buyers in this market are gonna expect
this<00:04:45.050> kind<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.290> space<00:04:45.470> out<00:04:45.650> here<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:48.160> think<00:04:49.160> it's

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
this kind of space out here I think it's

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.710 
this kind of space out here I think it's
kind<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.550> evident<00:04:49.940> that<00:04:50.060> they<00:04:50.150> haven't<00:04:50.330> spent

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
kind of evident that they haven't spent

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.100 
kind of evident that they haven't spent
any<00:04:50.870> money<00:04:51.169> sprucing<00:04:51.919> it<00:04:51.950> up<00:04:52.190> but<00:04:53.180> they<00:04:53.900> have<00:04:54.080> a
