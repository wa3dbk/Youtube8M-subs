not<00:03:54.730> as<00:03:54.850> bulky<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.420> whatnot<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.070> paint

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
not as bulky and whatnot so the paint

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.270 
not as bulky and whatnot so the paint
job<00:03:57.760> on<00:03:57.940> on<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.840> face<00:03:59.019> is<00:03:59.260> off<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.830> hook<00:04:00.040> this
