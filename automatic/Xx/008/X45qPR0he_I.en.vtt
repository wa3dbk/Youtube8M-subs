the bigger launcher and I'm going to put

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.000 
the bigger launcher and I'm going to put
a<00:00:17.910> boom<00:00:18.150> shot<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.600> its<00:00:18.720> place<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.619> main<00:00:19.830> reason

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
a boom shot in its place the main reason

a boom shot in its place the main reason
why<00:00:20.279> I'm<00:00:20.400> doing<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.970> because<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.109> if

why I'm doing that is because if you if

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.839

you recall in last week's fnf TDM on old

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.929 
you recall in last week's fnf TDM on old
town<00:00:27.769> nobody<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> COG<00:00:29.400> team<00:00:29.670> actually

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
town nobody on the COG team actually

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
town nobody on the COG team actually
went<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.359> digger<00:00:30.599> side<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.439> controlled

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
went to digger side the controlled

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.319 
went to digger side the controlled
sniper<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> grenades<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.940> whole<00:00:33.090> time

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
sniper and the grenades the whole time

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.139 
sniper and the grenades the whole time
and<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.160> digger<00:00:35.340> launcher<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and the the digger launcher is is a

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.260 
and the the digger launcher is is a
weapon<00:00:36.420> that's<00:00:36.719> extremely<00:00:37.380> easy<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.550> avoid<00:00:38.969> in

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
weapon that's extremely easy to avoid in

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.440 
weapon that's extremely easy to avoid in
a<00:00:39.600> most<00:00:40.079> most<00:00:40.620> situations<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> digger

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
a most most situations so the digger

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.910 
a most most situations so the digger
launcher<00:00:42.809> really<00:00:43.200> wasn't<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.590> big<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
launcher really wasn't that big of a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.069 
launcher really wasn't that big of a
factor<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:45.030> guess<00:00:45.180> by<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> time<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
factor and I guess by the time the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.750 
factor and I guess by the time the
locust<00:00:46.559> team<00:00:46.770> realized<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.610> already

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
locust team realized that it was already

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.190 
locust team realized that it was already
too<00:00:47.850> late<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.329> were<00:00:48.420> already<00:00:48.600> down<00:00:48.809> too<00:00:49.079> many

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
too late they were already down too many

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.860 
too late they were already down too many
deaths<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.879> their<00:00:50.879> pushes<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.449> digger<00:00:51.629> were

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
deaths and their pushes for digger were

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.840 
deaths and their pushes for digger were
really<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.379> pointless<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.640> gonna

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
really really pointless so I'm gonna

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
really really pointless so I'm gonna
swap<00:00:54.180> boom<00:00:54.690> shot<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.140> hotel<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:58.160> for<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
swap boom shot on hotel for the for the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.189 
swap boom shot on hotel for the for the
digger<00:00:59.430> launcher<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.719> will<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.020> boon

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
digger launcher so there will be a boon

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.149 
digger launcher so there will be a boon
shot<00:01:01.410> outside<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:02.129> hotel<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.769> second<00:01:04.769> game<00:01:04.949> mode

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
shot outside on hotel a second game mode

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
shot outside on hotel a second game mode
king<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> hill<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:06.000> thought<00:01:06.810> about<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260

king of the hill I thought about this a
lot<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.740> wondering<00:01:07.860> what<00:01:08.490> would<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729

good king of the hill map and last week
king<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.330> hill<00:01:12.390> map<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.990> supposed<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> be

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
king of the hill map was supposed to be

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.399 
king of the hill map was supposed to be
over<00:01:14.189> past<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.420> unanimous<00:01:15.540> decision

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
over past but it was unanimous decision

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
over past but it was unanimous decision
in<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.920> lobby<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.790> decided<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.210> play

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
in the lobby and we decided to play

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
in the lobby and we decided to play
something<00:01:18.689> else<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.470> I'm<00:01:19.920> gonna<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.400> ahead<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
something else so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.710 
something else so I'm gonna go ahead and
put<00:01:21.299> king<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> hill<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.110> thrash<00:01:22.979> ball<00:01:23.720> yes

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720

put king of the hill on thrash ball yes
I<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.560> mean<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.680> thrash<00:01:26.040> ball<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> map

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I don't mean like thrash ball as a map

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.200 
I don't mean like thrash ball as a map
but<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:27.960> king<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.229> hill<00:01:28.409> spawns

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
but I think for king of the hill spawns

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
but I think for king of the hill spawns
make<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:31.409> bit<00:01:31.590> more<00:01:31.740> fair<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.640> know

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
make it a little bit more fair you know

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.960 
make it a little bit more fair you know
what<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> mean<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> um<00:01:34.490> king<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> hill<00:01:35.670> trash

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
what I mean so um king of the hill trash

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
what I mean so um king of the hill trash
ball<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.479> Game<00:01:36.659> two<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.560> if

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
ball is going to be Game two now if

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.910 
ball is going to be Game two now if
there<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> tie<00:01:39.180> breaker<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.470> tied<00:01:40.650> one

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there is a tie breaker if it's tied one

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
there is a tie breaker if it's tied one
to<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.000> roll<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> execution

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
to one you know we roll that execution

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.679 
to one you know we roll that execution
as<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> tiebreaking<00:01:43.710> match<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.689> thought

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
as a tiebreaking match right I thought

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.030 
as a tiebreaking match right I thought
