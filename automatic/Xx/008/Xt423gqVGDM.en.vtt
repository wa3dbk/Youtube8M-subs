00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.180 
little bit more calm you know we have
less<00:00:47.059> pressure<00:00:47.269> because<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.750> I<00:00:48.199> won<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:49.040> last

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
less pressure because I I won that last

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.670 
less pressure because I I won that last
year<00:00:49.489> but<00:00:50.180> anyway<00:00:50.510> always<00:00:50.900> exciting<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.530> come

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
year but anyway always exciting to come

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.460 
year but anyway always exciting to come
back<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:52.370> know<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.489> lot<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:52.760> motions<00:00:53.409> but<00:00:54.409> I

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
back and you know a lot of motions but I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.569 
back and you know a lot of motions but I
would<00:00:54.650> think<00:00:54.800> there'd<00:00:54.920> be<00:00:54.980> more<00:00:55.250> pressure

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
would think there'd be more pressure

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.970 
would think there'd be more pressure
because<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.540> expectation<00:00:57.230> is<00:00:57.350> oh<00:00:57.500> why

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
because the the expectation is oh why

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.670 
because the the expectation is oh why
should<00:00:58.220> win<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.460> again<00:00:58.930> maybe<00:00:59.930> but<00:01:02.260> I<00:01:03.260> cannot

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
have that same chemistry that same

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.279 
have that same chemistry that same
dynamic<00:04:47.949> to<00:04:48.370> make<00:04:48.550> one<00:04:49.000> another<00:04:49.240> greater<00:04:49.750> than

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
dynamic to make one another greater than

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.499 
dynamic to make one another greater than
if<00:04:50.500> they<00:04:50.650> had<00:04:50.680> not<00:04:50.979> been<00:04:51.669> playing<00:04:52.000> tennis<00:04:52.180> if

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
if they had not been playing tennis if

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:58.399 
if they had not been playing tennis if
they're<00:04:52.689> not<00:04:52.840> existed<00:04:54.210> no<00:04:55.210> no<00:04:55.509> no<00:04:55.689> but<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:57.360> think

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
they're not existed no no no but I think

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.320 
they're not existed no no no but I think
every<00:04:59.409> rivalry<00:04:59.949> is<00:05:00.159> completely<00:05:00.849> different

every rivalry is completely different

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.800 
every rivalry is completely different

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
few time ago and further in mind we're

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.899

having a lot of matches last couple of

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.790 
having a lot of matches last couple of
years<00:05:10.210> now<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.539> exciting<00:05:11.110> is<00:05:11.199> emotional<00:05:11.680> but

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
years now is exciting is emotional but

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.580 
years now is exciting is emotional but
at<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.069> same<00:05:12.190> time<00:05:12.509> we<00:05:13.509> are<00:05:13.629> we<00:05:14.199> have<00:05:14.349> a<00:05:14.379> very

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
at the same time we are we have a very
