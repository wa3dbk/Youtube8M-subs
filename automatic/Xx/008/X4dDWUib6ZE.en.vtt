we<00:01:32.939> really<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.420> believe<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.799> does

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
we really do believe that that does

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.210 
we really do believe that that does
actually<00:01:35.970> permit<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.200> students<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.770> develop

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
actually permit the students to develop

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.819 
actually permit the students to develop
the<00:01:38.369> kinds<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.820> relationships<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:40.200> potential

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the kinds of relationships the potential

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.399 
the kinds of relationships the potential
to<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> mentoring<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.780> known<00:01:43.079> by

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to have the mentoring and to be known by

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.069 
to have the mentoring and to be known by
faculty<00:01:43.770> much<00:01:44.700> more<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.299> than<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.750> schools

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
faculty much more so than in schools

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.020 
faculty much more so than in schools
that<00:01:46.350> are<00:01:46.500> much<00:01:46.680> larger<00:01:47.189> size<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.700> think

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that are much larger size I think

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
that are much larger size I think
sometimes<00:01:48.659> also<00:01:49.049> parents<00:01:49.409> look<00:01:49.649> at<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
sometimes also parents look at the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.219 
sometimes also parents look at the
rating<00:01:50.280> data<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.850> they<00:01:51.360> say<00:01:51.659> well<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
rating data and they say well the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.249 
rating data and they say well the
employers<00:01:52.829> will<00:01:53.040> make<00:01:53.310> decisions<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.810> this

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
employers will make decisions on this

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.219 
employers will make decisions on this
ranking<00:01:55.740> data<00:01:56.040> about<00:01:56.880> who<00:01:57.149> gains<00:01:57.479> access<00:01:57.840> to

the<00:01:58.560> career<00:01:59.369> opportunities<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.360> don't<00:02:00.990> think

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the career opportunities I don't think

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.880 
the career opportunities I don't think
that's<00:02:01.439> accurate<00:02:02.299> representation<00:02:03.299> either

that's accurate representation either
