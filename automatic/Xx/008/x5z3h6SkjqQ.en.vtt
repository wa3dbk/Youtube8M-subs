secondary school which was a very very
long<00:00:16.049> time<00:00:16.290> ago<00:00:16.470> myself<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.029> at<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.899> time<00:00:19.110> we

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
long time ago myself and at the time we

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.960 
long time ago myself and at the time we
used<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.470> just<00:00:19.649> do<00:00:19.770> those<00:00:19.890> sachets<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.579> washing

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970

used to just do those sachets of washing
wash<00:00:21.149> out<00:00:21.390> normally<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.200> red<00:00:22.470> or<00:00:22.710> blonde

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.729 
wash out normally like a red or blonde
and<00:00:23.579> it<00:00:23.669> would<00:00:23.759> never<00:00:23.910> go<00:00:24.059> blonde<00:00:24.360> or<00:00:24.599> so<00:00:25.529> like

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:25.739 
and it would never go blonde or so like

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
hole and then you put it into the box so

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.279 
hole and then you put it into the box so
it<00:01:42.939> doesn't<00:01:43.209> spill<00:01:43.420> over<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:43.810> get<00:01:44.049> anything

it doesn't spill over and get anything
dirty<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.670> then<00:01:45.819> you<00:01:45.970> mix<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.390> up<00:01:46.509> like<00:01:46.810> a

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
dirty and then you mix it up like a

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.740 
dirty and then you mix it up like a
shake<00:01:47.739> and<00:01:47.890> make<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.039> kind<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.459> thing<00:01:48.660> and<00:01:49.660> then

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
shake and make a kind of thing and then

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.199 
shake and make a kind of thing and then
it<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:49.989> literally<00:01:50.440> a<00:01:50.590> case<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.190> squeezing<00:01:52.119> it

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
it is literally a case of squeezing it

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.600 
it is literally a case of squeezing it
out<00:01:52.330> into<00:01:52.509> your<00:01:52.660> roots<00:01:52.989> scrunching<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.190> and

got<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.450> lot<00:02:01.869> of<00:02:01.899> hair<00:02:02.349> it's<00:02:02.590> very<00:02:02.800> thick<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.869> I

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
got a lot of hair it's very thick and I

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.699 
got a lot of hair it's very thick and I
think<00:02:05.319> one<00:02:06.039> bottle<00:02:06.899> probably<00:02:07.899> wasn't<00:02:08.440> enough

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
think one bottle probably wasn't enough

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.610 
think one bottle probably wasn't enough
for<00:02:09.310> my<00:02:09.489> hair<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:10.000> mean<00:02:10.269> I<00:02:10.509> managed<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.140> do<00:02:11.349> my

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
for my hair I mean I managed to do my

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.490

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
route like up till here and I did the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.199 
route like up till here and I did the
ends<00:02:14.830> but<00:02:14.980> I've<00:02:15.129> dyed<00:02:15.400> my<00:02:15.670> friends<00:02:16.030> hair

recently with an at-home hair dye in her
whole<00:02:18.159> head<00:02:18.489> was<00:02:19.200> really<00:02:20.200> wet<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.500> slimy<00:02:20.890> and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
whole head was really wet and slimy and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.830 
whole head was really wet and slimy and
mine<00:02:21.489> wasn't<00:02:21.879> like<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.360> was<00:02:22.510> kind<00:02:22.780> of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
just covered a little bit and so yeah if

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.339 
just covered a little bit and so yeah if
I<00:02:26.319> was<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.650> do<00:02:26.800> another<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.400> would<00:02:28.239> get<00:02:28.659> two<00:02:28.900> if

hair<00:02:33.700> then<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.000> would<00:02:34.269> suggest<00:02:34.420> getting<00:02:34.720> two<00:02:35.050> if

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
you can afford that and if not just try

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.050 
you can afford that and if not just try
and<00:02:40.569> make<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.870> make<00:02:41.739> sure<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.250> mixed<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.790> as

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
and make it make sure it's mixed in as

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.570 
and make it make sure it's mixed in as
much<00:02:43.209> as<00:02:43.269> possible<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:44.019> did<00:02:44.379> that<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.739> literally

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
much as possible I did that I literally

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.070 
much as possible I did that I literally
rubbed<00:02:45.849> it<00:02:46.030> everywhere<00:02:46.510> because<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.870> didn't

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
rubbed it everywhere because I didn't

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.250 
rubbed it everywhere because I didn't
want<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.260> have<00:02:47.440> big<00:02:47.650> patches<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.900> shows

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
want to have big patches and it shows

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.309 
want to have big patches and it shows
you<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.799> Box<00:02:51.010> what<00:02:51.670> your<00:02:52.209> color<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:53.050> likely

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
you on the Box what your color is likely

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.390 
you on the Box what your color is likely
to<00:02:53.560> go<00:02:53.740> like<00:02:54.520> if<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.630> have

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
that color hair and I would say that my

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.460 
that color hair and I would say that my
hair<00:02:59.519> underneath<00:02:59.970> was<00:03:00.450> probably<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.140> kind

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
hair underneath was probably this kind

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.789 
hair underneath was probably this kind
of<00:03:01.530> color<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.579> hasn't<00:03:03.090> gone<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:04.200> color

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
of color and it hasn't gone that color

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.710 
of color and it hasn't gone that color
and<00:03:07.159> but<00:03:08.159> it<00:03:08.280> has<00:03:08.519> lifted<00:03:10.280> I'd<00:03:11.280> say<00:03:11.640> one<00:03:12.420> or<00:03:12.540> two

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
and but it has lifted I'd say one or two

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.649 
and but it has lifted I'd say one or two
shades<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:14.040> has<00:03:14.280> definitely<00:03:14.939> lifted<00:03:15.450> it

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
shades it has definitely lifted it

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.920

an awful smells like a burning smell
there<00:03:49.709> was<00:03:49.799> none<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.069> us<00:03:50.250> got<00:03:50.609> no<00:03:50.790> ammonia<00:03:51.239> in
