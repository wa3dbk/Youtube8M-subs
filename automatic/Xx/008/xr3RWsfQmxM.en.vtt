00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 one of the most asked questions 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.359
 women is where I have the best 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.309
 stripe the hair to the center or to the side and to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.380
 answer this question and tell us 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.630
 why is our friend with us 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.630
 stylist of the stars as my friend 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.340
 good 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.810
 good question what are you doing 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 it depends on many things nowadays the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.199
 stripes are used a lot we have seen in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.269
 many carpets women combed with 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.130
 line at the side, line at the middle and good 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.140
 It also depends a lot on what kind of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.570
 face we have for example that we brought 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.250
 here to our beautiful claudia that she 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.690
 the lady who is at home is not 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.100
 looking has the round face many 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.629
 women think they have a face 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.579
 deep to each other but not in this 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.739
 case to determine it you have to take the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.780
 hair and see the way in this case that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.059
 has in the round form and is 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.039
 important in this case to make a streak 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.500
 from the side the line at the side does not go 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.949
 lengthen the face and it will not make the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.780
 face look more oval and much more and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.250
 It is also important to fine tune it 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.960
 example this I just cut him to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.390
 claudia that she wants him long hair 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.270
 I cut some strands so they can see 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.680
 at home with some boxes that came 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.450
 forward that fall on the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.210
 cheekbones and in this way also 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.100
 we disguise and make an optical effect 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.200
 so that women see their faces 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 more oval that's a detail 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.580
 spectacular another thing always when the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.619
 face is round does not have to have 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.930
 volume on the sides has to be 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.580
 flatter and if we want to give it volume 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.680
 we give from the middle to the tips 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.270
 as in this case I only work with 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:42.090
 this pincer that exactly are the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.520
 little tips I made them a divine 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.920
 well here we see she has her face 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.190
 more elongated with how much goat where 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.590
 we are here here perfect as 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.020
 you have the most rectangular face 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.270
 and more elongated in this case is very 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.880
 important not to give volume in the part 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.250
 superior and always make a line to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.899
 half the line to the center what is going to 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.580
 to do is to see my face more 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.039
 round or more oval which is the effect 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.440
 that we want to achieve in this case I with 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.940
 says what I worked for was to give it a little 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.130
 more movement 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.110
 is a little higher because as 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.180
 He has a long face, you have to give him 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.060
 volume on the sides so that what 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.680
 let's make more oval or rounder what 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.290
 that we work here from the movement 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.420
 and see how it looks spectacular and also 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.920
 as we see conceals much and 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.260
 puts the face more oval than what 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.900
 we want to achieve for many women if 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.290
 they encourage themselves to cut their hair a little 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.910
 shorter since it is already being by 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.250
 example she is towering has hair 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.200
 long elongated face if you 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.910
 cut a little more and we take them to the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.930
 shoulder height 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.930
 it is used a lot 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.260
 is a term that we have shown in 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.100
 another of our segments would be left 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.370
 very much and breaks that theme of length 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.200
 so you know they look spectacular and 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.370
 Narbona asks people where they have 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.410
 to write of course that I 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.390
 write to twitter leonardo rocco robbery 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.760
 with folds and of course as always 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.680
 We are waiting for you to send us those 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.450
 requirements to make them make 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.580
 overs as we do here on a new day 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.310

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.050
 well you know at home choose the race or 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.940
 the part that best fits them can 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.740
 being in the middle can be cost and for 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.020
 course depending on your face and that 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.120
