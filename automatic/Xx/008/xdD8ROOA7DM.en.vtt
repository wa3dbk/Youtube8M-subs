really missed my vertical of bread but I

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.310 
really missed my vertical of bread but I
didn't<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.270> deal<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> again

didn't want to like deal with that again
so<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> decided<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.640> would<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.760> Pierce<00:00:51.210> my

so I decided I would just Pierce my
regular<00:00:51.840> bread<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.530> put<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> circular<00:00:53.640> barbell

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210

in<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.129> mimic<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> appearance<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
in it to kind of mimic the appearance of

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.069 
in it to kind of mimic the appearance of
a<00:00:57.239> vertical<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.690> Brett<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.170> um<00:00:59.840> that's<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.050> I

because I don't like the way the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.249 
because I don't like the way the
in-between<00:01:46.439> sizes<00:01:46.680> look<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.220> little<00:01:47.430> bit<00:01:48.259> but
