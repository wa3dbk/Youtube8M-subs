00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.940
 remains in ten 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.450

 minute the pumping shot puts in series 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.370
 balsamini difficulties that still succeed 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.049
 not to let the ball enter the net 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.299
 to the thirteenth on the developments of a 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.299
 free kick the blow claims it 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.470
 a penalty for hand ball but the referee 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.860
 beltrami di rimini does not grant the 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.320
 maximum punishment 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.270

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.380
 pecks red for insults to the manager 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.810
 the race follows him with 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.280
 an expulsion for foul play 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.230
 the race closes with public screams 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.000
 and insults between players and managers 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.680
 without leaving out the different ones 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.440
 disputes with the triad 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.030
 arbitration in the first ninety minutes of the 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.350
 game we saw two teams that 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.580
 they struggled cleanly for 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.620
 to earn salvation 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.630
 in the last 30 minutes the game is 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.400
 generated many complicit mistakes 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.980
 made by the race director and two 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.480
 existing in this regard the 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.980
 president of the body is Andrea Vignali 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.020
 does not want to release any 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.730
 statement and defends himself from his 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.890
 removal from the forced field 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.870
 by the referee saying he never had 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.340
 insulted the race direction but 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.070
 declaring to have challenged his own 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.990
 players trying to spur them on this 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.820
 defeat but the Giallorossi directly 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.130
 second category without the possibility 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.140
 to play the playouts for the 3rd 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.730
 I saludecio instead this victory 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.830
 means the possibility of being able to 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:55.810
 save by playing the category with the 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.030
 pinarella a game a bit painful 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.400
 I would also say a little too male and 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.430
 especially in the last quarter of an hour for 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.890
 understands the importance of the race no 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.479
 inside out therefore of consequences with i 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.120
 extra time 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.330
 we have suffered ourselves and them 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.270
 probably us now in this 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.229
 moment we changed something 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.940
 we have a pretty tough team then 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.100
 120 minutes make us feel one 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.590
 beautiful match for the first 90 minutes 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.830
 after that something happened 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.919
 actually even a little complicate the error 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.540
 by the referee that is both for one 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.210
 that for the other team I would say that everything 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.500
 in all arbitrage is not gone bad 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.370
 in the sense that he arbitrated a little 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.229
 however, English is not so much this 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.169
 problem problem is that you are with 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:51.040
 water in the throat a decisive match 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:53.290
 you know everything is in it 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.030
 there is emotion there is some foul 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.430
 in addition there is ours which has been 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.780
 made to throw out we're there cramps of 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.930
 those other guys 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.000
 clear is how far you are in out is 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.919
 just a final game dry and then 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.250
 it is not dry because we go pinarella 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.270
 Sunday where the equals and us are enough 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.789
 we're out anyway 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.680
 however for the moment we have taken the 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.849
 results since Sunday for the hair 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.849
 so we believe it
