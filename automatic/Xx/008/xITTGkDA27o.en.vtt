00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.490
 that is, and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.570
 to square tip impacts by

 they must be super discreet 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.390
 both must be leather or at least 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.390
 it seems I remember for love 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.610
 get away from the chromium maxi trillions or 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.610
 with gigantic logos 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.670
 overwhelming 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.170
 that leave it for the rodeos and the 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.690
 charreada and those cuts for the office 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.550
 and always remember that the cover 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.280
 reading what should be the most 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.030
 discrete possible the simplest the most 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.970
 useful point number 4 attention jokes the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.970
 PriceMinister world attention 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:36.140
 the function that you think big 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.680
 in large and the largest 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.720
 but this time cut by fa 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.970
 I think about the little one if I do not plan 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.230
 wants to leave the boxes opts for the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.230
 smaller pictures 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.480
 a tie clip and a handkerchief in the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:56.840
 pocket to look flawless 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.540
 number 5 access orizaba at the point 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.810
 number 4 I will have to use tie clips and 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.840
 handkerchief I already know that they are not super basic 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.540
 for the office but but even though 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.489
 many seem too comfortable for 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.989
 grandparents these two accessories 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.040
 they started sometimes on the catwalks 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.400
 since 2003 and today they are same 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.650
 I repeat 1 2 at the time of sant costume 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.230
 You can even incorporate them into 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:31.180
 the casual business style without fear of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.180
 see you ridiculous basically point 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.380
 6 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.840
 many stylists chose them not to 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.790
 wear jeans in the office but the truth 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.770
 is that times change 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.880
 I feel office is allowed to wear jeans 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.880
 and it's Friday 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.290
 h 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.110
 my advice is that you opt for jeans 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:03.810
 dark and slightly washed out this 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.459
 to keep your professionalism to the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.519
 part time office dress 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.459
 but that you keep seeing relaxed 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:16.500
 whenever you use prince big office is 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:19.470
 super important that you're fixed that 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.250
 use a tie and put on a blazer 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.420
 in the absence of dress pants 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.050
 tie and blazer point number 7 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:33.170
 gentlemen gentlemen please is the rule 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.140
 of gold if you do not want to look like the classic 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.140
 gave the coma of 15 years please 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.770
 get in your shirt your pants either 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.070
 shirt or polo always always advances 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.070
 Never 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.320
 point shaft number 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.560
 Wearing t-shirts and step t-shirts 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.210
 I will include sports shoes 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.030
 it just is not successful in parana 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.360
 office breaks any code of good 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.420
 dress aside all those garments 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.550
 and sports shoes 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.070
 for weekends with friends 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:25.080
 with the bride with the family for the 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.730
 office do not forget points 2 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.010
 and we're not too sure to use a 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.700
 pole to go to the office for that from 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.740
 break the code of moriles dare 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.700
 but do it responsibly 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.860
 forget about the striking colors logos 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:44.620
 immense prints and embroidery 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.800
 we avoid the combination of a mono pole 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.840
 dark color and nice persimmons that 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.840
 will result in a graph 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:03.110
 and point number 10 at the end the council 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:05.909
 final my final advice is that guys 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.599
 they say that the first impression is the one that 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:11.699
 more account so take advantage of the view 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.129
 as well as the best possible version of 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:17.370
 yourselves you decide you mix if 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.250
 as nimes or in office tandil but 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.810
 yes before leaving your house 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.870
 make sure you feel comfortable 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.569
 possible is the most important thing 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.569
 how you feel is what you are going to reflect 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.250

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.270

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.400
 because whenever I'm watching the 

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:54.940
 language 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.940
