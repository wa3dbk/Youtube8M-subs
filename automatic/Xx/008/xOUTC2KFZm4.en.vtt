00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.580
 power consisting of eight levels 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.030

 each player must move his turn 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.010
 this pyramid of one interest 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.380
 for this he makes an attack 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.810
 which can be sent to a blog or 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.409
 up 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.450
 but by no means down 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.070
 attack to succeed the attacker's strength 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.520
 must exceed by virtue of defending 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.400
 at least unite 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.950
 tribesman standing out in the hierarchy 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.620
 older than inferior therefore 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.740
 his strength is always reduced by 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.250
 unit 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.740
 also the player can produce 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.620
 combined attack combining total 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.140
 two or even more tribesmen of one 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.950
 clan which are located by 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.760
 next door to a common goal 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.780
 the consequences of an attack are always changing 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.830
 hierarchy of authority 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.340
 defeated idea with leaving this group a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.370
 his place is the only one 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.190
 attacking 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.640
 or the strongest of the attackers 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.720
 with equality of strength advantage 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.409
 possess a woman and here with equality and 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.789

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.950
 the player himself makes a choice who will go 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.900
 upstairs 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.260
 vacant space pyramid of power 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.450

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.420
 empty it immediately takes from of two 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.580
 lower interest which 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.990

 the lower tier of the games he occupies one of 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.840
 card timing and then passes the move 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.739
 the next 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.669
 as soon as all the players ran out 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.639
 cards on hand the game comes to an end 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.399
 how empire is sorted and 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.399
 laid out on the pyramid from top to bottom 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:23.809
 top 7 second floor 6 third 5 and so on 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.699
 this is the victory points 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.719

 maximum 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.340
 quantity period and becomes 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.839
