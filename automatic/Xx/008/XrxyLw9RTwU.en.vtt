your iPhone or iPad to a projector there
are<00:00:14.580> two<00:00:14.730> ways<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:14.969> we<00:00:15.179> can<00:00:15.269> do<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.780> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
are two ways that we can do this and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.420 
are two ways that we can do this and
that<00:00:16.080> would<00:00:16.320> be<00:00:16.470> either<00:00:16.710> through<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.130> wired

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
that would be either through a wired

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.359 
that would be either through a wired
cable<00:00:17.730> or<00:00:18.109> through<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.470> wireless<00:00:19.920> connection

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
cable or through a wireless connection

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.890 
cable or through a wireless connection
so<00:00:21.090> we're<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.390> talk<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.720> first

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
about the wired connectivity and that's

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599 
about the wired connectivity and that's
pretty<00:00:24.930> simple<00:00:25.260> really<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.369> an

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
wireless network you need to go into

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.209 
wireless network you need to go into
your<00:01:53.939> settings<00:01:54.439> make<00:01:55.439> sure<00:01:55.470> your<00:01:55.740> Wi-Fi<00:01:56.189> is

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
your settings make sure your Wi-Fi is

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
projector has its own network address so

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.130 
projector has its own network address so
we're<00:02:02.850> gonna<00:02:02.939> go<00:02:03.149> ahead<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.450> join<00:02:03.869> that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
now it's on my screen here it's gonna

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.180 
now it's on my screen here it's gonna
take<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> couple<00:02:54.820> of<00:02:55.120> seconds<00:02:55.360> there<00:02:55.540> we<00:02:55.630> go

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
take a couple of seconds there we go

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.350 
take a couple of seconds there we go
internet<00:02:57.190> connection<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.000> wireless

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
internet connection and the wireless

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.970 
internet connection and the wireless
capabilities<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.470> takes<00:02:59.740> a<00:02:59.860> little

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
capabilities is that it takes a little

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.740 
capabilities is that it takes a little
bit<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.190> time<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.120> see<00:03:01.270> I<00:03:01.300> can<00:03:01.570> go<00:03:01.600> ahead

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
bit of time you can see I can go ahead

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.670 
bit of time you can see I can go ahead
and<00:03:01.930> scroll<00:03:02.170> up<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:04.110> now<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.260> Scrolls<00:03:05.530> up

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
and scroll up and now it Scrolls up

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.660 
and scroll up and now it Scrolls up
there<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:06.880> not<00:03:07.270> as<00:03:07.680> smooth<00:03:08.680> maybe<00:03:09.070> as<00:03:09.430> far

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
there so it's not as smooth maybe as far

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.160 
there so it's not as smooth maybe as far
as<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:09.940> transitions<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.870> what<00:03:11.020> you're
