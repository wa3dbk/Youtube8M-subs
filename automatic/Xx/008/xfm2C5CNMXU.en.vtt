was killed it would be good for them
because<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.329> would<00:04:10.389> kill<00:04:10.600> competition<00:04:11.350> but<00:04:12.130> I

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160

have a feeling there was a bunch of

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.229 
have a feeling there was a bunch of
suits<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.650> sat<00:04:14.920> down<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.370> said<00:04:15.489> what<00:04:15.819> would

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
suits that sat down and said what would

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.659 
suits that sat down and said what would
benefit<00:04:16.780> us<00:04:16.959> more<00:04:17.289> financially<00:04:18.100> having

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
benefit us more financially having

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.490 
benefit us more financially having
competition<00:04:19.060> be<00:04:19.630> killed<00:04:19.930> or<00:04:20.200> stifled

the
legal<00:04:26.930> bribes<00:04:27.229> that<00:04:27.650> would<00:04:27.770> be<00:04:27.889> able<00:04:28.039> to<00:04:28.160> be
