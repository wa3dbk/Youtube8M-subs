because I really want to train my

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.310 
because I really want to train my
attack<00:02:13.350> but<00:02:14.190> their<00:02:14.460> weakness<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.210> step<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.260> you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
attack but their weakness is step so you

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.190 
attack but their weakness is step so you
will<00:02:16.530> need<00:02:16.710> like<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.060> dragon<00:02:18.060> scimitar<00:02:18.600> or<00:02:18.780> even

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.570 
will need like a dragon scimitar or even
a<00:02:20.510> rune<00:02:21.510> scimitar<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:22.260> better<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.160> then<00:02:23.310> just

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
a rune scimitar is better and then just

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.000 
a rune scimitar is better and then just
take<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.820> step<00:02:24.300> option<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.470> you're<00:02:25.830> like

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
take the step option but if you're like

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.590 
take the step option but if you're like
me<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.550> already<00:02:26.700> got<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.330> high

wipe I guess but yeah you will kill them

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.610 
wipe I guess but yeah you will kill them
slower<00:02:35.160> for<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> special<00:02:36.600> weapon<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.380> take
