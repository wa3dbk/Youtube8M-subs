but<00:01:27.560> someone<00:01:28.189> I<00:01:28.220> think<00:01:28.490> at<00:01:28.820> some<00:01:28.880> point

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000

with<00:04:49.849> it<00:04:50.110> it<00:04:51.110> takes<00:04:51.289> a<00:04:51.439> little<00:04:51.620> bit<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:52.009> getting

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219 
with it it takes a little bit of getting

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:53.769 
with it it takes a little bit of getting
used<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.610> driving<00:04:52.879> in<00:04:53.090> opposed<00:04:53.449> to<00:04:53.659> the

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:53.779 
used to driving in opposed to the

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.749 
used to driving in opposed to the
founder<00:04:54.199> because<00:04:54.499> the<00:04:55.069> engines<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:55.669> back

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
founder because the engines in the back

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.890 
founder because the engines in the back
and<00:04:57.849> westbound<00:04:58.849> or<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.210> engine<00:04:59.449> is<00:04:59.539> up<00:04:59.629> front

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
and westbound or the engine is up front

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.920 
and westbound or the engine is up front
so<00:05:00.620> when<00:05:00.770> you<00:05:00.830> hit<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.069> gas<00:05:01.219> pedal<00:05:01.659> you<00:05:02.659> don't

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
so when you hit the gas pedal you don't

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.300 
so when you hit the gas pedal you don't
really<00:05:03.110> hear<00:05:03.379> anything<00:05:03.590> unless<00:05:03.889> you<00:05:04.069> get<00:05:04.189> the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
really hear anything unless you get the

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.839 
really hear anything unless you get the
windows<00:05:04.639> open<00:05:04.789> so<00:05:05.060> you<00:05:05.150> can't<00:05:05.389> tell<00:05:06.759> you<00:05:07.759> know

you don't hear the engine revving up or

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.850 
you don't hear the engine revving up or
anything<00:05:09.439> like<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:10.099> normal<00:05:10.819> vehicle<00:05:11.529> so<00:05:12.529> it's

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
anything like a normal vehicle so it's

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.800 
anything like a normal vehicle so it's
kind<00:05:13.129> of<00:05:13.219> take<00:05:14.029> some<00:05:14.180> getting<00:05:14.449> used<00:05:14.479> to

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
kind of take some getting used to

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.779 
kind of take some getting used to
driving<00:05:15.680> but<00:05:16.719> it's<00:05:17.719> not<00:05:17.870> too<00:05:18.080> bad

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.549 

overall<00:05:21.539> I<00:05:21.569> think<00:05:21.749> it's<00:05:22.020> gonna<00:05:22.169> work<00:05:22.259> out

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:22.559 
overall I think it's gonna work out

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.969 
overall I think it's gonna work out
great<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:24.180> more<00:05:24.990> pose<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.529> what<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:25.710> like

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
great and the more pose to what I like

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.029 
great and the more pose to what I like
there's<00:05:26.309> more<00:05:26.999> along<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.300> lines<00:05:27.449> without<00:05:28.039> one

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
there's more along the lines without one

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.679 
there's more along the lines without one
so<00:05:30.439> it's<00:05:31.439> kind<00:05:31.620> of<00:05:31.650> work<00:05:31.830> out<00:05:32.009> pretty<00:05:32.249> good<00:05:32.689> do
