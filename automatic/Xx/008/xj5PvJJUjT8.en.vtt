starts<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.180> turn<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.659> we're<00:01:51.840> turning<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
starts to turn and we're turning on the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.770 
starts to turn and we're turning on the
inside<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.250> our<00:01:53.340> foot<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:54.329> I've<00:01:54.420> heard<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
inside of our foot now I've heard the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.649 
inside of our foot now I've heard the
term<00:01:54.810> use<00:01:55.229> squish<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.890> bug

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
term use squish the bug

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.030 
term use squish the bug
sometimes<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.869> term<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.740> not

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
sometimes that term is really not

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
sometimes that term is really not
appropriate<00:01:59.880> because<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.540> don't<00:02:00.750> want<00:02:00.930> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
appropriate because we don't want to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
appropriate because we don't want to
turn<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.500> foot<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:02.520> we're<00:02:02.759> squishing<00:02:03.210> above

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
turn the foot like we're squishing above

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
turn the foot like we're squishing above
with<00:02:03.659> much<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.049> our<00:02:04.200> foot<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.799> ground<00:02:04.950> we

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
with much of our foot on the ground we

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.520 
with much of our foot on the ground we
want<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.000> turn<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> inside<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> our<00:02:07.229> foot

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
want to turn on the inside of our foot

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.919 
want to turn on the inside of our foot
so<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.550> our<00:02:08.729> foot<00:02:09.000> turned<00:02:09.239> quickly<00:02:09.539> to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
so we can get our foot turned quickly to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.780 
so we can get our foot turned quickly to
turn<00:02:10.170> our<00:02:10.349> hips<00:02:10.500> quickly<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.670> our

we get to a position called bat lag and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.970 
we get to a position called bat lag and
that's<00:02:24.780> taking<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.200> knob<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.830> ball
