and<00:07:16.680> that<00:07:17.680> was<00:07:17.770> probably<00:07:17.890> more<00:07:18.190> than<00:07:18.280> enough

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
and that was probably more than enough

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.640 
and that was probably more than enough
at<00:07:18.610> the<00:07:18.670> first<00:07:18.850> episode<00:07:19.210> I<00:07:19.410> think<00:07:20.410> it's<00:07:20.530> pretty

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
at the first episode I think it's pretty

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.100 
at the first episode I think it's pretty
clear<00:07:20.830> that<00:07:20.920> writing<00:07:21.340> is<00:07:21.400> very<00:07:21.490> complicated

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110 
clear that writing is very complicated

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.090 
clear that writing is very complicated
there<00:07:23.110> are<00:07:23.200> lots<00:07:23.380> of<00:07:23.500> factors<00:07:23.650> that<00:07:23.890> go<00:07:24.010> into

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
there are lots of factors that go into

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.740 
there are lots of factors that go into
creating<00:07:24.340> a<00:07:24.700> piece<00:07:24.850> of<00:07:24.880> literature<00:07:25.210> and<00:07:25.390> we

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:25.750 
creating a piece of literature and we

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.120 
creating a piece of literature and we
haven't<00:07:25.960> even<00:07:26.050> kicked<00:07:26.320> the<00:07:26.380> dust<00:07:26.620> off<00:07:26.800> some<00:07:26.830> of

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
haven't even kicked the dust off some of

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.530 
haven't even kicked the dust off some of
the<00:07:27.220> gigantic<00:07:27.700> topics<00:07:28.030> mentioned<00:07:28.150> in<00:07:28.450> this

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:28.540 
the gigantic topics mentioned in this

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.570 
the gigantic topics mentioned in this
episode<00:07:28.780> so<00:07:29.710> we'll<00:07:29.890> just<00:07:29.920> save<00:07:30.160> some<00:07:30.190> more<00:07:30.520> of
