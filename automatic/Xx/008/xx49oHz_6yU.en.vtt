of the whole spine of the book and that
will<00:00:34.590> give<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.040> part<00:00:35.430> its<00:00:36.050> cover<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.200> it's

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
will give this part its cover and it's

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.240 
will give this part its cover and it's
protection<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.719> normal<00:00:40.250> book

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
protection if it was just a normal book

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.180 
protection if it was just a normal book
that<00:00:41.550> was<00:00:41.700> still<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.899> good<00:00:43.320> shape<00:00:43.620> down<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that was still in good shape down the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
that was still in good shape down the
side<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.789> would<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.120> run<00:00:45.600> thinner<00:00:46.469> strips<00:00:46.890> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
side I would just run thinner strips of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.430 
side I would just run thinner strips of
tape<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:47.640> down<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.059> side<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.230> down

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
tape one down this side and one down

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.799 
tape one down this side and one down
this<00:00:49.620> side<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> thicker<00:00:51.030> piece<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.539> tape

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
this side but the thicker piece of tape

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
this side but the thicker piece of tape
will<00:00:52.170> accomplish<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.100> same<00:00:53.309> thing<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.910> will

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
will accomplish the same thing it will

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.529 
will accomplish the same thing it will
cover<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.010> strings<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.399> both<00:00:56.670> sides<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
cover the strings on both sides and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.170 
cover the strings on both sides and
it'll<00:00:57.750> also<00:00:57.870> give<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.590> part<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> book<00:00:59.969> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it'll also give this part of the book a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
it'll also give this part of the book a
nice<00:01:00.890> protection<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> let's<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.470> ahead<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
nice protection so let's go ahead and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.450 
nice protection so let's go ahead and
get<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> piece<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.060> tape<00:01:06.470> we're<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.979> do

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
get a piece of tape we're going to do

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
get a piece of tape we're going to do
the<00:01:08.610> same<00:01:08.850> thing<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.360> did<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.630> top<00:01:09.900> we

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the same thing that we did on top we

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.840 
the same thing that we did on top we
left<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.650> little<00:01:10.830> bit<00:01:10.950> over<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> edge<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.760> we

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
left it a little bit over the edge so we

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.090 
left it a little bit over the edge so we
can<00:01:12.030> stick<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.409> when<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> measure<00:01:13.799> your

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
can stick it in so when you measure your

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.270 
can stick it in so when you measure your
tape<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.810> cut<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> leave<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.189> bit

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
tape so if I cut it leave a little bit

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.410 
tape so if I cut it leave a little bit
over<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> top<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:22.939> also<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.409> bottom<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.950> well

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
over the top and also the bottom as well

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.640 
over the top and also the bottom as well
so<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> cut<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> right<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
so if I cut it right about here that

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.929 
so if I cut it right about here that
should<00:01:28.890> give<00:01:29.040> me<00:01:29.070> enough<00:01:29.189> space<00:01:31.759> on<00:01:32.759> both

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
should give me enough space on both

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.770 
should give me enough space on both
edges<00:01:34.970> actually<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.090> need<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> knife

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
edges actually we don't need the knife

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.969 
edges actually we don't need the knife
we<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.350> rip<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.770> tape<00:01:39.680> put<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> book

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
we can just rip this tape put the book

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:51.280 
we can just rip this tape put the book
on<00:01:41.130> its<00:01:41.369> side

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.470 

if<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.860> get<00:01:52.160> right<00:01:52.400> into<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.940> middle<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:53.390> also

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
if I get right into the middle and also

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.300 
if I get right into the middle and also
we<00:01:53.720> want<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:53.990> cover<00:01:54.260> up<00:01:54.440> those<00:01:54.650> strings<00:01:55.160> that

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
we want to cover up those strings that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.020 
we want to cover up those strings that
we<00:01:55.780> made<00:01:58.480> and<00:01:59.480> again<00:02:00.290> we<00:02:01.040> have<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.280> make<00:02:01.670> our

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
we made and again we have to make our

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.240 
we made and again we have to make our
snippets<00:02:02.630> into<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.110> top<00:02:03.410> so<00:02:03.620> we<00:02:03.710> can<00:02:03.890> tuck<00:02:04.070> it

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
snippets into the top so we can tuck it

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.190 
snippets into the top so we can tuck it
down<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.850> make<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.240> easier<00:02:05.660> so<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:05.900> have<00:02:06.050> our

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
down and make it easier so we have our

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.450 
down and make it easier so we have our
three<00:02:06.440> sections<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.250> we<00:02:08.180> see<00:02:08.450> over<00:02:08.630> here<00:02:09.460> on

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
three sections and we see over here on

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.830 
three sections and we see over here on
the<00:02:10.910> side<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.740> we<00:02:12.740> were<00:02:12.860> able<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.660> cover<00:02:14.660> up

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
the side that we were able to cover up

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.180 
the side that we were able to cover up
the<00:02:15.020> holes<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:15.590> made<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.250> strings

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
the holes that we made and the strings

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:29.660 
the holes that we made and the strings
