 from the hill or the truth genoa is not 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.580
 just closed I understand it's summer that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.129
 You could not hear me saying 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.590
 your work in this pizzeria will last five 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.850
 nights you see yourself on your right side a little 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.979
 of food so he can survive 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.229
 these days also within the same 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.050
 There is a mask that I will show you why 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.700
 it serves in a moment the first and before 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.680
 to explain that some things could 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.990
 please sign the papers that are in 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.090
 the desk this is from here if in 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.010
 serious you do not listen to me and I do not hear you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.549
 for nothing ah well then you will not hear 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.549
 if I do this 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.220
 ok legally I have to explain to you that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.240
 this animal is causing the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.300
 animatronics that we have here 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.180
 they walk loose at night is something normal 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.670
 since you can be for 20 years all 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.830
 the afternoon playing for children should be 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.510
 a bit stressful for them so what 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.340
 we let go at night what 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.340
 I also have to explain to you is that as 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.770
 any mechanical system has its 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.670
 failures so these can from time to time 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.400
 when 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.440
 scream and approach towards you from a 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.690
 way a little violent nothing from the other 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.270
 world but as I tell you it's a bit 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.180
 intimidating at first the papers were 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.580
 just signed are to not do the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.860
 responsible neither to me nor to the company 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.230
 much less to animatronics by 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.120
 any emotional physical or mental damage 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.210
 that you can receive in this pizzeria 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.710
 for the next five days I just 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.740
 to hear something because of the ventilation there 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.780
 you're not fucked like he's been saying 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.810
 come a moment you feel a little 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.390
 threatened or very intimidated as you can 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.360
 use the mask that you leave in the chest 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.820
 since if they do not see your income expensive 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.160
 better and not assigned to you as good I would 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.930
 I go and I have to retire to the hospital 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.210
 visit the old security man 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.150
 which in fact was yesterday is very serious 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.510
 in the hospital and what happened to him 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.770
 important then we talk chau and luck 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.180
 at least this man gives me a lot 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.830
 trust I think it will be a night 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.420
 quiet although a little boring 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.700
 I guess I could go thinking new 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.580
 tortures for the prizes to see the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.459
 butcher is already the incinerator already 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.840
 is the bastard in his chest is already fer and 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.940
 feli 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.700
 there is a new guy is security is 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.459
 new spit on them is already drowning them 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.550
 we are already going to attack 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.770
 now not later but now 4 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.930
 I said that later it 's okay to put them to 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.760
 a toxic waste tank is already 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.620
 what else would I need to do that out and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.930
 think that he stole a diamond that would be 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.700
 a real torture now we're going yes 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.530
 but remember that the first night this 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.030
 we observe it nobody loses in the first 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.010
 night not even in the second would be 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.300
 super marquis and mo girl you know is 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.340
 well that he lost in the first or in 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.540
 the second night then but still 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.310
 let's keep an eye on him 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.900
 the tupi boy of the camera us 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.640
 we will go to watch him south 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.959
 well I guess these will be all 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.420
 tortures that occurred to me for either 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.819
 tomorrow I'll think more about there is the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.620
 awakening must have delayed I think 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.540
 until even he could die in the 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.790
 first night you can not see how to use the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.799
 mask or flashlight rip interbus 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.140
 if I by the right conduit and by the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.870
 left and the bone is fine and here 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.980
 I can see listeners change if I 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.750
 we greet the three ok 1 2 and 3 is something 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.270
 move the room we are there 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.620
 instead 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.739
 [Applause] 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.909
 what happens because they avoid the phone 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.950
 hello hi hello tell me this is alive so 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.750
 thank goodness listen to me last night and I went back 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.760
 tell you something very important you have opened 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.680
 the box for something not for nothing 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.510
 so look inside the box there is also 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.220
 a security device with which 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.350
 You can check the cameras we have 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.840
 scattered throughout the building and this I 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.729
 It serves to be able to observe 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.710
 when an animatronic moves from the 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.660
 room where it is so if you see it 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.370
 moving in the direction of you must have 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.840
 be very careful and use the buttons that 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.030
 you have to the left to the right and 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.280
 in front of you to activate the lights and 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.440
 so that the recent ones in the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.449
 face the light to an animatronic or maybe you 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.250
 your systems are restarted whereby 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.590
 they go back to the room where they should 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.960
 be and no longer attack you and that's for 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.080
 so you do not die and I do not want 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.910
 die for today we'll talk tomorrow 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.740
 be a moment you said that only 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.150
 I 'm going to stay at night, yes, but if 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.060
 just sunrise then it's not from 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.620
 night the skills the time set 920 at night 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.389
 and because instead of putting the time set 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.949
 so that it's nighttime you do not do it for 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.139
 that it's daytime and no longer hire anyone 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.419
 to take care of this at night is true 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.199
 but just the same you just take care we talk 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.210
 morning is fine very good lanterns 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.430
 mask and camera ok as the camera serves 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.659
 so I do not know what animatronics speaks to me 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.659
 I think he's exaggerating a bit 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.960
 exaggerating 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:27.580
 then another night more here we were there 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.349
 to do night now already you like 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.840
 the flashlight cameras and the mask 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:36.759
 he was right to warn others is 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.610
 well let the game iron and gold begin 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.469
 there's no good you've lost now 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.289
 complete the game will scare 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:46.449
 he yes purple louis yes I see him drugged the 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.430
 turquoise water and drink beer the 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.310
 colorful flowers give me your epilepsy 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.060
 face releases a strong diarrhea not 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.060
 I know how I'm not a poet 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.349
 and the most expensive 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.349
 if you are you 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.230
 for a moment I thought that
