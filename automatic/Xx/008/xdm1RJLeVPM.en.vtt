crawling the truck yet just to rainy and
shitty<00:04:20.390> out<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:21.650> wasn't<00:04:21.919> too<00:04:22.159> bad<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.340> lot<00:04:22.610> of

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
shitty out so wasn't too bad a lot of

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.250 
shitty out so wasn't too bad a lot of
people<00:04:22.940> say<00:04:23.150> it's<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.570> hard

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
people say it's a hard

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260 
people say it's a hard
really<00:04:24.830> hard<00:04:25.040> time<00:04:25.220> just<00:04:25.490> put<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.760> two<00:04:25.880> pieces

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
really hard time just put the two pieces

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.330 
really hard time just put the two pieces
apart<00:04:26.300> but<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.290> didn't<00:04:27.590> have<00:04:27.680> any<00:04:27.860> problem

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
apart but I didn't have any problem

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.100 
apart but I didn't have any problem
probably<00:04:28.790> because<00:04:29.240> there's<00:04:29.450> no<00:04:29.570> rust<00:04:29.810> on<00:04:29.990> the

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
probably because there's no rust on the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.880 
probably because there's no rust on the
freaking<00:04:30.410> truck
