00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
South Texas which means that not only is

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.190 
South Texas which means that not only is
it<00:00:08.400> almost<00:00:08.700> spring<00:00:08.910> turkey<00:00:09.150> season<00:00:09.269> but<00:00:10.050> it's

it almost spring turkey season but it's

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.629 
it almost spring turkey season but it's
time<00:00:10.320> for<00:00:10.349> bucks<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.769> begin<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.070> drop<00:00:11.219> antlers

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
time for bucks to begin to drop antlers

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.129 
time for bucks to begin to drop antlers
you<00:00:11.940> know<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> whole<00:00:12.300> antler<00:00:12.630> growth<00:00:12.809> cycle

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
you know the whole antler growth cycle

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.900 
you know the whole antler growth cycle
is<00:00:13.230> really<00:00:13.469> quite<00:00:13.650> fascinating<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.759> most

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
is really quite fascinating for the most

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.490 
is really quite fascinating for the most
part<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.179> controlled<00:00:15.540> by<00:00:15.570> photo<00:00:15.870> period<00:00:16.109> which

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
part is controlled by photo period which

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.750 
part is controlled by photo period which
is<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> duration<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.190> light<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.550> which<00:00:17.609> an

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
is the duration of light in which an

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.130 
is the duration of light in which an
organism<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.480> case<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> buck<00:00:18.960> is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
organism and in this case a buck is

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.410 
organism and in this case a buck is
exposed<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.590> each<00:00:19.770> day<00:00:19.980> now<00:00:20.699> obviously<00:00:20.880> that

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
exposed to each day now obviously that

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.060 
exposed to each day now obviously that
changes<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> seasons<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.859> those

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
changes with the seasons and those

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.529 
changes with the seasons and those
seasonal<00:00:23.460> changes<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.060> duration<00:00:24.330> of

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
seasonal changes in the duration of

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.330 
seasonal changes in the duration of
light<00:00:24.750> influence<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.529> internal<00:00:25.859> mechanisms

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
light influence the internal mechanisms

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.429 
light influence the internal mechanisms
within<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.640> deer's<00:00:26.849> body<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.720> control<00:00:28.050> antler

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
within a deer's body that control antler

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.960 
within a deer's body that control antler
growth<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.220> now<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.400> need<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
growth but now we need to get to the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.730 
growth but now we need to get to the
point<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.300> video<00:00:30.570> which<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.990> how<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> find

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
point of this video which is how to find

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.680 
point of this video which is how to find
sheds<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.160> where<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> look<00:00:32.399> for<00:00:32.550> shits<00:00:32.759> now

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
sheds and where to look for shits now

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.330 
sheds and where to look for shits now
we're<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.960> South<00:00:34.110> Texas<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.710> obviously<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.130> lot

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
we're in South Texas and obviously a lot

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
we're in South Texas and obviously a lot
of<00:00:35.520> deer<00:00:35.700> use<00:00:35.910> feeders<00:00:36.329> feeders<00:00:36.930> are<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> great

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
of deer use feeders feeders are a great

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
of deer use feeders feeders are a great
place<00:00:37.620> obviously<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.700> find<00:00:38.969> shed<00:00:39.329> antlers

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
place obviously to find shed antlers

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.720 
place obviously to find shed antlers
because<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> congregation<00:00:40.739> point<00:00:41.040> now

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
stand here is to put a rope around this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.670 
stand here is to put a rope around this
feeder<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.239> work<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> around<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.840> legs<00:00:52.050> so

feeder and work it around the legs so
that<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.980> these<00:00:53.160> deer<00:00:53.370> feed<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.850> their<00:00:53.940> head

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that as these deer feed and their head

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.180 
that as these deer feed and their head
bobs<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.530> rope<00:00:55.800> will<00:00:55.829> actually

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
bobs up and down this rope will actually

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.010 
bobs up and down this rope will actually
catch<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.550> their<00:00:56.670> antlers<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.480> help<00:00:57.690> them<00:00:57.840> pop

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
catch on their antlers and help them pop

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.869 
catch on their antlers and help them pop
them<00:00:58.230> off<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> keep<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:58.980> it's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
them off and keep them right here it's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
them off and keep them right here it's
really<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> easiest<00:01:00.300> process<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.469> is

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
really the easiest process and this is

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
really the easiest process and this is
as<00:01:01.800> simple<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.359> try<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
as simple as can be it's just a try a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.390 
as simple as can be it's just a try a
rope<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> height<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
rope here about the height that what the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.770 
rope here about the height that what the
antler<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.270> they're<00:01:06.540> feeding

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
antler is going to be as they're feeding

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.620 
antler is going to be as they're feeding
and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.770> work<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.159> rope<00:01:08.400> around<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and then work that rope around the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
and then work that rope around the
speeder<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.500> catch<00:01:10.740> each<00:01:11.640> one

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
speeder so that you can catch each one

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.660 
speeder so that you can catch each one
of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> deer<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.420> come<00:01:12.570> around<00:01:13.460> now<00:01:14.460> that's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
of the deer that come around now that's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.100 
of the deer that come around now that's
about<00:01:14.760> right<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.659> they're<00:01:15.900> feeding

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
about right right there they're feeding

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.390 
about right right there they're feeding
their<00:01:16.350> antlers<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> tip<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.189> here

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
their antlers going to tip in here

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
their antlers going to tip in here
hopefully<00:01:18.150> they'll<00:01:18.330> hit<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.960> was<00:01:19.049> just

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
hopefully they'll hit that it was just

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
hopefully they'll hit that it was just
not<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.560> antler<00:01:19.710> off<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.250> could<00:01:20.520> go

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
not going to antler off I could go

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.010 
not going to antler off I could go
around<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.119> couple<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.450> times<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.840> there's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
around a couple of times but there's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.179 
around a couple of times but there's
really<00:01:22.140> no<00:01:22.320> point<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> would

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
really no point on it but it would

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.219 
really no point on it but it would
obviously<00:01:23.909> increase<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.600> odds<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.049> at<00:01:25.140> this

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
obviously increase my odds but at this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.890 
obviously increase my odds but at this
point<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.830> tie<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.070> off<00:01:26.659> I'm<00:01:27.659> good

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
point I can just tie this off I'm good

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.810

little bit of a different level as you

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.620 
little bit of a different level as you
can<00:03:22.799> tell<00:03:22.860> i<00:03:23.280> went<00:03:23.640> ahead<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.880> wire<00:03:24.120> these<00:03:24.360> in

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
can tell i went ahead and wire these in

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.500 
can tell i went ahead and wire these in
but<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.560> going<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.739> set<00:03:25.950> up<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.220> same<00:03:26.400> way

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
but it's going to set up the same way

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.270 
but it's going to set up the same way
i'll<00:03:27.510> stake<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.019> my<00:03:28.170> poles<00:03:28.700> in<00:03:29.700> each<00:03:29.940> corner

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
i'll stake in my poles in each corner

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.309 
i'll stake in my poles in each corner
and<00:03:32.280> once<00:03:32.459> again<00:03:32.580> i'm<00:03:32.850> going<00:03:32.880> for<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.750> know

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
and once again i'm going for you know

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.130 
and once again i'm going for you know
about<00:03:34.530> 23<00:03:35.040> inches<00:03:35.340> in<00:03:35.690> width<00:03:36.690> where<00:03:36.989> these<00:03:37.080> are

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
about 23 inches in width where these are

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.660 
about 23 inches in width where these are
spread<00:03:37.530> apart<00:03:37.650> that's<00:03:38.370> about<00:03:38.670> right<00:03:39.200> there

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
spread apart that's about right there

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.340 
spread apart that's about right there
get<00:03:41.670> these<00:03:41.820> holes<00:03:42.150> up<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.630> be<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.810> good<00:03:42.930> shape

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.729 

and<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.560> last<00:03:46.769> one<00:03:47.010> goes<00:03:47.190> up<00:03:48.470> spread<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.590> out<00:03:49.680> a

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
and the last one goes up spread it out a

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.840 
and the last one goes up spread it out a
little<00:03:49.920> bit<00:03:50.600> stake<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:55.070> really<00:03:56.070> not<00:03:56.340> not<00:03:56.820> a

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
little bit stake it in really not not a

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.450 
little bit stake it in really not not a
hard<00:03:57.090> trap<00:03:57.359> put<00:03:57.600> together

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.440 

it's<00:04:03.460> really<00:04:03.610> not<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.820> hard<00:04:04.030> trap<00:04:04.210> to<00:04:04.300> put

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
it's really not a hard trap to put

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.370 
it's really not a hard trap to put
together<00:04:04.570> just<00:04:05.170> initially<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:06.250> get<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.460> up

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
together just initially you get it up

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.360 
together just initially you get it up
once<00:04:08.380> again<00:04:08.470> get<00:04:08.770> it<00:04:08.860> to<00:04:08.920> stake<00:04:09.100> through<00:04:09.280> the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
once again get it to stake through the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.930 
once again get it to stake through the
ground<00:04:09.670> really<00:04:09.970> well<00:04:14.430> now<00:04:15.430> it's<00:04:15.580> up<00:04:15.670> off<00:04:15.820> the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
ground really well now it's up off the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.720 
ground really well now it's up off the
ground<00:04:16.470> last<00:04:17.470> two<00:04:17.709> stakes<00:04:18.040> go<00:04:18.280> in<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.489> middle

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
ground last two stakes go in the middle

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.150 
ground last two stakes go in the middle
just<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:18.940> hold<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.239> there<00:04:19.709> make<00:04:20.709> sure<00:04:20.739> nothing

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
just to hold it there make sure nothing

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.120 
just to hold it there make sure nothing
runs<00:04:21.340> off<00:04:21.519> with<00:04:21.700> your<00:04:22.230> with<00:04:23.230> your<00:04:23.260> wire<00:04:26.130> all

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
runs off with your with your wire all

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.500 
runs off with your with your wire all
right<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.460> about<00:04:27.640> does<00:04:27.700> it<00:04:27.880> for<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.210> trap

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
right that about does it for this trap

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.510 
right that about does it for this trap
once<00:04:29.260> again<00:04:29.350> it's<00:04:29.590> really<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:29.920> a<00:04:30.070> modified

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
once again it's really just a modified

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.550 
once again it's really just a modified
deed<00:04:30.790> but<00:04:31.480> now<00:04:31.600> I've<00:04:31.750> kind<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:32.050> increased<00:04:32.440> my

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
deed but now I've kind of increased my

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.530 
deed but now I've kind of increased my
opportunity<00:04:33.190> for<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.940> number<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.270> bucks<00:04:34.450> and

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
opportunity for the number of bucks and

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.700 
opportunity for the number of bucks and
the<00:04:34.660> number<00:04:34.870> of<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.230> was<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.500> drop

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
the number of in it was to drop

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.400 
the number of in it was to drop
I'll<00:04:36.400> put<00:04:36.610> corn<00:04:36.880> in<00:04:37.030> here<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.720> corn<00:04:38.020> in<00:04:38.140> here

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
I'll put corn in here the corn in here

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.290 
I'll put corn in here the corn in here
pick<00:04:39.070> corn<00:04:39.310> on<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:39.550> outside<00:04:40.000> now<00:04:40.180> I've

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
pick corn on this outside now I've

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.150 
pick corn on this outside now I've
really<00:04:40.510> got<00:04:40.630> three<00:04:40.840> spots<00:04:41.140> at<00:04:41.290> which<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:42.070> know

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
really got three spots at which you know

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.500 
really got three spots at which you know
a<00:04:42.190> bachelor<00:04:42.550> group<00:04:42.670> of<00:04:42.790> us<00:04:42.910> could<00:04:43.120> come<00:04:43.300> in

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
a bachelor group of us could come in

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.120 
a bachelor group of us could come in
they're<00:04:43.810> all<00:04:43.930> feeding<00:04:44.200> creates<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:45.010> good

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
they're all feeding creates a good

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.560 
they're all feeding creates a good
opportunity<00:04:45.370> for<00:04:45.670> them<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:45.940> drop<00:04:46.120> antlers

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
opportunity for them to drop antlers

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.730 
opportunity for them to drop antlers
makes<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:46.960> easier<00:04:47.230> if<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.380> need<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.560> find

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
makes it easier if you need to find

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.280 
makes it easier if you need to find
change<00:04:47.980> now<00:04:48.880> when<00:04:49.030> it<00:04:49.120> comes<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.600> shed<00:04:49.960> antler

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
change now when it comes to shed antler

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.750 
change now when it comes to shed antler
hunting<00:04:50.590> I'm<00:04:50.980> of<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.190> opinion<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.610> work

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
hunting I'm of the opinion to work

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.100 
hunting I'm of the opinion to work
smarter<00:04:52.120> not<00:04:52.150> harder<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:52.720> showed<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:53.080> a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
smarter not harder and I showed you a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.510 
smarter not harder and I showed you a
couple<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.500> ways<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.650> create<00:04:54.010> traps<00:04:54.340> the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
couple of ways to create traps the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.770 
couple of ways to create traps the
increase<00:04:54.790> your<00:04:54.820> odds<00:04:55.030> of<00:04:55.270> finding<00:04:55.450> shed

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
increase your odds of finding shed

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.660 
increase your odds of finding shed
antlers<00:04:56.110> but<00:04:56.770> definitely<00:04:56.920> use<00:04:57.430> what's

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
antlers but definitely use what's

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.010 
antlers but definitely use what's
already<00:04:57.790> on<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.120> field<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.450> in<00:04:58.510> this<00:04:58.630> case<00:04:58.810> of
