00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.040
 sorry 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.430
 efe 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.410
 It's easy at all but good thanks to 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.999
 god that we have weapons the weapon of 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.130
 armadillo good of the closet armed this 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:29.259
 it is true that they made me the title will be 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.029
 to get the look the apart 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.750
 get with life containers 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.340
 all potions the cucumber or is it 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.539
 ending up liking to say it like that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.980
 to get though there are simply 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.280
 to get to the end and get the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.930
 good container the kit that life 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.940
 what's next to the area 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.039
 just five times goes without 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.539
 Well, well, you do not get any damage or anything 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.670
 I was very convincing 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.430
 whoever it's worth I do not know my stuff 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.690
 I suppose 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.250
 this really what I'm going to kill but the other 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.769
 It would not be too bad for him to kill him 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.479
 with the weapon that affects it 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.479
 and you will understand right away why 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.649
 the skewers are made of a 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.360
 incredible way that yes you will see that in 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:27.869
 this area there are a couple of chulis gifts 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.329
 good to see carefully is that the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.009
 problem of this confrontation is that 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.520
 we have some skewers around the corner 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.520
 the corner and as we suggest what 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 just like those that better in certain 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.179
 way because this weapon is the one that affects 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.789
 to the boss children 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.709
 perfect has been because you have to 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.770
 get there if possible with a good 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:51.420
 amount of ammunition valera in this area 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.140
 yes now you have to climb the end here 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:01.060
 on top of the submarine there are carefully 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.680
 son of left fruit and now 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.130
 we calmly let ourselves be carried away 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.110
 while the submarine or the staff that 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.530
 they are store is going devastating with everything 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.880
 on the way to see the little bug this 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.530
 here with the tornado plus the attack of 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.720
 tornado charged wow does not last 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.310
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.440
 the fact is that you have to give it full 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.610
 you do not give it fully, which was 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.860
 the problems 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.390
 fuck how many medicine cabinets and 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.390
 good against a life container 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.390
 look with tranquility we have to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.500
 advance to the second boss 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.060
 second people that by the way is the same 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.330
 that the one we just left makes a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.330
 second 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.490
 because this pulls me up yes very 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.010
 well all very practical but then we 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.160
 says and I work and I'm not going to 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.160
 do 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.340
 when he dies they beat me with the spikes and 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.410
 you know that your point care g said of 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.480
 fruits has survived but not by much 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.910
 time the goal plan to the vandals there 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.820
 ropes are worth top I have recharged a little 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.120
 more the energy of the attack and to see with 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.120
 watch out 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:26.840
 this problem to see where they are all 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.010
 all all there the power I am 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.800
 used to changing it with 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.780
 little buttons of the good command you know 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.290
 that to change from top to bottom between 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.290
 the skills 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.120
 it's almost unpredictable ivÃ¡ncsik or those 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.120
 things like that so fast 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.810
 normal 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.069
 careful with this 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.970
 so he throws very straight 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:05.460
 son of the god that all heavy with the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.980
 little fish the missiles 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.620
 god norm that holds the character that 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.300
 do not see your term because we are going but 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.070
 merkel against a lot of ammunition for 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.750
 the one that swims a very short or even with 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.790
 the weapon that affects him or if he would not have 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.390
 stuck with charged bust attack 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.090
 It would not have taken long either 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.590
 and we got the torpedo something that 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.160
 it's not even perfect to kill the next 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.160
 so-and-so 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.559
 so the short guys that I hope that 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.209
