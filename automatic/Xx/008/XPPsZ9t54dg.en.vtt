00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
10-15 years ago I think okay now what if

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.380 
10-15 years ago I think okay now what if
the<00:01:00.120> starting<00:01:00.510> game<00:01:00.690> doesn't<00:01:01.080> work<00:01:01.290> and<00:01:02.390> they

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the starting game doesn't work and they

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.410 
the starting game doesn't work and they
have<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.659> go<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.930> another<00:01:04.170> starting<00:01:04.769> gate<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
have to go get another starting gate and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.990 
have to go get another starting gate and
it's<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> take<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> while<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.820> break<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
it's going to take a while to break the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.580 
it's going to take a while to break the
gate<00:01:09.180> over<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> TARDIS<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:09.990> reasonable
