him<00:01:35.920> or<00:01:36.009> not<00:01:36.569> so<00:01:37.569> I<00:01:37.630> got<00:01:37.750> nine<00:01:38.159> calling<00:01:39.159> my

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
him or not so I got nine calling my

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.090 
him or not so I got nine calling my
Harriers<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:40.690> I'm<00:01:41.259> hoping<00:01:41.619> our<00:01:41.860> team's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
Harriers and I'm hoping our team's

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.680 
Harriers and I'm hoping our team's
pushing<00:01:42.490> up<00:01:42.580> and<00:01:42.729> you<00:01:42.789> can<00:01:42.940> see<00:01:43.119> enough<00:01:43.360> to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
pushing up and you can see enough to

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.469 
pushing up and you can see enough to
make<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.259> we<00:01:45.009> can<00:01:45.190> have<00:01:45.640> them<00:01:45.789> spawn<00:01:46.149> on<00:01:46.299> a

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
make it so we can have them spawn on a

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.249 
make it so we can have them spawn on a
and<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:49.179> ideal<00:01:49.450> situation<00:01:49.630> just

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
and that's the ideal situation just

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.650 
and that's the ideal situation just
about<00:01:50.470> died<00:01:50.709> right<00:01:50.950> there<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.940> I<00:01:52.330> was<00:01:52.509> like

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660

see<00:02:07.929> I<00:02:07.959> don't<00:02:08.140> remember<00:02:08.349> how<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.679> Pistons<00:02:09.190> are

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
see I don't remember how the Pistons are

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.380 
see I don't remember how the Pistons are
working<00:02:09.610> with<00:02:09.700> her<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:10.000> can<00:02:10.149> see<00:02:10.269> they're

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
working with her you can see they're

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.089 
working with her you can see they're
totally<00:02:10.660> spawning<00:02:10.929> on<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.260> now<00:02:11.440> what<00:02:12.040> my

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
totally spawning on a now what my

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.720 
totally spawning on a now what my
Harriers<00:02:12.430> up<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.780> I'm

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
Harriers up so I'm

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.869 
Harriers up so I'm
130<00:02:15.420> now<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.769> got<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.099> little<00:02:17.220> long<00:02:17.550> shot

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
130 now and I got that little long shot

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.660 
130 now and I got that little long shot
so<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.319> where<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.530> think<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.099> gets<00:02:20.280> kind<00:02:20.640> of

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
so this is where I think it gets kind of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.309 
so this is where I think it gets kind of
interesting<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.599> see<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.810> i'm<00:02:22.140> ready

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
interesting you can see that i'm ready

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.170 
interesting you can see that i'm ready

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
to call on my AC 130 but then all of a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.809 
to call on my AC 130 but then all of a
sudden<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:25.260> ac-130<00:02:25.860> things<00:02:26.190> about<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.580> happen

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.229 
sudden the ac-130 things about to happen
and<00:02:27.269> then<00:02:27.810> as<00:02:28.170> I'm<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.739> my<00:02:28.890> AC<00:02:29.069> 130<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.909> end<00:02:30.180> up

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
and then as I'm in my AC 130 I end up

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.910 
and then as I'm in my AC 130 I end up
hearing<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:31.310> kind<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> enjoy<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.670> spot<00:02:33.920> which

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
hearing this kind of enjoy a spot which

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.160 
hearing this kind of enjoy a spot which
is<00:02:35.069> totally<00:02:35.670> horrible<00:02:35.970> because<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:37.019> is

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
is totally horrible because this is

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.780 
is totally horrible because this is
usually<00:02:37.319> one<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> those<00:02:37.799> things<00:02:38.069> where<00:02:38.250> like

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
usually one of those things where like

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.309 
usually one of those things where like
this<00:02:39.150> ends<00:02:39.540> up<00:02:39.569> being<00:02:39.629> a<00:02:39.870> nuke<00:02:40.019> because

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
this ends up being a nuke because

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.920 
this ends up being a nuke because
they're<00:02:40.440> spawning<00:02:40.769> like<00:02:41.040> perfectly<00:02:41.519> on<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.930> I'm

they're spawning like perfectly on a I'm
seeing<00:02:43.290> them<00:02:43.410> spawn<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.129> should<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.519> able<00:02:44.579> to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
seeing them spawn in I should be able to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.550 
seeing them spawn in I should be able to
get<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:44.940> nuke<00:02:45.180> really<00:02:45.510> easily<00:02:45.840> there's

by somebody a deadly weiner guy or
whatever<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.579> sucks<00:02:54.239> man<00:02:54.450> because<00:02:54.900> this

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
whatever and that sucks man because this

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.000 
whatever and that sucks man because this
would<00:02:55.170> have<00:02:55.260> been<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.379> nuke<00:02:55.590> for<00:02:55.799> sure

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
would have been a nuke for sure

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.789 
would have been a nuke for sure
sometimes<00:02:56.609> it<00:02:56.790> happens<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.510> so

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
sometimes it happens like this so

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.990 
sometimes it happens like this so
sometimes<00:02:58.799> these<00:02:59.069> nuke<00:02:59.310> fails<00:02:59.549> will<00:02:59.730> be<00:02:59.819> like

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
sometimes these nuke fails will be like

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.729 
sometimes these nuke fails will be like
well<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.720> could<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:00.900> gone<00:03:01.019> either<00:03:01.109> way<00:03:01.290> this

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
well it could have gone either way this

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.380 
well it could have gone either way this
is<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.250> like<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.579> definitely<00:03:02.640> should

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
is one that like I definitely should

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.180 
is one that like I definitely should
have<00:03:03.420> had<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.690> nuke<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.680> because<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.040> called

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
have had the nuke but because it called

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.920 
have had the nuke but because it called
in<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.370> UAB<00:03:05.609> strictly<00:03:06.420> because<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
in the UAB strictly because of that I

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.710 
in the UAB strictly because of that I
ended<00:03:07.590> up<00:03:07.680> getting<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.160> killed<00:03:08.879> man<00:03:09.209> it's<00:03:09.510> not

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720

ended up getting a killed man it's not
really<00:03:09.989> bad<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.739> there<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.970> was<00:03:12.260> shooting

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
really bad and there I was shooting

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.930 
really bad and there I was shooting
still<00:03:13.769> even<00:03:14.040> though<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.160> was<00:03:14.340> out<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:16.940> knife

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
