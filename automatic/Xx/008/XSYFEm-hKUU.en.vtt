higher<00:00:14.190> math<00:00:14.430> used<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.240> Euclidean<00:00:15.780> algorithm

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
higher math used the Euclidean algorithm

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.130 
higher math used the Euclidean algorithm
to<00:00:17.100> obtain<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.730> greatest<00:00:18.000> common<00:00:18.510> divisor<00:00:18.900> of

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
to obtain the greatest common divisor of

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.859 
to obtain the greatest common divisor of
those<00:00:19.860> two<00:00:20.010> numbers<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.550> Express<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.420> this

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
those two numbers and Express in this

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.970 
those two numbers and Express in this
form<00:00:22.200> where<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.770> B<00:00:23.040> are<00:00:23.189> integers

form where a and B are integers

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.159 
form where a and B are integers
our<00:00:25.980> first<00:00:26.250> part<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.579> go<00:00:26.970> through<00:00:27.000> York<00:00:27.810> Lydian

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
our first part is go through York Lydian

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.659 
our first part is go through York Lydian
algorithm<00:00:28.860> for<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.369> we're<00:00:29.520> starting

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
algorithm for this so we're starting

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.999 
algorithm for this so we're starting
with<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.240> two<00:00:30.450> or<00:00:30.480> four<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.410> still<00:00:31.680> trying<00:00:31.950> to

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
with one two or four and still trying to

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.220 
with one two or four and still trying to
figure<00:00:32.130> out<00:00:32.340> how<00:00:32.430> many<00:00:32.610> III<00:00:33.540> threes<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:34.110> we

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
figure out how many III threes can we

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.870 
figure out how many III threes can we
get<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.560> longer<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.100> them<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.700> one

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
get with a longer one of them so be one

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.370 
get with a longer one of them so be one
team<00:00:36.210> Z<00:00:36.450> 3<00:00:36.780> 3<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.680> remainder<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:38.190> 3<00:00:38.579> 7<00:00:39.510> 1<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
team Z 3 3 with a remainder of 3 7 1 and

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.520 
team Z 3 3 with a remainder of 3 7 1 and
then<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.980> start<00:00:41.250> again<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.600> these<00:00:43.170> two

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
then you start again know that these two

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.250 
then you start again know that these two
numbers<00:00:43.980> hold<00:00:44.580> the<00:00:45.240> greatest<00:00:45.660> common<00:00:45.930> divisor

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
numbers hold the greatest common divisor

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.640 
numbers hold the greatest common divisor
or<00:00:46.830> start<00:00:47.100> again<00:00:47.310> with<00:00:47.490> these<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.600> III<00:00:49.230> three

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
or start again with these so III three

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.550 
or start again with these so III three
how<00:00:50.610> many<00:00:50.820> three<00:00:51.120> seven<00:00:51.480> ones<00:00:51.690> cannot<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
how many three seven ones cannot be and

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.310 
how many three seven ones cannot be and
that's<00:00:52.680> two<00:00:53.130> of<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.790> that<00:00:54.660> leaves<00:00:55.100> 91

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
that's two of them and that leaves 91

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
that's two of them and that leaves 91
these<00:00:58.320> two<00:00:58.710> old<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.700> key<00:00:59.850> targets<00:01:00.240> come

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
these two old the key targets come

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840 
these two old the key targets come
divisor<00:01:00.810> so<00:01:01.020> I'll<00:01:01.290> start<00:01:01.500> again<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.100> so

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
divisor so I'll start again here so

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.820 
divisor so I'll start again here so
three<00:01:03.300> seven<00:01:03.720> one<00:01:03.750> will<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> certain<00:01:04.799> number

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
three seven one will be a certain number

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.730 
three seven one will be a certain number
of<00:01:05.129> ninety<00:01:05.880> ones<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.869> will<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.020> four<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
of ninety ones there will be four of

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.749 
of ninety ones there will be four of
them<00:01:07.979> plus<00:01:08.790> seven<00:01:09.479> left<00:01:09.659> over<00:01:10.250> these<00:01:11.250> two<00:01:11.520> hold

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
them plus seven left over these two hold

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:12.249 
them plus seven left over these two hold
it

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
it

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.200 
it
so<00:01:13.259> ninety-one<00:01:13.890> equals<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> thumbs<00:01:14.970> out

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so ninety-one equals as a thumbs out

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.600 
so ninety-one equals as a thumbs out
exactly<00:01:16.050> 13<00:01:16.770> times<00:01:17.159> seven<00:01:17.760> which<00:01:18.650> means<00:01:19.650> seven

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
exactly 13 times seven which means seven

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
exactly 13 times seven which means seven
went<00:01:20.820> into<00:01:21.180> them<00:01:21.330> both<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.900> seven<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
went into them both so seven is the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.700 
went into them both so seven is the
greatest<00:01:22.980> common<00:01:23.310> divisor<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.900> course<00:01:25.170> one

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
greatest common divisor so of course one

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.790 
greatest common divisor so of course one
two<00:01:25.979> four<00:01:26.640> eight<00:01:26.940> three<00:01:27.750> three<00:01:27.810> standing<00:01:28.620> for

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
two four eight three three standing for

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.560 
two four eight three three standing for
the<00:01:28.890> greatest<00:01:29.159> common<00:01:29.520> divisor<00:01:29.850> equals<00:01:30.720> seven

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
the greatest common divisor equals seven

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.360 
the greatest common divisor equals seven
now<00:01:33.570> I'm<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.170> backwards

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
now I'm just going about this backwards

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.130 
now I'm just going about this backwards
so<00:01:35.370> that's<00:01:36.240> seven<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.870> want<00:01:37.050> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
so that's seven because I want the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.719 
so that's seven because I want the
greatest<00:01:37.350> common<00:01:37.740> divisor<00:01:38.010> to<00:01:38.340> equal<00:01:38.610> this

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
greatest common divisor to equal this

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
greatest common divisor to equal this
expression<00:01:39.299> well<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:39.750> 7<00:01:40.260> equals<00:01:40.590> notice

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
expression well here as 7 equals notice

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.250 
expression well here as 7 equals notice
just<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.460> case<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> using<00:01:42.000> these<00:01:42.360> substitutions

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
just a case of using these substitutions

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.920 
just a case of using these substitutions
to<00:01:43.680> feed<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.340> back<00:01:44.490> through<00:01:44.549> well<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> seven

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
to feed it back through well the seven

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.399 
to feed it back through well the seven
