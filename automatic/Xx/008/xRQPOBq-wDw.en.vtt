00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
so you can see this one down here that

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.990 
so you can see this one down here that
I've<00:00:37.950> tested<00:00:38.950> out<00:00:39.070> I<00:00:39.100> decided<00:00:39.280> I<00:00:39.700> would<00:00:39.760> use

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
I've tested out I decided I would use

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000 
I've tested out I decided I would use
the<00:00:40.239> bottom<00:00:40.690> area<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.379> bag<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.739> kind<00:00:41.950> of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
the bottom area of the bag to kind of

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.520 
the bottom area of the bag to kind of
test<00:00:42.309> and<00:00:42.460> make<00:00:42.640> sure<00:00:42.789> I<00:00:42.820> had<00:00:43.090> my<00:00:43.260> idea<00:00:44.260> down

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
test and make sure I had my idea down

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.910 
test and make sure I had my idea down
right<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.600> I'm<00:00:46.960> think<00:00:47.530> I'm<00:00:47.620> going<00:00:47.890> to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
right and so I'm think I'm going to

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.479 
right and so I'm think I'm going to
start<00:00:49.079> they<00:00:50.079> drugged<00:00:50.350> pretty<00:00:50.620> quickly<00:00:50.980> after

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
start they drugged pretty quickly after

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.920 
start they drugged pretty quickly after
you<00:00:51.760> get<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.090> ink<00:00:52.270> on<00:00:52.420> there<00:00:52.660> so<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.870> don't

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
you get the ink on there so you don't

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.869 
you get the ink on there so you don't
have<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.170> worry<00:00:53.350> about<00:00:53.469> it<00:00:53.710> going<00:00:54.340> everywhere

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
have to worry about it going everywhere

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.639

has<00:01:50.410> a<00:01:50.440> blending<00:01:50.950> solution<00:01:51.220> in<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.430> just<00:01:52.060> in

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
has a blending solution in it just in

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.350 
has a blending solution in it just in

even use like a a glass dish or a plate
or<00:02:25.630> something<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.260> I'm<00:02:26.650> just<00:02:26.709> doing

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
or something like that I'm just doing

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.710 
or something like that I'm just doing
this<00:02:27.130> because<00:02:27.310> that's<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:27.850> have<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.540> my

of the butterflies colored in and as
I've<00:02:35.709> been<00:02:35.739> working<00:02:36.280> with<00:02:36.489> alcohol<00:02:37.120> inks<00:02:37.300> I've

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
I've been working with alcohol inks I've

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.330 
I've been working with alcohol inks I've
actually<00:02:37.780> learned<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.470> few<00:02:38.650> tips<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.310> I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
actually learned a few tips that I

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.949 
actually learned a few tips that I
wanted<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.730> share<00:02:39.910> with<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.090> guys<00:02:40.150> okay<00:02:40.900> so

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
wanted to share with you guys okay so

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.800 
wanted to share with you guys okay so
the<00:02:41.680> alcohol<00:02:41.950> blending<00:02:42.519> solution<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:43.780> this

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
the alcohol blending solution like this

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.240 
the alcohol blending solution like this
is<00:02:44.110> on<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.320> bottle<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:44.860> took<00:02:44.950> me<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.130> minute

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
is on the bottle and it took me a minute

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.990 
is on the bottle and it took me a minute
to<00:02:45.400> figure<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.730> out

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
to figure it out

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.840 
to figure it out
it<00:02:46.090> lightens<00:02:46.900> blends<00:02:47.290> reworks<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.340> removes

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
it lightens blends reworks and removes

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.400 
it lightens blends reworks and removes
alcohol<00:02:49.660> ink<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.269> kind<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.959> best

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
alcohol ink so this is kind of the best

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.259 
alcohol ink so this is kind of the best
way<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.680> I've<00:02:53.890> discovered<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.550> make<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
way that I've discovered to make the

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.150 
way that I've discovered to make the
colors<00:02:55.600> blend<00:02:55.959> like<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.620> one<00:02:56.680> up<00:02:56.920> here

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
colors blend like on this one up here

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.800 
colors blend like on this one up here
and<00:02:57.310> up<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:57.580> over<00:02:57.700> here<00:02:57.940> I'm<00:02:58.420> going<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.630> show

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
and up here over here I'm going to show

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.809 
and up here over here I'm going to show
you<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:59.110> this<00:02:59.290> butterfly<00:02:59.860> right<00:03:00.040> here<00:03:00.340> and

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
you on this butterfly right here and

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.870 
you on this butterfly right here and
we're<00:03:00.970> going<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.180> be<00:03:01.300> using<00:03:02.160> some<00:03:03.160> purples<00:03:03.610> and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
we're going to be using some purples and

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.180 
we're going to be using some purples and
yellows<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.269> greens<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.900> blues<00:03:05.140> okay<00:03:06.130> so

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
yellows and greens and blues okay so

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.160 
yellows and greens and blues okay so
I've<00:03:06.370> got<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:07.000> mixing<00:03:07.630> medium<00:03:07.810> or<00:03:08.140> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
I've got the the mixing medium or the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.400 
I've got the the mixing medium or the
blending<00:03:08.560> solution<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.220> my<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:10.450> my<00:03:10.720> brush<00:03:11.019> here

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
blending solution in my in my brush here

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.920 
blending solution in my in my brush here
and<00:03:11.650> I'm<00:03:12.130> going<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.489> start<00:03:12.940> with<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.600> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
and I'm going to start with this the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.830 
and I'm going to start with this the
pool<00:03:14.260> color<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.180> I'm<00:03:16.180> going<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.650> paint<00:03:17.650> on

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
pool color and I'm going to paint on

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.990 
pool color and I'm going to paint on
pretty<00:03:19.840> much<00:03:20.049> everything<00:03:20.500> but<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.280> very<00:03:21.579> most

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
pretty much everything but the very most

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.470 
pretty much everything but the very most
edges<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.230> wings<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:24.940> guess<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:25.360> the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
edges of the wings so I guess just the

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:35.130 
edges of the wings so I guess just the
inner<00:03:25.750> area<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.410> guess<00:03:26.620> you'd<00:03:26.799> say

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.010 

okay<00:03:35.860> now<00:03:36.550> I'm<00:03:36.700> going<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.120> kind<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.540> scribble

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
okay now I'm going to kind of scribble

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.480 
okay now I'm going to kind of scribble
and<00:03:38.260> get<00:03:38.380> that<00:03:38.530> color<00:03:38.770> off<00:03:38.980> I'm<00:03:39.130> going<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.340> come

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
and get that color off I'm going to come

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.240 
and get that color off I'm going to come
