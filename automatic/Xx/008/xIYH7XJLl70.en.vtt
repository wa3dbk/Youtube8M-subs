this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.890> no<00:00:02.010> question<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.909> servant<00:00:03.240> the

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
this is no question of a servant the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.380 
this is no question of a servant the
food<00:00:04.110> are<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.680> reflection<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.580> pond<00:00:05.879> -

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
food are is a reflection of the pond -

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.320 
food are is a reflection of the pond -
one<00:00:06.600> free<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.649> line<00:00:07.859> free<00:00:08.370> wireless<00:00:08.610> 2x

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
one free in the line free wireless 2x

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.680 
one free in the line free wireless 2x
got<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> 33<00:00:10.200> far<00:00:11.040> by<00:00:11.250> calculation<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
got a 33 far by calculation the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.470 
got a 33 far by calculation the
coordinates<00:00:13.320> are<00:00:13.790> so<00:00:14.790> how<00:00:15.059> are<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.179> going<00:00:15.389> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
coordinates are so how are we going to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.710 
coordinates are so how are we going to
do<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.710> same<00:00:16.949> office<00:00:17.369> view<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.570> be

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
do it this is the same office view to be

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.050 
do it this is the same office view to be
an<00:00:18.900> extremely<00:00:19.470> difficult<00:00:19.859> question<00:00:20.520> but<00:00:20.760> it's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
an extremely difficult question but it's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.960 
an extremely difficult question but it's
easy<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.689> need<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.260> understand<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.250> this

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
easy just need to understand it so this

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.550 
easy just need to understand it so this
is<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> line<00:00:24.590> yeah<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.960> makes<00:00:28.109> Y

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
is a line yeah you can see if it makes Y

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.889 
is a line yeah you can see if it makes Y
subject<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.039> formula<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.650> what<00:00:32.750> it<00:00:33.750> is

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
subject of formula that it is what it is

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.049 
subject of formula that it is what it is
a<00:00:33.930> decreasing<00:00:34.290> function<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:35.219> y-intercept

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
a decreasing function with y-intercept

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.600 
a decreasing function with y-intercept
Gallivan<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.320> obvious<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.370> this

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
Gallivan so it's obvious it is like this

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.440 
Gallivan so it's obvious it is like this
isn't<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.280> minus<00:00:41.280> 1/3<00:00:41.790> where<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.120> minus

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
isn't it and minus 1/3 where is minus

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.160 
isn't it and minus 1/3 where is minus
1/3<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:44.570> for<00:00:45.570> example<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
1/3 it's here for example we have the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.440 
1/3 it's here for example we have the
point<00:00:46.379> minus<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.890> free<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.420> be

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
point minus one free and has to be

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
point minus one free and has to be
reflected<00:00:48.989> over<00:00:49.530> there

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
reflected over there

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.160 
reflected over there
how's<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.390> reflected<00:00:51.960> over

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
how's it going to be reflected over

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.020 
how's it going to be reflected over
there<00:00:52.789> well<00:00:54.289> this<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.949> line<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.460> know<00:00:56.610> it's

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
there well this this line we know it's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.830 
there well this this line we know it's
gradient

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
gradient

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.720 
gradient
what<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> gradient<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.949> managed<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.520> search

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
what is gradient it's managed to search

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.049 
what is gradient it's managed to search
yeah<00:01:00.890> this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.820> perpendicular

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
yeah this is going to be perpendicular

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.560 
yeah this is going to be perpendicular
to<00:01:03.570> each<00:01:03.750> ok<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.909> find<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to each ok so can we find this that's a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300 
to each ok so can we find this that's a
greater<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.140> line<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.799> greater<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
greater of this line the greater of this

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.230 
greater of this line the greater of this
line<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:09.000> 3<00:01:09.900> by<00:01:09.930> 2<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.090> we<00:01:12.090> know

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
line is going to be 3 by 2 and we know

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200 
line is going to be 3 by 2 and we know
the<00:01:12.450> point<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:14.130> line<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.880> already

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the point on it this line we already

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.640 
the point on it this line we already
know<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> equation<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.960> line<00:01:16.140> which<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.439> free

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
know the equation of line which is free

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.600 
know the equation of line which is free
y<00:01:16.799> plus<00:01:17.520> 2x<00:01:17.880> square<00:01:18.180> 233<00:01:18.720> very<00:01:19.320> good<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.830> this

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
y plus 2x square 233 very good and this

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.940 
y plus 2x square 233 very good and this
time<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.270> gradient<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.500> how<00:01:22.799> we're

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
time we know it's gradient so how we're

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.490 
time we know it's gradient so how we're
going<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.280> where<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.210> refracted<00:01:24.900> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
going to know where it is refracted so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.640 
going to know where it is refracted so
this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.070> where<00:01:26.820> should<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.470> can

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
this is here where should be so we can

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.020 
this is here where should be so we can
see<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:31.759> perpendicular<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
see here that this is perpendicular to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.649 
see here that this is perpendicular to
this<00:01:33.270> time<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.680> point<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.600> point

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
this time and this point here this point

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.050 
this time and this point here this point
that<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.290> where<00:01:37.470> these<00:01:37.619> two<00:01:37.920> lines<00:01:37.950> meet<00:01:38.340> acts

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that is where these two lines meet acts

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.649 
that is where these two lines meet acts
as<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.619> report<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.920> these<00:01:41.369> two<00:01:41.610> point<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.630> can

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
as a report of these two point so we can

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.260 
as a report of these two point so we can
first<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.530> all<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> face<00:01:44.100> find<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
first of all the face find this

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.840 
first of all the face find this
coordinate<00:01:45.750> upon<00:01:46.500> finding<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.670> find

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
coordinate upon finding this we can find

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.499 
coordinate upon finding this we can find
all<00:01:48.119> okay<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.799> let<00:01:50.070> us<00:01:50.100> first<00:01:50.430> find<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
all okay so let us first find the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.160 
all okay so let us first find the
equation<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.110> line<00:01:52.490> ok<00:01:54.079> equation<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
equation of this line ok equation of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.420 
equation of this line ok equation of
perpendicular<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> want<00:01:58.040> okay

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
perpendicular if you want okay

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.999 
perpendicular if you want okay
that's<00:01:59.790> why<00:02:00.060> man<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.479> free<00:02:00.719> up<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.320> X<00:02:01.560> plus<00:02:01.740> 1

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
that's why man is free up and X plus 1

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.179 
that's why man is free up and X plus 1
that<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.640> X<00:02:03.000> minus<00:02:03.090> -1<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.320> going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:04.979> what

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that is X minus -1 is going to be what

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.660 
that is X minus -1 is going to be what
free<00:02:05.700> open<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.780> cross<00:02:07.049> multiply<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:08.310> still

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
free open to the cross multiply it still

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.420 
free open to the cross multiply it still
I<00:02:08.700> minus<00:02:09.209> 6<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.780> equal<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.200> 3x<00:02:10.560> plus<00:02:10.770> 3

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
I minus 6 is equal to 3x plus 3

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.650 
I minus 6 is equal to 3x plus 3
again<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:13.330> Y<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.960> going<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.320> be<00:02:14.500> free<00:02:14.710> experts<00:02:15.130> 9

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
again to Y is going to be free experts 9

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.090 
again to Y is going to be free experts 9
and<00:02:16.660> if<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:16.960> want<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.380> can<00:02:17.560> say<00:02:17.710> that<00:02:17.890> Y<00:02:18.040> is

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
and if you want you can say that Y is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.480 
and if you want you can say that Y is
going<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.490> be<00:02:18.610> 3<00:02:19.240> by<00:02:19.360> 2<00:02:19.390> X<00:02:19.780> plus<00:02:20.170> 9<00:02:20.380> 8<00:02:20.530> 9<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:21.070> met

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
going to be 3 by 2 X plus 9 8 9 I met

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.040 
going to be 3 by 2 X plus 9 8 9 I met
you<00:02:21.670> okay<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.710> what<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.520> going<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.790> happen<00:02:25.090> is

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
you okay so what is going to happen is

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.480 
you okay so what is going to happen is
that<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:27.100> point<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.580> intersection<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.980> pull<00:02:30.250> up

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
that a point of intersection and pull up

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.670 
that a point of intersection and pull up
inter<00:02:32.880> section<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.990> we<00:02:35.110> will<00:02:35.260> have<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.560> do

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
inter section so we will have to do

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.980 
inter section so we will have to do
simultaneous<00:02:36.520> equation<00:02:36.970> with<00:02:37.360> these<00:02:37.600> two

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
simultaneous equation with these two

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.830 
simultaneous equation with these two
okay<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.090> do<00:02:40.300> simultaneous

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
okay that is just do simultaneous

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.180 
okay that is just do simultaneous
equation<00:02:41.260> with<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.070> be

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
equation with this and this this can be

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.530 
equation with this and this this can be
rewritten<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:46.140> don't<00:02:47.140> forget<00:02:47.260> we<00:02:47.500> had<00:02:47.650> this

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
rewritten so don't forget we had this

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.260 
rewritten so don't forget we had this
okay<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.230> we<00:02:50.710> also<00:02:50.860> have<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.400> one<00:02:51.610> 2<00:02:52.480> y<00:02:52.630> -3<00:02:53.290> X

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
okay and we also have this one 2 y -3 X

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.490 
okay and we also have this one 2 y -3 X
equal<00:02:55.270> to<00:02:55.540> this<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:57.220> 1<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:57.850> second<00:02:58.360> if<00:02:59.350> you

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
equal to this is 1 in this second if you

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.160 
equal to this is 1 in this second if you
want<00:02:59.710> it<00:02:59.860> is<00:02:59.980> as<00:03:00.130> if<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.310> are<00:03:00.490> we<00:03:00.970> are<00:03:01.090> doing<00:03:04.170> we

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
want it is as if you are we are doing we

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.360 
want it is as if you are we are doing we
are<00:03:05.200> doing<00:03:05.850> simultaneous<00:03:06.930> ok<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.980> solve<00:03:09.190> it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
are doing simultaneous ok so to solve it

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
are doing simultaneous ok so to solve it
we<00:03:09.700> are<00:03:09.790> going<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.090> say<00:03:10.270> let<00:03:10.960> us<00:03:10.990> eliminate<00:03:11.740> Y

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
we are going to say let us eliminate Y

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.180 
we are going to say let us eliminate Y
so<00:03:13.390> it's<00:03:13.540> going<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.870> be<00:03:14.140> 2<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.130> first<00:03:15.960> -<00:03:16.960> free<00:03:17.950> of

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
so it's going to be 2 of first - free of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.430 
so it's going to be 2 of first - free of
second<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:20.080> going<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.380> be<00:03:20.560> 4x<00:03:22.140> minus<00:03:23.140> 9

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
second so it's going to be 4x minus 9

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.430 
second so it's going to be 4x minus 9
minus<00:03:24.040> minus<00:03:24.930> 9<00:03:25.930> which<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.320> plus<00:03:26.710> 9<00:03:26.980> X<00:03:27.250> equal<00:03:28.000> to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
minus minus 9 which is plus 9 X equal to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.320 
minus minus 9 which is plus 9 X equal to
66<00:03:30.630> minus<00:03:31.630> 27<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.930> 13<00:03:34.930> X<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.500> going<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:35.890> be

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
66 minus 27 that is 13 X is going to be

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.840 
66 minus 27 that is 13 X is going to be
66<00:03:37.330> minus<00:03:37.720> 27<00:03:38.410> if<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.590> don't<00:03:38.800> know<00:03:38.980> use<00:03:39.760> your

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
66 minus 27 if you don't know use your

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.310 
66 minus 27 if you don't know use your
calculator<00:03:40.950> okay<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:42.010> it's<00:03:42.310> such<00:03:42.490> 9<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.320> hence

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
calculator okay so it's such 9 and hence

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.160 
calculator okay so it's such 9 and hence
we<00:03:44.530> get<00:03:44.680> X<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.070> be<00:03:45.160> free<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.670> what<00:03:46.480> will<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:46.930> be

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
we get X to be free so what will I be

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.600 
we get X to be free so what will I be
just<00:03:47.470> replace<00:03:48.220> you

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
just replace you

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.470 
just replace you
ok<00:03:49.360> why<00:03:49.630> it's<00:03:49.780> going<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.020> be<00:03:51.900> free<00:03:52.930> enter<00:03:53.260> to

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
ok why it's going to be free enter to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.310 
ok why it's going to be free enter to
multiply<00:03:55.480> by<00:03:55.600> X<00:03:55.840> plus<00:03:56.440> 9<00:03:56.680> by<00:03:56.800> 2<00:03:56.910> which<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:58.150> 9<00:03:59.110> by

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
multiply by X plus 9 by 2 which is 9 by

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.010 
multiply by X plus 9 by 2 which is 9 by
2<00:03:59.380> plus<00:03:59.800> 9<00:03:59.950> by<00:04:00.130> 2<00:04:00.190> which<00:04:00.940> is<00:04:01.150> 9<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.920> it's<00:04:03.040> free<00:04:03.310> no

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
2 plus 9 by 2 which is 9 so it's free no

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.100 
2 plus 9 by 2 which is 9 so it's free no
this<00:04:05.020> is<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.200> midpoint<00:04:05.440> okay<00:04:06.460> free<00:04:07.240> 9<00:04:07.840> is<00:04:08.080> a

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
this is a midpoint okay free 9 is a

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.930 
this is a midpoint okay free 9 is a
point<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:09.190> we<00:04:09.310> can<00:04:09.490> use<00:04:09.910> here<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:11.940> -1

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940
