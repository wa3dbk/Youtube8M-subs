 what measures can be taken accompanying them from mayani the manager 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.760
 regional computer security company 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.990
 sahim before equity welcome hours piggy bank is by salmons others many of 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.730
 these 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.589
 percent does not count two please 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.289
 percent and this is a princely title for 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.640
 make it clear this only those computers that have systems 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.750
 windows xp expo windows are the ones in danger tomorrow 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.510
 that computers that not only have windows but have a world 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.210
 that does not have the one last patch in security 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.820
 site a windows computer that does not have the latest security patches i 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.920
 not have a strong use protection then they are vulnerable to being 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.820
 infected by conflicts of the now eric that happens with those people who do not 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.710

 the security software you the sickle of different parties of this operation 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.240
 completely updated percent 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.439
 conficker is a is a threat that has been distributing not lately nor 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.439
 is that it is going to be distributed tomorrow is a threat that has been 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.340
 wandering the internet infecting different computers from the past 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.150
 November therefore it is crucial to have updates to the lidovia day 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.620
 minds includes tonight's yesterday's tricks that tomorrow's also 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.990
 there will be because if you how important first of April then 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.520
 well this this this particular threat 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.270
 have 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.800
 percent the possibility d 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.920
 every so often 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.690
 go find more instructions imagine that in the gp2 a network of 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.569
 spies 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.640
 and that each machine infected his new spy and every so often this spy 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.529
 looks for the way to communicate with the central to ask for more instructions 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.399
 what is the next thing he has to do 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:29.359
 because tomorrow is the day where p all computers that are infected 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.230
 with this threat 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.390
 they will leave to look for new instructions 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.220
 they were going to change the percent methodology by which they seek 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.859
 This road where you are going to look for we are instructions on what you do 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.949
 now be family of this malicious software as circus advances as you 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.660
 they call May holds the family 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.790
 that was malicious the conficker that they are looking for with this 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.079
 well there are league and valuable goals behind this no but there are only 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.009
 a very marked trend 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.599
 that has to do with information theft percent 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.359
 in order to achieve a financial benefit 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.249
 this can be translated in several ways can mean send spam 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.120
 may want to p the ibge take 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.459
 passwords for example of online banking or shopping sites that is 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.469
 using the user an infected machine 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.579
 i in all this can be controlled by 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.540
 that person who has control of what they are doing 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.810
 computers are infected nicolás the people who have mac computers 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.429
 have to be worried tomorrow or not 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:35.929
 This is a virus that is not currently affecting 100 computers 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:37.589
 mac 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.749
 percent and this once again raises the weaknesses that can have all the 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.870
 windows systems and so much has been criticized 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.890
 to this system the poule of skill that has percent of the system 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.790
 pointed this is going to change at some point and it is inevitable that you are 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.990
 malicious flower families of that 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.380
 continue to develop viruses in the future continued to squeeze 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.380
 computers is involuntarily and cheating people 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.379
 well it's actually this is a percent race that continues there I think or 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:09.839
 personally will continue 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:13.020
 in the trend has changed the last years 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.860
 percent years ago what percent were looking for and creators of this type 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.440
 of 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.709
 of threats is to seek notoriety to make a lot of noise 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.779
 and nowadays they hurt themselves not in the end it's exactly 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.390
 exactly one year 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.520
 exactly in ccoo and the day what they are looking for 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.759
 fundamentally the economic benefit of knowing if they can capture numbers of 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.910
 credit cards site passwords the mayor at the end of the day 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.140
 this is reduced that is 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.110
 very important and critical 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.099
 to keep the system completely updated, initiate some software 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.870
 of protection and tails this I love it to withdraw once again why very 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.720
 important we are warning our viewers 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.920
 it's earlier people constantly open up and I have no idea who 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.680
 they come 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.750
 open those files that well inside have no idea who is the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.389
 The person who changes them is the company that also be a doctor 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.040
 same and all the people read click and open it and you have to start avoiding this if 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.940
 you do not know who is sending you a message or ohl is sending an SMS 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.570
 a message by email and do not know what was inside that 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.669
 directly message to make him I realized that by stealing it 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.089
 exactly the long one at the end of the day 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:26.439
 the computers the internet access door as the door of the house is the 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.819
 contribution to the world 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.729
 and just as we do not let anybody in just because they are 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.669
 the couple of houses minutes is very important to be very careful with how 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.580
 we manage that force to the cybernetic world that are in the house 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.379
 So now that you turn on the computer, see if it's up to date with the 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:43.919
 protection systems 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.710
 exactly opened 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.590
 that they make sure they are up to date and that is ensuring they have 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.389
 a protection system 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.620
 and if they do not have it good it's a very good time to try to go and look for this 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.630
 some its closure system to propose protects of computations 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.520
 nicolás severino regional manager of the computer security company 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.619
 symantec thank you very much 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:06.159
 by local entity for clarifying those issues ofra next count of mallarmé 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.539
 and sport of course this is just going really fast do not be so naive or 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.500
 naive you will never be a millionaire over the internet with a miraculous message 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.220
 that promises a better future so if there is a serve you do not know about 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.360
 where it comes from and what company comes to ignore it completely borrel no 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.280
 I would even tell you to import them a message that you do not know the 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.800
 origin is not so and
