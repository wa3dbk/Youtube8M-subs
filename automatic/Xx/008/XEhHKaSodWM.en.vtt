00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that and it is for Windows so if you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.100 
that and it is for Windows so if you
have<00:01:39.630> Windows<00:01:40.020> XP<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.530> 7<00:01:41.570> it's<00:01:42.570> great<00:01:42.869> for

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
have Windows XP or 7 it's great for

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.920 
have Windows XP or 7 it's great for
those<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.890> even<00:01:43.950> Vista<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.780> want

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
those or even Vista and so what I want

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.210 
those or even Vista and so what I want
to<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.439> show<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.950> software

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
to do I want to show you the software

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
to do I want to show you the software
and<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.630> data<00:01:48.869> recovery

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and here it is it's a data recovery

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
and here it is it's a data recovery
software<00:01:49.619> by<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> company<00:01:50.610> called<00:01:50.700> pre<00:01:51.060> de

software by a company called pre de

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.170 
software by a company called pre de
logic<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.680> works<00:01:52.920> very<00:01:53.070> simple<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.000> you've

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
logic and it works very simple if you've

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.149 
logic and it works very simple if you've
never<00:01:54.420> tried<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.350> recover<00:01:55.619> deleted<00:01:55.860> files

never tried to recover deleted files

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.280 
never tried to recover deleted files
before<00:01:56.700> you're<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.110> any

before you're not going to have any
problems<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.159> there's<00:01:59.820> simply<00:02:00.500> really

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
problems with this there's simply really

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.990 
problems with this there's simply really
just<00:02:01.770> two<00:02:01.979> options<00:02:02.159> you're<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.820> use

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
up if it has a memory device this will

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.199 
up if it has a memory device this will
scan<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.870> memory<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.790> show<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.849> what's

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
scan that memory and show you what's

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.930 
scan that memory and show you what's
available<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.840> recover<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.640> can

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
available to recover and so you can

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.970 
available to recover and so you can
simply<00:02:39.330> go<00:02:39.900> through<00:02:39.959> these<00:02:40.260> options<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.950> just

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
simply go through these options and just

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.070 
simply go through these options and just
pick<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.640> it'll<00:02:42.060> walk<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:42.330> through<00:02:42.870> how<00:02:42.900> to

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
pick and it'll walk you through how to

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.440 
pick and it'll walk you through how to
do<00:02:43.379> it<00:02:43.560> or<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.700> advanced<00:02:45.030> scan

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
do it or you can go to the advanced scan

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.390 
do it or you can go to the advanced scan
which<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.840> also<00:02:46.019> very<00:02:46.410> simple<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.069> if<00:02:47.250> you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
which is also very simple and if you

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.100 
which is also very simple and if you
know<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.670> files<00:02:47.940> name<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.569> simply<00:02:48.900> type

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
know the files name you can simply type

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.199 
know the files name you can simply type
it<00:02:49.319> in<00:02:49.410> here<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.769> search<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.430> otherwise

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
it in here and search for it otherwise

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.970 
it in here and search for it otherwise
you<00:02:51.599> just<00:02:51.630> checkmark<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:52.560> want<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.799> scan

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
you just checkmark that you want to scan

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.220 
you just checkmark that you want to scan
the<00:02:53.130> recycle<00:02:53.670> bin<00:02:53.849> also<00:02:54.360> files<00:02:54.630> without<00:02:54.930> names

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
the recycle bin also files without names

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.630 
the recycle bin also files without names
corrupted<00:02:55.709> hard<00:02:55.890> drive<00:02:56.040> sectors<00:02:56.459> and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
corrupted hard drive sectors and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640 
corrupted hard drive sectors and
reformatted<00:02:57.239> partitions<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:58.560> you're

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
reformatted partitions and then you're

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.870 
reformatted partitions and then you're
going<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.860> get<00:02:58.980> down<00:02:59.099> here<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.489> this<00:02:59.640> section

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
going to get down here in this section

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.229 
going to get down here in this section
and<00:03:00.209> you're<00:03:00.780> going<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:00.959> checkmark<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:03.209> box

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
and you're going to checkmark the box

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.660 
and you're going to checkmark the box
next<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.290> device<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.099> want<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.370> scan

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
next to the device that you want to scan

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.600 
next to the device that you want to scan
so<00:03:05.970> if<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.360> an<00:03:06.450> external<00:03:06.959> hard<00:03:07.170> drive

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
so if you have an external hard drive

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.729 
so if you have an external hard drive
such<00:03:08.610> as<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:09.090> here<00:03:09.510> on<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.230> one<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.590> would

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
such as I have here on this one I would

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.259 
such as I have here on this one I would
checkmark<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.000> want<00:03:12.209> to

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
checkmark this is the one that I want to

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.449 
checkmark this is the one that I want to
scan<00:03:12.569> or<00:03:12.870> if<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.260> have<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.410> USB<00:03:13.739> drive<00:03:14.250> or

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
scan or if you have a USB drive or

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.490 
scan or if you have a USB drive or
whatever<00:03:14.660> you're<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.900> check<00:03:16.049> mark<00:03:16.380> it

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500
