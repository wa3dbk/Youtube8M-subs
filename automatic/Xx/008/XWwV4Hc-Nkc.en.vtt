television<00:00:12.599> has<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.780> lot<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.110> people<00:00:13.410> talking

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
television has a lot of people talking

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.519 
television has a lot of people talking
and<00:00:14.070> thinking<00:00:14.519> these<00:00:14.639> days<00:00:14.719> asking<00:00:15.719> questions

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
and thinking these days asking questions

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.370 
and thinking these days asking questions
to<00:00:17.029> questions<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.119> our<00:00:18.779> television

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
to questions like our television

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.080 
to questions like our television
stations<00:00:19.859> linked<00:00:20.100> together<00:00:20.279> by<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.789> bell

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090

system the way radio stations are
connected<00:00:24.140> well<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.710> question<00:00:25.980> we

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
connected well that's one question we

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.660 
connected well that's one question we
can<00:00:26.550> answer<00:00:26.840> but<00:00:27.840> first<00:00:28.109> let's<00:00:28.949> look<00:00:29.160> back<00:00:29.460> to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
can answer but first let's look back to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.040 
can answer but first let's look back to
the<00:00:29.789> beginning<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.390> cross<00:00:30.750> country

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the beginning of cross country

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.010 
the beginning of cross country
telephoning<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.790> those<00:00:33.090> days<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.870> were<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
telephoning in those days there were a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.250 
telephoning in those days there were a
few<00:00:34.260> wires<00:00:34.530> strung<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.160> slender<00:00:35.489> poles<00:00:35.989> but<00:00:36.989> as

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
few wires strung on slender poles but as

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100 
few wires strung on slender poles but as
the<00:00:37.500> demap<00:00:37.800> rule<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.149> more<00:00:39.390> wires<00:00:39.750> were

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the demap rule more and more wires were

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.979 
the demap rule more and more wires were
added<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.620> poles<00:00:41.000> in<00:00:42.000> some<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.570> larger

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
added to the poles in some of the larger

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.150 
added to the poles in some of the larger
cities<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.980> led<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> overcrowding<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.239> folds

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
cities this led to overcrowding of folds

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.069 
cities this led to overcrowding of folds
something<00:00:47.160> had<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.610> done

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
something had to be done

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.170 
something had to be done
so<00:00:49.079> Bell<00:00:49.320> System<00:00:49.649> engineers<00:00:50.340> began<00:00:50.789> looking

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
so Bell System engineers began looking

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150 
so Bell System engineers began looking
for<00:00:51.360> ways<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.539> make<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.079> wires<00:00:52.320> smaller<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
for ways to make the wires smaller and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.990 
for ways to make the wires smaller and
to<00:00:53.850> pack<00:00:54.059> them<00:00:54.300> into<00:00:54.480> lead<00:00:54.780> covered<00:00:55.260> cables

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.759 

today<00:01:03.000> these<00:01:03.270> cross<00:01:03.570> country<00:01:03.840> cables<00:01:04.439> carry

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
today these cross country cables carry

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
today these cross country cables carry
hundreds<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.339> wires<00:01:06.170> sometimes

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
hundreds of wires sometimes

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.640 
hundreds of wires sometimes
overhead<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.540> sometimes<00:01:09.540> buried<00:01:10.170> under<00:01:10.530> the

overhead and sometimes buried under the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.240 
overhead and sometimes buried under the
ground<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.510> time<00:01:12.510> went<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.260> people<00:01:13.890> found

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
ground as time went on and people found

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.090 
ground as time went on and people found
they<00:01:14.430> could<00:01:14.610> talk<00:01:14.820> farther<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.540> hear<00:01:15.840> better

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
they could talk farther and hear better

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.450 
they could talk farther and hear better
more<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> more<00:01:17.490> telephone<00:01:18.060> calls<00:01:18.450> were<00:01:18.750> made

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
more and more telephone calls were made

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.280 
more and more telephone calls were made
telephone<00:01:20.460> research<00:01:20.909> men<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:21.600> had<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> find

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
telephone research men then had to find

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
telephone research men then had to find
ways<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.619> make<00:01:23.100> these<00:01:23.340> wire<00:01:23.610> pathways<00:01:24.180> carry

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
ways to make these wire pathways carry

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.190 
ways to make these wire pathways carry
heavier<00:01:25.439> traffic<00:01:25.970> ways<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.270> place<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.810> calls

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
heavier traffic ways to place more calls

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.480 
heavier traffic ways to place more calls
on<00:01:28.530> each<00:01:28.740> wire<00:01:29.009> yet<00:01:30.000> keep<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> calls<00:01:30.720> separate

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
on each wire yet keep the calls separate

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.980 
on each wire yet keep the calls separate
this<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:32.759> done<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.390> came<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.840> known

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this was done with what came to be known

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.030 
this was done with what came to be known
as<00:01:34.409> carrier<00:01:35.250> systems<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:37.140> first<00:01:37.380> used<00:01:37.530> on

as carrier systems it was first used on

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.240 
as carrier systems it was first used on
open<00:01:38.549> wires<00:01:39.110> then<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> pairs<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.040> wires
