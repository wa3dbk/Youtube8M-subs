00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.030 
and um I don't get any triple sec and I
don't<00:04:06.030> really<00:04:06.450> get<00:04:06.720> any<00:04:06.989> lime<00:04:07.319> juice<00:04:07.620> probably

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
don't really get any lime juice probably

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.699 
don't really get any lime juice probably
because<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.760> margarita<00:04:09.330> this<00:04:10.019> one<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.470> based

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
because the margarita this one is based

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.210 
because the margarita this one is based
on<00:04:10.890> off<00:04:11.100> lines<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.709> lime<00:04:13.830> juice<00:04:14.100> I

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
on off lines so the lime juice I

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.699 
on off lines so the lime juice I
probably<00:04:14.580> taste<00:04:15.120> but<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.510> just<00:04:16.049> probably<00:04:16.289> think

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
probably taste but I just probably think

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.279 
probably taste but I just probably think
it's<00:04:16.829> just<00:04:17.039> this<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.669> never<00:04:17.820> know

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
it's just this but you never know

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.830 
it's just this but you never know
convenient<00:04:19.289> use<00:04:19.410> too<00:04:19.590> much<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:19.979> but<00:04:20.840> it's

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
convenient use too much of that but it's

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.950 
convenient use too much of that but it's
definitely<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.620> odd<00:04:23.460> drink<00:04:24.180> like<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.660> would

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
definitely a odd drink like I would

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.560 
definitely a odd drink like I would
drink<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.440> it's<00:04:25.950> definitely<00:04:26.760> thicker<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.450> it

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
drink it it's definitely thicker and it

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.170 
drink it it's definitely thicker and it
definitely<00:04:28.110> tastes<00:04:28.440> more<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.729> weird<00:04:29.970> taste

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
definitely tastes more of a weird taste

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.640 
definitely tastes more of a weird taste
that<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.450> wouldn't<00:04:30.690> expect<00:04:30.750> mocktails

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
that you wouldn't expect mocktails

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.420 
that you wouldn't expect mocktails
it's<00:04:31.830> like<00:04:32.780> it's<00:04:33.780> what<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.530> tastes<00:04:34.740> very<00:04:35.100> sweet

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
it's like it's what it tastes very sweet

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.460 
it's like it's what it tastes very sweet
and<00:04:35.850> I<00:04:36.240> think<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:38.330> like<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.810> thing<00:04:40.110> is<00:04:40.289> I

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
and I think that I like the thing is I

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.110 
and I think that I like the thing is I
wasn't<00:04:40.710> expecting<00:04:41.370> when<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.520> took<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.789> big

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
wasn't expecting when I took that big

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.240 
wasn't expecting when I took that big
employers<00:04:42.539> for<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.900> be<00:04:43.050> like<00:04:43.229> that<00:04:43.260> but<00:04:44.010> I

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
employers for it to be like that but I

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.820 
employers for it to be like that but I
think<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.539> is<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.810> pretty<00:04:46.140> good<00:04:46.350> drink<00:04:46.590> so

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
think that it is a pretty good drink so

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.700 
think that it is a pretty good drink so
I<00:04:46.860> definitely<00:04:47.130> recommend<00:04:48.080> for<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.440> try<00:04:49.680> it

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
I definitely recommend for you to try it

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.320 
I definitely recommend for you to try it
