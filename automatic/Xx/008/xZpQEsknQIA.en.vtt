cider vinegar and then the next thing we
do<00:01:38.570> is<00:01:39.680> we<00:01:40.680> make<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.479> straps<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:44.130> will<00:01:44.310> hold

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
do is we make some straps that will hold

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.580 
do is we make some straps that will hold
these<00:01:45.240> onto<00:01:45.659> plants<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.259> we'll<00:01:46.350> demonstrate

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
these onto plants and we'll demonstrate

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.550 
these onto plants and we'll demonstrate
that<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> placement<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> minute<00:01:48.840> but

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that and placement here in a minute but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.940 
that and placement here in a minute but
first<00:01:49.829> we're<00:01:50.130> assembling<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> trap<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.950> have

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
first we're assembling the trap I have

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.490 
first we're assembling the trap I have
some<00:01:53.310> holes<00:01:53.549> drilled<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.149> side<00:01:57.259> which<00:01:58.259> I'm

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
some holes drilled in the side which I'm

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.100 
some holes drilled in the side which I'm
just<00:01:58.530> taking<00:01:59.280> some<00:01:59.310> fine<00:01:59.969> wire<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.110> use

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
just taking some fine wire you can use

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.580 
just taking some fine wire you can use
any<00:02:04.110> kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.649> strap<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.340> hang<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.240 

okay<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.970> looks<00:02:10.119> good<00:02:10.690> another<00:02:11.530> thing<00:02:11.890> we<00:02:12.069> do

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
okay that looks good another thing we do

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.070 
okay that looks good another thing we do
there's<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.300> lid<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:15.340> take<00:02:15.610> these<00:02:15.849> lids<00:02:16.780> I

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
there's a lid to it we take these lids I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.540 
there's a lid to it we take these lids I
just<00:02:20.080> punch<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.470> little<00:02:20.620> hole<00:02:21.270> through<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.300> and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
just punch a little hole through it and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:33.030 
just punch a little hole through it and
the<00:02:24.550> top<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.030> lid<00:02:28.769> remove<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:32.010> piece<00:02:33.010> of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
the top of the lid remove the piece of

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.900 
the top of the lid remove the piece of
paper<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:34.319> insert<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:38.459> inside<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.700> cup

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
paper and insert it inside of the cup

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.370 
paper and insert it inside of the cup
and<00:02:40.709> now<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.769> have<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.100> trap<00:02:42.519> ready<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.690> go<00:02:43.870> to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
and now you have a trap ready to go to

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.660 
and now you have a trap ready to go to
be<00:02:44.530> hung<00:02:44.769> in<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:46.260> canopy<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.500> your<00:02:47.860> fruiting

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
be hung in the canopy of your fruiting

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.780 
be hung in the canopy of your fruiting
bushes<00:02:49.319> if<00:02:50.319> you're<00:02:50.830> not<00:02:51.010> gonna<00:02:51.220> hang<00:02:51.580> your

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
bushes if you're not gonna hang your

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.670 
bushes if you're not gonna hang your
trap<00:02:52.120> for<00:02:52.810> example<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:53.470> have<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
trap for example if you have a

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.509 
trap for example if you have a
strawberry<00:02:53.980> bed<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:55.569> may<00:02:55.810> want<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.769> use<00:02:57.069> even

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
strawberry bed you may want to use even

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.330 
strawberry bed you may want to use even
a<00:02:57.640> shorter<00:02:58.269> container<00:02:58.930> that's<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.500> about<00:02:59.709> 16

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
a shorter container that's just about 16

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.670 
a shorter container that's just about 16
ounces<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.150> effect<00:03:01.900> again<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.500> will<00:03:02.620> see

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
ounces and effect again you will see

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.370 
ounces and effect again you will see
holes<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.519> are<00:03:03.580> drilled<00:03:03.870> along<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.080> sides

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
holes that are drilled along the sides
