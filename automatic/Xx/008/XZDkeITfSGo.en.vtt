00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.070
 and i give it to you to find them around 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.520
 all being watched by the tour 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.830
 de france 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.170
 and those have floor month leaves 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.820
 so yes you do get some people 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.820
 even with this suit there again 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.120
 hello and construction and therefore mollema en ten dam 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.559
 we go on a bike and tom 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.270
 you beat 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.890
 here from the north of country that have 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.150
 ridden on an e-bike 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.150
 well the did not know where it came across 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.950
 my name boy 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.759
 greetings was first to buy on 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.649
 such a bike is sitting and yes you start it 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.390
 Notice and god it if you like your one 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.110
 little kick that he that that 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.119
 advance 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.420
 I felt sorry that he can but up to 25 per 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.700
 hour actually no we say that wins too 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.259
 it gave you the holder of went so make 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.060
 because we have good experience 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.159
 a fantastic I never had the hangover 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.560
 sat on it but it really struck me 100% 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.270
 I really loved Reidinga 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.250
 you feel rich he really feels it 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.740
 front wheel really yes you really feel 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.600
 drive for that matter in your can 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.039
 of course still with the eco that the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.750
 ridicule 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.350
 adjustment so it certainly makes a lot 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.780
 difference yes so 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.399
 bikes with the best support 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.289
 The Schildwolde can both use now 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.679
 throws at me but I think they give me 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.720
 not just to accept it in 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.280
 bike is working it really works yes the role 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.019
 teams do that from their mechanic 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.420
 Rental you can tell you how 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.400
 important that is very important 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.489
 your mechanics I must above all ensure that 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.290
 the bikes or chess works well 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.660
 it all if tip top is fine and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.640
 yes certainly in the tour or in every competition 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.200
 then your bike can of course yes if you 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.880
 bad luck that wrong moments can 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.609
 just the difference between between 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.230
 profit and loss and leads us to 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.549
 us in the squad is very good mechanism 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.299
 who have it well done for each other 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.829
 to have 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.480
 it's a super important thing that I cycle 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.340
 that if the subject fails 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.690
 he broke something or you have to change something 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.290
 in the end it will cost you a lot of time 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.420
 and energy 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.829
 so before that time it is mainly a question 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.019
 for that man to finish as well as possible 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.180
 therefore say that nothing breaks the 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.310
 tires with the correct pressure the brakes 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.950
 well-adjusted height of your handlebars from 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.660
 your saddle yes actually is after to you 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.480
 own quarrel you tell that is the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.079
 adjustment of the bicycle and therefore yes 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.220
 important 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.489
 there is a lot of maintenance actually 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.550
 yes of course we see a bike 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.950
 too yes of course it's just one 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.740
 a complex whole and it is becoming 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.740
 More complex with electrical switching and 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.360
 and lighter and then he or she must be hours a day 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.640
 under few days we need new new ones 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.680
 tips on you are also kit in between 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.930
 he is more work are you think yes is what 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.730
 for the alp d'huez for next year 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.680
 who knows yes i would like a motor in it 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.190
 I want the racing bike year well 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.110
 use 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.370
 I think if you take this kind of third week with 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.140
 that it did bring differences 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.010
 the end yes then that certainly does not work 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.550
 count 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.550
 no no I just keep up 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.840
 human strength and leave here later 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.840
 apparently for the city
