you're<00:00:11.010> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.309> need<00:00:11.670> image<00:00:12.179> burn<00:00:12.480> this

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you're going to need image burn this

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.509 
you're going to need image burn this
program<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.650> easily<00:00:13.830> get<00:00:14.130> anywhere

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
program you can easily get anywhere

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.870 
program you can easily get anywhere
probably<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> link<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.880> my

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
probably have a link to it on my

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.990 
probably have a link to it on my
description<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.670> you're<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
description and you're going to have a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.130 
description and you're going to have a
modded<00:00:21.390> ps2<00:00:21.689> or<00:00:22.140> swap<00:00:22.859> magic<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.750> I<00:00:24.750> think

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
modded ps2 or swap magic and I think

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.540 
modded ps2 or swap magic and I think
I've<00:00:25.289> heard<00:00:25.470> there's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.769> different<00:00:26.130> way<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.250> do

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
I've heard there's a different way to do

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.339 
I've heard there's a different way to do
it<00:00:26.730> without<00:00:27.000> name<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.199> easily

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it without name of that but can easily

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.479 
it without name of that but can easily
break<00:00:28.650> ps2<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.880> don't<00:00:30.359> really<00:00:30.390> recommend<00:00:30.810> it

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
break ps2 so I don't really recommend it

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.090 
break ps2 so I don't really recommend it
okay<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.660> first<00:00:33.930> want<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.680> put

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
okay so what you first want to do is put

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.970 
okay so what you first want to do is put
in<00:00:35.219> your<00:00:35.570> ps2<00:00:36.570> desk<00:00:36.960> into<00:00:37.290> your<00:00:37.440> computer<00:00:37.829> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
don't have to do anything special to it

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.569 
don't have to do anything special to it
now<00:00:43.620> start<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.280> image<00:00:44.579> burn

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.799 

okay<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:52.489> want<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.820> create<00:00:53.239> image<00:00:53.600> file

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
okay so you want to create image file

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.680 
okay so you want to create image file
from<00:00:54.019> disk<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:55.579> um<00:00:57.489> so<00:00:58.489> have<00:00:58.909> the<00:00:59.059> read<00:00:59.299> speeds

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
from disk and um so have the read speeds

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.520 
from disk and um so have the read speeds
be<00:00:59.960> at<00:01:00.079> like<00:01:00.289> 4x<00:01:00.829> whatever<00:01:01.750> 4x<00:01:02.750> over<00:01:02.870> 4x<00:01:03.260> I

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
be at like 4x whatever 4x over 4x I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.869 
be at like 4x whatever 4x over 4x I
don't<00:01:03.679> know<00:01:03.769> that's<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.399> speed<00:01:04.610> you<00:01:04.699> have<00:01:04.729> to

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
don't know that's the speed you have to

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.359 
don't know that's the speed you have to
write<00:01:05.059> it<00:01:05.089> out<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:05.600> I'm<00:01:06.259> just<00:01:06.530> doing<00:01:07.009> that<00:01:07.130> just

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
write it out so I'm just doing that just

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.359 
write it out so I'm just doing that just
to<00:01:07.520> be<00:01:07.820> safe<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.869> barely<00:01:09.380> even<00:01:09.619> gets<00:01:09.979> that<00:01:10.100> high

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
to be safe it barely even gets that high

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.440 
to be safe it barely even gets that high
so<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:10.729> doesn't<00:01:11.030> even<00:01:11.180> matter<00:01:12.789> so<00:01:13.789> now<00:01:14.030> select

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
so it doesn't even matter so now select

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.940 
so it doesn't even matter so now select
your<00:01:14.570> destination<00:01:14.899> of<00:01:15.439> where<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.649> want<00:01:15.830> the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
your destination of where you want the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.580 
your destination of where you want the
iso<00:01:16.369> file<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.789> be<00:01:16.820> I've<00:01:17.659> already<00:01:17.990> created<00:01:18.229> my

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
iso file to be I've already created my

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.289 
iso file to be I've already created my
iso<00:01:19.100> file<00:01:19.720> scene<00:01:20.720> right<00:01:21.679> there<00:01:22.060> image<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.270> I

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
iso file scene right there image that I

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.059
