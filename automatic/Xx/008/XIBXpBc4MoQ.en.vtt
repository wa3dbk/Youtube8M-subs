hello<00:00:00.570> I'm<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:01.110> cube<00:00:01.350> master<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:01.949> I'm<00:00:02.070> going

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hello I'm the cube master and I'm going

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.970 
hello I'm the cube master and I'm going
to<00:00:02.310> teach<00:00:02.520> you<00:00:02.550> our<00:00:02.700> Rubik's<00:00:03.149> Cube<00:00:03.389> works<00:00:03.980> this

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
to teach you our Rubik's Cube works this

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.360 
to teach you our Rubik's Cube works this
is<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.220> standard<00:00:05.850> 3x3<00:00:06.450> rubik's<00:00:06.810> cube<00:00:07.189> like<00:00:08.189> this

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
is a standard 3x3 rubik's cube like this

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.669 
is a standard 3x3 rubik's cube like this
is<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.730> get<00:00:08.910> at<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> store<00:00:09.590> how<00:00:10.590> it

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
is what you get at the store how it

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.280 
is what you get at the store how it
works<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.130> turn<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.790> side<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:13.019> all<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
works is you turn a side and all the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.620 
works is you turn a side and all the
pieces<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.799> side<00:00:14.219> move<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.420> turn

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
pieces on that side move you can turn

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.960 
pieces on that side move you can turn
all<00:00:15.809> six<00:00:16.109> sides<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> cube<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.730> can<00:00:17.850> get

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
all six sides of the cube and it can get

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.260 
all six sides of the cube and it can get
mixed<00:00:18.300> up<00:00:18.390> really<00:00:18.630> fast<00:00:19.039> to<00:00:20.039> take<00:00:20.220> apart<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.730> 3x3

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
important thing to remember when you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.859 
important thing to remember when you
actually<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.340> about<00:01:59.369> solving<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.210> rubik's<00:02:00.570> cube

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
actually go about solving a rubik's cube

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.010 
actually go about solving a rubik's cube
is<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.280> sides<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:03.000> most<00:02:03.360> Rubik's<00:02:03.750> cubes

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
is that the sides on most Rubik's cubes

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.139 
is that the sides on most Rubik's cubes
are<00:02:04.170> oriented<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> same<00:02:04.860> way<00:02:05.119> for<00:02:06.119> example

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
are oriented the same way for example

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.990 
are oriented the same way for example
the<00:02:06.750> blue<00:02:06.930> side<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.229> always<00:02:07.829> upset<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.729> green

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the blue side is always upset the green

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.330 
the blue side is always upset the green
side<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.959> orange<00:02:10.259> side<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.649> always<00:02:10.890> opposite

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
side the orange side is always opposite

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.920 
side the orange side is always opposite
the<00:02:11.760> red<00:02:11.940> side<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:13.020> yellow<00:02:13.230> side

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the red side and the yellow side

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.649 
the red side and the yellow side
always<00:02:14.230> opposite<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.250> white<00:02:15.459> side<00:02:15.730> an<00:02:16.420> easy

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
always opposite the white side an easy

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.599 
always opposite the white side an easy
way<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.959> remember<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.829> that<00:02:17.890> colors<00:02:18.430> that

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
way to remember this is that colors that

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.399 
way to remember this is that colors that
are<00:02:18.700> kind<00:02:18.969> of<00:02:19.090> similar<00:02:19.359> like<00:02:19.780> blue<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.200> green

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
are kind of similar like blue and green

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.259 
are kind of similar like blue and green
are<00:02:20.650> always<00:02:21.159> going<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> be<00:02:21.489> opposite<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.150> each

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
are always going to be opposite of each

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.720 
are always going to be opposite of each
other<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.750> white<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.950> yellow<00:02:24.159> are<00:02:24.549> also

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
other and white and yellow are also

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.940 
other and white and yellow are also
pretty<00:02:25.090> similar<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.689> so<00:02:26.049> is<00:02:26.290> orange<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.799> red

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
pretty similar and so is orange and red

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.250 
pretty similar and so is orange and red
this<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:28.090> help<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.450> when<00:02:28.569> you're<00:02:28.719> solving<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
this can help you when you're solving it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.899 
this can help you when you're solving it
so<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:29.829> don't<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.099> to<00:02:30.219> keep<00:02:30.370> looking<00:02:30.639> around

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
so you don't have to keep looking around

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.879 
so you don't have to keep looking around
for<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.329> centerpieces<00:02:31.840> because<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.739> know

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
for the centerpieces because you know

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.640 
for the centerpieces because you know
where<00:02:33.069> they'll<00:02:33.250> be

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
where they'll be

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.929 
where they'll be
now<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.859> you<00:02:35.950> know<00:02:36.069> how<00:02:36.250> our<00:02:36.370> Rubik's<00:02:36.670> Cube

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
now that you know how our Rubik's Cube

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.399 
now that you know how our Rubik's Cube
works<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.480> might<00:02:37.629> be<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> little<00:02:37.930> easier<00:02:38.170> for

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
works it might be a little easier for

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.890 
works it might be a little easier for
you<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.650> understand<00:02:39.189> how<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.430> solve<00:02:39.730> one<00:02:40.000> don't

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
you to understand how to solve one don't

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.390 
you to understand how to solve one don't
hit<00:02:41.109> like<00:02:41.290> unless<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.769> enjoyed<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.219> video
