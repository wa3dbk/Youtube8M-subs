irrespective of the pregnancy duration

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.930 
irrespective of the pregnancy duration
just<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.629> need<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> ask<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.649> patient<00:00:53.129> has<00:00:53.730> she

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
just you need to ask the patient has she

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.500 
just you need to ask the patient has she
been<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.360> pregnant<00:00:55.160> she<00:00:56.160> will<00:00:56.309> say<00:00:56.550> yeah<00:00:56.969> twice

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
been a pregnant she will say yeah twice

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.310 
been a pregnant she will say yeah twice
but<00:00:58.579> two<00:00:59.579> times<00:00:59.789> have<00:01:00.719> been<00:01:00.960> aborted<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:03.320> so

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
but two times have been aborted so so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.719 
but two times have been aborted so so
the<00:01:04.589> gravity<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.400> 2<00:01:05.610> okay<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:07.460> just<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the gravity will be 2 okay so just you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.100 
the gravity will be 2 okay so just you
have<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> remember<00:01:09.210> what's<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.630> gravity

Omaha has never carried a pregnancy
achieving<00:04:08.810> what<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.530> call<00:04:10.989> equals<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.410> 20<00:04:12.769> weeks

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
achieving what I call equals to 20 weeks

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.830 
achieving what I call equals to 20 weeks
so<00:04:13.130> 20<00:04:13.459> weeks<00:04:13.639> gestation<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:14.329> really<00:04:14.750> very

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
so 20 weeks gestation is really very

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.140 
so 20 weeks gestation is really very
important<00:04:15.470> nullifier<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:16.549> nothing<00:04:16.820> but<00:04:16.910> woman

achieving 20 equals 20 or more than 20
weeks<00:04:23.450> of<00:04:23.690> gestation<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:25.190> it's<00:04:25.400> like<00:04:25.640> an<00:04:25.789> early
