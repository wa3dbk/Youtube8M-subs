sticks<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.680> enable<00:02:32.220> stick<00:02:32.520> one

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
sticks you enable stick one

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.759 
sticks you enable stick one
and<00:02:33.560> put<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.890> axis<00:02:34.400> as<00:02:34.610> x<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.780> y<00:02:35.930> just<00:02:36.560> like

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.970 
and put the axis as x and y just like
that<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:38.060> it'll<00:02:38.629> work<00:02:38.780> right<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:39.500> go<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.680> stick

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
that so it'll work right and go to stick

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.210 
that so it'll work right and go to stick
to<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.580> enable<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.150> also<00:02:42.010> then<00:02:43.010> go<00:02:43.159> to

to you enable that also then go to
access<00:02:43.819> our<00:02:44.000> y-axis<00:02:44.659> RX<00:02:45.590> just<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.310> i<00:02:46.340> can<00:02:46.549> just

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
access our y-axis RX just so i can just

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.930 
access our y-axis RX just so i can just
so<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.269> will<00:02:47.390> work<00:02:47.599> on<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.870> one<00:02:48.049> right<00:02:48.170> here

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
so it will work on this one right here
