00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.580
 he threw paulo henrique do tecnoblog 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.179
 direct from barcelona to show the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.420
 galaxy s 6 or better the galaxy 6 that the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.349
 samsung showed on Sunday , 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.230
 March 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.320
 to vestas on the eve of the opening of the world 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.939
 congress the first galaxy 6 is the rooster 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.330
 that it is normal that you probably 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.039
 will buy successor to Galaxy 5 and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.510
 samsung also presented a galaxay 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.350
 seat that has a screen a curved screen 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.719
 on both sides is copying is inspired 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.239
 on the idea of ​​the galaxy note edge 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.030
 the handsets have a lot of hardware 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.690
 similar is basically what changes is the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.510
 thickness but I know sad it has 0.2mm 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.610
 the plus is got 50,000 empire hour more 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.100
 battery but it will practically not do 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.190
 difference and it is a bit narrower 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.300
 because the fact of the screens and curved in the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.520
 sides 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.539
 change a little is one thing 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.049
 interesting 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.140
 it's just that the most 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.500
 clean is already it the two appliances already comes 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.979
 with ipop samsung android 5.0 made 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.630
 active modifications continue there have tem 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.830
 many of the resources that people 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.439
 found in the old galaxy but aa 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.250
 samsung made a point of adopting some 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.100
 ideas of keeping the design and stayed 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 It's really cool, a screen problem. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:38.159
 6 is to be curved is that the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.720
 content gets a little distorted on 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.509
 sides but actually more a matter 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.500
 than a technical problem 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.329
 or finally execution is an issue 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.090
 more to get used to 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.310
 you design has improved a lot in 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.409
 relation to the last generation is everything 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.240
 world tired of knowing that 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.210
 championship height that is samsung 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.630
 finally abandoned plastic 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.549
 edges are made of aluminum and steel and 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.880
 a glass rear that even has 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.250
 Curila Gracie 4 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.220
 a cool point of the gorilla glass 4 is that 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:18.200
 it has a greater resistance to falls 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:22.370
 so then maybe this will save the galaxy 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.400
 6 of some minor accidents in the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.400
 of settings or before you're fine 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.269
 You're still with a lot of samsung. 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.340
 simplified even put a try one 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.080
 settings area where you can 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.720
 You can put whatever you want to 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.870
 there fast access time but it looks like a 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.989
 thing is still polluted and confused in 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:50.390
 relation to android normal android pure 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:54.519
 that we see in nexus and in some 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:58.840
 motorola appliances in s6 ad 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:02.540
 practically we do not see as much 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.849
 justification for the screens and curved 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.120
 as we saw in tié dye with those 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.720
 Shortcut features on the side control 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.760
 the media player, and when you 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.790
 he carried instead turned it off 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.430
 showed the load level anyway is this 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.630
 if it was you basically have a business 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.030
 a feature for example for ready access 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.940
 fast to a favorite contact by 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.239
 example that can have several colors 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.980
 if you turn the unit off 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.130
 certain times of the day 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.350
 this screen door can stay connected is 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.799
 now showing how the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.480
 fabric only 6 of the floors needed 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.840
 should not be a very big problem 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.840
 for battery and after all you go 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.639
 you will leave the device at night kagan 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.150
 in any way then taking a 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:58.580
 problem never made samsung enough 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.950
 highlight this battery issue 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.770
 16 and the s6 is theirs with this new design 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.650
 they no longer have a removable battery 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.150
 ah and also does not have 11 an entrance to 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.720
 micro sd card that I'll talk about here 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.450
 there is little to samsung said in a 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.680
 for Brazilian journalists that the 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.720
 samsung only took this option of not having 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.240
 more removable battery when I have 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.480
 sure that the user would not need 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.300
 more than anything of the kind and that the battery 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.310
 she would hold the battery in fact she 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.540
 decreases until it decreases a little 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.460
 capacity issue , the normal 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.380
 2550 Mpele time on the card 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.870
 Samsung specifications but 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.780
 processor is the new xbox 14 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.440
 nanometer that samsung claims to be more 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.400
 and delivers performance up to 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.160
 best 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.330
 are 3 gb of ram which is the 6 year 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.480
 settings 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.610
 he has a desmate manager is a genius 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.640
 but task requirement that shows the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.580
 how much the available network has and gives 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.510
 Little bit of fear when you watch TV 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.550
 which starts at 84% stroke used in the 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.560
 true the way android manages 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.930
 the ram has no problem 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:30.620
 when an application requires android ham 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:32.780
 release the s6 he finally eliminated the 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.850
 16 gigabyte option no longer available 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.310
 even in brazil 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.520
 according to roberto soboll who is director of 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.700
 Mobile Samsung products in Brazil there 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.810
 we will have 32 and 64 and 128 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.930
 gb no more micro sd to put the 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.150
 which may be a positive point in point 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.010
 negative in the final micro sd is 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.630
 significantly slower than the 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.000
 internal memory of the device 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.910
 mainly on galaxy 6 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.510
 Samsung has upgraded and is up to 30% 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.720
 faster than normal memory 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.670
 then it has improved this point also and 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.160
 It's a problem because obviously 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.320
 the cost for you to increase memory soon 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.150
 at the time of purchase is sure to be 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.210
 much larger than if you had a 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.100
 device with a constellation 32 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.710
 gigabytes and buy a micro 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.610
 sd to expand the memory but at last it is 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:31.370
 that it even actively works with 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.200
 To apple in Brazil but that reminds me not 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.590
 have no other company do that 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:45.890
 in the high end with options 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:48.860
 up to 128 gb o the gas button 16 is has a 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.480
 fingerprint sensor and a 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.810
 cool part is you do not need anymore 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.360
 slide your finger or do not guarantee 5 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.100
 only that part of sliding the 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.110
 was a problem because not always 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.240
 very sure as well as not being very 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.610
 now you simply do it 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.260
 The same is on the iphone from 5 s 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.530
 you register your fingerprint 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:12.310
 by tapping the button and so on 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:15.110
 How so you want to connect the device? 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.930
 no longer resting on the button it goes 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.560
 automatically block these were the 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.930
 galaxy six new s6 s6 edge both 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.840
 beginning to be sold in the world on 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.070
 April 10 to samsung said that Brazil 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.380
 not in the first batch of releases 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.020
 but the release date in Brazil will 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.330
 be very close to that day April 10 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.800
 it is already confirmed that it arrives 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.440
 still in April 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.470
 this loneliness did not define exactly the 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.350
 colors and the price obviously still has not been 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:48.350
 released but samsung has already signaled that 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.420
 should reach the band of 3 thousand reais 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.940
 which is already fully expected 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.350
 these were the new appliances and the 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.240
 first impressions complete you 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.690
 check in the technoblog until the next 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.690
 champions
