00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.190
 we are leaders in cocoa production 

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:06.860
 in the equator we have 2000 hectares 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.410
 of the club ccn51 proudly 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.150
 Ecuadorian are the pioneers in the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.640
 development of management techniques and 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.200
 benefit of our gold chip 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.759
 work begins with the selection of 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.099
 better seeds to develop 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.349
 patterns over which at the age of 2 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.749
 months a graft with yolk of 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.579
 high production and quality our areas 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.529
 of cultivation are prepared with all the 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.839
 modern agricultural technique the floors 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.399
 subsoiled plows and released are 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.250
 designed with irrigation infrastructure 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.769
 Drain necessary roads and cable 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.899
 for future cultivation work the 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.789
 cateo is cultivated in association with the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.309
 green banana of high demand and consumption 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:45.079
 18 months after planting is 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.420
 necessary to carry out training pruning 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.250
 and hardening so that the branches 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.109
 support the weight of the ears in the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.820
 future at three years you get the 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.100
 first harvest the fourth comes 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.350
 stabilize between 50 and 60 quintals per 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.969
 hectare per year as long as it is 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.730
 operate under a strict program of 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.079
 irrigation and fertilization the harvest 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.180
 consists of collecting the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.900
 ears or fruit the same as demand 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.910
 large amount 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.790
 labor which contributes to the 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.440
 economy of neighboring families of the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.900
 the grains are removed 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.670
 separating them from the ribs to be 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.770
 taken to the terminals where they 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.650
 makes the benefit of cocoa which 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.320
 consists of the presentation by 4 or 5 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.690
 days and has dried the grain until 8 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.370
 percent of humidity one of the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.160
 most important plantations of the gruppo 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.260
 Quirola is the hacienda makes canal this 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.810
 It has more than 400 hectares of cocoa 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.160
 in different physiological states is 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.840
 here where the plants are produced 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.850
 grafts where the first one was installed 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.740
 artificial dryer and all the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.430
 necessary handling to reach the optimum 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.020
 of quality and yield in the grain 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.940
 This is a paradise that has all 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.950
