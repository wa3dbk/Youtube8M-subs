almost<00:01:04.379> every<00:01:04.890> foot<00:01:05.689> it<00:01:06.689> takes<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.049> long<00:01:07.229> time

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
almost every foot it takes a long time

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.580 
almost every foot it takes a long time
to<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> tubing<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.020> actually<00:01:10.409> laid

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
to do this the tubing was actually laid

little after 8 o'clock at night to get
all<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.170> tubing<00:01:25.560> laid<00:01:25.799> down<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.430> one

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
all this tubing laid down and one

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.070 
all this tubing laid down and one
thing's<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.750> sure

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
thing's for sure

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.350 
thing's for sure
having<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> radio<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.460> makes<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> go<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> lot

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
having the radio on makes it go a lot

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.289 
having the radio on makes it go a lot
faster<00:01:31.340> because<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.520> definitely<00:01:32.700> took<00:01:33.150> a

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
faster because it definitely took a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.240 
faster because it definitely took a
while<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.840> especially<00:01:34.229> tedious<00:01:34.860> because

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
while and is especially tedious because

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
while and is especially tedious because
of<00:01:35.400> all<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> tying<00:01:36.090> down<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.540> had<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.810> be

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
of all the tying down that had to be

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.370 
of all the tying down that had to be
done<00:01:37.640> but<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.850> pretty<00:01:39.420> much<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.810> only<00:01:39.840> steps

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
done but now pretty much the only steps

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.710 
done but now pretty much the only steps
that<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.680> left<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.299> our<00:01:42.450> plumber

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.050 
by a thermostat and then the concrete
people<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.909> come<00:02:03.119> back

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
people can come back

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.600 
people can come back
and<00:02:04.659> they<00:02:04.810> can<00:02:04.990> actually<00:02:05.170> pour<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:06.190> rat<00:02:06.400> wall

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
and they can actually pour the rat wall

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.180 
and they can actually pour the rat wall
which<00:02:07.510> is<00:02:07.540> what<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.930> plywood<00:02:08.350> former<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:08.920> for

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
which is what the plywood former is for

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.470 
which is what the plywood former is for
and<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.929> can<00:02:11.110> go<00:02:11.260> on<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.740> pour<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.459> floor<00:02:12.730> so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
and they can go on and pour the floor so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.059 
and they can go on and pour the floor so
that's<00:02:13.600> pretty<00:02:13.900> much<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.290> way<00:02:14.410> things<00:02:14.709> stand

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
that's pretty much the way things stand

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.449 
that's pretty much the way things stand
right<00:02:15.250> now<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.620> that's<00:02:17.620> what<00:02:17.800> we've<00:02:17.950> done<00:02:17.980> so

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
right now and that's what we've done so

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.400 
right now and that's what we've done so
far<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:22.390> looks<00:02:22.600> like<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.870> heating<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
far that looks like the heating in the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.220 
far that looks like the heating in the
floor<00:02:23.650> ought<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.100> be<00:02:24.220> really<00:02:24.640> nice<00:02:25.000> if<00:02:25.390> it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
floor ought to be really nice if it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.780 
floor ought to be really nice if it
works<00:02:26.410> even<00:02:26.680> half<00:02:27.010> as<00:02:27.190> well<00:02:27.370> as<00:02:27.610> was

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
works even half as well as was

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.180 
works even half as well as was
advertised<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:30.180> certainly<00:02:31.180> hope<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:33.010> was<00:02:33.160> a
