00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
will be a little trickier to kill in the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.250 
will be a little trickier to kill in the
mage<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.329> kill<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> mage<00:00:54.780> first<00:00:55.079> if

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
mage so you can kill the mage first if

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.979 
mage so you can kill the mage first if
you<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:55.500> want<00:00:55.829> his<00:00:56.270> damage<00:00:57.270> being<00:00:57.510> done<00:00:57.600> to

you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.490 

and<00:01:09.890> most<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:10.700> video<00:01:11.030> is<00:01:11.390> just<00:01:12.320> getting

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
and most of this video is just getting

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.230 
and most of this video is just getting
the<00:01:12.680> upgrades<00:01:13.070> in<00:01:13.310> two<00:01:13.460> separate<00:01:13.760> rooms<00:01:14.000> here

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
the upgrades in two separate rooms here

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.700 
the upgrades in two separate rooms here
there's<00:01:14.660> only<00:01:14.720> one<00:01:14.870> upgrade<00:01:15.170> i<00:01:15.320> didn't<00:01:15.590> get

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
there's only one upgrade i didn't get

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.330 
there's only one upgrade i didn't get
because<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:16.310> not<00:01:16.640> really<00:01:17.120> worth<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:18.340> because

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
because it's not really worth it because

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.580 
because it's not really worth it because
it's<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.760> really<00:01:20.240> really<00:01:20.600> hard<00:01:20.960> fight<00:01:21.260> that's

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
it's a really really hard fight that's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.520 
it's a really really hard fight that's
not<00:01:22.250> worth<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.640> upgrade<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:27.350> you're<00:01:27.440> gonna

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
not worth the upgrade so you're gonna

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.960 
not worth the upgrade so you're gonna
have<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.740> couple<00:01:27.920> golems<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.520> priest<00:01:28.790> in<00:01:28.910> here

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
have a couple golems in a priest in here

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.640 
have a couple golems in a priest in here
so<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.030> want<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.330> save<00:01:32.510> her<00:01:32.780> land<00:01:33.170> quake<00:01:33.440> for

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
so you want to save her land quake for

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.100 
so you want to save her land quake for
when<00:01:33.770> they're<00:01:33.830> all<00:01:33.980> bunched<00:01:34.250> up<00:01:34.630> because<00:01:35.630> it

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
when they're all bunched up because it

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.600 
when they're all bunched up because it
does<00:01:36.560> affect<00:01:36.890> them<00:01:37.010> all<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.740> once<00:01:40.400> i<00:01:40.490> get

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
does affect them all so once i get

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.490 
does affect them all so once i get
really<00:01:40.729> close<00:01:40.910> to<00:01:41.090> use<00:01:41.360> her<00:01:41.660> land<00:01:42.080> then<00:01:42.470> a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
really close to use her land then a

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.190 
really close to use her land then a
quake<00:01:42.830> and<00:01:43.580> then<00:01:43.790> if<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.150> need<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.510> switch<00:01:44.780> to

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
quake and then if you need to switch to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.060 
quake and then if you need to switch to
your<00:01:45.380> spirit<00:01:45.830> form<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.930> put<00:01:48.530> regenerate<00:01:48.950> on

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
your spirit form to put regenerate on

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.320 
your spirit form to put regenerate on
yourself<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:50.170> good<00:01:51.170> strategy<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.740> can<00:01:51.800> use

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
yourself a good strategy you can use

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.080 
yourself a good strategy you can use
this<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.390> actually<00:01:54.520> while<00:01:55.520> you're<00:01:55.700> running<00:01:55.880> in

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
this to actually while you're running in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.930 
this to actually while you're running in
the<00:01:56.180> room<00:01:56.360> put<00:01:56.900> spirit<00:01:57.890> form<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.610> use

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
the room put spirit form on and use

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.740 
the room put spirit form on and use
crushing<00:01:59.540> prison<00:01:59.869> on<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.050> mage<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:02.330> that'll

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
crushing prison on the mage and that'll

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.109 
crushing prison on the mage and that'll
basically<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:03.410> be<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.009> kill<00:02:04.310> right<00:02:04.520> there<00:02:04.759> you

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
basically just be a kill right there you

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.509 
basically just be a kill right there you
won't<00:02:05.240> have<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.390> worry<00:02:05.600> about<00:02:05.720> them<00:02:05.930> at<00:02:05.990> all<00:02:09.519> so

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
won't have to worry about them at all so

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.920 
won't have to worry about them at all so
it's<00:02:10.610> gonna<00:02:10.700> be<00:02:10.790> a<00:02:10.880> golem<00:02:11.269> around<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:11.630> corner

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
it's gonna be a golem around this corner

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:22.210 
it's gonna be a golem around this corner
and<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.200> goal<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.500> around<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.769> next<00:02:13.040> corner

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.620 

so<00:02:23.220> these<00:02:23.340> golems<00:02:23.580> are<00:02:23.850> fairly<00:02:24.120> easy<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.420> deal

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
so these golems are fairly easy to deal

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.690 
so these golems are fairly easy to deal
with<00:02:24.660> just<00:02:25.530> one<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.830> them<00:02:25.950> but<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.520> next

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
with just one of them but in the next

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.680 
with just one of them but in the next
one<00:02:26.910> we're<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.209> go<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.420> there's<00:02:27.569> going

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
one we're going to go in there's going

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.910 
one we're going to go in there's going
to<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.780> three<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.230> them<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.620> you're<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:28.860> to

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
to be three of them and you're going to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.500 
to be three of them and you're going to
see<00:02:29.100> where<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.670> gets<00:02:29.819> tricky<00:02:30.330> because

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
see where it really gets tricky because

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.960 
see where it really gets tricky because
they're<00:02:30.930> constantly<00:02:31.800> having<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.400> rotative

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
they're constantly having a rotative

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.780 
they're constantly having a rotative
slams<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.950> you're<00:02:35.100> constantly<00:02:35.370> getting

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
slams up so you're constantly getting

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.360 
slams up so you're constantly getting
hit<00:02:36.300> down<00:02:36.540> before<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.230> use<00:02:37.260> most<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.190> your

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
hit down before you can use most of your

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.130 
hit down before you can use most of your
skills<00:02:39.830> cuts<00:02:40.830> ringg<00:02:41.040> hurl<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.060> slam<00:02:42.750> both

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
skills cuts ringg hurl and slam both

00:02:43.140 --> 00:03:13.040 
skills cuts ringg hurl and slam both
take<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> minute<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.950> get<00:02:44.190> off<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.019> next

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
take a minute to get off and the next

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.960 
take a minute to get off and the next
fight<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> actually<00:03:13.709> screwed<00:03:14.430> up<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.580> little<00:03:14.820> bit

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
fight I actually screwed up a little bit

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.560 
fight I actually screwed up a little bit
I<00:03:15.150> ran<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.080> there<00:03:16.200> with<00:03:16.440> my<00:03:16.860> spirit<00:03:17.220> full<00:03:17.370> on

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
I ran in there with my spirit full on

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.610 
I ran in there with my spirit full on
forgetting<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.750> there<00:03:18.900> wasn't<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.230> human<00:03:19.440> in

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
forgetting that there wasn't a human in

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.600 
forgetting that there wasn't a human in
there<00:03:19.769> because<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.070> was<00:03:20.190> actually<00:03:20.310> going<00:03:20.550> to

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
there because I was actually going to

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.920 
there because I was actually going to
use<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.880> strategy<00:03:21.120> i<00:03:21.420> just<00:03:21.630> mentioned<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:24.420> I

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
use that strategy i just mentioned so I

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.250 
use that strategy i just mentioned so I
had<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.769> get<00:03:26.700> out<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:27.000> there<00:03:29.209> they<00:03:30.209> came<00:03:30.720> very

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
had to get out of there they came very

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.130 
had to get out of there they came very
close<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.680> killing<00:03:31.980> me<00:03:32.160> as<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.370> can<00:03:32.489> see

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.120 

I<00:03:36.150> should<00:03:37.150> have<00:03:37.240> been<00:03:37.420> dead<00:03:40.770> all<00:03:41.770> right<00:03:41.800> even

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
I should have been dead all right even

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.250 
I should have been dead all right even
had<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.400> use<00:03:42.490> a<00:03:42.520> health<00:03:42.819> potion<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.450> was<00:03:43.630> really

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
had to use a health potion it was really

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.620 
had to use a health potion it was really
close

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.110 

then<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.590> health<00:03:51.860> is<00:03:52.010> high<00:03:52.130> enough<00:03:52.190> go<00:03:52.970> back

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
then a health is high enough go back

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.390 
then a health is high enough go back
into<00:03:53.300> golden<00:03:53.600> form<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.740> you'll<00:03:55.040> start<00:03:55.340> seeing

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
into golden form and you'll start seeing

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.340 
into golden form and you'll start seeing
now<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.850> rotation<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.690> slams<00:03:56.990> are<00:03:57.140> going<00:03:57.290> to

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
now the rotation of slams are going to

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.980 
now the rotation of slams are going to
have<00:03:57.440> off<00:03:57.650> on<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:59.180> how<00:03:59.270> hard<00:03:59.600> it<00:03:59.750> is<00:03:59.780> to

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
have off on you and how hard it is to

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.040 
have off on you and how hard it is to
get<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.170> spell<00:04:00.470> off

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.410 

once<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.070> get<00:04:05.220> one<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.490> them<00:04:05.580> down<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:06.120> gets<00:04:06.300> a

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
once you get one of them down it gets a

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.970 
once you get one of them down it gets a
little<00:04:06.570> bit<00:04:06.780> easier<00:04:09.080> so<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.620> see<00:04:10.740> one<00:04:10.890> of

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
little bit easier so you can see one of

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.610 
little bit easier so you can see one of
them<00:04:11.100> just<00:04:11.130> went<00:04:11.490> down<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:13.230> second<00:04:13.530> one

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
them just went down and the second one

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.370 
them just went down and the second one
is<00:04:13.710> low<00:04:13.890> on<00:04:14.040> health<00:04:20.750> but<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:21.989> be<00:04:22.110> safe<00:04:22.140> you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
is low on health but just to be safe you

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.410 
is low on health but just to be safe you
want<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.860> back<00:04:23.190> up<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.580> user<00:04:23.700> generate<00:04:24.240> if

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
want to back up and user generate if

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.740 
want to back up and user generate if
your<00:04:24.570> health<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.990> dipping<00:04:25.920> below<00:04:26.130> half

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
your health is dipping below half

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.060 
your health is dipping below half
because<00:04:27.750> if<00:04:28.020> not<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:28.470> might<00:04:28.710> not<00:04:28.890> have

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
because if not you might not have

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:40.790 
because if not you might not have
another<00:04:29.280> chance<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.670> do<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:39.380> then<00:04:40.380> there's<00:04:40.530> one

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
another chance to do it then there's one

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.650 
another chance to do it then there's one
left<00:04:41.040> so<00:04:41.340> it's<00:04:41.550> fairly<00:04:41.880> easy<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.270> take<00:04:42.510> him

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
left so it's fairly easy to take him

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:51.230 
left so it's fairly easy to take him
down<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:50.370> might<00:04:50.580> not<00:04:50.760> want<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.000> use<00:04:51.120> your

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
down you might not want to use your

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.820 
down you might not want to use your
cooldowns<00:04:51.720> if<00:04:52.020> you're<00:04:52.200> only<00:04:52.320> fighting<00:04:52.650> one

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
cooldowns if you're only fighting one

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.610 
cooldowns if you're only fighting one
guy<00:04:52.980> and<00:04:53.280> it's<00:04:53.480> pretty<00:04:54.480> certain<00:04:54.750> you'll<00:04:55.560> be

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
guy and it's pretty certain you'll be

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:04.600 
guy and it's pretty certain you'll be
able<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.950> kill<00:04:56.100> him

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.279 

and<00:05:05.180> at<00:05:05.330> this<00:05:05.419> point<00:05:05.629> is<00:05:05.840> where<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:05.990> noticed

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
and at this point is where I noticed

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:07.899 
and at this point is where I noticed
that<00:05:06.319> spirit<00:05:06.740> form<00:05:06.979> is<00:05:07.159> a<00:05:07.189> lot<00:05:07.460> slower<00:05:07.639> to

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
that spirit form is a lot slower to

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.629 
that spirit form is a lot slower to
travel<00:05:08.270> in<00:05:08.330> than<00:05:08.509> any<00:05:08.659> other<00:05:08.870> form<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:10.550> get

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
travel in than any other form so you get

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.409 
travel in than any other form so you get
to<00:05:10.759> use<00:05:10.849> her<00:05:11.000> lon<00:05:11.240> this<00:05:11.360> door<00:05:13.270> it's<00:05:14.270> never
