00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.440 
talk to I don't know why I didn't do
that<00:03:10.409> first<00:03:10.739> but<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.370> Box<00:03:11.640> ibly<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.180> they<00:03:12.299> had

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
that first but the Box ibly so they had

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.050 
that first but the Box ibly so they had
said<00:03:12.870> do<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.739> ends<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.340> lengths<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.910> your

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
said do the ends and lengths of your

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.330 
said do the ends and lengths of your
hair<00:03:15.269> first<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.290> decided<00:03:16.680> well<00:03:16.919> this<00:03:17.130> follow

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
hair first so I decided well this follow

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.860 
hair first so I decided well this follow
the<00:03:17.549> instructions<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.239> park<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.750> was

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the instructions on the park but it was

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.900 
the instructions on the park but it was
a<00:03:18.900> bad<00:03:19.139> idea<00:03:19.169> I<00:03:19.590> should<00:03:19.889> not<00:03:20.099> have<00:03:20.130> done<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.549> I

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
a bad idea I should not have done that I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.240 
a bad idea I should not have done that I
would<00:03:20.970> definitely<00:03:21.299> start<00:03:21.930> at<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.739> roots<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
would definitely start at the roots and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.979 
would definitely start at the roots and
do<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.639> just<00:03:23.849> section<00:03:24.239> by<00:03:24.329> section<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.900> then

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
do it just section by section and then

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.470 
do it just section by section and then
wrap<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.260> up<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.590> tin<00:03:25.799> foil<00:03:26.040> no<00:03:26.549> massaging<00:03:27.269> no

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
wrap it up in tin foil no massaging no

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.629 
wrap it up in tin foil no massaging no
nothing<00:03:27.870> that's<00:03:28.139> I<00:03:28.349> just<00:03:28.829> I<00:03:29.250> shouldn't<00:03:29.579> have

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
nothing that's I just I shouldn't have

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.789 
nothing that's I just I shouldn't have
done<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.849> it<00:03:30.120> was<00:03:30.239> bad<00:03:30.419> idea<00:03:30.690> also<00:03:31.290> after<00:03:31.500> my

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
done that it was bad idea also after my

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.650 
done that it was bad idea also after my
hair<00:03:32.010> was<00:03:32.220> pretty<00:03:32.459> blonde<00:03:32.730> I'd<00:03:33.090> say<00:03:33.419> it<00:03:33.569> was

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
hair was pretty blonde I'd say it was

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.869 
hair was pretty blonde I'd say it was
probably<00:03:34.019> like<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> level<00:03:34.650> three<00:03:35.340> or<00:03:35.669> maybe

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
probably like a level three or maybe

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.879 
probably like a level three or maybe
level<00:03:36.329> two<00:03:36.629> but<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.049> definitely<00:03:37.230> had<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.769> know

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
level two but it definitely had you know

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.500 
level two but it definitely had you know
a<00:03:37.919> lot<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.190> warmth<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.639> it<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.940> would<00:03:39.269> definitely

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
a lot of warmth in it I would definitely

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.280 
a lot of warmth in it I would definitely
use<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:40.290> toner<00:03:40.859> I<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:41.730> decided<00:03:41.879> like<00:03:42.569> an<00:03:42.840> toner

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
use a toner I just decided like an toner

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.759 
use a toner I just decided like an toner
money<00:03:43.949> energy<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:45.389> go<00:03:45.480> ahead<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.780> buy<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.049> just

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
money energy to go ahead and buy it just

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.819 
money energy to go ahead and buy it just
skipped<00:03:47.430> using<00:03:48.030> toner<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.569> wouldn't<00:03:49.079> skip<00:03:49.590> that

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
skipped using toner I wouldn't skip that

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.039 
skipped using toner I wouldn't skip that
step<00:03:50.129> because<00:03:50.790> then<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.419> turns<00:03:51.720> out<00:03:51.870> more

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
step because then this turns out more

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.199 
step because then this turns out more
teal<00:03:52.379> and<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.769> does<00:03:52.889> blue<00:03:53.190> now<00:03:53.579> to<00:03:53.639> the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
teal and it does blue now to the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.809 
teal and it does blue now to the
condition<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:55.169> my<00:03:55.470> current<00:03:55.859> hair<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.549> is

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
really not any different than it was

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.699 
really not any different than it was
