goodbye<00:01:07.090> rainbow<00:01:07.630> flower

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.850 

and<00:01:11.299> he<00:01:11.750> doesn't<00:01:12.049> do<00:01:12.140> anything

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.370 

the<00:01:15.460> reason<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:15.940> don't<00:01:16.150> sacrifice<00:01:16.450> then<00:01:17.140> is

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
the reason I don't sacrifice then is

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.870 
the reason I don't sacrifice then is
because<00:01:17.710> I<00:01:17.830> wouldn't<00:01:18.190> be<00:01:18.280> able<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.520> take<00:01:18.730> out

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
because I wouldn't be able to take out

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.780 
because I wouldn't be able to take out
both<00:01:19.120> his<00:01:19.150> monsters<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:19.930> deal<00:01:20.080> damage<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.490> I

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
both his monsters and deal damage so I

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.700 
both his monsters and deal damage so I
made<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.210> best<00:01:22.420> move<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:22.870> but<00:01:23.590> what<00:01:23.680> a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
made the best move that but what a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.650 
made the best move that but what a
sacrifice<00:01:23.980> through<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.700> skull<00:01:25.000> Knight<00:01:25.240> or

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
truth I think we have to duel in two

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.580 
truth I think we have to duel in two
more<00:02:27.610> extra<00:02:28.030> times<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.690> then<00:02:28.870> he<00:02:28.989> like<00:02:29.200> walks

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
more extra times and then he like walks

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.850 
more extra times and then he like walks
