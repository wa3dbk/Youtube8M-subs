00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.000
 welcome to psv my name is thus the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.420
 ego sama today we are going to talk about the gta 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.439
 5 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.750
 the official gta 5 trailer came out on the 29th 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.029
 August is because the original game goes 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 to leave on September 17th which is 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.619
 a pretty big expectation because 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.919
 not only was the year expected, the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.919
 game 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.560
 because the truth because all the people 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.590
 that have gone out to where it happens 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.080
 downhill spectacular signs I hope 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.260
 but they have no entity that is going to 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.640
 highlight with respect to all 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.980
 analysts and in the first instance 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.680
 spectacular graphics and three stories 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.570
 is of three characters which we are going to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.420
 comment now after what are 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.340
 great that are very well created are 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.090
 very different between them but they are going to 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.580
 go joining miguel to go forward 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.260
 that makes the format change a bit 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.340
 basic thinking what we are not 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.289
 used and is the evolution of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.140
 except the most famous in history 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.440
 stable 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.800
 so it may become the year 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.480
 and now anyway I would like to know 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.980
 what are the elements that I must say 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.200
 that will highlight the game a lot 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.720
 like for example just commented to me 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.340
 that are three stories actresses in a 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.440
 moment they are going to end up joining in a 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.090
 moment that also carries this and what 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.510
 we are clear if it is at the beginning if it is 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.560
 advance the few characters 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.560
 we know that a couple of characters already 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.690
 know of another and if he is about to know about 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.550
 the band 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.550
 for me one of the best situations 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.560
 besides that I kojima said that he is 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.260
 guide was not up to 5 people 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.090
 which is very important 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.430
 I say chasm like you squeezed a 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.190
 little bit of the ortho saying to me 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.210
 that gta 5 is going to break that is one of 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.000
 the things with which he has called me 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.320
 a lot of attention that I'm a fan of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.420
 the mental sagra and getty so that kojima 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.670
 say that kind of thing you have to pay 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.430
 pretty much the set of cars that 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.980
 there is awesome they really are 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.130
 marks all in state there are some and others 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.550
 they are brands that are there I saw six 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.980
 notes to be original plus that 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.680
 three planes two helicopters three boats 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.660
 you have what appears to be a submarine in 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.150
 the medium I do not like to say add 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.360
 some more variant and missions I guess 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.640
 more bizarre 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.500
 as in a moment they will enter as in 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.410
 a bank and you do not have to go down there is no 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.410
 go down a wall of a building 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:55.100
 in regards to sandbox but 7 a 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:56.340
 5 promised everything else is 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.410
 Awesome 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.290
 impress you know something of the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.880
 characters the idea that there is a character 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.370
 franklin who has a skill 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.989
 special something regarding the handling issue 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.989
 and until then 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.459
 our characters all started from 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.459
 saints of santa is a former criminal the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.160
 which had an arrangement with him we are going to 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.240
 say it with the police is and is now 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.420
 protected by them for having sold 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.090
 to his ex-partners and others and that's how 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.740
 The representative asks quietly with a 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.930
 very big house with your happy family 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.430
 they have a couple of children but their lives 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.650
 about one I did not have boring and 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.480
 probably goes back to the old ways every 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.090
 main character of gta 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.400
 The interesting thing is that they show how 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.250
 special abilities are a kind 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.640
 very lethal, that is, their weapons 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.620
 shots hold a little more 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.880
 a question the characters that have 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.590
 relationship with some of the issues 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.230
 previous or simply it's a story 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.480
 completely new by now there's no 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.060
 connections with previous objectives but 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.270
 they promise that some characters from 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.270
 object can be very interesting 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.510
 phillips 3 is a sociopath a psychopath 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.460
 and in passing is one of the best friends 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.860
 of michael de santa is the character 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.270
 crazy detailed that gets back to being 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.110
 happy and head against the walls 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.660
 and hitting people by court this is 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.940
 quite acceptable 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.550
 is also a criminal is a former military 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.120
 is a drug addict can not 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.140
 make a very good explosive package 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.190
 has a special guide that is a 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.470
 kind of frenzy 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.750
 in which the link double damage that 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.270
 receives half of the year and as it has 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.220
 the body shots pounded from him are 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:59.600
 more different and are more effective 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:02.810
 a kind of good we are all if the 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.430
 head if this one is so much 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.420
 frankie is one of the three characters without 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.430
 under him is a young black man who uses him 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.770
 as carriers so to speak 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.780
 and they tell him that he has with his vehicle the 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.540
 things of the other I keep in mind with your 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.670
 skill that is just like a 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.530
 Slow motion handling as the subject 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.660
 help this a lot to the vehicles to 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.360
 As we move forward, there is not much 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.000
 deepening and did is that all of 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.310
 how bad it has children and it seems that 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.030
 children one of them wants wants to get into 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.610
 in the family business 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.280
 trevor as he is engaged in doing 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.060
 rampage of killings good is part of the 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.370
 business and franklin like I had a 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.140
 life was not easy for gangsters and I'm going to 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.810
 mai know it seems like your 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.990
 perspective changed a bit to improve 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.030
 We will know all that, how was it said on 17 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:00.590
 September when the 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.590
 gta 5 and let's hope that everything will come out 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.900
 because the 360 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.650
