thing<00:02:27.659> I<00:02:27.750> do<00:02:27.810> want<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.140> let<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.290> know<00:02:28.409> is<00:02:28.799> that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
thing I do want to let you know is that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.009 
thing I do want to let you know is that
I<00:02:28.980> put<00:02:29.310> topcoat<00:02:29.970> on<00:02:30.000> these<00:02:30.360> nails<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.930> there

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
I put topcoat on these nails and there

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.649 
I put topcoat on these nails and there
were<00:02:31.110> two<00:02:31.290> reasons<00:02:31.739> for<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:31.920> first<00:02:32.670> thing<00:02:33.360> is

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
were two reasons for that first thing is

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.110 
were two reasons for that first thing is
on<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.230> couple<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.129> nails<00:02:35.340> including<00:02:35.970> this

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
on a couple of the nails including this

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.270 
on a couple of the nails including this
one<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.569> got<00:02:36.780> some<00:02:37.019> nail<00:02:37.200> glue<00:02:37.409> on<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.739> top<00:02:38.040> I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
one I got some nail glue on the top I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.890 
one I got some nail glue on the top I
don't<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.489> if<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.849> see<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.299> that

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
don't know if you can see that that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.319 
don't know if you can see that that
bumpy<00:02:40.260> texture<00:02:40.680> there<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.370> when<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.760> put<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
bumpy texture there but when I put the

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.270 
bumpy texture there but when I put the
nail<00:02:42.480> down<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.810> got<00:02:43.140> some<00:02:43.409> nail<00:02:43.590> glue<00:02:43.829> leakage

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
nail down I got some nail glue leakage

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.430 
nail down I got some nail glue leakage
and<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.519> went<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.909> top<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.510> tried<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.170> file

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
and it went on the top I tried to file

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.430 
and it went on the top I tried to file
it<00:02:46.650> down<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.760> ended<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.239> filing<00:02:48.510> off<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.109> tiny

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
it down and I ended up filing off a tiny

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.250 
it down and I ended up filing off a tiny
bit<00:02:49.859> of<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.069> design<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> put<00:02:51.480> some<00:02:51.510> top<00:02:51.959> coat

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
bit of the design so I put some top coat

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.830 
bit of the design so I put some top coat
on<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:53.099> one<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.819> order<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.390> protect<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
on this one in order to protect the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.780 
on this one in order to protect the
design<00:02:54.989> decided<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.069> might<00:02:56.220> not<00:02:56.430> be<00:02:56.609> a<00:02:56.640> bad

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
design decided it might not be a bad

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.149 
design decided it might not be a bad
idea<00:02:56.849> for<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.569> rest<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.049> ones<00:02:58.260> as<00:02:58.590> well<00:02:58.829> in

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
idea for the rest of the ones as well in

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.920 
idea for the rest of the ones as well in
case<00:02:59.700> this<00:02:59.879> design<00:03:00.269> wears<00:03:00.510> off<00:03:00.720> so

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
case this design wears off so

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.009 
case this design wears off so
unfortunately<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.620> cannot<00:03:02.069> speak<00:03:02.519> as<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.019> if

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
unfortunately I cannot speak as to if

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.839 
unfortunately I cannot speak as to if
the<00:03:04.230> design<00:03:04.530> stays<00:03:04.920> on<00:03:05.159> well<00:03:05.430> without<00:03:05.670> a

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
the design stays on well without a

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.729 
the design stays on well without a
topcoat<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:06.599> I<00:03:06.659> can<00:03:06.930> say<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.379> with<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
topcoat but I can say that with the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.530 
topcoat but I can say that with the
topcoat<00:03:08.220> three<00:03:08.549> days<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.970> there<00:03:09.209> looking

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
topcoat three days in there looking

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.190 
topcoat three days in there looking
absolutely<00:03:09.859> gorgeous<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:12.540> other<00:03:12.750> thing<00:03:13.170> that

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
absolutely gorgeous the other thing that

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.759 
absolutely gorgeous the other thing that
it<00:03:13.470> did<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.549> nail<00:03:15.510> glue<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:16.019> top<00:03:16.349> of<00:03:16.590> my

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
it did with the nail glue on top of my

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.379 
it did with the nail glue on top of my
nail<00:03:16.829> is<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.639> smoothed<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.060> out<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.209> little

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
nail is that it smoothed it out a little

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.300 
nail is that it smoothed it out a little
bit<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:18.989> not<00:03:19.049> as<00:03:19.319> rough<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.889> texture

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
bit so it's not as rough of a texture

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.220 
bit so it's not as rough of a texture
this<00:03:20.730> one<00:03:20.970> definitely<00:03:21.120> still<00:03:21.599> has<00:03:21.750> some<00:03:21.989> bump

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
this one definitely still has some bump

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.830 
this one definitely still has some bump
to<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:22.829> it's<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:23.459> too<00:03:23.730> bad<00:03:23.760> at<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:24.329> let's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
to it but it's not too bad at all let's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.839

just say it's my little secret and

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.240 
just say it's my little secret and
honestly<00:03:27.480> I've<00:03:28.079> had<00:03:28.380> these<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.739> for<00:03:29.040> three

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
honestly I've had these on for three

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.039 
honestly I've had these on for three
days<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:29.940> been<00:03:29.970> carrying<00:03:30.480> my<00:03:30.629> nail<00:03:30.810> glue

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
days I have been carrying my nail glue

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.680 
days I have been carrying my nail glue
around<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.889> I've<00:03:32.010> had<00:03:32.250> absolutely<00:03:32.450> none<00:03:33.450> of

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
around and I've had absolutely none of

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.900 
around and I've had absolutely none of
the<00:03:33.780> nails<00:03:33.959> fall<00:03:34.290> off<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.829> I<00:03:35.129> work<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.609> a<00:03:35.730> job

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
the nails fall off and I work in a job

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.020 
the nails fall off and I work in a job
where<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.239> am<00:03:36.510> typing<00:03:36.989> all<00:03:37.139> day<00:03:37.200> long<00:03:38.030> during

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
where I am typing all day long during

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.610 
where I am typing all day long during
the<00:03:39.209> first<00:03:39.480> day<00:03:39.690> my<00:03:39.870> nails<00:03:40.079> were<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.319> little

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
the first day my nails were a little

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.920 
the first day my nails were a little
sore<00:03:40.950> that's<00:03:41.220> kind<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.609> typical<00:03:41.849> when<00:03:42.629> you<00:03:42.810> do

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
sore that's kind of typical when you do

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.629 
sore that's kind of typical when you do
acrylics<00:03:43.500> at<00:03:43.650> least<00:03:43.859> so<00:03:44.040> I'd<00:03:44.160> assume<00:03:44.459> it's

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
acrylics at least so I'd assume it's

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.520 
acrylics at least so I'd assume it's
similar<00:03:44.879> for<00:03:45.090> these<00:03:45.480> nails<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.109> know<00:03:46.139> it's

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
similar for these nails you know it's

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.559 
similar for these nails you know it's
pressing<00:03:47.129> on<00:03:47.340> your<00:03:47.519> nails<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.030> your<00:03:48.090> cuticles

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
pressing on your nails and your cuticles

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.119 
pressing on your nails and your cuticles
in<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.840> way<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.169> your<00:03:49.290> hands<00:03:49.590> aren't<00:03:49.769> really

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
in a way that your hands aren't really

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.849 
in a way that your hands aren't really
used<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:51.959> after<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.379> there's<00:03:52.680> been

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
used to but after that there's been

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.949 
used to but after that there's been
absolutely<00:03:53.370> no<00:03:53.489> pain<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.359> hasn't<00:03:54.720> really

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
absolutely no pain it hasn't really

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.990 
absolutely no pain it hasn't really
gotten<00:03:55.379> in<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.590> way<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.889> me<00:03:56.040> typing<00:03:56.489> any<00:03:56.669> more

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
gotten in the way of me typing any more

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.119 
gotten in the way of me typing any more
than<00:03:57.180> any<00:03:57.359> other<00:03:57.599> nails<00:03:57.930> would<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.530> while

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
than any other nails would and while

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.949 
than any other nails would and while
when<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.549> juggle<00:03:59.970> them<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.239> definitely<00:04:00.690> do<00:04:00.810> not

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
when I juggle them I definitely do not

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.240 
when I juggle them I definitely do not
feel<00:04:01.230> like<00:04:01.349> my<00:04:01.500> normal<00:04:01.560> nail<00:04:02.010> they're
