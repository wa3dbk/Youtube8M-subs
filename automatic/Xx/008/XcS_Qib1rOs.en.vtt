00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
to mimic the fishings situations that

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.680 
to mimic the fishings situations that
i'll<00:02:17.440> hopefully<00:02:17.980> find<00:02:18.520> myself<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:19.090> within<00:02:19.540> a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
i'll hopefully find myself in within a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.650 
i'll hopefully find myself in within a
couple<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.960> weeks<00:02:20.020> here<00:02:21.270> once<00:02:22.270> i've<00:02:22.480> actually

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
couple of weeks here once i've actually

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.120 
couple of weeks here once i've actually
got<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.170> fish<00:02:23.350> up<00:02:24.420> 100<00:02:25.420> meters<00:02:25.950> that's<00:02:26.950> when

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
got the fish up 100 meters that's when

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.729 
got the fish up 100 meters that's when
they<00:02:27.250> will<00:02:27.400> stop<00:02:27.640> being<00:02:28.420> rather<00:02:28.959> easy<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.560> get

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
they will stop being rather easy to get

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.130 
they will stop being rather easy to get
up<00:02:29.860> then<00:02:30.400> I'm<00:02:30.630> hopefully<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.660> won't<00:02:31.840> have<00:02:31.989> to

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
up then I'm hopefully I won't have to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.140 
up then I'm hopefully I won't have to
keep<00:02:32.709> pumping<00:02:33.160> like<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.430> do<00:02:33.489> with<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.880> rock
