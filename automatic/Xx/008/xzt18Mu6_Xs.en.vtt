that we need to do step three is we need
to<00:01:10.310> get<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.460> good<00:01:10.610> exposure<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:11.930> make<00:01:12.200> sure<00:01:12.229> that

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
to get a good exposure so make sure that

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.260 
to get a good exposure so make sure that
you<00:01:12.649> check<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.189> following<00:01:13.219> video<00:01:14.000> where<00:01:14.180> we

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.819 
talk about how to get an exposure with
the<00:01:16.430> ExpoDisc<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.509> make<00:01:18.229> sure<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.380> watch<00:01:18.590> that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
but once we have our correct exposure

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.889 
but once we have our correct exposure
now<00:01:21.860> we<00:01:22.250> are<00:01:22.310> going<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.579> simply<00:01:22.939> take<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.600> shot

the ExpoDisc over the lens and it's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.289 
the ExpoDisc over the lens and it's
going<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.770> be<00:01:33.920> like<00:01:34.100> where<00:01:34.460> it's<00:01:35.060> going<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.210> be

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
going to be like where it's going to be

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.609 
going to be like where it's going to be
making<00:01:35.570> some<00:01:35.750> really<00:01:35.899> hard<00:01:36.140> noises<00:01:36.439> because

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
making some really hard noises because

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.740 
making some really hard noises because
it's<00:01:36.770> not<00:01:36.979> going<00:01:37.219> to<00:01:37.310> be<00:01:37.399> able<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.579> focus<00:01:38.060> so

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
it's not going to be able to focus so

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.149 
it's not going to be able to focus so
what<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:38.960> simply<00:01:39.170> do<00:01:39.469> is<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.680> can<00:01:39.829> switch

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
what you simply do is you can switch

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.480 
what you simply do is you can switch
your<00:01:40.189> camera's<00:01:40.789> focus<00:01:41.149> to<00:01:41.390> manual<00:01:41.600> focus<00:01:42.490> take

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
your camera's focus to manual focus take

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.359 
your camera's focus to manual focus take
the<00:01:43.640> shot<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.270> then<00:01:44.840> simply<00:01:45.350> just<00:01:45.380> make<00:01:46.189> sure

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
the shot and then simply just make sure

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.039 
the shot and then simply just make sure
you<00:01:46.490> put<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.729> back<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.030> autofocus<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.750> next

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
you put it back to autofocus the next

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.450 
you put it back to autofocus the next
step<00:01:48.259> is<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:48.560> want<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.770> double<00:01:49.130> check<00:01:49.159> and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
step is you want to double check and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.310 
step is you want to double check and
make<00:01:49.579> sure<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.329> exposure<00:01:50.869> that<00:01:51.200> you

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
make sure that that exposure that you

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.440 
make sure that that exposure that you
just<00:01:51.560> took<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:52.039> correct<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.149> you're<00:01:53.270> going<00:01:53.390> to

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
just took is correct so you're going to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.599 
just took is correct so you're going to
look<00:01:53.689> at<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.049> back<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.380> your<00:01:54.530> camera<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.130> look

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
look at the back of your camera and look

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.490 
look at the back of your camera and look
at<00:01:55.700> your<00:01:55.850> histogram<00:01:56.390> if<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.780> see<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.140> spike

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
at your histogram if you see the spike

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.230 
at your histogram if you see the spike
down<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.859> middle<00:01:58.070> or<00:01:58.429> close<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.969> middle

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
down the middle or close to the middle

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.880 
down the middle or close to the middle
you<00:01:59.450> know<00:01:59.869> that<00:02:00.079> you're<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:00.380> sweet<00:02:00.649> spot

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
of that you want to be the next thing of

your camera from Canon to Nikon users

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.290 
your camera from Canon to Nikon users
the<00:02:09.320> process<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:10.009> varies<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.670> make<00:02:10.910> sure<00:02:10.940> that

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
the process of varies so make sure that

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.149 
the process of varies so make sure that
you<00:02:11.390> check<00:02:11.720> your<00:02:11.780> manual<00:02:12.319> on<00:02:12.560> how<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.800> apply

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
so go ahead and check that out and then

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.330 
so go ahead and check that out and then
now<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.660> are<00:02:18.080> ready<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.349> shoot<00:02:18.680> your<00:02:18.830> subject

inside<00:02:21.500> your<00:02:21.620> camera<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:22.400> question<00:02:22.819> often

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
inside your camera the question often

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.300 
inside your camera the question often
comes<00:02:23.300> up<00:02:23.629> how<00:02:23.870> often<00:02:24.140> do<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.560> need<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.860> grab<00:02:25.099> a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
comes up how often do I need to grab a

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.040 
comes up how often do I need to grab a
new<00:02:25.459> white<00:02:25.670> balance<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.390> answer<00:02:26.930> is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
new white balance and the answer is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.559 
new white balance and the answer is
anytime<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.860> light<00:02:28.040> changes<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:29.269> really

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
anytime the light changes and it really

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.059 
anytime the light changes and it really
doesn't<00:02:29.930> take<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.110> long<00:02:30.290> once<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.860> get<00:02:31.010> in

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
doesn't take that long once you get in

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.710 
doesn't take that long once you get in
the<00:02:31.129> habit<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.580> doing<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.180> takes<00:02:32.360> only<00:02:32.629> a

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
the habit of doing it it takes only a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.600 
the habit of doing it it takes only a
few<00:02:32.780> seconds<00:02:33.349> so<00:02:33.530> I'm<00:02:34.220> going<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.370> demonstrate

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
few seconds so I'm going to demonstrate

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.300 
few seconds so I'm going to demonstrate
how<00:02:35.150> fast<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.780> can<00:02:35.900> actually<00:02:36.110> go<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.860> we'll

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
how fast it can actually go so we'll

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.369 
how fast it can actually go so we'll
have<00:02:37.430> Meredith<00:02:37.879> come<00:02:38.360> on<00:02:38.510> up<00:02:38.629> and<00:02:39.170> we're<00:02:39.290> going

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
have Meredith come on up and we're going

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.809 
have Meredith come on up and we're going
to<00:02:39.470> shoot<00:02:39.680> her<00:02:39.860> right<00:02:40.220> here

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
to shoot her right here

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.570 
to shoot her right here
so<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.569> stand<00:02:42.410> in<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:42.620> area<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.160> point<00:02:43.489> it

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
so I stand in this area I point it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.470 
so I stand in this area I point it
towards<00:02:43.819> where<00:02:44.000> I'm<00:02:44.090> going<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.269> be<00:02:44.330> shooting

towards where I'm going to be shooting
from<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:45.110> adjust<00:02:45.590> my<00:02:45.709> camera<00:02:45.739> settings<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:46.489> I

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
from I adjust my camera settings so I

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.670 
from I adjust my camera settings so I
haven't<00:02:46.790> down<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.239> line<00:02:47.390> exposure<00:02:47.810> take<00:02:48.560> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
haven't down the line exposure take the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.120 
haven't down the line exposure take the
shot

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
shot

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.069

now I'm gonna go ahead and walk and

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.710 
now I'm gonna go ahead and walk and
