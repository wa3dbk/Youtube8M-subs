00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
better job in planning better do in

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.270 
better job in planning better do in

aligned with the current buildings and

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.270 
aligned with the current buildings and
so<00:03:18.660> while<00:03:18.959> there<00:03:19.140> about<00:03:19.350> four<00:03:19.680> we<00:03:20.040> believe

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
so while there about four we believe

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.069 
so while there about four we believe
over<00:03:20.519> 4000<00:03:21.120> buildings<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:21.840> area

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
over 4000 buildings in this in one area

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.220 
over 4000 buildings in this in one area
a<00:03:22.320> little<00:03:23.220> bit<00:03:23.310> wider<00:03:23.519> than<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.910> hill

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
a little bit wider than that hill

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.199 
a little bit wider than that hill
there's<00:03:25.230> only<00:03:25.320> two<00:03:25.560> thousand<00:03:25.890> registered

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
there's only two thousand registered

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.270 
there's only two thousand registered
paying<00:03:27.209> taxes<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.840> they're<00:03:27.930> paying<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.410> up<00:03:28.980> to

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
paying taxes and they're paying of up to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.840 
paying taxes and they're paying of up to
50<00:03:29.640> square<00:03:30.209> meters<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.780> house<00:03:31.200> which<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.760> bit<00:03:32.760> of

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
50 square meters a house which is bit of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.240 
50 square meters a house which is bit of
a<00:03:32.970> gap<00:03:33.450> between<00:03:33.630> what<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.799> naked<00:03:35.160> eye

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
a gap between what you see the naked eye

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.750 
a gap between what you see the naked eye
so<00:03:36.350> indeed<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.560> believe<00:03:37.769> not<00:03:38.250> all<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.549> them<00:03:38.609> are

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
so indeed I believe not all of them are

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.680 
so indeed I believe not all of them are
paying<00:03:39.000> all<00:03:39.209> their<00:03:39.359> Texas<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:40.799> bylaw<00:03:41.690> second
