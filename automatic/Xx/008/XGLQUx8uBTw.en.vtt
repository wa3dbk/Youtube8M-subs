targets for facial animation so say for
example<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.330> created<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.820> this<00:00:17.820> limits

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270

team<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:47.989> say<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.410> our<00:00:50.539> default

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
team and say that is our default

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.610 
team and say that is our default
character<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:54.329> now<00:00:55.640> go<00:00:56.640> back<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.620> file

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
character so now go back to the file

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.529 
character so now go back to the file
that<00:00:58.649> we're<00:00:59.039> working<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:02.329> come<00:01:03.329> down

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that we're working with and come down

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.370 
that we're working with and come down
here<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.369> facial<00:01:05.369> expression<00:01:06.210> control<00:01:07.110> us

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
here to the facial expression control us

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.630 
here to the facial expression control us
and<00:01:08.900> we<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.080> actually<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> controller

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and we can actually have a controller

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.740 
and we can actually have a controller
that<00:01:12.290> gives<00:01:13.290> us<00:01:13.470> quite<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> lot<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.750> possibility

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that gives us quite a lot of possibility

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.219 
that gives us quite a lot of possibility
for<00:01:15.900> creating<00:01:16.409> mouth<00:01:16.680> targets<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.080> let's<00:01:19.080> go

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
for creating mouth targets so let's go

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.510 
for creating mouth targets so let's go
down<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:23.210> opening<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.240> mouth<00:01:24.479> completely<00:01:25.520> now

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
down to opening the mouth completely now

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640 
down to opening the mouth completely now
the<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:27.390> nice<00:01:27.659> thing<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.110> sort<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the really nice thing about sort of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.469 
the really nice thing about sort of
about<00:01:29.369> using<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.670> head<00:01:32.850> designer<00:01:33.270> is

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
about using the the head designer is

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.870 
about using the the head designer is
that<00:01:33.689> even<00:01:34.619> though<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.400> target

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that even though we have this target

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
that even though we have this target
here<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.350> actually<00:01:37.680> come<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:39.890> adjust<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
here we can actually come and adjust it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.179 
here we can actually come and adjust it
so<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.630> example<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> mouth<00:01:43.950> opened

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
so so for example when the mouth opened

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:54.319 
so so for example when the mouth opened
perhaps<00:01:48.290> we<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:52.880> different<00:01:53.880> sort<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> like

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
perhaps we have a different sort of like

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.600 
perhaps we have a different sort of like
kind<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.659> shape<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.829> thickness<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
kind of shape in the thickness of the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.580 
kind of shape in the thickness of the
mouth<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.149> lips<00:01:57.570> actually<00:01:57.869> sort<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.380> come

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
mouth so the lips actually sort of come

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.020 
mouth so the lips actually sort of come
come<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:02:00.270> bit<00:02:00.420> higher<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:01.020> that

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
come up a little bit higher like that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.020 
come up a little bit higher like that
also<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.240> width<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.110> mouth<00:02:04.790> narrows<00:02:05.790> as

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
also the width of the mouth narrows as

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.150 
also the width of the mouth narrows as
we<00:02:06.210> open<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.509> mouth<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:08.599> also<00:02:09.709> we<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.739> come

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
we open the mouth and also we can come

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
we open the mouth and also we can come
and<00:02:11.340> sort<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.000> 10<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.569> chicks

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and sort of like on of 10 that chicks

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.830 
and sort of like on of 10 that chicks
down<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> little<00:02:13.530> bit

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
down a little bit

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.350 
down a little bit
so<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.319> pops<00:02:14.590> out<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:15.129> words<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.640> little<00:02:15.760> bit<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
so it pops out in words a little bit and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.210 
so it pops out in words a little bit and
same<00:02:19.360> thing<00:02:19.390> with<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:20.019> with<00:02:20.319> with<00:02:20.739> lower

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
same thing with that with with lower

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.119 
same thing with that with with lower
with<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> lower<00:02:22.030> lip<00:02:22.360> we<00:02:23.349> can<00:02:23.530> actually<00:02:23.709> bring

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
with a lower lip we can actually bring

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.570 
with a lower lip we can actually bring
it<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.519> slightly<00:02:24.879> and<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:30.040> even<00:02:30.190> sort<00:02:30.430> of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
it in slightly and we can even sort of

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.580 
it in slightly and we can even sort of
like<00:02:30.730> enough<00:02:31.060> take<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.810> down<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.019> little<00:02:32.349> bit

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
like enough take it down a little bit

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.990 
like enough take it down a little bit
more<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:34.590> perhaps<00:02:35.590> thicken<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.489> a<00:02:36.610> little<00:02:36.760> bit

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
more and perhaps thicken it a little bit

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.430 
more and perhaps thicken it a little bit
more<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:39.180> before<00:02:40.180> all<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:40.959> have<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.170> do

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
more and like before all we have to do

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.800 
more and like before all we have to do
is<00:02:41.560> control<00:02:42.370> C<00:02:43.920> go<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.329> window<00:02:46.329> that<00:02:46.510> we

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
is control C go to the window that we

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.150 
is control C go to the window that we
have<00:02:47.190> control<00:02:48.190> V<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:52.410> we<00:02:53.410> can<00:02:53.590> delete<00:02:53.860> all<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
have control V and we can delete all the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.900 
have control V and we can delete all the
Stags<00:02:57.930> obviously<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:59.470> that<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.700> tool

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
Stags obviously on that on the tool

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.640 
Stags obviously on that on the tool
itself<00:03:01.060> all<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.569> Stags<00:03:01.930> will<00:03:02.079> not<00:03:02.290> be<00:03:02.440> there

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
itself all the Stags will not be there

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.229 
itself all the Stags will not be there
they<00:03:02.890> sexually<00:03:03.549> they<00:03:03.670> are<00:03:03.790> still<00:03:04.000> there

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
they sexually they are still there

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.350 
they sexually they are still there
because<00:03:04.450> I'm<00:03:05.170> still<00:03:05.590> developing<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.459> lot<00:03:07.239> of

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
because I'm still developing a lot of

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.940 
because I'm still developing a lot of
the<00:03:07.480> stuff<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.670> then<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:14.140> all<00:03:14.379> we<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.769> do

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
the stuff and then so all we have to do

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.660 
the stuff and then so all we have to do
now<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.160> actually<00:03:15.480> just<00:03:16.829> right-click<00:03:17.829> and

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.280 

come<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.959> character<00:03:22.959> tags<00:03:24.420> I'm<00:03:25.420> so<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:25.989> can't

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
come to character tags I'm so you can't

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.020 
come to character tags I'm so you can't
see<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.680> over<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.100> side<00:03:27.340> here<00:03:27.670> get<00:03:28.000> a

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
see it is over to the side here get a

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:38.370 
see it is over to the side here get a
new<00:03:28.299> morph<00:03:28.540> tag<00:03:30.750> selected<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:34.569> then<00:03:37.170> take<00:03:38.170> out

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
new morph tag selected and then take out

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.849 
new morph tag selected and then take out
that<00:03:38.799> that<00:03:39.329> that<00:03:40.329> new<00:03:41.049> sort<00:03:41.349> of<00:03:41.410> like<00:03:41.590> Anna's

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
that that that new sort of like Anna's

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.039 
that that that new sort of like Anna's
target<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:44.560> put<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.799> there<00:03:45.690> then<00:03:46.690> you

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
target and we put it there then you

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.210 
target and we put it there then you
don't<00:03:47.260> really<00:03:47.319> need<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.709> anymore<00:03:47.950> we<00:03:48.190> can

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
don't really need it anymore we can

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.710 
don't really need it anymore we can
delete<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:50.819> now<00:03:51.819> if<00:03:51.940> we<00:03:52.030> go<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.389> anime

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
delete it and now if we go to the anime

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.990 
delete it and now if we go to the anime
tab<00:03:53.430> we<00:03:54.430> have<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.639> really<00:03:55.000> nice<00:03:55.180> move

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.170 

and<00:04:01.560> then<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.920> nice<00:04:03.130> thing<00:04:03.370> about<00:04:03.460> is<00:04:03.880> kind<00:04:04.090> of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
and then the nice thing about is kind of

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.420 
and then the nice thing about is kind of
about<00:04:04.600> creative<00:04:05.440> moves<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.280> can

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
about creative moves like that you can

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.510 
about creative moves like that you can
see<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:07.080> lips<00:04:08.080> are<00:04:08.290> so<00:04:08.710> starting<00:04:09.310> quite

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
see that the lips are so starting quite

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.990 
see that the lips are so starting quite
thinner<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.900> know<00:04:11.050> and<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.920> mouth<00:04:12.250> starts

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
thinner you know and the mouth starts

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.570 
thinner you know and the mouth starts
quite<00:04:13.390> wide<00:04:13.720> but<00:04:14.500> be<00:04:14.620> home<00:04:14.860> because<00:04:15.280> we<00:04:15.400> have

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
quite wide but be home because we have

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.420 
quite wide but be home because we have
the<00:04:15.730> ability<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.180> adjust<00:04:16.420> to<00:04:17.010> adjust<00:04:18.010> if<00:04:18.130> like

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
the ability to adjust to adjust if like

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.039 
the ability to adjust to adjust if like
enough<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.030> position<00:04:19.540> of<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.720> mouth<00:04:20.019> with

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
enough the position of the mouth with

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.230 
enough the position of the mouth with
the<00:04:20.410> moves<00:04:20.650> you<00:04:20.890> can<00:04:21.310> see<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.519> as<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.000> mouth

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
the moves you can see that as the mouth

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.410 
the moves you can see that as the mouth
opens<00:04:22.750> in<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:23.860> more<00:04:24.130> realistic<00:04:24.340> way<00:04:24.880> it<00:04:25.120> kind<00:04:25.330> of

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
opens in a more realistic way it kind of

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.590 
opens in a more realistic way it kind of
narrows<00:04:25.680> also<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.800> can<00:04:26.980> see<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.340> we<00:04:28.180> have<00:04:28.210> a

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
narrows also you can see that we have a

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.560 
narrows also you can see that we have a
nice<00:04:28.960> effect<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.750> skin<00:04:32.140> stretching<00:04:32.890> a

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
nice effect of the skin stretching a

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.350 
nice effect of the skin stretching a
further<00:04:34.570> up<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.080> mouth<00:04:35.820> like<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:37.000> would<00:04:37.150> do

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
further up the mouth like it would do

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.050 
further up the mouth like it would do
sort<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.660> language<00:04:37.870> in<00:04:38.290> in<00:04:38.650> in<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.669> realistic

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
sort of language in in in a realistic

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.610 
sort of language in in in a realistic
sort<00:04:40.480> of<00:04:40.540> like<00:04:40.720> more<00:04:40.930> realistic<00:04:41.200> kind<00:04:41.530> of

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
sort of like more realistic kind of

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:52.070 
sort of like more realistic kind of
character<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:46.560> have<00:04:47.560> created<00:04:47.830> here<00:04:48.070> this

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.460 

type<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.260> couple<00:04:53.560> more<00:04:54.180> morph<00:04:55.180> targets<00:04:55.660> to

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
type a couple more morph targets to

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.360 
type a couple more morph targets to
illustrate<00:04:57.160> sort<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.490> like<00:04:57.669> this<00:04:57.880> point<00:04:58.180> about

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
illustrate sort of like this point about

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.840 
illustrate sort of like this point about
how<00:05:00.370> easy<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:00.970> so<00:05:01.180> like<00:05:01.360> I'm<00:05:01.540> here<00:05:01.870> we<00:05:02.050> have

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
how easy it is so like I'm here we have

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.900 
how easy it is so like I'm here we have
narrow<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.240> can<00:05:05.110> see<00:05:05.290> that<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:06.400> thing

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
narrow and you can see that the thing

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.719 
narrow and you can see that the thing
there<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:08.290> good<00:05:08.500> thing<00:05:08.530> about<00:05:08.800> sort<00:05:09.220> of<00:05:09.250> using

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
there the good thing about sort of using

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.090 
there the good thing about sort of using
this<00:05:10.030> kind<00:05:10.270> of<00:05:10.419> system<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.740> can<00:05:11.919> see

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
this kind of system is that you can see

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.170 
this kind of system is that you can see
that<00:05:12.310> we<00:05:12.430> have<00:05:12.460> really<00:05:13.150> nice<00:05:13.979> response<00:05:14.979> of<00:05:15.940> the

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
that we have really nice response of the

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.570 
that we have really nice response of the
skin<00:05:16.570> because<00:05:17.320> of<00:05:17.500> those<00:05:17.650> of<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:18.220> small

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
skin because of those of the small

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.180 
skin because of those of the small
targets<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.630> actually<00:05:20.020> affect<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.010> whole

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
targets that actually affect the whole

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.550 
targets that actually affect the whole
skinny<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:21.910> it<00:05:22.000> gives<00:05:22.180> us<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.419> nice<00:05:22.600> nice<00:05:23.320> sense

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
skinny and it gives us a nice nice sense

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.730 
skinny and it gives us a nice nice sense
of<00:05:23.680> realism<00:05:24.840> including<00:05:25.840> here<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.229> chain<00:05:26.530> in

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
of realism including here the chain in

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:35.219 
of realism including here the chain in
whatever<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:28.200> we<00:05:29.200> have<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:30.250> r<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:34.050> we<00:05:35.050> have

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
whatever and we have the r and we have

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.770 
whatever and we have the r and we have
the<00:05:35.380> v<00:05:35.590> and<00:05:35.860> with<00:05:36.520> a<00:05:36.550> V<00:05:36.820> I'll<00:05:37.120> sort<00:05:37.540> of<00:05:37.630> like<00:05:37.750> uh

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
the v and with a V I'll sort of like uh

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.080 
the v and with a V I'll sort of like uh
Nevada<00:05:38.229> t<00:05:38.500> eyes<00:05:38.770> but<00:05:39.220> you<00:05:39.400> know<00:05:39.550> to<00:05:39.760> see<00:05:39.910> you

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
Nevada t eyes but you know to see you

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.680 
Nevada t eyes but you know to see you
can<00:05:40.240> actually<00:05:40.390> do<00:05:40.660> it<00:05:40.780> and<00:05:42.090> we<00:05:43.090> have<00:05:43.240> the<00:05:43.450> wide

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
can actually do it and we have the wide

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.210 
can actually do it and we have the wide
and<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.860> with<00:05:45.460> a<00:05:45.490> ride<00:05:45.820> I<00:05:46.440> have<00:05:47.440> added<00:05:48.130> a

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
and and with a ride I have added a

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.040 
and and with a ride I have added a
little<00:05:48.370> bit<00:05:48.490> of<00:05:48.610> puffy<00:05:49.090> or<00:05:49.240> puffiness<00:05:49.660> of<00:05:49.930> the

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
little bit of puffy or puffiness of the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.890 
little bit of puffy or puffiness of the
chicks<00:05:50.380> and<00:05:50.680> you<00:05:51.550> can<00:05:51.729> see<00:05:51.910> that<00:05:51.940> you<00:05:52.660> know<00:05:52.690> we

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
chicks and you can see that you know we

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.020 
chicks and you can see that you know we
have<00:05:53.080> a<00:05:53.110> nice<00:05:53.380> effect<00:05:53.620> all<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:54.280> way<00:05:54.430> up<00:05:54.700> to<00:05:54.729> the

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
have a nice effect all the way up to the

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.930 
have a nice effect all the way up to the
the<00:05:56.020> cheekbones<00:05:57.210> so<00:05:58.470> I<00:05:59.470> hope<00:06:00.430> this<00:06:00.580> actually

this fight is going to if I open sort of
like<00:06:33.890> another<00:06:34.190> one<00:06:34.490> last<00:06:35.410> fine<00:06:36.410> like<00:06:36.740> that<00:06:39.640> so

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.570 

if<00:06:47.180> we're<00:06:47.420> going<00:06:47.630> to<00:06:47.720> go<00:06:48.190> into<00:06:49.190> the<00:06:49.430> head

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
if we're going to go into the head

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.390 
if we're going to go into the head
designer<00:06:49.970> and<00:06:50.410> so<00:06:51.410> for<00:06:51.770> example<00:06:51.830> get<00:06:52.280> the

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
designer and so for example get the

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.800 
designer and so for example get the
child<00:06:52.700> preset<00:06:53.570> and<00:06:54.500> ok<00:06:55.300> the<00:06:56.300> kind<00:06:56.510> of<00:06:56.570> child

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
child preset and ok the kind of child

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.800 
child preset and ok the kind of child
let's<00:06:57.110> go<00:06:57.260> to<00:06:57.320> look<00:06:57.560> like<00:06:57.710> another<00:06:58.390> beer<00:06:59.390> too

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
let's go to look like another beer too

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:07.150 
let's go to look like another beer too
let's<00:07:01.510> go<00:07:02.510> do<00:07:02.690> the<00:07:02.870> childhood<00:07:03.790> material<00:07:06.160> okay

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 
let's go do the childhood material okay

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.810 
let's go do the childhood material okay
and<00:07:07.780> now<00:07:08.780> we<00:07:08.840> go<00:07:09.170> to<00:07:09.200> the<00:07:09.410> head<00:07:09.590> designer<00:07:12.820> going

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
and now we go to the head designer going

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.150 
and now we go to the head designer going
to<00:07:13.940> edit<00:07:14.240> mode<00:07:14.450> and<00:07:15.730> then<00:07:17.560> the<00:07:18.560> mouth<00:07:18.800> slider

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 
to edit mode and then the mouth slider

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.690 
to edit mode and then the mouth slider
you<00:07:20.000> can<00:07:20.030> see<00:07:20.390> how<00:07:20.660> mass<00:07:21.530> slider<00:07:21.860> works<00:07:22.250> a<00:07:22.430> riot

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.700 
you can see how mass slider works a riot

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:29.460 
you can see how mass slider works a riot
with<00:07:22.970> that<00:07:24.220> for<00:07:25.220> the<00:07:25.340> child<00:07:27.220> if<00:07:28.220> we<00:07:28.430> go<00:07:28.640> into

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
with that for the child if we go into

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.850 
with that for the child if we go into
even<00:07:30.470> if<00:07:30.560> we<00:07:30.680> go<00:07:30.860> to<00:07:30.920> sort<00:07:31.250> of<00:07:31.310> like<00:07:31.460> MF<00:07:31.790> to<00:07:32.860> the

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
even if we go to sort of like MF to the

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.540 
even if we go to sort of like MF to the
animal<00:07:34.400> presets<00:07:35.590> we<00:07:36.590> still<00:07:36.950> have<00:07:37.190> quite<00:07:37.490> a
