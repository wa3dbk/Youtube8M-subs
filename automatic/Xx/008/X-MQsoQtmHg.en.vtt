the fight this time that's the way I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
the fight this time that's the way I
said<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.949> think<00:00:56.250> Pacquiao<00:00:56.579> we'll<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
said I think Pacquiao we'll just do the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.930 
said I think Pacquiao we'll just do the
same<00:00:57.570> thing<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:59.010> he<00:00:59.160> did<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.520> my<00:00:59.670> griddle

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
same thing to what he did to my griddle

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.569 
same thing to what he did to my griddle
he'll<00:01:00.239> fight<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> outside<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.859> throw<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
he'll fight from the outside and throw a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.840 
he'll fight from the outside and throw a
lot<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.879> punches<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.129> Rios<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.519> swelled

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
lot of punches and Rios will be swelled

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700
