want to tell you about a new product we

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.600 
want to tell you about a new product we
have<00:00:18.970> coming<00:00:19.239> out<00:00:19.390> this<00:00:19.540> year<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:21.160> technique

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
have coming out this year the technique

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.150 
have coming out this year the technique
we're<00:00:21.849> calling<00:00:22.270> it<00:00:22.360> is<00:00:22.509> I<00:00:22.779> motion<00:00:23.290> and<00:00:23.470> it<00:00:24.009> was

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
we're calling it is I motion and it was

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.580 
we're calling it is I motion and it was
been<00:00:24.310> invented<00:00:24.849> by<00:00:24.880> Jacqueline<00:00:25.540> Japan<00:00:25.899> and<00:00:26.169> it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
been invented by Jacqueline Japan and it

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.979 
been invented by Jacqueline Japan and it
served<00:00:26.829> their<00:00:27.099> own<00:00:27.309> technique<00:00:27.849> the<00:00:28.809> technique

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
served their own technique the technique

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.040 
served their own technique the technique
is<00:00:29.500> to<00:00:29.700> basically<00:00:30.700> throw<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.300> bait<00:00:31.599> out<00:00:31.809> and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
is to basically throw a bait out and

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.090 
is to basically throw a bait out and
have<00:00:32.349> it<00:00:32.380> swim<00:00:32.739> straight<00:00:33.160> and<00:00:33.429> if<00:00:34.030> you<00:00:34.210> if<00:00:34.510> you

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
have it swim straight and if you if you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.560 
have it swim straight and if you if you
see<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.129> minnow<00:00:36.399> in<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.640> water<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.179> you<00:00:37.359> look

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
see a minnow in the water and you look

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.329 
see a minnow in the water and you look
when<00:00:37.750> it's<00:00:37.780> not<00:00:38.019> threatened<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.800> just<00:00:39.129> from

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
when it's not threatened it just from

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.220 
when it's not threatened it just from
straight<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.539> that's<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.870> technique

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
straight and so that's the technique

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.470 
straight and so that's the technique
they're<00:00:41.410> trying<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:41.769> mimic<00:00:42.609> is<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:43.000> bait<00:00:43.329> that

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
they're trying to mimic is a bait that

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.209 
they're trying to mimic is a bait that
is<00:00:43.600> none<00:00:43.870> threatened<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.469> will<00:00:44.859> just<00:00:45.039> come

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
is none threatened and will just come

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.430 
is none threatened and will just come
straight<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:45.839> actually<00:00:46.839> to<00:00:46.960> develop<00:00:47.379> a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
straight and actually to develop a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.220 
straight and actually to develop a
product<00:00:47.769> that<00:00:48.160> to<00:00:49.059> do<00:00:49.239> nothing<00:00:49.690> this

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
product that to do nothing this

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.810 
product that to do nothing this
substrate<00:00:50.679> is<00:00:50.829> just<00:00:51.039> as<00:00:51.190> hard<00:00:51.370> as<00:00:51.489> developed

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
substrate is just as hard as developed

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.880 
substrate is just as hard as developed
product<00:00:52.089> that<00:00:52.210> actually<00:00:52.359> has<00:00:52.719> an<00:00:52.899> action<00:00:53.289> so

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
product that actually has an action so

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.250 
product that actually has an action so
what<00:00:54.460> we've<00:00:54.609> done<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.909> for<00:00:55.449> example<00:00:55.539> this<00:00:56.079> is

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
what we've done is for example this is

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.430 
what we've done is for example this is
the<00:00:56.379> Sierra<00:00:56.890> meadow<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.730> comes<00:00:58.199> comes<00:00:59.199> in<00:00:59.319> an

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
the Sierra meadow it comes comes in an

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.220 
the Sierra meadow it comes comes in an
80<00:00:59.589> millimeter<00:01:00.039> size<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.730> this<00:01:01.179> bait<00:01:01.449> has<00:01:01.839> a

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
80 millimeter size and this bait has a

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.890 
80 millimeter size and this bait has a
lot<00:01:02.469> of<00:01:02.499> technology<00:01:03.069> behind<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.659> it's<00:01:04.659> got<00:01:04.870> a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
lot of technology behind it it's got a

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.330 
lot of technology behind it it's got a
weighted<00:01:05.259> system<00:01:05.680> where<00:01:05.799> there's<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.979> ball<00:01:06.159> in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
weighted system where there's a ball in

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.550 
weighted system where there's a ball in
here<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:06.820> it<00:01:06.909> will<00:01:06.939> go<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.990> back<00:01:08.200> so<00:01:08.530> you

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
here and it will go to the back so you

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.550 
here and it will go to the back so you
can<00:01:08.799> cast<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.220> further<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:10.659> actually<00:01:11.049> have<00:01:11.259> a

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
can cast it further they actually have a

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.100 
can cast it further they actually have a
glued<00:01:12.100> feathered<00:01:12.579> tail<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.149> that<00:01:13.659> is<00:01:13.810> again

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
glued feathered tail and that is again

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.010 
glued feathered tail and that is again
to<00:01:14.409> keep<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.159> bait<00:01:15.340> stable<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.060> it's<00:01:16.750> hard<00:01:16.930> to

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
to keep the bait stable and it's hard to

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.050 
to keep the bait stable and it's hard to
see<00:01:17.140> on<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.560> camera<00:01:17.770> but<00:01:17.979> there's<00:01:18.640> actually<00:01:19.030> a

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
see on the camera but there's actually a

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.240 
see on the camera but there's actually a
hole<00:01:19.299> in<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.600> mouth<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.110> on<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.740> side<00:01:21.009> of<00:01:21.040> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
hole in the mouth and on the side of the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.280 
hole in the mouth and on the side of the
bait<00:01:21.490> there's<00:01:22.119> actually<00:01:22.479> some<00:01:22.689> small<00:01:23.020> little

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
bait there's actually some small little

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.310 
bait there's actually some small little
slits<00:01:23.740> for<00:01:23.860> gills<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.670> what<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.630> does<00:01:26.020> is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
slits for gills and what that does is

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.160 
slits for gills and what that does is
the<00:01:26.979> water<00:01:27.490> will<00:01:27.880> go<00:01:28.090> through<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.630> mouth<00:01:28.810> and

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
the water will go through the mouth and

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.230 
the water will go through the mouth and
actually<00:01:29.619> come<00:01:29.799> out<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:30.070> gills<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.640> it

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
actually come out the gills and it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.880 
actually come out the gills and it
actually<00:01:31.600> helps<00:01:31.990> stabilize<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.590> bait<00:01:32.740> as

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
actually helps stabilize the bait as

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.459 
actually helps stabilize the bait as
well<00:01:33.100> so<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.460> will<00:01:33.640> swim<00:01:33.939> is<00:01:34.060> just<00:01:34.090> straight<00:01:34.539> as

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
well so it will swim is just straight as

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.350 
well so it will swim is just straight as
well<00:01:35.770> as<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:35.950> fish<00:01:36.310> action<00:01:36.729> can<00:01:36.850> sense<00:01:37.149> water

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
well as a fish action can sense water

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.410 
well as a fish action can sense water
movement<00:01:37.750> coming<00:01:38.469> through<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.829> gills<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:39.420> no

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
movement coming through the gills and no

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.770 
movement coming through the gills and no
it's<00:01:40.570> like<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.780> live<00:01:41.289> bait<00:01:41.590> type<00:01:41.829> of<00:01:42.009> lure<00:01:43.000> so

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
it's like a live bait type of lure so

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.260 
it's like a live bait type of lure so
this<00:01:44.229> here<00:01:44.439> is<00:01:44.530> called<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.829> si<00:01:45.039> hermano<00:01:45.270> throw

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
this here is called the si hermano throw

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.929 
this here is called the si hermano throw
it<00:01:46.420> out<00:01:46.570> on<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.780> spinning<00:01:47.140> reel<00:01:47.350> with<00:01:47.680> like<00:01:48.340> six

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
it out on a spinning reel with like six

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.499 
it out on a spinning reel with like six
six<00:01:49.270> pound<00:01:49.750> test<00:01:49.960> line<00:01:50.079> eight<00:01:50.590> max<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.299> you

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
six pound test line eight max and you

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.539 
six pound test line eight max and you
just<00:01:52.689> slowly<00:01:53.170> retrieve<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:53.680> back<00:01:53.859> a<00:01:53.890> real<00:01:54.280> slow

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
just slowly retrieve it back a real slow

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.120 
just slowly retrieve it back a real slow
and<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:54.909> base<00:01:55.030> comes<00:01:55.240> from<00:01:55.450> straight<00:01:56.130> also

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
and the base comes from straight also

that<00:02:25.300> goes<00:02:25.480> straight<00:02:25.660> there's<00:02:26.110> some

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
that goes straight there's some

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.920 
that goes straight there's some
technology<00:02:26.769> behind<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.280> there's<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.239> as<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
technology behind it there's a as you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.059

can<00:02:29.019> see<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.260> color<00:02:29.440> change<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:30.010> this

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
can see the color change in this

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.670 
can see the color change in this
particular<00:02:30.250> color<00:02:31.090> which<00:02:31.989> is<00:02:32.019> dark<00:02:32.349> Thunder

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
the top half what that's going to do

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.430 
the top half what that's going to do
it's<00:02:39.880> going<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.060> be<00:02:40.150> hot<00:02:40.330> heavier<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.019> denser

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
it's going to be hot heavier and denser

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.140 
it's going to be hot heavier and denser
which<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.160> going<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.340> keep<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.640> bait<00:02:42.790> more

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
which is going to keep the bait more

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.180 
which is going to keep the bait more
stable<00:02:43.599> so<00:02:44.019> it<00:02:44.140> doesn't<00:02:44.319> roll<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:44.980> water

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
stable so it doesn't roll in the water

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.360 
stable so it doesn't roll in the water
and<00:02:45.519> they<00:02:46.090> even<00:02:46.299> have<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.989> bulge<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.130> tail

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
and they even have a bulge and the tail

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.270 
and they even have a bulge and the tail
which<00:02:49.180> helps<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.140> tail<00:02:50.380> keep<00:02:50.650> stable<00:02:50.950> and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
which helps the tail keep stable and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.949 
which helps the tail keep stable and
they've<00:02:51.790> even<00:02:52.090> gone<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.480> trouble<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.840> a

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
they've even gone to the trouble of a

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.360 
they've even gone to the trouble of a
split-tail<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.680> can't<00:02:53.829> hard<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.099> see<00:02:54.250> but

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
split-tail you can't hard to see but

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.559 
split-tail you can't hard to see but
there's<00:02:54.459> actually<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:54.880> split<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.299> tail

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
there's actually a split in the tail

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.199 
there's actually a split in the tail
which<00:02:56.170> creates<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.650> vibration<00:02:57.280> which<00:02:57.790> mimics

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
which creates a vibration which mimics

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.309 
which creates a vibration which mimics
like<00:02:58.450> you're<00:02:58.630> feeding<00:02:59.069> feeding<00:03:00.069> bait<00:03:00.400> fish<00:03:00.610> so

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
like you're feeding feeding bait fish so

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.770 
like you're feeding feeding bait fish so
again<00:03:02.319> with<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.829> a<00:03:03.040> soft<00:03:03.519> bait<00:03:03.760> there's<00:03:04.690> a

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
again with just a soft bait there's a

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.600 
again with just a soft bait there's a
lot<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:04.989> technology<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.829> cast<00:03:06.130> it<00:03:06.310> straight

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
lot of technology you cast it straight

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.800 
lot of technology you cast it straight
out<00:03:06.640> again<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.390> light<00:03:07.959> line<00:03:08.760> 46<00:03:09.810> preferably

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
out again on light line 46 preferably

out again on light line 46 preferably
real<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.650> straight<00:03:11.950> back<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.760> looks<00:03:12.790> like

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
real is straight back and it looks like

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.319 
real is straight back and it looks like
a<00:03:13.560> minnow<00:03:14.560> or<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:14.920> bait<00:03:15.250> fish<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:16.030> not

a minnow or a bait fish that is not
threatened<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.110> bass<00:03:17.260> comes<00:03:17.560> up<00:03:17.709> and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
threatened and the bass comes up and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.030 
threatened and the bass comes up and
eats<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.310> as<00:03:18.459> an<00:03:18.549> easy<00:03:18.700> meal<00:03:19.049> we<00:03:20.049> also<00:03:20.230> can<00:03:20.920> you
