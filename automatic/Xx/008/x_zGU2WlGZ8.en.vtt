00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.890 
hey guys these are my two strand twists
that<00:00:43.470> I<00:00:43.710> did<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.940> two<00:00:45.510> months<00:00:45.840> ago

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
that I did like about two months ago

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.740 
that I did like about two months ago
that<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.350> my<00:00:46.470> first<00:00:46.770> set<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.510> they<00:00:48.510> look<00:00:48.720> very

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
that was my first set and they look very

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
that was my first set and they look very
curly<00:00:49.199> once<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.620> wet<00:00:49.800> them<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.129> soon<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.460> wet

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
curly once I wet them as soon as I wet
them<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.270> hard<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.629> tell<00:00:51.780> they're<00:00:51.960> even<00:00:52.199> two

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
them it's hard to tell they're even two

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.900 
them it's hard to tell they're even two
strand<00:00:52.680> twists<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.449> took<00:00:54.510> them<00:00:54.900> down<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.860> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
looked like the hair swelled and I don't

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.550 
looked like the hair swelled and I don't
know<00:01:23.550> I<00:01:23.940> was<00:01:24.360> liking<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.899> so<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> said<00:01:25.410> let<00:01:25.530> me

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
know I was liking it so I said let me

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
know I was liking it so I said let me
see<00:01:25.710> how<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.009> looks<00:01:26.310> when<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> dries<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
see how it looks when it dries and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.770 
see how it looks when it dries and
that's<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:27.780> came<00:01:27.899> out<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> dried<00:01:29.780> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that's how it came out when it dried it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.650 
that's how it came out when it dried it
had<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.470> hold<00:01:31.740> from<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.660> conditioner

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
had a little hold from the conditioner

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.080 
had a little hold from the conditioner
but<00:01:33.929> it<00:01:34.229> wasn't<00:01:34.679> like<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> gel<00:01:35.429> hold<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.970> was

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
but it wasn't like a gel hold it was

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.320 
but it wasn't like a gel hold it was
just<00:01:36.300> a<00:01:36.450> hold<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.610> because<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:38.789> guessing

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
just a hold and because I'm guessing

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.499 
just a hold and because I'm guessing
because<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.929> twist<00:01:40.710> out<00:01:41.390> everything<00:01:42.390> was

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
because of the twist out everything was

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.499 
because of the twist out everything was
already<00:01:42.869> clumped<00:01:43.530> together<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
already clumped together so the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.230 
already clumped together so the
conditioner<00:01:46.080> just<00:01:46.369> likes<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:49.830> know<00:01:50.119> cuz<00:01:51.119> I'm

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
conditioner just likes you know cuz I'm

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.109 
conditioner just likes you know cuz I'm
hold<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.569> that<00:01:52.039> so<00:01:53.039> I<00:01:53.069> like<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:53.910> I<00:01:53.940> was
