00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 the psv logo at the end of the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.310
 player tunnel and the start of it 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.500
 playing field of the philips stadium light 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.250
 we fried when the players are ready 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.219
 in front of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.740
 and there is a lot of interest in psv 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.670
 the run-up to the game against 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.980
 waregem 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.189
 third qualifying round of the champions 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.080
 league and that after a relatively short one 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.730
 preparation in which the new staff and 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.529
 the new players have to each other 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.480
 can get used to yes i think the group 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.220
 is done 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.199
 we started later due to 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.320
 many obligations 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.079
 international dogs 1921 everyone played 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 taken into account 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.860
 the load some players are there 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.390
 started earlier 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.280
 but if i look now i think so 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.129
 everyone is well and so good 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.829
 Fit the preparations have come through 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.300
 no injuries and that is important 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 you can go it or fresh season 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.210
 also start feeling a bit like that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.100
 that preparation is of what you open 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.949
 envisioned 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.940
 yes I am fairly satisfied with how 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.920
 it has expired 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.460
 matches have entered how played 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.130
 have it is only natural one 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.479
 indication preparation is anyway 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.159
 always difficult to estimate where you are 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.780
 exactly but I am satisfied 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.390
 about the developments around team tom 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.460
 now so far after all the practice football from 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.810
 the past weeks in which psv none 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.939
 match lost 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.320
 so now it's about the real thing 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.939
 Moreover 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.250
 placement for the playoffs of the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.450
 champions league that's what it's all about 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.369
 turns 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.170
 yes it is very important competition in 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.840
 every way 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.970
 So that thrills up for those players who 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.600
 they are not really used to things 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.009
 the club is an important competition yes 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.079
 I 'd better start with 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.220
 important and the battle for the brand you 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.509
 that also in the group that is now on 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.979
 voltage on 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.649
 the he does notice that there is a big one 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.619
 match is coming that lives 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.560
 what a dressing room you feel are again 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.409
 the beautiful things 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.240
 the grin on mont ventoux you say a lot 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.200
 because he experiences it all as 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.990
 player 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.229
 played the semi-final with psv in 2005 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.090
 against ac milan and he also knows what 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.590
 it can do to get sold out 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.380
 play stadium 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.450
 the extra support from the 12th man yes there 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.250
 I am also very happy that the fans 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.130
 flocking to this pointed it because 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.860
 we will need you to support 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.019
 and we can use it well so that we 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.600
 with will the english 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.769
 as staff and the and play together with 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.540
 those supporters hear that well again 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.489
 drop result 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.319
 leaving after with a good one 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.360
 want to go to the ipad 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.830
 what is the greatest danger of this 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.440
 contest zulte waregem it's no 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.340
 established name it is not a big name 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.200
 is the biggest danger that you saw it 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.130
 well underestimate that shrill there 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.780
 lives in danger think few people 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.280
 shields why well know that 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.250
 have developed excellent 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.690
 past years and where an ana champion 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.950
 from Belgium 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.269
 well you do n't just do that then 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.560
 you really have quality in your teams 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.320
 they have good in the realm 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.090
 players but especially the team 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.340
 have been where the changes have been between 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.570
 being able to get together with one or two 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.040
 to hold 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.170
 yes so that we will really have a heavy one 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.989
 have been able to put the team together 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.930
 many qualities 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.459
 so they should certainly not underestimate 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.890
 put those two teams together there zulte 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.769
 waregem to your team 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.739
 yes i think it is similar too 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.120
 a few routinier many young boys 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.850
 We have creative players 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.160
 also so i think it's very close 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.930
 each other is what you said just none 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.100
 we injured that lineup 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.810
 not so much different from that of 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.819
 last week and turkey 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.350
 yes about the setup that I have little 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.730
 letting go 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.730
 so we'll see that tomorrow
