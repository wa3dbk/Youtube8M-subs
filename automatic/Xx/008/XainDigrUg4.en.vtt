00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.500
 ah 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.960
 one 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.860
 This chapter video back 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.910
 make it easy I will teach you how to do 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.310
 very particular nails and that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.920
 simple view would be quite complicated 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.750
 not the supremely easy and they are going to give 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.120
 account at this moment I'm going to show you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.160
 that we are going to use how we are going to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.320
 do and it's going to be super but super 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.290
 simple so let's go by name 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.260
 First, first, first, we're going 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.330
 to do is apply our protector 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.040
 so that the nails are not going to be damaged and 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.470
 I repeat it and I repeat it we repeat it 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.690
 that in zone because it is supremely 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.989
 important that it has already dried 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.649
 completely let's apply then 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.970
 the first layer of color in this case I 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.460
 I'm going to apply the silver one that is the most 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.180
 clarita that is important that the most 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.420
 clarita be the one that goes like base 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.460
 and then let's let it dry 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.700
 after I 'm well I know it's 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.729
 then we are going to apply the second layer 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.110
 of color and what are we going to do 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.180
 Following way 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.240
 we're just going to apply it in half 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.820
 from the nail down but we're going to 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.550
 do diagonally as such as 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.290
 are watching when we have them ready 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.180
 then with that same color with the 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.720
 purple color let's start doing 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.730
 little dots so well distributed that we 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.600
 stay in different positions to 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.600
 aligned also the time 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.360
 and then let's do exactly what 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.280
 same but with the opposite color and in 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.220
 the opposite side is to say with the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.700
 silver where the base is 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.700
 purple 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.729
 and it's that easy then we start 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.890
 clean around the nail because a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.690
 Sometimes there are little things on the outside but it is 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.330
 this circuit entourage then we go to 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.310
 apply our protector or our 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.350
 transparent glaze transparent varnish 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.390
 protective varnish as you want to call it 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.330
 and it's that easy 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.190
 we have finished we have finished good 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.620
 So far the video blog I hope you 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.110
 I liked it but they count supremely 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.989
 simple is a matter of feeling good 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.420
 steps the indications and also of 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.000

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.560
