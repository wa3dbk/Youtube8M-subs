00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello to everyone you said this channel 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.630
 Omsk dota 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.570
 today I would like to show them the set on nyx 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.730
 assassin and its name is shadow hunter and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 let's consider our model 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.550
 Nix but this bug is very Soul Plane 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.699
 pretty 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.070
 an insect in my opinion that I would like 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.710
 say about this kit on 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.140
 this moment is the latest set on 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.460
 south from all existing 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.910
 set is very expensive and from this little 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.000
 affordable but if you take 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 shop price the price of the site 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.940
 is double what any other 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.940
 set and besides this kit 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 there are four styles 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.260
 first he is yellow then we if we 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.410
 see 10 the game turns blue through 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.949
 ten games in purple if we look 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.110
 30 gr then turns red proper 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.360
 what games you need to watch games 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.080
 watch and commentator casper here 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.360
 here you can look at gemmi 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.570
 Casper I think many of you know 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.210
 comments on starladder besides 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.409
 besides become starladdera can watch 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.790
 games dreamleague 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.690
 Well, that is, throw it like it is like 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.540
 imagine what it looks like 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.030
 that is, the set we have roughly worth 250 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.660
 rubles ticket on starladder 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.120
 or DreamLig costs 320 rubles and in general 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.770
 if a 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.940
 how to buy this set and open it 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.510
 you need to spend almost completely 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.550
 600 rubles, well, roughly I 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.090
 I think that it is very expensive for this 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.450
 There are a couple of sets in my set 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.430
 look much better and no matter how they are needed 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.910
 they already open as it were in 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.150
 original kind beautiful but here's how 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.500
 would such a thing besides 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.000
 add that the counters are these things 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.580
 it is added difficult that is it seems as though 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.980
 watch games with commentator Casper but 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.450
 not for each game the counter is added 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.180
 you do not know what it is connected with errors 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.420
 organizers or with errors in hp then 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.840
 there is an error with dota itself 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.670
 minus such present do not know see 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.900
 is it anyone and but i think it is 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.320
 as it should be fixed well let's continue 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.710
 about the very set on and cute 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.140
 this kit 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.960
 I think that very nice models 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.120
 luxury pieces of texture cool 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.880
 I especially like this one 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.990
 last open style when we 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.090
 let's look at 30 Casper games with these 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.900
 red parts of course you can 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.210
 combine 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.310
 one thing make purple another 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.060
 blue another red another yellow 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.590
 let's show here for example we will change 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:15.220
 leave this on yellow 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:18.190
 here we do blue and violet and 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.230
 see what will happen here this turns 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.900
 terrible christmas tree of course you can 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.090
 wash well how smarter somehow this 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.150
 make half unix make blue 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.330
 half red and it will be much 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.870
 better look well either leave everything in 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.210
 the same style as we are doing now 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.930
 let's dig in red so how is it 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.250
 us the latest open style 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.550
 by the way here pay attention when i 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.890
 click style icons they change with me i 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.230
 first time watching that so crooked 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:57.200
 photographed okay it's like 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.920
 no role on the site does not affect well 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.650
 such an interesting thing in general I approve 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.300
 this kit is very pretty given 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.110
 the site consists as you have seen from 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.580
 four things 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.020
 1 rarki 2 ankammon ok and one team 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.380
 well let's see how to highlight the suite and 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.590
 in Game 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.510
 Here we have such zhike let's equalize them 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.690
 so that we have them in the same direction 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:27.580
 We will look further 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.740
 note that we have mixes 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.580
 changes completely ie we have 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.560
 changing their bodies upper back 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.600
 part of the head claw 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.960
 as well as the karae apiary also change well 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.470
 With regards to the legs, I would like to add 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:51.040
 such a thing that our legs are changing and here 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.620
 there are thorns on their feet would be nice 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.180
 if these thorns also changed color 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.890
 along with the rest of the body ie 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.440
 why is this yellow all the rest 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.740
 red spikes would be nice if they 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.410
 also red and were well as it were 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.140
 so it is but it still looks like it all 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.230
 great well we looked at the front 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.570
 let's see what nux is from behind and that's it 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.170
 they look like funny she kidneys 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.720
 his ass too 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.260
 pretty something she reminds me 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.100
 ant ass 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.650
 such some kind of non - nevovsky ass 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:33.610
 let's look from this angle in 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.700
 principle what's the difference with this task with 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.120
 Well, let's get this back but the front one 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.370
 part and still see their faces a little 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.090
 By the way, here I would like to draw your 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.580
 Attention 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:51.250
 This last style reminds me 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:54.040
 hut wicked hut look here how 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.810
 red nix and this marriage is something 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.870
 reminds 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.140
 luxury to you let's go consider consider 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.030
 models of our nyx assassin of icons 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.140
 which we have very different a 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.410
 as well as 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:12.130
 nyx assassin as a whole that is from this 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.980
 i icon head now 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.860
 red spikes are visible here 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.870
 red and standard nix absolutely 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.870
 other 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.920
 Here is a completely standard she barrack 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.920
 as in the first dotka 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.639
 but this is probably all the changes we had 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:35.159
 probably add anything 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:40.979
 I said everything I wanted if you were playing 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:43.020

 this kit after a while 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:50.520
 another decent job will come out if not 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:54.090
 I am mistaken with Milo and hangs at virtus.pro 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.900

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.840
