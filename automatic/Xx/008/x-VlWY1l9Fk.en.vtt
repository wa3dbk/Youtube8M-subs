00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 And then, beauty people, I'll bring them here. 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.040
 Comparison of gl 90 and gl 65 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.000
 Of course we know it 's 90's 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240
 best 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.350
 and it is also more expensive is a more 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.760
 powerful 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.220
 I was 65 is already a more basic model 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.550
 only very good here also a video 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.059
 more for you to compare the design of the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.399
 each one of them as you can see 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:42.660
 both are end up pretty much the same 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:46.829
 here is different here than the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.050
 l 90 is in red France, here's the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.800
 infrared output 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.800
 the buttons on the side all good-looking 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:07.229
 their size is also very similar 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:10.560
 here in the case is 90 and here is the s65 that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.350
 is a 4.7-inch screen and here a 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.210
 4.3 inch screen 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.600
 the edges of the 90 is thinner with the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.600
 better use of the front 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 without leaving the appliance too large 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:38.360
 both have there the android in the same version 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.360
 both have the new code 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:58.750
 So, as you can see, they both have a 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:02.289
 very good nice screen 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.409
 the rear camera both have a camera 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.440
 with led flash 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:12.700
 89 l but in theory and 8 megapixels 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:18.190
 s65 from only 5 megapixels the quality 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:22.650
 do is 90 is better also in the photos both 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:30.910
 are both self-focused but the technology 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:36.549
 90 is used in the best differential l 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:39.730
 here also on the screen he has until 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.430
 smart here you can check that 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.819
 she will recognize your face that you 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.870
 is looking at the device and will not 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:53.670
 pay the screen already or 65 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:59.730
 does not have this function're 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.730
 both have here the guest mode 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.450
 where you can set up a 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.920
 unlock pattern and set some 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.590
 applications that will be viewed 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.010
 it may be that you leave your device there 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.190
 with your child so he will have access 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:29.470
 only the applications you choose 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:34.030
 so test here at the top shows what i 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.340
 yielded 17 000 425 13 026 points and here 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.639
 points 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.870
 details on the device here both have 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:44.859
 indicates ram memory which is a 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.760
 1.2 ghz quad core processor and here 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:53.650
 is one of the accord 1.2 ghz which is a 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.090
 snapdragon 400 and here is a snapdragon 200 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.930
 Let's go there, Adrian. 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.930
 5 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.709
 then we will open here the trail to 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:13.480
 people having a notion is not 90 is 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.480
 opening a little faster 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.670
 the ae 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:53.220
 there is love very good clear wheel 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.220
 The best wheel is 90 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:02.550
 the message application here 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.550
 practically here was already open 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:12.520
 the message application here is 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.300
 configured the mall the mode of operation 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.260
 only one hand and 90 have this 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:25.200
 Function 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.200
 You can also deactivate here. 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:42.430
 keyboard is basically the same as there is 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:47.620
 phone number is also good 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:50.700
 similar is a little higher in l 90 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.700
 have a larger screen 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.360
 good staff battery from them too 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.990
 basically the same duration is the same 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.120
 or is 90 has a battery with the capacity 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.670
 a bit bigger 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.270
 only it demands a little more battery 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:13.320
 so the durability is very similar 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:18.940
 good guys this is it both have a 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:22.180
 the same angle of view as with reflection 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:29.230
 not good to see the op however has a 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:31.060
 very good angle of vision so that's it 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:35.740
 I hope that you guys have 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:39.700
 liked and that the video there will show you the ta 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:43.570
 the similarities in which they are worth 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:49.630
 worth buying for a little more price 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:53.480
 expensive the l 90 or the cheaper price or lc 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:56.560
 I liked it 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.560
 not worth
