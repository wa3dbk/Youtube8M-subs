00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
you control each car from say an iPhone

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.699 
you control each car from say an iPhone
or<00:01:54.520> an<00:01:54.849> Android<00:01:54.939> device<00:01:55.509> not<00:01:55.899> only<00:01:55.929> are<00:01:56.529> they

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709
