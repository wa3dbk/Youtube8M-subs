00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.820
In the previous movie, we looked at correcting
Color and Tone and Skin on a couple of images

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180
that really needed it and the results were
really dramatic.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.710
Yet what about those images where things are
a little bit more subtle.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.710
Well that's what we are going to work on in
this particular movie.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.870
Open up the file Daniel.psd.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
Once that's opened in Photoshop, press F to
go to Full Screen View mode.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.890
Now this is a photograph that was captured
by one of my students in one of his early

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.980
classes at Brooks and it is a nice image
and I had him given a demo on working on this

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.309
image in Photoshop class.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.479
I also asked him if we could use this in our
training and I think that this image will

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.820
work out well for us
because the need for the improvement here

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.239
is very subtle.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.620
let's go ahead and double click the Zoom tool.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.040
That will take this image to 100% so that
we can see the image in its entirety.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.170
You really focus in on the face.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.720
Now you will notice in the Layers palette,
there is a group there you can turn that on

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.229
to see how he is retouched this image
and if we zoom in even further heres our Before

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.500
and After basically clean up the image.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.540
Now that looks really nice.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.840
One of the things that I'm noticing is the
skin is a little bit uneven.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.140
Here we see the reds underneath the eye, little
bit of red patchiness in the skin.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.570
Well how do we fix that?

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.650
We use Hue/Saturation.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.570
we will click on the Adjustment Layer icon
and choose Hue/Saturation, go with the Reds.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.310
Now when I modify my Hue slider for my Reds
I'm going to notice that it is affecting the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.840
entire image.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.520
All of his skin is turning green.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.450
Well how do I focus in on the specific tones
that I want to work on?

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.970
Well we can try our Eye Dropper tool and click
around the image and see, well don't work

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.770
on these tones and we can see
that it is a little bit less of an adjustment.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.350
We can also try sampling the area that we
want to work on.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.010
Yet one of the things we are noticing is this
isnt quite working for us.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.420
This doesnt cut it.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.729
So let's press the Option or the Alt Key and
choose Reset, that will reset our Hue/Saturation

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.180
adjustments.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.409
Again that was the Option key on the Mac,
the Alt key on the PC that changes Cancel

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.409
to Reset.

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.299
I move that over a little bit so you can see
that.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.000
Next, let's go back to the Reds.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.500
Now modify the Hue, this will help us define
what we are working on and let's just try

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.310
manually to bring in these two points
and also to bring in our outside sliders here.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.810
What this does is it changes the transition
from the actual color we are working on to

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.290
other colors and what we should start
to see is that we can really focus in on specific

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.870
areas of our image.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.760
let's modify our Hue slider and one thing
that youre seeing is that I'm modifying,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.060
in this case making it worse these areas that
I think are problematic.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.050
Now, if the reach of those areas arent good
enough.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.240
I'm going to go ahead and expand them a little
bit further.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.750
You can see that it is going to reach out
a little bit further here and then even more

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.010
there
that one I need to be really careful of those

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.010
areas.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.830
OK so the image doesnt look good.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.800
But I will take my Hue back to 0.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.890
I now know what are the areas I'm working
on.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.590
I need to Desaturate just a tad.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm going to warm those areas up a little
bit.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.120
I happened to know if I increased the Hue
slider just a tad bit; it will warm those

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.190
areas up.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.260
let's look at our Preview.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.980
Heres our Before and After.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.050
it is evening out the skin tone.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.970
let's click OK.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.989
Now of course there are areas that it doesnt
look good, the lips in particular actually

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.190
it helped
out with those red veins in the eyes, that's

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.190
nice.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.360
The red on the ears if you look at the Before
and After heres our Before heres our After.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.790
Areas I'm paying attention to are the eyes,
the ears, the nose, the skin, looks great.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.990
Click on the Mask and select the Brush tool.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.050
Now I choose black for my color picker and
I'm going to invert those two colors by clicking

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.239
on this arrow which will allow me
to switch my foreground and background colors

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.580
and next paint was black on the lips that
I want to bring that color back

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.300
and then click the Eye on this Adjustment
layer to look at my Before and After to see

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.480
if any other areas need help and I would say
no, that looks really good.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.889
Now that adjustment is incredibly subtle but
what it will actually do is make his skin

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:32.130
look smoother
and it will make the image much stronger.
