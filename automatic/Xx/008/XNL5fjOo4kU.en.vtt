00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.610
 with this country to the near east Antioquia we continue with the 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.390
 dialogue with sergio quiroz 8 about the commercialization of cabaret 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.159
 Colombian 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.169
 I remembered that there are some what techniques plus equine ministration 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:16.109
 win was and omar livestock that is not a telephone brings so much of 8 14 69 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.640
 to all of these that what we produce 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.130
 we kill ourselves because they see in the whole world at the same time we have better horse neglect 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.609
 step of the world and 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.310
 and we have a very important guild that is to finalize your inass date 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.469
 at 26 ' 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.780
 regional asuncena we have one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.510
 more than 150 trade fair events available throughout the year between degrees 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 of degree to and in the national etcetera 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 some important figures for December in the export and trade part 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.170
 internal the horse expression but to all stories we produce notoriously 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.230
 maybe but that showed to each other in the Chinese part in the I have eight 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.960
 regions 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 they are used as cabal as communal work animals 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.640
 and many haciendas in the country are dedicated precisely 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.970
 to take out those types of animals and on extensive cattle ranches 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 you have great technical breeding lots 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 thus in being born rosendo products 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.990
 for the dairy to replace the battery 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.040
 but we got to the exhibition 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.400
 Really 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.900
 although it is marketed internally in the country if it is a 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.150
 product export our sillar horse specially of fabrics modality 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
 Colombian fine step that is the most desirable failures in the world 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.110
 behind the united states it was already almost full saturated with interest of kind of 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.470
 horses are already taking Czechoslovakia inclusion in germany 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.800
 the little ones in their daughter from a small group and canada 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.450
 They are taken to those countries and they are known for mega world level 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.509
 As export product by sun be the softest chair horses 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.040
 of the world but multi mamen that suddenly exports have not been the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.450
 which therefore the rate of imports of other races 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.720
 at this time 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.400
 importing 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.730
 other races precisely because of that void p animals taken out for the ride 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.620
 then come for example the horses paint the sticks or if the cuts 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.250
 million horses used for the cavalcade come the Lusitanian horses and 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.250
 Spaniards to fill that void 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:25.449
 the modern globalized world through the media of 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:29.009
 interpol in day have notoriously impacted the 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.170
 Colombian Creole horses that make it part of the small segment 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.969
 dedicated to the breeding of exhibition horses by allowing them to witness the 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.909
 Successful reproduction process calls for testimonies of a shock and ansa of others 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.970
 races that can adopt if our means to be used in activities 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.769
 of riding and work leading to some diversification of the offer 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.819
 of horses and therefore of the conditions of the offer and the truth that 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.969
 he always heard on the street men that he 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.839
 l that theme the creole horse is his thing is not a business but what happens is that 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:08.170
 as the market is stigmatized again reveals in only wants 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.359
 produce horses position with the usual time complications 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.279
 resources 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.039
 of all even though it was that this implies 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.699
 and we realize that another type of decennial dd to lock with the horse 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.110
 horse mansions horseback riding the street of the walk the jaleo bacterium 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.390
 and for which the possible in Colombia has been opened that enter characteristics of caste and 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.149
 morning 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.449
 for the enjoyment of many people who are in that entity in the most part of 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:35.059
 the pyramid that soon to the voluminous that pees and that this as for the 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.479
 part those that destroy clear that yes it is that the base of the horses of this 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.199
 country should be the horse 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.279
 from everyone that everyone knows and the horse the whole horse world 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.989
 working horse riding horse riding horse 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.510
 Our horse fulfills that function but if we make a selection line 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.499
 only for the track horse we will not have it in Colombia perfectly 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.699
 it could be done 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.969
 what is being done that is a special crossings to improve 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.430
 our horse decision 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.559
 in battery 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.619
 with a cowgirls line 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.029
 it touched us already walked with some failures 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.449
 good size 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.649
 quiet and noble our draft horse mixing them with a line of 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:13.429
 soon 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.209
 with animals a little more than 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.669
 corpulence 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.029
 and a little more strength and size for the cattle for that job 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.809
 then that kind of crosses that can be done in the country are never going to 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:27.960
 finish with the Colombian saddle horse announced that is that they are not 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.319
 makeup artists excluding it 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.419
 may the breeding of the horse duty of passage or the horse exhibition the four 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.919
 modalities will continue statesman and will continue and tends to stabilize with the 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.620
 method answer production handling by modern 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.060
 but they are still quietly on their way but not exclusive with 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.479
 with the other activity where you can 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.870
 place many of work can not move 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.900
 an amount the baby must in his mailbox in important money and can be 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.800
 transar presented to the country for event abortion is obviously a source and 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.920
 very large income 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.410
 because she went from informal casual marketing 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.789
 and we entered into a marketing that is currently being done that is 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:07.839
 Internet 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:12.359
 that line can be marketed a large number of our copies 

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:15.359
 and even bring them to Colombia 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.789
 now they are also very very much in vogue hours 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.930
 in the three premises 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.029
 e for example more severe girl of 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.379
 in a long year 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.199
 of the mimo expo finca and many scenarios that are used for me, continue 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.169
 but nash of the private sector created scenarios for 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.360
 to use horses meters of the world 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.370
 many times you really think he was telling me how it is that people before calling the 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.740
 people around here that caught the attention of that other kind of unemployment 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.999
 terraceo on the subject of this 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:48.159
 they are made 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:51.379
 in different fairs like the one that was held in Medellin as the ci field 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.389
 that was used as 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.389
 platform and show york of different race of horses 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.900
 where people can appreciate 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.379
 all the skills and abilities of other races 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:02.470
 impunity 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.800
 that is not incompatible with the verses of their animals of their equines 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.800
 with our father that the Colombian 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:16.369
 serious now there is a very important thing pp handle seen that 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:20.549
 is being generated by a phenomenon or educational instuons such as 

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:23.330
 here we come here making an effort to form 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.809
 or for the most part of the quilmes center's mission 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:30.349
 because people directly do not honor a little bit beyond 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.680
 from the double san telmo countries 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.949
 Pressed Europe several summers Pri is impressive in Germany in Spain 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:41.929
 we have an idol in Argentina I get changes of all kinds and people 

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:43.419
 culture has the horse but 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:44.749
 culture 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:47.259
 global universal to another we continue to see very 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.880
 very very Creole is still very attached to tourism as it looks with stupor that 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:56.350
 only if we scratch it we are so much we already fly as from outside but 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.389
 we as one potential product made not only him 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:01.509
 decide is the technician 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.369
 a quota to guarantee trade and abroad 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:07.369
 it may be that the only way you know this ostracism 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:09.540
 equine culture 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.879
 we had 500 years in him 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:15.350
 it is precisely with the specialized schools I set off 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.710
 about the little ones we have been 500 years 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.210
 creating a horse 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.289
 who came from Spain 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.039
 but those failures never came here with the operation manual but we 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:26.759
 They carry 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:30.729
 Many schools in the world take us 4000 or 5000 years of dressage 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.380
 in a different way that does not have any way 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.089
 handling of our horse in which 

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:40.069
 all those cultures 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:43.550
 enrique is in the way that Ernesto Caballero and handle it is not incompatible 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.990
 no way 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.009
 and that will allow us suddenly at some point it will be easy not 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.330
 only is not finished national 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.840
 international level but to form an honor that 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.199
 specialized 

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:00.789
 of horses that can be used in other activities than the exhibition 

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:03.789
 equine 

00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:07.809
