that<00:01:10.630> they<00:01:10.810> wanted<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.290> do<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.770> new<00:01:12.070> kind<00:01:12.430> of

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
that they wanted to do a new kind of

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.950 
that they wanted to do a new kind of
land<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:14.140> idea<00:01:14.680> came<00:01:14.920> out<00:01:15.100> what<00:01:15.490> if<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:16.720> was

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
land so the idea came out what if it was

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.640 
land so the idea came out what if it was
like<00:01:17.140> Andy<00:01:17.770> was<00:01:18.580> playing<00:01:19.000> with<00:01:19.660> his<00:01:20.020> toys<00:01:20.320> in

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
like Andy was playing with his toys in

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.970 
like Andy was playing with his toys in
his<00:01:21.010> backyard

his backyard

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
his backyard
it<00:01:23.980> was<00:01:24.160> something<00:01:24.400> that<00:01:24.490> would<00:01:24.640> appeal<00:01:24.970> to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
it was something that would appeal to

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120 
it was something that would appeal to
guests<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.720> all<00:01:25.900> ages<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.620> a<00:01:26.650> very<00:01:26.890> broad

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
guests of all ages to a very broad

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.190 
guests of all ages to a very broad
audience<00:01:27.160> it<00:01:27.850> was<00:01:27.970> colorful<00:01:28.300> it<00:01:28.630> was<00:01:28.750> kinetic

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
audience it was colorful it was kinetic

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200 
audience it was colorful it was kinetic
it<00:01:29.380> alters<00:01:29.740> your<00:01:29.800> perception<00:01:30.400> of<00:01:30.520> scale<00:01:30.880> and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
it alters your perception of scale and

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.330 
it alters your perception of scale and
it<00:01:31.540> was<00:01:31.660> a<00:01:31.690> very<00:01:31.960> immersive<00:01:32.470> environment<00:01:33.130> that

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
it was a very immersive environment that

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.500 
it was a very immersive environment that
we<00:01:33.460> thought<00:01:33.640> would<00:01:33.790> work<00:01:33.820> really<00:01:34.060> well<00:01:34.210> for

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
we thought would work really well for

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.360 
we thought would work really well for
Hong<00:01:34.660> Kong<00:01:34.870> as<00:01:35.110> well

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.490 

there<00:01:40.970> are<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.120> lot<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.420> steps<00:01:41.690> that<00:01:42.140> take<00:01:42.320> us

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
there are a lot of steps that take us

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.560 
there are a lot of steps that take us
from<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.010> initial<00:01:43.460> concept<00:01:43.940> all<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.240> way<00:01:44.510> to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
from the initial concept all the way to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.900 
from the initial concept all the way to
opening<00:01:45.170> day<00:01:46.660> we<00:01:47.660> begin<00:01:47.960> with<00:01:48.140> sketches<00:01:48.910> begin

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
opening day we begin with sketches begin

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.610 
opening day we begin with sketches begin
to<00:01:50.060> build<00:01:50.210> scale<00:01:50.870> models<00:01:53.200> animation<00:01:54.200> models

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
to build scale models animation models

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.370 
to build scale models animation models
and<00:01:54.890> small-scale<00:01:55.460> maquettes<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.390> then<00:01:57.200> we

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
and small-scale maquettes and then we

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.400 
and small-scale maquettes and then we
built<00:01:57.620> them<00:01:57.830> in<00:01:58.010> full<00:01:58.280> size<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.990> then<00:01:59.990> we<00:02:00.260> did

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
built them in full size and then we did

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.110 
built them in full size and then we did
what's<00:02:00.590> called<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:01.040> Sketchup<00:02:01.490> model<00:02:01.820> which<00:02:01.970> is

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
what's called a Sketchup model which is

what's called a Sketchup model which is
a<00:02:02.150> 3d<00:02:02.540> computer<00:02:03.050> model<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.710> helps<00:02:04.070> us<00:02:04.250> as

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
a 3d computer model and that helps us as

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.280 
a 3d computer model and that helps us as
we<00:02:04.850> start<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.210> go<00:02:05.390> through<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.810> land<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.200> it

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
we start to go through the land and it

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.020 
we start to go through the land and it
gives<00:02:06.470> us<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.830> perspective<00:02:07.400> from<00:02:07.610> our<00:02:07.820> point

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
gives us the perspective from our point

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.120 
gives us the perspective from our point
