00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.160 
are but I started stretching my ears
when<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.549> was<00:01:59.850> 12<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.930> took<00:02:01.079> me<00:02:01.290> about<00:02:03.170> that

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
when I was 12 and it took me about that

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.459 
when I was 12 and it took me about that
was<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.409> too<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:06.329> an<00:02:06.450> eight<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.960> then

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
was just too like a to an eight and then

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.290 
was just too like a to an eight and then
I<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:07.770> started<00:02:08.190> moving<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> high

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
I actually started moving up to a high

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.770 
I actually started moving up to a high
number<00:02:10.430> when<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> was<00:02:11.760> about<00:02:12.000> 14<00:02:12.300> because<00:02:12.599> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
number when I was about 14 because it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.230 
number when I was about 14 because it
took<00:02:12.870> me<00:02:12.930> about<00:02:13.200> four<00:02:13.470> years<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.830> do

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
took me about four years to do

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.100 
took me about four years to do
this<00:02:14.330> um<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:16.370> yeah<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.750> thought<00:02:17.750> about<00:02:17.810> getting

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
this um but yeah I thought about getting

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.510 
this um but yeah I thought about getting
the<00:02:18.320> rest<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.590> my<00:02:18.650> ear<00:02:18.800> pierced<00:02:18.920> but<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.250> decided

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
the rest of my ear pierced but I decided

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.460 
the rest of my ear pierced but I decided
not<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.850> because<00:02:20.150> my<00:02:20.450> lobes<00:02:20.810> are<00:02:21.050> quite<00:02:21.290> big

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
not to because my lobes are quite big
