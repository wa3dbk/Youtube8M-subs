00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
you can see the new Miller come the arms

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.630 
you can see the new Miller come the arms
they're<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:26.840> little<00:00:27.840> nicer<00:00:28.369> but<00:00:29.369> that's<00:00:29.490> not

really the reason for the video reason
for<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> video<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:33.230> new<00:00:34.230> iconic<00:00:34.590> x<00:00:34.920> pv<00:00:35.640> frame

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
for the video is new iconic x pv frame

for the video is new iconic x pv frame
version<00:00:36.780> 2<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:38.610> folding<00:00:39.030> frame

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.710 

there<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:48.440> go

the<00:00:52.720> way<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:52.960> works<00:00:53.020> is<00:00:53.410> you<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:56.260> 22<00:00:56.770> knots

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
the way it works is you have 22 knots

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.300 
the way it works is you have 22 knots
screws<00:00:57.580> that<00:00:57.700> hold<00:00:57.850> each<00:00:58.240> arm<00:00:58.510> on<00:00:59.070> nice<00:01:00.070> and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
screws that hold each arm on nice and

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.470 
screws that hold each arm on nice and
snug<00:01:00.720> you<00:01:01.720> can<00:01:01.900> take<00:01:02.080> them<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.410> whatever

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
snug you can take them to whatever

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:19.270 
snug you can take them to whatever
attention<00:01:04.480> you<00:01:04.570> need

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
also a whole bone right down here in the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520 
also a whole bone right down here in the
middle<00:01:41.789> right<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> other<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.170> both

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
middle right to the other one on both

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.180 
middle right to the other one on both
sides<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:46.100> but<00:01:47.100> after<00:01:47.929> tightening<00:01:49.190> close

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
sides here so but after tightening close

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.070 
sides here so but after tightening close
it<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.429> open<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.909> 20<00:01:51.149> times<00:01:51.330> with<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
it and open it about 20 times with the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.050 
it and open it about 20 times with the
tension<00:01:52.409> i<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.619> now<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
tension i have now and it's not going to

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.820 
tension i have now and it's not going to
come<00:01:54.179> loose<00:01:54.560> but<00:01:55.560> as<00:01:55.709> you<00:01:55.830> can<00:01:55.950> see<00:02:00.830> it's

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
come loose but as you can see it's

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.460 
come loose but as you can see it's
foldable<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.780> i've<00:02:03.959> been<00:02:04.080> working<00:02:04.289> on<00:02:04.350> this

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
foldable so i've been working on this

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.809 
foldable so i've been working on this
for<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.679> while<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:06.479> quality<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.640> much

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
for a while the quality is so much

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.650 
for a while the quality is so much
cleaner<00:02:09.350> what<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:10.380> did<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.920> took<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:12.180> break<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
cleaner what I did was I took a break I

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.550 
cleaner what I did was I took a break I
invested<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.709> blue<00:02:13.830> CNC<00:02:14.340> machine<00:02:15.440> with<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
invested in a blue CNC machine with the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.599 
invested in a blue CNC machine with the
approval<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.069> my<00:02:17.250> wife<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:20.100> quality<00:02:20.340> got

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
approval of my wife and the quality got

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.729 
approval of my wife and the quality got
a<00:02:20.640> lot<00:02:20.790> better<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.780> my<00:02:21.989> cutting<00:02:22.290> there's<00:02:22.620> lots

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
a lot better so my cutting there's lots

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.699 
a lot better so my cutting there's lots
to<00:02:22.890> move<00:02:23.070> all<00:02:23.519> my<00:02:23.730> edges<00:02:23.880> are<00:02:24.410> really<00:02:25.410> smooth

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
to move all my edges are really smooth

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:33.259 
to move all my edges are really smooth
better<00:02:26.640> aluminum<00:02:27.090> cutting<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.739> see<00:02:32.269> the

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
better aluminum cutting you can see the

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.670 
better aluminum cutting you can see the
quality<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.170> much<00:02:34.290> nicer<00:02:36.680> probably

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
quality is just so much nicer probably

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.979 
quality is just so much nicer probably
can't<00:02:37.829> even<00:02:37.859> pick<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.549> here<00:02:38.959> some<00:02:39.959> of

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
can't even pick it up on here some of

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.780 
can't even pick it up on here some of
