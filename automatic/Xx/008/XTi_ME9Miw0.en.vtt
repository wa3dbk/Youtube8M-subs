with<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.010> consistency<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.149> really

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
with that the consistency is really

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.350 
with that the consistency is really
gooey<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:56.129> thing<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.670> about<00:00:56.879> though

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.090 
gooey the thing I do like about though
is<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> reason<00:00:58.829> why<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
is that and this is the reason why it's

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.180 
is that and this is the reason why it's
kind<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> crusty<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.800> really

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
kind of crusty and it is really a really

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.860 
kind of crusty and it is really a really
good<00:01:02.430> rough<00:01:02.640> exfoliant<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.660> could<00:01:03.840> just

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
good rough exfoliant if I could just

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.560 
good rough exfoliant if I could just
squeeze<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.530> down<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:08.479> see<00:01:09.479> how

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
squeeze a little down here see how

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.770 
squeeze a little down here see how
coolly<00:01:11.240> see<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.390> crusty<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:14.780> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
coolly see how crusty that is that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
coolly see how crusty that is that
scrapes<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.619> crap<00:01:17.040> off<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.250> face<00:01:17.610> it's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
scrapes all that crap off your face it's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.249 
scrapes all that crap off your face it's
a<00:01:18.479> good<00:01:18.659> thing<00:01:18.920> um<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.509> price<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.049> good

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
a good thing um the price is really good

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.020 
a good thing um the price is really good
I<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.650> two<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:22.860> three<00:01:23.040> bucks<00:01:23.280> at<00:01:23.580> your

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
I think it's two or three bucks at your

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
I think it's two or three bucks at your
local<00:01:24.210> CVS<00:01:24.659> don't<00:01:25.409> quote<00:01:25.650> me<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:25.979> though

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
local CVS don't quote me on this though

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.109 
local CVS don't quote me on this though
because<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:27.000> could<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.270> different<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.720> area

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
because it could be different your area

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.670 
because it could be different your area

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.580 
thicker as you can tell and it's a lot
more<00:02:23.709> find<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:26.400> exfoliator<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.430> think<00:02:28.410> as<00:02:29.410> you

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
more find a exfoliator I think as you

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.699 
more find a exfoliator I think as you
can<00:02:29.770> see<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.060> looks<00:02:31.360> like<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:32.410> lot

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
can see and it looks like it's a lot

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.910 
can see and it looks like it's a lot
more<00:02:32.739> thicker<00:02:33.959> which<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:35.140> assume<00:02:35.500> means<00:02:35.739> more

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
more thicker which I assume means more

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:45.020 
more thicker which I assume means more
moisturizing<00:02:38.610> yeah<00:02:41.310> that's<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.550> compare<00:02:43.739> I

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
moisturizing yeah that's the compare I

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.130 
moisturizing yeah that's the compare I
think<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.120> five<00:02:46.300> out<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.450> five<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.870> course

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
think that five out of five of course

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.100 
think that five out of five of course
