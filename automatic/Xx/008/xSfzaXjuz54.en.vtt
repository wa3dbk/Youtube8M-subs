zero percent of the time and because

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.439 
zero percent of the time and because
this<00:00:59.160> person<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.699> known<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.329> have

this person is not known and just have

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.020 
this person is not known and just have
to<00:01:00.539> use<00:01:00.660> default<00:01:01.140> based<00:01:01.410> assumptions<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.520> my

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
to use default based assumptions and my

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.640 
to use default based assumptions and my
base<00:01:03.210> assumption<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> six<00:01:04.470> max

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
base assumption is that in a six max

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.080 
base assumption is that in a six max
game<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.010> someone<00:01:05.220> has<00:01:05.339> position<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.909> me<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
game when someone has position on me I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
game when someone has position on me I
expect<00:01:06.510> far<00:01:07.140> fewer<00:01:07.470> folds<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.250> I

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
expect far fewer folds when I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100 
expect far fewer folds when I
continuation<00:01:08.970> bet<00:01:09.119> than<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.630> were<00:01:09.960> in

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
continuation bet than if I were in

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.710 
continuation bet than if I were in
position<00:01:10.590> myself<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.939> operating<00:01:12.390> under<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
position myself so operating under that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.210 
position myself so operating under that
assumption<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.470> shocked<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.100> end

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
assumption I'm not shocked that we end

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
assumption I'm not shocked that we end
up<00:01:14.280> getting<00:01:14.340> called<00:01:14.820> which<00:01:15.240> means<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:16.049> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
up getting called which means because I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.380 
up getting called which means because I
expect<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:17.040> continuance<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> flop<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
expect more continuance on the flop I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.960 
expect more continuance on the flop I
have<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.460> profitable<00:01:20.460> plan<00:01:20.700> for

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
have to have that profitable plan for

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.310 
have to have that profitable plan for
the<00:01:21.060> turn<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> term<00:01:22.049> we're<00:01:22.229> gonna

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the turn now on the term we're gonna

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.600 
the turn now on the term we're gonna
have<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> couple<00:01:23.070> different<00:01:23.159> things<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
have a couple different things that

happen we're gonna either hit it or

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.870 
happen we're gonna either hit it or
we're<00:01:26.040> gonna<00:01:26.130> miss<00:01:26.430> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
we're gonna miss it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.490 
we're gonna miss it
pretty<00:01:27.180> simple<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:28.140> pretty<00:01:28.409> much

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
pretty simple right that's pretty much

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.469 
pretty simple right that's pretty much
what<00:01:28.680> happens<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.250> situation<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.119> we

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
what happens in this situation and we

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.730 
what happens in this situation and we
can<00:01:30.630> already<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:30.930> ahead<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.350> say<00:01:31.470> okay

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
can already think ahead and say okay

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.080 
can already think ahead and say okay
what<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.189> gonna<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.640> each<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.970> those

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
what are we gonna do on each of those

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
what are we gonna do on each of those
cards<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.720> typically<00:01:34.439> when<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> improve<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
cards so typically when you improve you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.270 
cards so typically when you improve you
continue<00:01:35.759> betting<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> miss<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:38.100> could

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
continue betting when you miss you could

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.800 
continue betting when you miss you could
consider<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> check<00:01:38.939> raised<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.689> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
consider a check raised just so you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
consider a check raised just so you
consider<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.680> hit<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.250> well<00:01:41.400> for

consider that when you hit as well for

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.910 
consider that when you hit as well for
the<00:01:41.759> record<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.479> at<00:01:43.079> least<00:01:43.259> start<00:01:43.590> thinking

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the record but at least start thinking

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
the record but at least start thinking
about<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.280> now<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.360> what

about that now and this is really what

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.600 
about that now and this is really what

off table stuff is for is to start

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850 
off table stuff is for is to start
saying<00:01:47.850> okay<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.869> my<00:01:48.899> realistic<00:01:49.649> lines

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.010 
saying okay what are my realistic lines
I<00:01:50.040> could<00:01:50.100> take<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.479> course<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.990> I

what line should I take which line is
gonna<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.210> best<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.930> really<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.799> off

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
gonna be best this really is what off

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.450 
gonna be best this really is what off
table<00:02:02.369> study<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.820> exploration<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:03.780> about

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
table study and exploration is all about

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.550 
table study and exploration is all about
so<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.640> situation<00:02:05.880> five<00:02:06.659> bricks<00:02:07.079> off<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
so in this situation five bricks off the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.160 
so in this situation five bricks off the
turn<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:08.369> decides<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.090> double<00:02:09.629> barrel<00:02:09.899> for

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
turn here decides to double barrel for

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.500 
turn here decides to double barrel for
three<00:02:10.590> bucks<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.180> things<00:02:12.360> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
three bucks so one of the things that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.809 
three bucks so one of the things that
would<00:02:12.599> heavily<00:02:13.080> consider<00:02:13.560> it

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
would heavily consider it

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.580 
would heavily consider it
point<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.269> hand<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:15.049> for<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.349> check

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
point the hand is going for a check

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.009 
point the hand is going for a check
raised<00:02:15.799> as<00:02:16.099> opposed<00:02:16.609> to<00:02:16.939> going<00:02:17.239> for<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.659> $3

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
raised as opposed to going for the $3

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.929 
raised as opposed to going for the $3
double<00:02:18.409> barrel<00:02:18.650> not<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.340> hate<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.670> double

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
double barrel not that I hate the double

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.819 
double barrel not that I hate the double
barrel<00:02:20.060> by<00:02:20.269> any<00:02:20.420> stretch<00:02:20.689> but<00:02:20.810> let's<00:02:21.650> think

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
barrel by any stretch but let's think

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.379 
barrel by any stretch but let's think
back<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.340> flop<00:02:22.579> so<00:02:22.999> I<00:02:23.030> made<00:02:23.269> the

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:23.389 
back on the flop so I made the

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:24.819 
back on the flop so I made the
assumption<00:02:23.719> that<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.109> thought<00:02:24.469> we<00:02:24.590> were<00:02:24.680> going

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
assumption that I thought we were going

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.190 
assumption that I thought we were going
to<00:02:24.859> get<00:02:25.010> called<00:02:25.310> more<00:02:25.790> often<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.540> our

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
to get called more often and that our

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.899 
to get called more often and that our
about<00:02:27.439> it<00:02:27.560> was<00:02:27.650> gonna<00:02:27.769> take<00:02:28.010> more<00:02:28.340> hands<00:02:28.730> to

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
about it was gonna take more hands to

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.910 
about it was gonna take more hands to
the<00:02:29.090> turn<00:02:29.359> think<00:02:30.319> about<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> amount<00:02:30.799> of

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
the turn think about the amount of

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.679 
the turn think about the amount of
strong<00:02:31.340> hands<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:31.879> our<00:02:32.000> opponent<00:02:32.389> can<00:02:32.480> have

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
strong hands that our opponent can have

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.390 
strong hands that our opponent can have
they<00:02:33.290> probably<00:02:33.560> would<00:02:33.769> have<00:02:33.799> three<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.189> a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
they probably would have three that a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.250 
they probably would have three that a
Skiing<00:02:34.849> preflop<00:02:35.239> so<00:02:35.510> that's<00:02:35.689> gone<00:02:35.900> they

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
Skiing preflop so that's gone they

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.479 
Skiing preflop so that's gone they
probably<00:02:36.469> would<00:02:36.650> have<00:02:36.680> three<00:02:36.859> back<00:02:37.040> kings<00:02:37.280> and

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
probably would have three back kings and

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.789 
probably would have three back kings and
queens<00:02:37.700> preflop<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.540> that's<00:02:38.750> gone<00:02:39.019> there's

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
queens preflop so that's gone there's

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.039 
queens preflop so that's gone there's
three<00:02:40.250> combos<00:02:40.609> of<00:02:40.700> pocket<00:02:41.000> threes<00:02:41.239> if<00:02:41.569> he<00:02:41.930> has

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
three combos of pocket threes if he has

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.050 
three combos of pocket threes if he has
all<00:02:42.319> commas<00:02:42.769> of<00:02:42.859> king<00:02:43.099> queen<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:43.519> talking<00:02:43.700> nine

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
all commas of king queen or talking nine

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.809 
all commas of king queen or talking nine
combos<00:02:44.599> of<00:02:44.749> that<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.769> there<00:02:46.250> are<00:02:46.340> very<00:02:46.579> very

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
combos of that so there are very very

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.809 
combos of that so there are very very
few<00:02:47.329> monster<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.560> pair<00:02:48.769> plus<00:02:48.950> combos<00:02:49.519> in<00:02:49.700> his

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
few monster to pair plus combos in his

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.520 
few monster to pair plus combos in his
range<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.359> any<00:02:50.569> time<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:50.930> he<00:02:50.989> has<00:02:51.139> a<00:02:51.290> king

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
range in any time that he has a king

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.649 
range in any time that he has a king
it's<00:02:51.709> gonna<00:02:51.829> be<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.189> King<00:02:52.579> Jack<00:02:52.909> King<00:02:53.329> ten

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
it's gonna be like King Jack King ten

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.020 
it's gonna be like King Jack King ten
may<00:02:54.109> be<00:02:54.169> a<00:02:54.260> king<00:02:54.500> nine<00:02:54.650> suited<00:02:55.189> so<00:02:55.819> we're<00:02:55.939> not

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
may be a king nine suited so we're not

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.879 
may be a king nine suited so we're not
talking<00:02:56.269> about<00:02:56.480> like<00:02:56.629> the<00:02:57.079> strongest<00:02:57.709> of

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
talking about like the strongest of

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.280 
talking about like the strongest of
hands<00:02:58.159> possible<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:59.239> that's<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.079> really

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
hands possible and that's a really

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.959 
hands possible and that's a really
important<00:03:00.650> thing<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.829> consider<00:03:00.949> because<00:03:01.549> you

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
important thing to consider because you

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.179 
important thing to consider because you
can<00:03:02.180> have<00:03:02.359> all<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.540> those<00:03:02.810> hands<00:03:03.169> right<00:03:03.859> you

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
can have all of those hands right you

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.069 
can have all of those hands right you
open<00:03:04.519> preflop<00:03:04.969> you<00:03:05.299> continuation<00:03:05.900> of<00:03:05.989> the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
open preflop you continuation of the

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.539 
open preflop you continuation of the
flop<00:03:06.260> all<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.650> those<00:03:06.739> hands<00:03:06.980> could<00:03:07.219> possibly

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
flop all of those hands could possibly

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.399 
flop all of those hands could possibly
be<00:03:07.699> in<00:03:07.790> your<00:03:07.969> range<00:03:08.180> but<00:03:08.359> he<00:03:08.629> cannot<00:03:08.930> have<00:03:09.169> them

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
be in your range but he cannot have them

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.659 
be in your range but he cannot have them
definitely<00:03:10.010> something<00:03:10.250> important<00:03:10.609> to

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
definitely something important to

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.490 
definitely something important to
consider<00:03:10.969> and<00:03:11.719> the<00:03:11.780> other<00:03:11.930> thing<00:03:12.169> is<00:03:12.290> if<00:03:12.439> you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
consider and the other thing is if you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.689 
consider and the other thing is if you
think<00:03:12.530> about<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.949> kind<00:03:13.129> of<00:03:13.159> hands<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.519> your

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:13.699 
think about the kind of hands that your

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.330 
think about the kind of hands that your
opponent<00:03:14.060> will<00:03:14.090> call<00:03:14.359> you<00:03:14.480> with<00:03:14.659> on<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.900> flop

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
opponent will call you with on the flop

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.319 
opponent will call you with on the flop
chances<00:03:16.340> are<00:03:16.489> there's<00:03:16.730> gonna<00:03:16.790> be<00:03:16.969> two<00:03:17.150> types

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
chances are there's gonna be two types

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.390 
chances are there's gonna be two types
they're<00:03:17.750> either<00:03:17.840> gonna<00:03:18.019> be<00:03:18.199> like<00:03:18.379> paired<00:03:18.889> or

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
they're either gonna be like paired or

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.009 
they're either gonna be like paired or
they're<00:03:19.579> gonna<00:03:19.669> be<00:03:19.879> kind<00:03:20.329> of<00:03:20.419> garbagey<00:03:20.870> or

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
they're gonna be kind of garbagey or

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.589 
they're gonna be kind of garbagey or
kind<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.349> draw<00:03:21.560> e<00:03:21.590> or<00:03:21.949> more<00:03:22.909> likely<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.359> bet

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
kind of draw e or more likely to bet

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.420 
kind of draw e or more likely to bet
when<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.109> check<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.620> him<00:03:24.769> on<00:03:24.919> the<00:03:25.009> turn<00:03:25.189> right

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
when you check to him on the turn right

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.860 
when you check to him on the turn right
cuz<00:03:25.609> he's<00:03:25.729> not<00:03:25.879> gonna<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.209> call<00:03:26.449> the<00:03:26.629> flop

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
cuz he's not gonna like call the flop

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.960 
cuz he's not gonna like call the flop
with<00:03:27.049> these<00:03:27.199> 10<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.829> then<00:03:28.310> check<00:03:28.579> behind<00:03:28.849> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
with these 10 and then check behind the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.210 
with these 10 and then check behind the
turn<00:03:29.299> that<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:30.169> doesn't<00:03:30.500> fit<00:03:30.739> in<00:03:30.859> line<00:03:31.040> with

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
turn that just doesn't fit in line with

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.830 
turn that just doesn't fit in line with
what<00:03:31.370> most<00:03:31.549> people<00:03:31.790> do<00:03:31.970> they<00:03:32.180> call<00:03:32.509> the<00:03:32.629> flop

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
what most people do they call the flop

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.360 
what most people do they call the flop
so<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.139> they<00:03:33.199> can<00:03:33.349> take<00:03:33.560> away<00:03:33.799> when<00:03:34.040> someone

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
so that they can take away when someone

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.909 
so that they can take away when someone
shows<00:03:35.000> weakness<00:03:35.329> by<00:03:35.720> checking<00:03:36.199> on<00:03:36.349> future

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
shows weakness by checking on future

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.670 
shows weakness by checking on future
streets<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:38.299> I<00:03:38.329> really<00:03:38.930> like<00:03:39.109> check<00:03:39.349> racing

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
streets so I really like check racing

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.099 
streets so I really like check racing
here<00:03:39.859> I<00:03:39.889> think<00:03:40.129> you<00:03:40.220> get<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.549> bet<00:03:40.939> from<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.540> very

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
here I think you get a bet from a very

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.140 
here I think you get a bet from a very
very<00:03:42.409> very<00:03:42.680> large<00:03:43.069> part<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.519> your<00:03:43.699> opponent's

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
very very large part of your opponent's

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.670 
very very large part of your opponent's
range<00:03:44.389> and<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.019> can<00:03:45.049> apply<00:03:45.439> a<00:03:45.470> lot<00:03:45.620> of

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
range and you can apply a lot of

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.949 
range and you can apply a lot of
pressure<00:03:45.919> and<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.879> should<00:03:47.329> also<00:03:47.509> be<00:03:47.659> doing

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
pressure and you should also be doing

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.119 
pressure and you should also be doing
this<00:03:48.019> with<00:03:48.199> other<00:03:48.349> hands<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.829> shouldn't<00:03:49.099> just

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
this with other hands it shouldn't just

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.879 
this with other hands it shouldn't just
be<00:03:49.489> drawers<00:03:49.909> you<00:03:50.629> can<00:03:50.840> do<00:03:51.049> this<00:03:51.259> with<00:03:51.470> value

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
be drawers you can do this with value

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.379 
be drawers you can do this with value
type<00:03:52.099> hands<00:03:52.430> as<00:03:52.609> well<00:03:52.790> from<00:03:53.030> time<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.359> time

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
type hands as well from time to time

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.330 
type hands as well from time to time
until<00:03:53.930> your<00:03:54.079> opponent<00:03:54.199> starts<00:03:54.560> adjusting<00:03:55.189> and

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
until your opponent starts adjusting and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.129 
until your opponent starts adjusting and
then<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.579> just<00:03:55.759> readjust<00:03:56.239> it<00:03:56.449> pretty<00:03:56.840> simple

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
then you just readjust it pretty simple

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.399 
then you just readjust it pretty simple
from<00:03:57.290> there<00:03:57.609> so<00:03:58.609> another<00:03:59.569> real<00:03:59.959> quick<00:04:00.139> thing

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
from there so another real quick thing

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.990 
from there so another real quick thing
that<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.650> want<00:04:00.799> to<00:04:00.859> consider<00:04:01.009> here<00:04:01.549> is<00:04:01.759> that

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
that you want to consider here is that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.119 
that you want to consider here is that
you<00:04:02.299> have<00:04:02.329> nine<00:04:03.109> eight<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.409> hearts<00:04:03.680> which

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
you have nine eight of hearts which

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.009 
you have nine eight of hearts which
means<00:04:04.400> it's<00:04:04.669> very<00:04:05.030> unlikely<00:04:05.569> that<00:04:05.750> this

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
means it's very unlikely that this

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.330 
means it's very unlikely that this
person's<00:04:06.409> gonna<00:04:06.500> have<00:04:06.739> very<00:04:06.769> many<00:04:07.099> heart

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
person's gonna have very many heart

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.879 
person's gonna have very many heart
combos<00:04:07.759> simply<00:04:08.569> because<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.229> King<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.739> Hearts

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
combos simply because the King of Hearts

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.429 
combos simply because the King of Hearts
is<00:04:10.250> spoken<00:04:10.579> for<00:04:10.609> if<00:04:11.120> they<00:04:11.569> had<00:04:11.900> something<00:04:12.259> like

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
is spoken for if they had something like

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.039 
is spoken for if they had something like
East<00:04:12.680> ten<00:04:12.979> or<00:04:13.129> East<00:04:13.280> Jack<00:04:13.579> of<00:04:13.939> Hearts<00:04:13.969> or<00:04:14.629> Jack

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
East ten or East Jack of Hearts or Jack

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.990 
East ten or East Jack of Hearts or Jack
ten<00:04:15.349> of<00:04:15.469> Hearts<00:04:15.829> I<00:04:16.039> expect<00:04:16.699> that<00:04:16.820> that<00:04:16.849> would

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
ten of Hearts I expect that that would

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.370 
ten of Hearts I expect that that would
have<00:04:17.120> gotten<00:04:17.239> raised<00:04:17.479> on<00:04:17.659> the<00:04:17.780> flop<00:04:17.989> it's<00:04:18.199> very

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
have gotten raised on the flop it's very

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.319 
have gotten raised on the flop it's very
typical<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.799> play<00:04:18.949> those<00:04:19.159> super<00:04:19.789> draws<00:04:20.000> very

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
typical to play those super draws very

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.629 
typical to play those super draws very
aggressively<00:04:20.840> I'd<00:04:21.169> expect<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.590> face<00:04:22.340> arrays

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
aggressively I'd expect to face arrays

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.280 
aggressively I'd expect to face arrays
either<00:04:22.880> on<00:04:22.969> the<00:04:23.060> flop<00:04:23.270> or<00:04:23.419> on<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.570> turn<00:04:23.810> so

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
either on the flop or on the turn so

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.950 
either on the flop or on the turn so
if<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.440> don't<00:04:24.500> get<00:04:24.920> raised<00:04:25.550> here<00:04:25.940> or<00:04:26.240> anything

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
if I don't get raised here or anything

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.240 
if I don't get raised here or anything
like<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.230> I'm<00:04:27.590> not<00:04:27.710> assuming<00:04:27.950> that<00:04:28.160> they

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
like that I'm not assuming that they

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.710 
like that I'm not assuming that they
have<00:04:28.280> some<00:04:28.550> sort<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.880> like<00:04:29.030> monster<00:04:29.480> heart

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
have some sort of like monster heart

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.900 
have some sort of like monster heart
draw<00:04:30.160> which<00:04:31.160> means<00:04:31.430> that<00:04:31.580> they're<00:04:31.730> draw

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
draw which means that they're draw

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.630 
draw which means that they're draw
combos<00:04:32.330> are<00:04:32.420> gonna<00:04:32.510> be<00:04:32.690> like<00:04:32.900> he's<00:04:33.500> Jack<00:04:33.920> Jack

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
combos are gonna be like he's Jack Jack

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.570 
combos are gonna be like he's Jack Jack
10<00:04:35.030> Jack<00:04:35.840> 9<00:04:36.110> suited<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.650> sort<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.070> thing<00:04:37.250> so

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
10 Jack 9 suited that sort of thing so

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.680 
10 Jack 9 suited that sort of thing so
at<00:04:37.640> least<00:04:37.730> keep<00:04:37.940> those<00:04:38.090> kind<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.330> things<00:04:38.540> in

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
at least keep those kind of things in

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.390 
at least keep those kind of things in
mind<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:39.230> I<00:04:39.560> know<00:04:39.650> I'm<00:04:39.890> kind<00:04:40.070> of<00:04:40.100> going<00:04:40.250> a

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
mind and I know I'm kind of going a

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.740 
mind and I know I'm kind of going a
little<00:04:40.670> bit<00:04:40.850> further<00:04:41.060> down<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.420> rabbit<00:04:41.540> hole

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
little bit further down the rabbit hole

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.780 
little bit further down the rabbit hole
than<00:04:42.050> some<00:04:42.230> people<00:04:42.350> may<00:04:42.950> be<00:04:42.980> comfortable<00:04:43.580> with

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
than some people may be comfortable with

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.370 
than some people may be comfortable with
but<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.540> is<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.750> kind<00:04:44.900> of<00:04:44.960> stuff<00:04:45.170> that<00:04:45.320> you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
but this is the kind of stuff that you

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.900 
but this is the kind of stuff that you
should<00:04:45.530> be<00:04:45.620> thinking<00:04:45.920> about<00:04:45.980> off<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.340> table

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
should be thinking about off the table

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.370 
should be thinking about off the table
you<00:04:47.210> know<00:04:47.240> really<00:04:47.600> trying<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:47.900> get<00:04:48.050> in<00:04:48.170> there

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
you know really trying to get in there

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.110 
you know really trying to get in there
and<00:04:48.500> really<00:04:48.710> think<00:04:49.010> about<00:04:49.100> ranges<00:04:49.670> and<00:04:49.820> really

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
and really think about ranges and really

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.180 
and really think about ranges and really
think<00:04:50.330> about<00:04:50.600> what<00:04:51.380> kind<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:51.890> place<00:04:52.160> people

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
think about what kind of place people

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.430 
think about what kind of place people
are<00:04:52.520> gonna<00:04:52.670> make<00:04:52.880> when<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:53.150> check<00:04:53.420> at<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.960> vs.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
are gonna make when you check at the vs.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.620 
are gonna make when you check at the vs.
when<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.680> bet<00:04:54.890> at<00:04:55.100> them<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:56.000> another<00:04:56.450> thing

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
when you bet at them and another thing

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.020 
when you bet at them and another thing
to<00:04:56.690> consider<00:04:56.870> going<00:04:57.380> for<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.220> check<00:04:58.460> raise<00:04:58.700> is

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
to consider going for the check raise is

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.540 
to consider going for the check raise is
that<00:04:59.060> if<00:04:59.450> you<00:04:59.630> bet<00:04:59.960> here<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:00.590> don't<00:05:01.040> think<00:05:01.160> Queen

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
that if you bet here I don't think Queen

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.090 
that if you bet here I don't think Queen
X<00:05:01.760> goes<00:05:02.000> away<00:05:02.300> just<00:05:02.540> simply<00:05:03.410> because<00:05:03.710> players

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
X goes away just simply because players

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.190 
X goes away just simply because players
and<00:05:04.340> 6mx<00:05:04.670> tend<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.000> be<00:05:05.090> much<00:05:05.240> stickier<00:05:05.810> not

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
and 6mx tend to be much stickier not

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.470 
and 6mx tend to be much stickier not
even<00:05:06.740> incorrectly<00:05:07.310> they<00:05:07.970> just<00:05:08.180> tend<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.390> get

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
even incorrectly they just tend to get

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.360 
even incorrectly they just tend to get
stickier<00:05:08.960> so<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:09.290> think<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.680> if<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:09.860> bet<00:05:10.070> here

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
stickier so I think that if you bet here

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.490 
stickier so I think that if you bet here
Queen<00:05:10.790> X<00:05:11.000> is<00:05:11.180> still<00:05:11.360> continuing<00:05:12.020> because

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
Queen X is still continuing because

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.680 
Queen X is still continuing because
Queen<00:05:12.890> X<00:05:13.070> is<00:05:13.190> gonna<00:05:13.310> be<00:05:13.430> decent<00:05:14.210> right<00:05:14.600> it's

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
Queen X is gonna be decent right it's

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.050 
Queen X is gonna be decent right it's
gonna<00:05:14.810> be<00:05:14.870> like<00:05:15.080> ace<00:05:15.290> queen<00:05:15.710> or<00:05:15.980> queen<00:05:16.700> Jack

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
gonna be like ace queen or queen Jack

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.400 
gonna be like ace queen or queen Jack
and<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:17.450> sort<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.720> thing<00:05:17.900> he's<00:05:18.080> gonna<00:05:18.170> put

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
and that sort of thing he's gonna put

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.090 
and that sort of thing he's gonna put
you<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.710> test<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:19.220> show<00:05:19.250> King<00:05:20.060> X<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:21.620> don't

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
you to a test to show King X and I don't

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.100 
you to a test to show King X and I don't
know<00:05:22.280> I<00:05:22.310> think<00:05:22.700> that<00:05:22.910> if<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.210> check<00:05:23.480> raise<00:05:23.690> you

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
know I think that if you check raise you

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.420 
know I think that if you check raise you
have<00:05:24.200> a<00:05:24.260> much<00:05:24.440> higher<00:05:24.710> chance<00:05:24.770> of<00:05:25.310> getting

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
have a much higher chance of getting

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.520 
have a much higher chance of getting
Queen<00:05:25.760> X<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.090> fold<00:05:26.330> whereas<00:05:26.630> if<00:05:26.750> you<00:05:26.870> bet<00:05:27.140> here

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
Queen X to fold whereas if you bet here

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.770 
Queen X to fold whereas if you bet here
very<00:05:27.980> little<00:05:28.220> chance<00:05:28.580> of<00:05:28.790> getting<00:05:28.940> Queen<00:05:29.390> X<00:05:29.600> to

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
very little chance of getting Queen X to

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.620 
very little chance of getting Queen X to
fold<00:05:30.130> so<00:05:31.130> we<00:05:31.250> end<00:05:31.340> up<00:05:31.430> getting<00:05:31.490> called<00:05:31.820> brick

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
fold so we end up getting called brick

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.380 
fold so we end up getting called brick
on<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:33.140> river<00:05:33.530> here<00:05:34.280> decides<00:05:34.640> to<00:05:34.850> go<00:05:35.000> for<00:05:35.300> it

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
on the river here decides to go for it

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.720 
on the river here decides to go for it
again<00:05:35.450> and<00:05:36.020> again<00:05:36.560> at<00:05:36.920> this<00:05:37.070> point<00:05:37.340> I<00:05:37.580> just

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
again and again at this point I just

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.670 
again and again at this point I just
don't<00:05:38.000> think<00:05:38.300> there's<00:05:38.450> a<00:05:38.510> ton<00:05:38.870> of<00:05:38.900> draw<00:05:39.230> combos

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
don't think there's a ton of draw combos

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.770 
don't think there's a ton of draw combos
you<00:05:39.800> get<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.130> fold<00:05:40.370> there<00:05:40.850> are<00:05:41.030> a<00:05:41.210> reasonable

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
you get to fold there are a reasonable

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.560 
you get to fold there are a reasonable
amount<00:05:42.230> of<00:05:42.560> King<00:05:43.460> ax<00:05:43.670> hands<00:05:43.940> that<00:05:44.300> I<00:05:44.390> don't

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
amount of King ax hands that I don't

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.330 
amount of King ax hands that I don't
think<00:05:44.720> are<00:05:44.810> going<00:05:44.930> to<00:05:44.990> fold<00:05:45.170> queen<00:05:45.650> x<00:05:45.860> hands<00:05:46.100> I

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
think are going to fold queen x hands I

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.340 
think are going to fold queen x hands I
don't<00:05:46.610> think<00:05:46.910> are<00:05:47.030> gonna<00:05:47.150> fold<00:05:47.480> and<00:05:48.230> the

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
don't think are gonna fold and the

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.270 
don't think are gonna fold and the
reason<00:05:48.590> why<00:05:48.650> I<00:05:48.680> say<00:05:48.830> this<00:05:48.950> because<00:05:49.100> this

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
reason why I say this because this

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.920 
reason why I say this because this
person<00:05:49.610> is<00:05:49.640> an<00:05:49.760> unknown<00:05:50.120> right<00:05:50.600> it's<00:05:50.720> not<00:05:50.810> like

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
person is an unknown right it's not like

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.690 
person is an unknown right it's not like
this<00:05:51.080> person<00:05:51.290> is<00:05:51.560> an<00:05:51.680> itty<00:05:51.860> guy<00:05:52.100> who's<00:05:52.430> shown

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
this person is an itty guy who's shown

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.450 
this person is an itty guy who's shown
the<00:05:52.850> propensity<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.750> fold<00:05:54.560> to<00:05:54.800> a<00:05:54.830> decent<00:05:55.100> size

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
the propensity to fold to a decent size

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.700 
the propensity to fold to a decent size
riverbed<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.210> get<00:05:56.360> rid<00:05:56.540> of<00:05:56.570> second<00:05:57.320> pair<00:05:57.500> that

riverbed and get rid of second pair that

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.830 
riverbed and get rid of second pair that

was decent or top hair that was decent
right<00:06:00.080> I<00:06:00.320> don't<00:06:00.380> have<00:06:00.710> that<00:06:00.890> information<00:06:01.130> I

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
right I don't have that information I

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.120 
right I don't have that information I
don't<00:06:01.520> have<00:06:01.760> that<00:06:02.030> confirmation<00:06:02.680> so<00:06:03.680> because

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
don't have that confirmation so because

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.380 
don't have that confirmation so because
of<00:06:04.310> that<00:06:04.340> I'm<00:06:04.580> gonna<00:06:04.670> operate<00:06:05.030> under<00:06:05.300> the

of that I'm gonna operate under the

of that I'm gonna operate under the

to<00:06:07.250> fold<00:06:07.460> King<00:06:08.420> ax<00:06:08.600> or<00:06:08.720> Queen<00:06:09.020> X<00:06:09.200> which<00:06:09.980> means

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
to fold King ax or Queen X which means

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.220 
to fold King ax or Queen X which means
I'm<00:06:10.310> only<00:06:10.490> getting<00:06:10.790> folds<00:06:11.090> from<00:06:11.150> like<00:06:11.360> jack<00:06:11.810> 10

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
I'm only getting folds from like jack 10

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.290 
I'm only getting folds from like jack 10
and<00:06:12.800> gut<00:06:13.310> shots<00:06:13.640> and<00:06:13.820> I'm<00:06:13.880> not<00:06:14.030> even<00:06:14.150> sure

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
and gut shots and I'm not even sure

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.480 
and gut shots and I'm not even sure
gunshots<00:06:14.840> are<00:06:14.990> here<00:06:15.260> anymore<00:06:15.410> you<00:06:15.800> know<00:06:16.070> after

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
gunshots are here anymore you know after

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.150 
gunshots are here anymore you know after
they<00:06:16.970> call<00:06:17.330> the<00:06:17.480> turn<00:06:17.720> so<00:06:18.650> because<00:06:19.040> of<00:06:19.130> that

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
they call the turn so because of that

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.220 
they call the turn so because of that
we're<00:06:19.460> down<00:06:19.580> to<00:06:19.880> some<00:06:20.360> commas<00:06:20.720> of<00:06:20.810> Jack<00:06:20.990> 10

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
we're down to some commas of Jack 10

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.320 
we're down to some commas of Jack 10
that<00:06:21.380> fold<00:06:21.590> but<00:06:21.860> a<00:06:21.890> lot<00:06:22.280> of<00:06:22.310> sticky<00:06:22.790> pairs<00:06:23.030> and
