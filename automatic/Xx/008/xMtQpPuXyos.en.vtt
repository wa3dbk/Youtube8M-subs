something really important yeah
then<00:03:14.020> I<00:03:14.050> think<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.620> might<00:03:14.860> be<00:03:14.890> exempt<00:03:15.819> it's

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
then I think it might be exempt it's

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.110 
then I think it might be exempt it's
excusable<00:03:16.900> yeah<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:17.920> curriculum<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:19.090> I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
excusable yeah is that curriculum so I

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.000 
excusable yeah is that curriculum so I
think<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.540> phones<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.050> texting<00:03:20.440> will<00:03:20.860> be

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
think the phones in the texting will be

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.820 
think the phones in the texting will be
worse<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.340> hate<00:03:21.640> people<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.030> dont<00:03:22.300> reply<00:03:22.930> when
