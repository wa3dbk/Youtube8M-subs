00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
alright guys this is ballistics gel this

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.630 
alright guys this is ballistics gel this

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.270 
ballistics bullet testing it reenact
human<00:00:12.330> flesh<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.900> contains<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.009> same

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
human flesh and contains the same

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.849 
human flesh and contains the same
density<00:00:14.700> as<00:00:15.000> humans<00:00:15.900> get<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.289> literally<00:00:16.529> it's

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
density as humans get and literally it's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.099 
density as humans get and literally it's
just<00:00:17.160> jello<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.940> make<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.359> take<00:00:18.570> packs<00:00:18.900> of

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
just jello to make it you take packs of

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.090 
just jello to make it you take packs of
nox<00:00:19.350> gelatin<00:00:19.949> or<00:00:20.130> gelatin<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:22.439> ratio<00:00:22.830> is

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
nox gelatin or gelatin and the ratio is

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.720 
nox gelatin or gelatin and the ratio is
one<00:00:24.000> part<00:00:24.539> gelatin<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.410> ten<00:00:25.650> parts<00:00:26.039> water<00:00:26.279> so

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
one part gelatin to ten parts water so

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.429 
one part gelatin to ten parts water so
if<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.390> cup<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.779> gelatin<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.320> have

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
if you have one cup of gelatin you have

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.730 
if you have one cup of gelatin you have
ten<00:00:28.650> cups<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.099> water<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.910> liter<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.240> gelatin

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
ten cups of water one liter of gelatin

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.670 
ten cups of water one liter of gelatin
ten<00:00:31.740> liters<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.460> water<00:00:33.050> that's<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> ratio<00:00:34.469> one

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
ten liters of water that's the ratio one

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.470 
ten liters of water that's the ratio one
to<00:00:34.800> ten<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.270> simply

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
to ten so what you do is you simply

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.580 
to ten so what you do is you simply
spray<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.320> pan<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:38.270> container<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.750> cooking

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
spray a pan or container with cooking

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
spray a pan or container with cooking
spray<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.640> comes<00:00:41.879> out<00:00:42.059> really<00:00:42.329> easy

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
spray and then it comes out really easy

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.200 
spray and then it comes out really easy
you<00:00:42.840> let<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.620> sit<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> fridge<00:00:44.430> set

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you let it you sit it in the fridge set

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.549 
you let it you sit it in the fridge set
it<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.809> fridge<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.460> it<00:00:47.460> hardens<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.559> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it in the fridge and it hardens and it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.790 
it in the fridge and it hardens and it's
forever<00:00:49.829> playable<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.410> saturated<00:00:52.410> here

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
forever playable with and saturated here

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.770 
forever playable with and saturated here
in<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.190> early<00:00:53.789> maintains<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> shape<00:00:54.600> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
in it it early maintains the shape of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.930 
in it it early maintains the shape of
the<00:00:54.899> container<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.160> need<00:00:56.789> them

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the container as you can see need them

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.670 
the container as you can see need them
on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.059> bottom<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.199> print<00:00:58.530> on

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
on the bottom if there was like print on

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
on the bottom if there was like print on
the<00:00:58.770> container<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.399> will<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.730> printed<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.210> here

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the container it will be printed on here

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.599 
the container it will be printed on here
but<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:00.840> was<00:01:00.960> no<00:01:01.079> print<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.190> bottom<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
but there was no print on the bottom of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.000 
but there was no print on the bottom of
this<00:01:02.640> container<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.739> wouldn't<00:01:04.739> end<00:01:04.799> this

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this container that wouldn't end this

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
this container that wouldn't end this
but<00:01:05.610> there<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.909> my<00:01:06.240> gelatin<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.780> made<00:01:06.990> another

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
but there is my gelatin I made another

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.140 
but there is my gelatin I made another
mold<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> heart<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.580> I'm<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:08.909> pull

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
mold of a heart so I'm going to go pull

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.630 
mold of a heart so I'm going to go pull
that<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.409> reusable<00:01:11.010> simply

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640

I<00:02:55.019> said<00:02:55.079> it's<00:02:55.439> all<00:02:55.560> reusable<00:02:56.129> just<00:02:56.370> throw<00:02:56.549> it

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
I said it's all reusable just throw it

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.190 
I said it's all reusable just throw it
back<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.359> container<00:02:57.750> put<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.109> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
back and like container put in the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.159 
back and like container put in the
microwave<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.919> turns<00:02:59.159> back<00:02:59.340> into<00:02:59.370> liquid

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
microwave and it turns back into liquid

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:04.640 
microwave and it turns back into liquid
so<00:03:01.579> hard<00:03:02.579> gelatin<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.930> i<00:03:04.260> were<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.470> poke

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
so hard gelatin and if i were to poke

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.500 
so hard gelatin and if i were to poke
something<00:03:04.919> through<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.489> that's<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.299> same

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
something through that that's the same

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.080 
something through that that's the same
density<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:06.989> human<00:03:07.379> skin<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.310> they<00:03:08.939> usually

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
density as human skin so they usually

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:20.070 
density as human skin so they usually
they<00:03:09.419> shoot<00:03:09.689> bullets<00:03:09.900> through<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.439> stuff

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.690 

having<00:03:20.920> young<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.680> that's<00:03:23.860> gelatin<00:03:24.370> quarter

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
having young so that's gelatin quarter

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.990 
having young so that's gelatin quarter
