another web design trends video in this

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.840 
another web design trends video in this
video<00:00:04.859> we're<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.279> be<00:00:05.339> taking<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.670> look<00:00:05.790> at

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
video we're going to be taking a look at

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.610 
video we're going to be taking a look at
a<00:00:06.060> different<00:00:06.390> trend<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.870> actually<00:00:07.230> does<00:00:07.440> not

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
a different trend that actually does not

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.610 
a different trend that actually does not
involve<00:00:07.980> any<00:00:08.340> CSS<00:00:09.150> or<00:00:09.599> anything<00:00:09.780> like<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.080> it

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
involve any CSS or anything like that it

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.600 
involve any CSS or anything like that it
truly<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:12.410> solely<00:00:13.410> relying<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
truly and is solely relying on the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.269 
truly and is solely relying on the
colors<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.179> use<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:16.049> layout<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.440> choose<00:00:16.949> and

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
colors you use the layout you choose and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.880 
colors you use the layout you choose and
even<00:00:17.940> some<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.449> icons<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.230> styles<00:00:19.740> of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
even some of the icons and styles of

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580 
even some of the icons and styles of
buttons<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> use<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.779> flat

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
buttons that you use and that is flat

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.939 
buttons that you use and that is flat
design<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:25.019> been<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.500> around<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.769> lot

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
design now it's been going around a lot

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.740 
design now it's been going around a lot
it's<00:00:26.130> been<00:00:26.310> getting<00:00:26.460> really<00:00:27.240> really<00:00:27.449> big

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
it's been getting really really big

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.109 
it's been getting really really big
especially<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.470> app<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:29.250> operating

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
especially with app with operating

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.299 
especially with app with operating
systems<00:00:30.210> such<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.660> Android<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.650> even<00:00:31.949> now<00:00:32.070> iOS

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
systems such as Android and even now iOS

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.660 
systems such as Android and even now iOS
7<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.329> even<00:00:33.780> Windows<00:00:34.200> Metro<00:00:34.770> UI<00:00:34.950> has<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
7 and even Windows Metro UI has it a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.479 
7 and even Windows Metro UI has it a
little<00:00:35.880> bit<00:00:36.440> it's<00:00:37.440> becoming<00:00:37.770> pretty<00:00:38.070> big<00:00:38.280> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
little bit it's becoming pretty big I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
little bit it's becoming pretty big I
think<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.120> looks<00:00:39.300> pretty<00:00:39.510> good<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.899> done<00:00:40.469> right

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
think it looks pretty good if done right

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.979 
think it looks pretty good if done right
so<00:00:41.489> today<00:00:41.879> we're<00:00:42.210> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> talk<00:00:42.600> about<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
so today we're going to talk about it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
so today we're going to talk about it
I'm<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.230> give<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.440> guys<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.860> examples

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
I'm going to give you guys some examples

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.360 
I'm going to give you guys some examples
of<00:00:44.550> great<00:00:44.940> flat<00:00:45.629> design<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.289> we're<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
of great flat design and we're going to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
of great flat design and we're going to
go<00:00:47.489> over<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:48.270> exactly<00:00:48.780> makes<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.110> good<00:00:49.260> flat

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
go over what exactly makes a good flat

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.810 
go over what exactly makes a good flat
design<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> biggest<00:00:51.149> thing<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.629> probably

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
design so the biggest thing is probably

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
design so the biggest thing is probably
the<00:00:53.820> color<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.989> layout<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:55.920> say

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the color or the layout I would say

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.950 
the color or the layout I would say
probably<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> layout<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.780> times

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
probably the layout a lot of times

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.529 
probably the layout a lot of times
you'll<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.910> navigation<00:00:59.910> bar<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> header

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
you'll see a navigation bar or a header

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.090 
you'll see a navigation bar or a header
bar<00:01:00.780> that's<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.170> section<00:01:01.559> right<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.829> here

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
bar that's this section right up here

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.820 
bar that's this section right up here
that<00:01:02.280> goes<00:01:02.719> all<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> way<00:01:04.170> through<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that goes all the way through it's the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.560 
that goes all the way through it's the
same<00:01:05.040> color<00:01:05.280> throughout<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.060> can't<00:01:06.330> really

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
same color throughout you can't really

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
same color throughout you can't really
tell<00:01:06.840> where<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.140> ends<00:01:07.530> except<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.220> fact

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
tell where it ends except for the fact

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.670 
tell where it ends except for the fact
that<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> content<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.900> only<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that the content in it is only in a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.429 
that the content in it is only in a
given<00:01:11.520> point<00:01:11.729> other<00:01:12.450> than<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.200> looks<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
given point other than that it looks the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
given point other than that it looks the
same<00:01:13.680> throughout<00:01:14.040> next<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.060> may<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
same throughout next you may have a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
same throughout next you may have a
different<00:01:15.630> color<00:01:15.780> such<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
different color such as this and if you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
different color such as this and if you
scroll<00:01:17.400> through<00:01:17.509> there's<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.689> different

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
scroll through there's some different

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
scroll through there's some different
things<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:20.400> cool<00:01:20.640> animations<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
things here some cool animations and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.230 
things here some cool animations and
whatnot<00:01:21.920> which<00:01:22.920> only<00:01:23.100> add<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
whatnot which only add to the to the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
whatnot which only add to the to the
design<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.259> uh<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:26.360> whatnot<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.400> even

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
design in and uh and whatnot and even

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.300 
design in and uh and whatnot and even
these<00:01:29.490> buttons<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.119> aren't<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:31.020> know

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
these buttons here aren't just you know

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
these buttons here aren't just you know
really<00:01:32.310> crazy<00:01:32.729> design<00:01:33.180> errors<00:01:33.570> they're<00:01:33.840> just

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
really crazy design errors they're just

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.080 
really crazy design errors they're just
arrows<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:35.040> different<00:01:35.400> colors<00:01:35.790> than<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
arrows with different colors than the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.390 
arrows with different colors than the
background<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.740> makes<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.100> flat

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
background and that's what makes it flat

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.020 
background and that's what makes it flat
and<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:39.390> eye<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:40.220> easily<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and your eye is really easily it can you

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.550 
and your eye is really easily it can you
can<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.329> differentiate<00:01:43.049> between<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
can really differentiate between the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.639 
can really differentiate between the
hierarchy<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.220> things<00:01:44.579> with<00:01:45.090> colors<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> with

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
hierarchy of things with colors and with

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.240 
hierarchy of things with colors and with
you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.100> how<00:01:47.399> big<00:01:47.700> things<00:01:47.970> are<00:01:48.149> for<00:01:48.420> example

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
you know how big things are for example

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.859 
you know how big things are for example
this<00:01:50.250> sign<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.909> pretty<00:01:51.119> big<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.570> here

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
this sign in is pretty big up here

so<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:14.780> some<00:02:14.900> examples<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.590> stuff<00:02:15.860> obviously

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
so just some examples of stuff obviously

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.729 
so just some examples of stuff obviously
some<00:02:16.940> core<00:02:17.180> animations<00:02:17.660> with<00:02:17.870> which<00:02:18.410> just

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
some core animations with which just

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.100 
some core animations with which just
helped<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.980> design<00:02:19.190> next<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.180> foundation<00:02:20.390> now

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
helped to design next is foundation now

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.240 
helped to design next is foundation now
this<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:22.720> actually<00:02:23.739> foundation<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:24.890> a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
this is actually foundation is a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.780 
this is actually foundation is a
framework<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:26.560> web<00:02:27.560> development<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.220> it's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
framework for web development and it's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.759 
framework for web development and it's
centered<00:02:29.180> around<00:02:29.300> mobile<00:02:29.780> development<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
centered around mobile development and

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.100 
centered around mobile development and
whatnot<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.580> they<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.269> great<00:02:32.840> looking

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
whatnot and they have a great looking

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.720 
whatnot and they have a great looking
website<00:02:33.170> here<00:02:34.269> starting<00:02:35.269> off<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.750> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
website here starting off with the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.710 
website here starting off with the
navigation<00:02:37.730> bar<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.209> same<00:02:38.480> color

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
navigation bar that is the same color

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.130 
navigation bar that is the same color
throughout<00:02:38.930> as<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.290> mentioned<00:02:40.069> before<00:02:40.160> and

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
throughout as I mentioned before and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.479 
throughout as I mentioned before and
then<00:02:42.140> going<00:02:42.500> into<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.680> different<00:02:43.040> color<00:02:43.220> an

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
then going into a different color an

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.430 
then going into a different color an
image<00:02:44.209> which<00:02:44.450> doesn't<00:02:44.870> really<00:02:45.200> let's<00:02:45.380> be

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
image which doesn't really let's be

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.229 
image which doesn't really let's be
honest<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.860> really<00:02:45.890> does<00:02:46.310> not<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.730> much

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
honest it really does not have that much

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.630 
honest it really does not have that much
depth<00:02:47.599> -<00:02:47.810> other<00:02:48.049> than<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.290> fact<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.769> parts

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
depth - other than the fact that parts

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.130 
depth - other than the fact that parts
of<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.849> are<00:02:50.000> different<00:02:50.360> colors<00:02:50.660> which<00:02:50.870> make<00:02:50.900> it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
of it are different colors which make it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.900 
of it are different colors which make it
appear<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.920> more<00:02:52.190> depth<00:02:52.459> than<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.730> really

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
appear to have more depth than it really

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.949 
appear to have more depth than it really
does<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.400> that's<00:02:56.239> that's<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:58.090> next<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.269> this

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
does so that's that's that next is this

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.809 
does so that's that's that next is this
this<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.290> developer<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.950> believe<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.670> a

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
this is a developer I believe this is a

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.569 
this is a developer I believe this is a
web<00:03:02.150> development<00:03:02.630> web<00:03:03.260> design<00:03:03.590> company<00:03:04.250> or

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
web development web design company or

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.220 
web development web design company or
studio<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.390> this<00:03:05.690> is<00:03:05.780> another<00:03:05.930> great<00:03:06.140> example

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
studio and this is another great example

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.759 
studio and this is another great example
of<00:03:06.739> some<00:03:06.920> flat<00:03:07.220> design<00:03:08.349> they've<00:03:09.349> really<00:03:09.650> done

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
of some flat design they've really done

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.740 
of some flat design they've really done
the<00:03:09.890> same<00:03:10.069> thing<00:03:10.310> white<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.790> think<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.150> lot<00:03:11.599> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
the same thing white I think a lot of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.039 
the same thing white I think a lot of
white<00:03:11.989> space<00:03:12.319> open<00:03:12.920> space<00:03:13.450> clean<00:03:14.450> simple

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
white space open space clean simple

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.349 
white space open space clean simple
minimalistic<00:03:15.560> design<00:03:15.829> also<00:03:16.430> goes<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:16.910> long<00:03:17.150> way

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
minimalistic design also goes a long way

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.460 
minimalistic design also goes a long way
with<00:03:17.510> flat<00:03:17.750> design<00:03:18.079> this<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:20.470> store

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
with flat design this is a store

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.069 
with flat design this is a store
obviously<00:03:22.150> seeing<00:03:23.150> by<00:03:23.329> they're<00:03:23.720> selling

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
obviously seeing by they're selling

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.160 
obviously seeing by they're selling
things<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:25.239> really<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.569> one<00:03:26.720> thing<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.019> can

corners<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.660> lot<00:03:51.109> of<00:03:51.760> 90-degree<00:03:52.760> angles<00:03:53.150> and

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
corners a lot of 90-degree angles and

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.559 
corners a lot of 90-degree angles and
whatnot<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:54.370> next<00:03:55.370> is<00:03:55.519> actually<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.480> think

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
whatnot and next is actually I think

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.809 
whatnot and next is actually I think
something<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.290> we<00:03:57.349> all<00:03:57.560> know<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.519> don't

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
something that we all know and I don't

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.370 
something that we all know and I don't
remember<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.450> website<00:03:59.630> looking<00:04:00.079> like<00:04:00.230> this

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
remember the website looking like this

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.720 
remember the website looking like this
but<00:04:00.620> clearly<00:04:00.709> they've<00:04:01.010> done<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.190> really<00:04:01.519> good

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
but clearly they've done a really good

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.879 
but clearly they've done a really good
job<00:04:01.790> with<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.660> that<00:04:02.750> is<00:04:02.810> Microsoft<00:04:03.470> the

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
job with it and that is Microsoft the

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.129 
job with it and that is Microsoft the
