00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
thing is a thing called instability if

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.879 
thing is a thing called instability if
she<00:03:31.310> can<00:03:31.430> handle<00:03:31.639> it<00:03:31.819> as<00:03:31.910> well<00:03:32.530> did<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.620> notice

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
she can handle it as well did you notice

she can handle it as well did you notice
the<00:03:33.980> difference<00:03:34.340> in<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.519> way<00:03:34.609> she<00:03:34.760> stepped

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
the difference in the way she stepped

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.710 
the difference in the way she stepped
back<00:03:35.120> all<00:03:35.450> right<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:37.160> up<00:03:38.739> okay

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.839

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
how much partner is that than it should

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:57.059 
how much partner is that than it should
be<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.900> reason<00:03:56.260> I'm<00:03:56.380> telling<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.770> guys

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
be so the reason I'm telling you guys

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.520 
be so the reason I'm telling you guys
for<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.430> holding<00:03:57.910> trainer<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.660> what<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.349> can

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
for the holding trainer is what you can

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.559 
for the holding trainer is what you can
do<00:03:59.680> harder<00:04:00.370> than<00:04:00.519> you<00:04:00.700> thought

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
do harder than you thought

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.690 
do harder than you thought
so<00:04:02.290> what<00:04:02.440> happens<00:04:02.830> is<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.099> you're<00:04:03.250> only<00:04:03.370> adding

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
so what happens is is you're only adding

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.000 
so what happens is is you're only adding
you're<00:04:04.060> adding<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.390> very<00:04:04.660> light<00:04:05.110> load<00:04:05.560> but

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
you're adding a very light load but

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.729 
you're adding a very light load but
because<00:04:06.849> of<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.060> instability<00:04:07.480> all<00:04:08.440> that

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
because of the instability all that

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.740 
because of the instability all that
stuff<00:04:09.099> is<00:04:09.280> going<00:04:09.459> on<00:04:09.730> every<00:04:10.060> time<00:04:10.269> you<00:04:10.360> move<00:04:10.540> up

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
stuff is going on every time you move up

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.500
