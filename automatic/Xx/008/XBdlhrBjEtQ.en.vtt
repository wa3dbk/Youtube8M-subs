00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.309
 so I think it went well 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.050
 for us obviously we were a little 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.720
 behind the whole game but like everything 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.400
 the world was waiting for him where everyone 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.140
 think and we were going to have a little trouble 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.540
 at first, but of course we knew 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.820
 handle this early game after miami has a 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.950
 little pushed they have they they have we 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.529
 surprises took the advantage over everything 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.540
 and but the most important thing is 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.780
 either when they stayed together 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.280
 continued to play our game and that's it 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.059
 in the end it's the little details that and 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.059
 who ended up paying 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.120
 yes it's sure tony knew how to take his 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.780
 responsibilities as he did everything 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.839
 throughout the year 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.210
 after as I say we knew we knew 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.670
 stay together defensively we knew 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.949
 keep them creating problems 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.500
 and here we have we have taken 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:13.380
 the advantage we have kept a cool head 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:13.380
 and manage possessions talk 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.070
 I think they explain what it takes 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.400
 do on on the last defense do 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.770
 watch out for mistakes 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.740
 and here we stand before the players and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.740
 not leave to not let the shooters 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.570
 open is something that makes it 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.100
 during the season as well or sometimes he has 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.580
 he has some details to give to any 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.930
 team 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.640
 he will take the place of the coach for 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:44.040
 although everyone is either 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.600
 focused given the instructions yes after 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.280
 really take the place of the coach and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.590
 explain what to do not but 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.960
 here in san antonio we know that everything 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.060
 end leaders especially have the right to 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.110
 speech at a certain moment so here is this 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:04.740
 that they know what they have to do 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:06.630
 they do it yes for sure he has he has 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.550
 developed a new status since the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.229
 last years and this year it's 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.590
 really exceptional in everything he 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.459
 done after that around him there is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.770
 also players who listen and even if 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.300
 tim duncan and discreet he has all the time 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.720
 his word to say so here they do they 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.720
 do the right thing 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.080
 I think we have to play our game 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.960
 must continue to defend as we have a 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.850
 great especially that we know that in my opinion 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.950
 especially it's lebron james who will 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.600
 take on more responsibilities but 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 here we did it on the first 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.570
 match defend together it takes 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.990
 continue on it and after unroll 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.990
 our game in attack
