 then I will come here in the garage and that 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.150
 garage you will need a vacancy 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.760
 empty right 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.510
 O has an empty variant will take care of 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.180
 an empty space and also a bicycle 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:59.560
 So let's get the bike here and 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:01.390
 let's leave the garage that easy you 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.500
 will have to do you have to stop the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.260
 bike 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.690
 if you do another garage will have 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.260
 who work with the car a vehicle of the 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.630
 take the garage in here is just you 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.730
 put the bike 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:25.390
 here in the corner with a touch would tighten 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:27.160
 will teleport right then it 's the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.590
 following will now need a 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.350
 street vehicle 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.270
 I took this car from the street you 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.630
 going to do with this car you will 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.860
 position it in front of the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.530
 your garage 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.540
 leaning against the gate only before that 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.070
 open the cell phone goes here in the list 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.340
 service leaves the service list open 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.780
 and position the car in front of the gate 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.150
 from the garage 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.580
 if you do not do what you do 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.489
 will end up getting in with the car straight away 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.110
 in your garage in the vacancy that is empty 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.209
 so it is important to do this in the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:10.290
 cell phone goes down and now 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.810
 You're going to shoot the street car engine. 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.090
 until it starts to catch fire when it gets 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.420
 without looking at the open door and 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.489
