00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.040
 here we have a control circuit 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.860
 level that can be used in a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.280
 Water pump itself is based 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.440
 fundamentally in a logic circuit 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.389
 consisting of two integrated circuits 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.410
 4011 which contain floodgates 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.850
 logical 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.340
 we also have a relay which is 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.980
 powered by a transistor or is this 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.320
 is the classic transistor output that already 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.480
 we have seen in other circuits that is the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.390
 logical block what it does is strain 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.430
 been the base of the transistor putting it 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.410
 in saturation or making the farc 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.660
 as a closed switch and through the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.850
 transistor let's say current to the coil 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.330
 of the relay through the contacts of the 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.900
 relay 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.540
 at the same time we operate a 220 motor 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.130
 volts that is simulating being the engine 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.290
 of the water pump 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.150
 here we have a set of electrodes that 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.350
 would be the ones that go in the top tank 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.970
 they are called the longest electrode mass 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.190
 inferior the one that denominates the minimum level 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.380
 of which forgiveness determines the minimum level 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.000
 of the tank and upper electrodes that 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.830
 determines the maximum level of the tank 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.280
 we are going to introduce in a container with 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.970
 water and when the water touches the electrode 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.310
 higher 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.020
 the pump is going to have to turn off and 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.729
 when the water stops touching the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.920
 lower electrode the pump is going to have 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.720
 have to start in such a way that the tank 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.600
 it's never going to overflow and it's not going to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.520
 let the water in this tank pass 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.800
 below the lower level that is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.290
 determined by this electro in turn 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.850
 this circuit has the security of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.590
 that if there is no water in the lower tank 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 from where water comes into the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.690
 top tank does not work either 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.399
 that we have to find a bridge that 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.380
 is simulating the union between a 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.450
 March electrode and an electrode 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.800
 bottom located in the tank below 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.110
 of the building where they are in their 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.530
 dreams so that we would raise this 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.990
 bridge 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.490
 that would do the simulation like no 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.480
 there is water in the lower tank and so 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.700
 both the pump would not work either 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.890
 to leave connected let's go to the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.440
 12 volt power and as well 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.490
 is connected to the 220 the motor 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.490
 should start 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.250
 starts the engine activates relaxes the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.870
 motor turns on with LEDs that are 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.540
 signaling that the biker in 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.000
 working and now we're going to place 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.890
 the electrodes in a container with water 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.090
 which simulates access to pond superior 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.220
 of the building 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.140
 here when the water touches the electrode 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.910
 top the pump has to be turned off 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.700
 we produce the electrodes in a 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.170
 container on the dais of dough touches 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.660
 the lower one and nothing happens and when 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.310
 touch the top 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.510
 and that means that the tank is 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.280
 it filled therefore it shuts off 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.470
 automatically the board 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.320
 then the water level in the tank 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.000
 I should go down here stop touching the 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.010
 upper electrode but the pump still 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.230
 does not start and when I stop playing the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.140
 lower liter then if the pump is going to 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.940
 start there see that the water stops 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.190
 touch the lower electro and the pump will 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.870
 puts it back into operation now 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.130
 let's see what would happen if in the tank 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.390
 below that is where the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.640
 water will be just without water 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.010
 for this we are going to disconnect this 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.360
 bridge that simulates the contact that makes 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.350
 the water between the March electro and a 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.060
 bottom located in the tank below 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.180
 Now what we are going to do is that 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.650
 turn off let's see and good 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.830
 missing water in the tank interest 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.110
 top of the canyon there are the 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.240
 three electrodes under water 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.700
 Stop dipping the top one and when you leave 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.630
 to show the lower 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.010
 does not start the pump because it is 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.050
 missing water in the tank below and 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.400
 therefore does not allow the pump 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.400
 run empty 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.260
 Yes Yes
