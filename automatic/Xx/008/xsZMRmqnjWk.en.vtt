teams make a very difficulty this we
contain<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> safety<00:00:29.490> too<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.910> we'll<00:00:30.599> go<00:00:30.750> by

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
contain the safety too so we'll go by

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.870 
contain the safety too so we'll go by
the<00:00:30.960> bay<00:00:31.199> from<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.250> our<00:00:32.369> decision<00:00:32.759> there

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the bay from and make our decision there

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
the bay from and make our decision there
is<00:00:33.000> another<00:00:33.180> spot<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.050> really

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
is another spot that we have to really

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.280 
is another spot that we have to really
focus<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.130> feel<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.210> you've<00:00:36.329> seen<00:00:36.600> enough<00:00:36.899> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290

know everything you know about these

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.030 
know everything you know about these
guys<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> decision-making<00:00:40.559> theory<00:00:40.860> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
guys going to decision-making theory I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.470 
guys going to decision-making theory I
think<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.520> think<00:00:41.579> guys<00:00:42.000> had<00:00:42.210> ample

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
think so I think guys had ample

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.760 
think so I think guys had ample
opportunity<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:43.110> show<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.530> do

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
opportunity to show what they can do

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.290 
opportunity to show what they can do
that's<00:00:43.980> what's<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.370> preseason<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that's what's a preseason about the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.240 
that's what's a preseason about the
practices<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.649> worked<00:00:46.800> harder<00:00:47.070> for

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
practices we really worked harder for

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.529 
practices we really worked harder for
young<00:00:47.340> guys<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.700> try<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> get<00:00:48.059> ready<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> place

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
young guys to try to get ready to place

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
young guys to try to get ready to place
when<00:00:48.809> our<00:00:48.899> number<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.200> work<00:00:49.320> folder<00:00:49.710> prepared

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that's not like they were I think

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.990

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
everybody had a chance to touch the ball

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.270 
everybody had a chance to touch the ball
on<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.239> constants<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.899> defensively<00:00:55.829> guy<00:00:56.070> was

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
on all constants and defensively guy was

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.470 
on all constants and defensively guy was
lying<00:00:56.520> around<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.850> making<00:00:56.969> plays<00:00:57.210> without

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
lying around and making plays without

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.420

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
ample opportunity so if they can do so

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.950 
ample opportunity so if they can do so
