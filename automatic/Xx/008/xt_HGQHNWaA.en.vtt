yes<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.450> this<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.690> move<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.230> referenced

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
yes so this is a move that I referenced

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.510 
yes so this is a move that I referenced
last<00:00:14.099> year<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.700> my<00:00:15.030> linear<00:00:15.420> extensions

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
last year in my linear extensions

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.900 
last year in my linear extensions
tutorial<00:00:17.520> here<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:18.150> YouTube<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.910> basically

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
tutorial here on YouTube and I basically

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.759 
tutorial here on YouTube and I basically
stated<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.779> was<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.960> way<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.289> solving<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
stated that it was a way of solving the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.590 
stated that it was a way of solving the
problem<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.369> doing<00:00:23.789> split<00:00:24.090> time<00:00:24.300> same

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
problem of doing split time same

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.839 
problem of doing split time same
direction<00:00:24.869> anti-spin<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:26.099> wall<00:00:26.580> plane

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
direction anti-spin in wall plane

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.210 
direction anti-spin in wall plane
because<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.960> tend<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.500> issue<00:00:28.710> where

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
because we tend to have this issue where

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.669 
because we tend to have this issue where
our<00:00:29.670> hands<00:00:29.939> will<00:00:30.090> run<00:00:30.269> into<00:00:30.539> each<00:00:30.660> other<00:00:30.900> in

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
our hands will run into each other in

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.280 
our hands will run into each other in
wall<00:00:31.949> plane<00:00:32.189> mainly<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.960> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
wall plane mainly because we have a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.430 
wall plane mainly because we have a
vertical<00:00:34.739> body<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:36.290> essentially<00:00:37.290> doesn't

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
vertical body that essentially doesn't

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.229 
vertical body that essentially doesn't
allow<00:00:37.710> us<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.010> flip<00:00:38.280> over<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> process<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
allow us to flip over in the process of

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.869 
allow us to flip over in the process of
doing<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.280> wanted<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> give<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
doing this so what I wanted to give you

doing this so what I wanted to give you
guys<00:00:41.910> today<00:00:42.270> was<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.750> tutorial<00:00:43.050> on

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
guys today was actually a tutorial on

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.190 
guys today was actually a tutorial on
how<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.590> make<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.160> happen<00:00:44.690> which<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:46.020> you've

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
how to make this happen which if you've

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.279 
how to make this happen which if you've
done<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.890> previous<00:00:47.280> tutorial<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:49.079> lanes

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
done the previous tutorial on the lanes

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.709 
done the previous tutorial on the lanes
of<00:00:49.530> poi<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.640> idea<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.329> being<00:00:51.570> able

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
of poi that is this idea of being able

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.139 
of poi that is this idea of being able
to<00:00:51.870> keep<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> poor<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.760> consistent

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
to keep the poor going in a consistent

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
to keep the poor going in a consistent
timing<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.960> direction<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.219> your

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
timing and direction with one of your

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.060 
timing and direction with one of your
poi<00:00:56.520> closer<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> body<00:00:57.420> than<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> other

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
poi closer to the body than the other

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.010 
poi closer to the body than the other
congratulations<00:00:59.070> you've<00:00:59.309> already<00:00:59.460> done

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
congratulations you've already done

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.029 
congratulations you've already done
probably<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> quarter<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> third<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
probably a quarter to a third of the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
probably a quarter to a third of the
work<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.910> making<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.239> particular<00:01:03.480> flower

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
work for making this particular flower

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.730 
work for making this particular flower
happen<00:01:04.439> here's<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> rest<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.740> my

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
happen here's the rest of it now my

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
happen here's the rest of it now my
dominant<00:01:08.130> direction<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.850> clockwise<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
dominant direction is clockwise so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.560 
dominant direction is clockwise so
that's<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.820> way<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> give

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's kind of the way I'm going to give

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.640 
that's kind of the way I'm going to give
these<00:01:12.720> instructions<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.380> your<00:01:13.500> dominant

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
these instructions if your dominant

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.399 
these instructions if your dominant
Direction<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.220> counterclockwise<00:01:15.409> simply

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
Direction is counterclockwise simply

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.469 
Direction is counterclockwise simply
substitute<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.400> word<00:01:17.580> clockwise<00:01:18.180> every

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
substitute in the word clockwise every

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.600 
substitute in the word clockwise every
time<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> say<00:01:18.900> counterclockwise<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.890> vice

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
time I say counterclockwise and vice

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.100 
time I say counterclockwise and vice
versa<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.270> basically<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.720> same<00:01:21.900> set

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
versa and you basically get the same set

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.740 
versa and you basically get the same set
of<00:01:22.140> instructions<00:01:22.820> anyhow<00:01:23.820> let's<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.479> rolling

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
of instructions anyhow let's get rolling

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.380 
of instructions anyhow let's get rolling
with<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> shall<00:01:25.110> we

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
with it shall we

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.730 
with it shall we
so<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.960> first<00:01:28.140> place<00:01:28.320> you're<00:01:28.439> gonna<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
so the first place you're gonna want to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.249 
so the first place you're gonna want to
start<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:30.030> place<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.810> right

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
drilled this in the video on the lanes

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
drilled this in the video on the lanes
of<00:01:37.140> POI<00:01:37.439> now<00:01:38.100> how<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> get<00:01:38.729> out

of this awful and uncomfortable position

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.319 
of this awful and uncomfortable position
because<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> kind<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> pain<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.210> the

bottom<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.640> your<00:01:59.729> right<00:01:59.909> hand<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.270> top<00:02:00.600> now

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
bottom and your right hand on top now

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.539 
bottom and your right hand on top now
and<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:02.159> great<00:02:02.250> thing<00:02:02.520> about<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.240> that

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
and the great thing about this is that

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.130 
and the great thing about this is that
you've<00:02:05.549> already<00:02:05.909> drilled<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.390> position<00:02:06.869> too

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you've already drilled this position too

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.619 
you've already drilled this position too
it's<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.920> matter<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.280> getting<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.479> in

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
it's just a matter of getting to it in

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.360 
it's just a matter of getting to it in
such<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> way<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.649> feel<00:02:10.920> stable

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
such a way that you can feel stable

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.590 
such a way that you can feel stable
there<00:02:11.760> when<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
there when you

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.300 
there when you
unfortunately<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> next<00:02:14.830> part<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.250> is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
unfortunately the next part of this is

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.760 
unfortunately the next part of this is
not<00:02:15.580> going<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.850> be<00:02:15.910> nearly<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.480> easy<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:17.530> it's

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
not going to be nearly so easy but it's

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.290 
not going to be nearly so easy but it's
essentially<00:02:18.220> going<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.550> involve<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.180> you're

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
essentially going to involve it you're

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.600 
essentially going to involve it you're
going<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.690> prop<00:02:19.960> your<00:02:20.140> left<00:02:20.410> hand<00:02:20.650> up<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.190> your

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
going to prop your left hand up and your

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.250 
going to prop your left hand up and your
right<00:02:21.640> hand<00:02:21.850> down<00:02:22.300> along<00:02:22.750> your<00:02:22.900> center<00:02:23.230> line

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
right hand down along your center line

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.490 
right hand down along your center line
and<00:02:23.910> then<00:02:24.910> splay<00:02:25.690> your<00:02:25.720> arms<00:02:26.050> straight<00:02:26.320> out<00:02:26.380> to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
and then splay your arms straight out to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.450 
and then splay your arms straight out to
the<00:02:26.710> sides<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.900> bring<00:02:29.230> right<00:02:30.040> arm<00:02:30.220> up

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
the sides and then bring right arm up

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.300 
the sides and then bring right arm up
left<00:02:30.880> arm<00:02:31.060> down<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:31.650> return<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.920> position

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
left arm down and return to the position

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.950 
left arm down and return to the position
that<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.520> started<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.300> your<00:02:34.600> right<00:02:34.810> hand

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
that we started in with your right hand

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.950 
that we started in with your right hand
on<00:02:35.170> top<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.650> your<00:02:35.740> left<00:02:35.920> hand<00:02:36.070> on<00:02:36.160> bottom<00:02:36.460> yeah

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
on top and your left hand on bottom yeah

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.000 
on top and your left hand on bottom yeah
okay<00:02:37.960> so<00:02:38.620> from<00:02:39.160> here<00:02:39.460> we<00:02:39.640> know<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.000> we<00:02:40.120> can

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
okay so from here we know that we can

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.950 
okay so from here we know that we can
reset<00:02:42.010> just<00:02:42.310> like<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.120> what<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.720> want<00:02:43.900> you

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
reset just like that and what I want you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.900 
reset just like that and what I want you
to<00:02:44.050> practice<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.680> going<00:02:45.040> four<00:02:45.490> beats<00:02:45.700> along

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
to practice is going four beats along

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.340 
to practice is going four beats along
each<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.150> those<00:02:46.240> positions<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.840> four<00:02:47.830> left<00:02:48.070> top

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
each of those positions so four left top

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.370 
each of those positions so four left top
four<00:02:50.350> left<00:02:50.620> left

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
four left left

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.290 
four left left
four<00:02:53.380> left<00:02:53.590> bottom<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:56.130> four<00:02:57.130> beats<00:02:57.400> with<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
four left bottom and four beats with the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.790 
four left bottom and four beats with the
left<00:02:58.600> over<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.020> right<00:02:59.170> hand<00:02:59.320> side<00:02:59.470> yeah

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
left over on the right hand side yeah

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.360 
left over on the right hand side yeah
and<00:03:00.070> then<00:03:00.970> we<00:03:01.150> reset<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.380> then<00:03:03.010> try<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.250> with

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
and then we reset and then try it with

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:12.120 
and then we reset and then try it with
three<00:03:03.520> beats<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.060> 3<00:03:04.930> 2<00:03:05.410> 1<00:03:06.040> 3<00:03:06.310> 2<00:03:07.050> 1<00:03:08.050> 3<00:03:08.400> 2<00:03:09.400> 1<00:03:09.780> 3<00:03:10.780> 2<00:03:11.050> 1

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
three beats so 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.070 
three beats so 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1
rewind<00:03:12.880> cool<00:03:13.840> now<00:03:14.710> if<00:03:14.980> you've<00:03:15.280> got<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.730> down

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
rewind cool now if you've got that down

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
1 2 1 2 and reset okay if all of that

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.140 
1 2 1 2 and reset okay if all of that
feels<00:03:26.590> relatively<00:03:26.980> comfortable<00:03:27.370> now<00:03:28.000> it's

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
feels relatively comfortable now it's

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.400 
feels relatively comfortable now it's
time<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.390> do<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.600> harder<00:03:28.900> work<00:03:29.020> which<00:03:29.260> is

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
time to do the harder work which is

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.699 
time to do the harder work which is
going<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.590> be<00:03:30.330> we're<00:03:31.330> going<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.690> try<00:03:32.320> and

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
going to be we're going to try and

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.130 
going to be we're going to try and
switch<00:03:33.700> between<00:03:33.850> positions<00:03:34.480> much<00:03:34.660> faster

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
switch between positions much faster

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.530 
switch between positions much faster
here<00:03:35.350> let<00:03:35.770> me<00:03:35.830> show<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.100> what<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.250> mean

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
here let me show you what I mean

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.400 
here let me show you what I mean
essentially<00:03:37.540> what<00:03:37.690> we're<00:03:37.810> going<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:37.959> do<00:03:38.170> is

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
essentially what we're going to do is

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.860 
essentially what we're going to do is
we're<00:03:38.650> going<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.920> pop<00:03:39.850> our<00:03:40.060> hands<00:03:40.270> out<00:03:40.540> and

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
we're going to pop our hands out and

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.990 
we're going to pop our hands out and
then<00:03:41.770> out<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.070> side<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:42.580> when<00:03:42.760> we<00:03:42.850> do<00:03:42.970> that

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
then out to the side so when we do that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.730 
then out to the side so when we do that
initial<00:03:43.450> pop<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.870> left<00:03:44.080> hand<00:03:44.260> goes<00:03:44.320> up<00:03:44.620> the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
initial pop the left hand goes up the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.620 
initial pop the left hand goes up the
right<00:03:44.890> hand<00:03:44.920> goes<00:03:45.250> down<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.270> think<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.510> it

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
right hand goes down so we think of it

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.980 
right hand goes down so we think of it
as<00:03:46.720> pop<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.440> then<00:03:47.860> out<00:03:48.100> yeah<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.060> from<00:03:49.690> here

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
as pop and then out yeah and from here

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.080 
as pop and then out yeah and from here
we<00:03:50.110> can<00:03:50.370> refined<00:03:51.370> our<00:03:51.490> stability<00:03:51.730> and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
we can refined our stability and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.190 
we can refined our stability and
everything<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.600> might<00:03:52.750> have<00:03:52.930> issues

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
everything and you might have issues

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.230 
everything and you might have issues
keeping<00:03:53.530> timing<00:03:54.220> in<00:03:54.310> Direction<00:03:54.640> consistent

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
keeping timing in Direction consistent

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.420 
keeping timing in Direction consistent
during<00:03:55.330> that<00:03:55.540> initial<00:03:55.690> pop<00:03:56.080> one<00:03:57.070> way<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.250> can

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
during that initial pop one way you can

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.220 
during that initial pop one way you can
think<00:03:57.490> of<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.090> you're<00:03:58.300> trying<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.780> get<00:03:58.959> that

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
think of it is you're trying to get that

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.750 
think of it is you're trying to get that
left<00:03:59.470> hand<00:03:59.680> poi<00:03:59.860> to<00:03:59.980> touch<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.310> ceiling<00:04:00.490> and

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
left hand poi to touch the ceiling and

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.510 
left hand poi to touch the ceiling and
the<00:04:00.850> right<00:04:01.000> hand<00:04:01.180> PO<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.420> touch<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.930> ground<00:04:02.520> the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
the right hand PO a touch the ground the

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.550 
the right hand PO a touch the ground the
best<00:04:03.910> way<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.120> do<00:04:04.420> this<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:04.840> not<00:04:05.080> tangle

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
best way to do this and not tangle

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.900 
best way to do this and not tangle
number<00:04:05.800> one<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.160> keep<00:04:06.400> those<00:04:06.610> planes

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
number one is to keep those planes

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.590 
number one is to keep those planes
stable<00:04:07.420> and<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:08.020> other<00:04:08.140> one<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.470> actually<00:04:08.830> to

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
stable and the other one is actually to

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600 
stable and the other one is actually to
make<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.840> switch-up<00:04:11.350> happen<00:04:11.920> in<00:04:12.070> such<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.370> way

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
make the switch-up happen in such a way

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.220 
make the switch-up happen in such a way
that<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.239> aren't<00:04:13.450> reaching<00:04:13.600> towards<00:04:14.050> the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
that you aren't reaching towards the

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.470 
that you aren't reaching towards the
center<00:04:14.620> first<00:04:14.860> before<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.550> reach<00:04:16.270> free

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
center first before you reach free

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.300 
center first before you reach free
either<00:04:16.600> those<00:04:16.840> extremes<00:04:17.320> that<00:04:17.590> your<00:04:18.010> hand<00:04:18.220> is

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
either those extremes that your hand is

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.880 
either those extremes that your hand is
just<00:04:18.700> going<00:04:18.880> straight<00:04:19.120> there<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:19.810> then<00:04:20.590> out

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
just going straight there and then out

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.540 
just going straight there and then out
to<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.460> sides<00:04:21.700> yes<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:22.810> again<00:04:23.050> we<00:04:23.620> pop<00:04:23.979> out<00:04:24.490> to

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
to the sides yes so again we pop out to

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.860 
to the sides yes so again we pop out to
the<00:04:24.760> sides

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
the sides

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.450 
the sides
and<00:04:25.990> then<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.470> second<00:04:26.770> part<00:04:26.889> of<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.280> going

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
and then the second part of it is going

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.390 
and then the second part of it is going
to<00:04:27.580> be<00:04:27.880> another<00:04:28.150> pop<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.710> we<00:04:29.830> cross<00:04:30.070> again

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
to be another pop and we cross again

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.170 
to be another pop and we cross again
yeah

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
yeah

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.320 
yeah
so<00:04:31.780> we<00:04:31.930> reset<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:33.340> we're<00:04:33.490> going<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.639> do<00:04:33.760> pop

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
so we reset and we're going to do pop

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.370 
so we reset and we're going to do pop
out<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.169> sides<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.760> then<00:04:36.760> pop<00:04:37.350> back<00:04:38.350> to

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
out to the sides and then pop back to

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.260 
out to the sides and then pop back to
cross<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.070> try<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.610> avoid<00:04:39.760> hitting<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.090> poi

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
cross and try and avoid hitting the poi

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.290 
cross and try and avoid hitting the poi
like<00:04:40.479> that<00:04:41.220> reset<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.820> we're<00:04:43.030> going<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.210> do

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
like that reset and we're going to do

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.640 
like that reset and we're going to do
pop<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.020> sides<00:04:44.260> two<00:04:45.010> three<00:04:45.370> two<00:04:45.940> one<00:04:46.870> pop

congratulations you have the move it's
quite<00:05:55.240> a<00:05:55.300> few<00:05:55.479> steps<00:05:55.690> I<00:05:55.870> know<00:05:55.930> but<00:05:56.440> it's<00:05:57.340> one<00:05:57.550> of

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
quite a few steps I know but it's one of

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.040 
quite a few steps I know but it's one of
those<00:05:57.729> things<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.300> if<00:05:58.479> you<00:05:58.599> break<00:05:58.780> it<00:05:58.930> down

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
those things that if you break it down

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.680 
those things that if you break it down
in<00:05:59.260> this<00:05:59.349> fashion<00:05:59.650> the<00:06:00.460> pieces<00:06:00.820> should<00:06:01.060> feel<00:06:01.389> a

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
in this fashion the pieces should feel a

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.839 
in this fashion the pieces should feel a
little<00:06:02.470> bit<00:06:02.949> more<00:06:03.190> intuitive<00:06:03.490> when<00:06:03.760> they

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
little bit more intuitive when they

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.730
