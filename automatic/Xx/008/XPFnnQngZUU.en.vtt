00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
the pros but honestly it's not that

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.419 
the pros but honestly it's not that
difficult<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.509> can<00:00:06.690> show<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:06.960> how<00:00:07.290> any<00:00:08.069> DIY

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
difficult and I can show you how any DIY

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:25.870 
difficult and I can show you how any DIY

so the very first job that we're going
to<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.259> doing<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> preparing<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.759> area<00:00:30.029> that

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
here we've got slight gaps between our

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.460 
here we've got slight gaps between our
joints<00:00:35.010> same<00:00:35.790> around<00:00:35.970> here<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.390> well<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:36.780> it's

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
joints same around here as well now it's

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.049 
joints same around here as well now it's
always<00:00:37.620> good<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.220> because<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.850> do

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
want to let the plasterboard slightly

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.119 
want to let the plasterboard slightly
expand<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.430> contract<00:00:41.579> okay<00:00:42.470> but<00:00:43.470> to<00:00:43.650> make

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
expand and contract okay but to make

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.380 
expand and contract okay but to make
sure<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.610> doesn't<00:00:44.909> come<00:00:45.030> through<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
sure that that doesn't come through to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.979

finish<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.549> off<00:03:54.849> I've<00:03:55.419> maybe<00:03:55.599> got<00:03:55.810> about<00:03:55.930> two

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
finish it off I've maybe got about two

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.500 
finish it off I've maybe got about two
or<00:03:56.230> three<00:03:56.620> inches<00:03:57.099> worth<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.609> water<00:03:57.790> I'll<00:03:58.269> mix

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
or three inches worth of water I'll mix

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.839 
or three inches worth of water I'll mix
it<00:03:58.690> up<00:03:58.780> much<00:03:59.169> thinner<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.310> being<00:04:00.489> thinner

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
it up much thinner so it being thinner

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.970 
it up much thinner so it being thinner
it's<00:04:01.120> going<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.359> spread<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.870> lot<00:04:02.109> more<00:04:02.319> this<00:04:02.919> is

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
it's going to spread a lot more this is

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.240 
it's going to spread a lot more this is
a<00:04:03.129> consistency<00:04:03.879> of<00:04:04.090> our<00:04:04.419> final<00:04:05.019> skim<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.980> now

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
a consistency of our final skim and now

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.280 
a consistency of our final skim and now
we're<00:04:09.430> not<00:04:09.639> putting<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:10.299> on<00:04:10.389> as<00:04:10.690> thick<00:04:10.720> as<00:04:11.169> we

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
we're not putting it on as thick as we

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.729 
we're not putting it on as thick as we
do<00:04:11.470> with<00:04:11.680> our<00:04:11.799> first<00:04:12.099> skin<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.840> is<00:04:14.019> about<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.290> 1

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
do with our first skin this is about a 1

do with our first skin this is about a 1
to<00:04:14.980> 2<00:04:15.190> mil<00:04:15.489> thickness<00:04:18.120> although<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:19.150> said<00:04:19.269> be<00:04:20.079> a

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
to 2 mil thickness although I said be a

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.420 
to 2 mil thickness although I said be a
little<00:04:20.320> bit<00:04:20.410> more<00:04:20.500> fussy<00:04:20.919> with<00:04:21.010> this<00:04:21.190> one

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
little bit more fussy with this one

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.760 
little bit more fussy with this one
we're<00:04:22.000> still<00:04:22.270> not<00:04:22.419> done<00:04:22.599> yet<00:04:22.900> now<00:04:23.500> we're<00:04:23.650> going

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
run my trial over the areas that we've

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.330 
run my trial over the areas that we've
worked<00:05:11.940> again<00:05:12.940> if<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:13.210> wipe<00:05:13.449> any<00:05:13.720> off<00:05:14.100> try<00:05:15.100> and

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
worked again if I wipe any off try and

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.310 
worked again if I wipe any off try and
put<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:15.669> back<00:05:16.000> into<00:05:16.240> any<00:05:16.479> hollows<00:05:16.990> that<00:05:17.020> you

put that back into any hollows that you
might<00:05:17.500> see<00:05:18.430> or<00:05:18.699> feel<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.930> really<00:05:20.260> want<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.470> try

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
might see or feel you really want to try

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.700 
might see or feel you really want to try
and<00:05:20.650> pay<00:05:20.889> attention<00:05:21.550> to<00:05:22.240> how<00:05:22.450> the<00:05:22.710> plaster

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
and pay attention to how the plaster

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.260 
and pay attention to how the plaster
feels<00:05:24.040> under<00:05:24.370> your<00:05:24.639> trowel<00:05:26.760> don't<00:05:27.760> worry<00:05:27.970> too

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
feels under your trowel don't worry too

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.879 
feels under your trowel don't worry too
much<00:05:28.300> if<00:05:28.720> you<00:05:28.870> find<00:05:29.110> that<00:05:29.169> you<00:05:29.290> still<00:05:29.620> leaving

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
much if you find that you still leaving

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.860 
much if you find that you still leaving
the<00:05:30.160> odd<00:05:30.280> marks<00:05:30.760> it's<00:05:31.300> just<00:05:31.570> going<00:05:31.660> to<00:05:31.720> get

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
the odd marks it's just going to get

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.730 
the odd marks it's just going to get
drier<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.530> drier<00:05:32.590> as<00:05:33.340> it<00:05:33.700> dries<00:05:34.000> out<00:05:34.300> the

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
drier and drier as it dries out the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.379 
drier and drier as it dries out the
marks<00:05:35.740> that<00:05:35.800> we<00:05:35.919> leave<00:05:36.250> will<00:05:36.580> be<00:05:36.610> less<00:05:37.060> obvious

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.219 

we're<00:05:40.389> just<00:05:40.600> going<00:05:40.750> to<00:05:40.780> turn<00:05:40.930> our<00:05:41.139> attention

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
we're just going to turn our attention

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.800 
we're just going to turn our attention
now<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:42.550> edges<00:05:43.060> because<00:05:43.300> that's<00:05:43.450> really

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
now to the edges because that's really

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.480 
now to the edges because that's really
important<00:05:44.320> when<00:05:44.440> we're<00:05:44.590> patch<00:05:44.800> plastering

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
important when we're patch plastering

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.730 
important when we're patch plastering
give<00:05:45.820> it<00:05:45.910> a<00:05:45.970> little<00:05:46.120> spray<00:05:46.600> of<00:05:46.750> water<00:05:46.780> so<00:05:47.650> we

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
give it a little spray of water so we

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.460 
give it a little spray of water so we
just<00:05:47.889> want<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:48.160> keep<00:05:48.280> it<00:05:48.460> pliable<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:49.780> with

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
just want to keep it pliable and with

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.210 
just want to keep it pliable and with
this<00:05:50.710> I'm<00:05:51.400> stroking<00:05:51.760> inwards<00:05:52.570> so<00:05:52.979> taking<00:05:53.979> off

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
this I'm stroking inwards so taking off
