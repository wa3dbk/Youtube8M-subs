00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
both single-player and multiplayer so I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000

be able to see through it if you hit X
it<00:02:45.840> brings<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.440> larger<00:02:47.180> model<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.330> map<00:02:48.480> this

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
it brings up a larger model the map this

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.809 
it brings up a larger model the map this
is<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.380> see<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.680> more<00:02:49.830> detail<00:02:50.220> what's

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
is so you can see in more detail what's

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.360 
is so you can see in more detail what's
around<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.930> also<00:02:52.940> extends<00:02:55.069> like<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.190> map

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
around and it also extends like the map

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.860 
around and it also extends like the map
gets<00:02:56.640> bigger<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.780> see<00:02:57.930> further<00:02:59.870> by

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
gets bigger so you can see further by

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.309 
gets bigger so you can see further by
default<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:03.090> opacity<00:03:03.360> for<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.870> large<00:03:04.049> maps

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
default the opacity for the large maps

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.280 
default the opacity for the large maps
at<00:03:04.590> one<00:03:04.680> hundred<00:03:04.739> percent<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.900> when<00:03:07.019> it's<00:03:07.140> at<00:03:07.260> a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
at one hundred percent so when it's at a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.479 
at one hundred percent so when it's at a
hundred<00:03:07.500> percent<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:08.070> can't<00:03:08.280> really<00:03:08.400> see

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
hundred percent you can't really see

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.660 
hundred percent you can't really see
through<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.850> at<00:03:09.030> all<00:03:09.120> it's<00:03:09.299> kinda<00:03:09.750> ridiculous

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
through it at all it's kinda ridiculous

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.569 
through it at all it's kinda ridiculous
so<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.420> mine<00:03:12.600> at<00:03:12.750> twenty-five<00:03:13.140> percent

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
so I have mine at twenty-five percent

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.500 
so I have mine at twenty-five percent
some<00:03:14.579> other<00:03:14.730> things<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.239> do<00:03:15.299> with<00:03:15.390> this

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
some other things you can do with this

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
mod is you can make waypoints i'll call

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.520 
mod is you can make waypoints i'll call
this<00:03:18.630> one<00:03:18.840> house<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:21.019> then<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.140> can<00:03:22.320> change

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
this one house and then you can change

your<00:04:15.620> data<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.239> office<00:04:17.780> fires<00:04:18.019> going<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.350> go

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
your data and I office fires going to go

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.700 
your data and I office fires going to go
or<00:04:18.919> not<00:04:19.130> hopefully<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.030> die<00:04:20.120> oh<00:04:22.630> really<00:04:23.710> all

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
or not hopefully I die oh really all

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.590 
or not hopefully I die oh really all
right<00:04:24.919> probably<00:04:25.250> go<00:04:25.490> catch<00:04:25.970> on<00:04:26.120> fire<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.450> died

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
right probably go catch on fire and died

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.920 
right probably go catch on fire and died
here<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:26.960> I'm<00:04:27.050> gonna<00:04:27.139> drop<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.410> just<00:04:27.919> in<00:04:28.010> case

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
here so I'm gonna drop that just in case

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.920 
here so I'm gonna drop that just in case
all<00:04:29.930> right<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.710> then<00:04:34.010> it<00:04:34.880> shows<00:04:35.270> where<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:35.660> dyed

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
all right and then it shows where I dyed

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.270 
all right and then it shows where I dyed
it<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:37.000> then<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.750> X<00:04:39.080> is<00:04:39.290> a<00:04:39.320> waypoint<00:04:39.530> but<00:04:40.190> it

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
it and then this X is a waypoint but it

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.690 
it and then this X is a waypoint but it
shows<00:04:40.490> up<00:04:40.780> automatically<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.580> obviously<00:04:43.580> you

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
shows up automatically so obviously you

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.870 
shows up automatically so obviously you
don't<00:04:43.850> have<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.060> market<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.729> could

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
don't have to market and you could

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.230 
don't have to market and you could
toggle<00:04:47.060> these<00:04:47.389> on<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:47.750> off<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.110> same<00:04:48.320> way<00:04:49.240> and

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
toggle these on and off the same way and

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.570 
toggle these on and off the same way and
you<00:04:50.720> can<00:04:50.870> also<00:04:51.020> remove<00:04:51.560> them<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.860> same<00:04:52.040> way<00:04:54.580> so

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
you can also remove them the same way so

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.159 
you can also remove them the same way so
it<00:04:55.729> does<00:04:55.880> show<00:04:56.090> more<00:04:56.330> than<00:04:56.510> one<00:04:56.660> death<00:04:56.870> point

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
it does show more than one death point

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:04.629 
it does show more than one death point
if<00:04:57.260> you<00:04:57.350> don't<00:04:57.530> believe<00:04:57.800> them<00:05:02.260> if<00:05:03.639> you're

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
if you don't believe them if you're

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.270 
if you don't believe them if you're
above<00:05:04.850> ground<00:05:05.020> it's<00:05:06.020> usually<00:05:06.800> best<00:05:06.979> to<00:05:07.070> have

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
above ground it's usually best to have

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.140 
above ground it's usually best to have
it<00:05:07.310> set<00:05:08.000> on<00:05:08.210> surface<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.740> then<00:05:10.669> you<00:05:10.910> can<00:05:11.030> also

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
it set on surface and then you can also

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.300 
it set on surface and then you can also
sort<00:05:11.750> of<00:05:11.900> by<00:05:12.050> biomes<00:05:12.560> so<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:12.919> can<00:05:13.070> find

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
sort of by biomes so you can find

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.570 
sort of by biomes so you can find
different<00:05:13.580> biomes<00:05:13.880> and<00:05:14.240> then<00:05:14.840> cave<00:05:15.430> so<00:05:16.430> we'll

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
different biomes and then cave so we'll

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.900 
different biomes and then cave so we'll
go<00:05:16.729> down<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.180> my<00:05:17.330> mind<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:18.039> see<00:05:19.039> what<00:05:19.280> it<00:05:19.669> looks

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
go down to my mind and see what it looks

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.100 
go down to my mind and see what it looks
like<00:05:20.060> when<00:05:20.180> you<00:05:20.300> go<00:05:20.390> down<00:05:20.570> there<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:22.990> down<00:05:23.990> the

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
like when you go down there and down the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.380 
like when you go down there and down the
map<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:24.440> shows<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:25.370> different<00:05:25.669> caverns<00:05:26.120> in

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
map it shows the different caverns in

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.469 
map it shows the different caverns in
the<00:05:27.289> tunnel<00:05:27.620> system<00:05:28.010> Oh<00:05:28.780> creeper<00:05:31.330> stay<00:05:32.330> away

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
the tunnel system Oh creeper stay away

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.060 
the tunnel system Oh creeper stay away
from<00:05:32.510> him<00:05:32.830> but<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.970> different<00:05:36.070> cavern

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
from him but the different cavern

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.600 
from him but the different cavern
systems<00:05:37.100> are<00:05:37.760> shown<00:05:38.350> another<00:05:39.370> pretty<00:05:40.370> useful

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
systems are shown another pretty useful

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.020 
systems are shown another pretty useful
thing<00:05:40.940> is<00:05:41.720> if<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.200> go<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.680> entities<00:05:43.639> radar

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
thing is if you go to the entities radar

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.710 
thing is if you go to the entities radar
and<00:05:44.889> then<00:05:45.889> enable<00:05:46.760> that

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
and then enable that

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.690 
and then enable that
things<00:05:48.470> are<00:05:48.710> red<00:05:48.980> on<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.640> radar<00:05:50.140> represent

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
things are red on the radar represent

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.660 
things are red on the radar represent
monsters<00:05:52.960> you<00:05:53.960> can<00:05:54.110> toggle<00:05:54.320> everything<00:05:54.860> and

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
monsters you can toggle everything and

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:01.720 
monsters you can toggle everything and
those<00:05:55.940> are<00:05:55.970> white<00:05:56.420> ones<00:05:58.660> and<00:05:59.660> then<00:06:00.470> squid<00:06:01.400> are

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
those are white ones and then squid are

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.910 
those are white ones and then squid are
gonna<00:06:02.090> be<00:06:02.270> blue<00:06:02.480> but<00:06:02.750> I'm<00:06:03.200> not<00:06:03.470> really<00:06:03.650> here

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
gonna be blue but I'm not really here

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.760 
gonna be blue but I'm not really here
any<00:06:04.160> water<00:06:04.430> so<00:06:04.550> there's<00:06:04.880> no<00:06:04.970> squid<00:06:05.300> showing

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
any water so there's no squid showing

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.580 
any water so there's no squid showing
they'll<00:06:06.770> be<00:06:06.890> with<00:06:07.100> and<00:06:07.880> then<00:06:08.660> also<00:06:09.140> players

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
they'll be with and then also players

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.270 
they'll be with and then also players
can<00:06:09.950> be<00:06:10.070> shown<00:06:10.630> so<00:06:11.630> I<00:06:11.900> guess<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:12.920> kind<00:06:13.100> of<00:06:13.160> gives

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
can be shown so I guess it kind of gives

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.830 
can be shown so I guess it kind of gives
you<00:06:13.430> an<00:06:13.580> advantage<00:06:13.670> for<00:06:14.300> playing<00:06:14.540> multiplayer

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
you an advantage for playing multiplayer

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.770 
you an advantage for playing multiplayer
servers<00:06:15.460> find<00:06:16.460> where<00:06:16.640> people<00:06:16.910> are<00:06:17.000> at<00:06:17.030> I<00:06:19.780> know

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
servers find where people are at I know

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.270 
servers find where people are at I know
that<00:06:21.140> it<00:06:21.230> works<00:06:21.350> on<00:06:21.530> the<00:06:21.590> multiplayer<00:06:22.010> server

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
that it works on the multiplayer server

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.370 
that it works on the multiplayer server
that<00:06:22.490> I've<00:06:22.610> played<00:06:22.850> on<00:06:23.030> I<00:06:23.240> don't<00:06:24.170> know<00:06:24.260> if

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
that I've played on I don't know if

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.670 
that I've played on I don't know if
there's<00:06:24.620> anything<00:06:24.860> that<00:06:25.010> can<00:06:25.190> block<00:06:25.520> out<00:06:26.680> you

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
there's anything that can block out you

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.960 
there's anything that can block out you
just<00:06:27.920> have<00:06:28.070> to<00:06:28.100> test<00:06:28.430> it<00:06:28.550> for<00:06:28.730> whichever

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
just have to test it for whichever

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.310 
just have to test it for whichever
servers<00:06:29.420> you<00:06:29.510> might<00:06:29.660> play<00:06:31.630> if<00:06:32.630> you<00:06:32.870> have<00:06:33.020> a<00:06:33.050> set

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
servers you might play if you have a set

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.380 
servers you might play if you have a set
for<00:06:33.500> surface<00:06:33.920> and<00:06:34.220> then<00:06:35.320> you<00:06:36.320> change<00:06:36.680> the

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
for surface and then you change the

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:45.670 
for surface and then you change the
lighting<00:06:42.040> once<00:06:43.540> if<00:06:44.540> it's<00:06:44.780> not<00:06:44.990> if<00:06:45.200> it's<00:06:45.380> a

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
lighting once if it's not if it's a

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.360 
lighting once if it's not if it's a
nighttime<00:06:46.120> it'll<00:06:47.120> show<00:06:47.330> things<00:06:47.630> like<00:06:48.370> players

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
nighttime it'll show things like players

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.890 
nighttime it'll show things like players
torches<00:06:49.970> that<00:06:50.120> are<00:06:50.240> placed<00:06:50.480> or<00:06:50.870> lava<00:06:51.290> and<00:06:52.900> that

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
torches that are placed or lava and that

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.210 
torches that are placed or lava and that
could<00:06:54.050> be<00:06:54.140> useful<00:06:54.320> if<00:06:54.860> you're<00:06:55.070> playing

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
could be useful if you're playing

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.640 
could be useful if you're playing
multiplayer<00:06:55.550> you<00:06:55.910> could<00:06:56.500> find<00:06:57.500> other

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
multiplayer you could find other

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.440 
multiplayer you could find other
people's<00:06:58.040> houses<00:06:58.220> or<00:06:58.610> stuff<00:06:58.910> like<00:06:59.030> that<00:06:59.090> and

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
people's houses or stuff like that and

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.409 
people's houses or stuff like that and
then<00:07:00.040> it<00:07:01.040> gives<00:07:01.310> a<00:07:01.460> bird<00:07:01.640> eyes<00:07:01.790> view<00:07:02.090> if<00:07:02.270> you're

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
then it gives a bird eyes view if you're

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.150 
then it gives a bird eyes view if you're
on<00:07:02.510> surface<00:07:02.900> so<00:07:03.110> then<00:07:03.260> you<00:07:03.350> can<00:07:03.470> also<00:07:03.620> see<00:07:03.979> any

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
on surface so then you can also see any

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.730 
on surface so then you can also see any
structures<00:07:04.700> that<00:07:04.910> might<00:07:05.090> be<00:07:05.210> built<00:07:08.500> if<00:07:09.500> you

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
structures that might be built if you

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.240 
structures that might be built if you
have<00:07:09.830> the<00:07:09.979> big<00:07:10.130> map<00:07:10.370> up<00:07:10.780> it's<00:07:11.780> pretty<00:07:12.620> cool<00:07:12.950> if

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
have the big map up it's pretty cool if

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.900 
have the big map up it's pretty cool if
you're<00:07:13.370> trying<00:07:13.610> to<00:07:13.729> sail<00:07:14.000> around<00:07:14.180> and<00:07:15.910> then

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910 
you're trying to sail around and then

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.730 
you're trying to sail around and then
you<00:07:17.030> can<00:07:17.210> get<00:07:17.330> an<00:07:17.450> idea<00:07:17.510> of<00:07:17.870> what<00:07:18.140> biomes<00:07:18.560> are

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
you can get an idea of what biomes are

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.710 
you can get an idea of what biomes are
around<00:07:19.010> then<00:07:19.340> you<00:07:20.330> could<00:07:20.479> find<00:07:21.010> ravines<00:07:22.010> and

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
around then you could find ravines and

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.820 
around then you could find ravines and
rivers<00:07:23.720> and<00:07:23.960> stuff<00:07:24.169> like<00:07:24.290> that<00:07:24.350> so<00:07:26.710> there's<00:07:27.710> a

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830 
rivers and stuff like that so there's a

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.200 
rivers and stuff like that so there's a
lot<00:07:27.979> of<00:07:28.010> different<00:07:28.340> settings<00:07:28.729> you<00:07:28.850> guys<00:07:29.000> can

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.210 
lot of different settings you guys can
