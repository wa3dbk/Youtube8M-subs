circular<00:00:40.719> in<00:00:40.870> shape<00:00:40.899> hope<00:00:41.649> you<00:00:41.800> can<00:00:41.949> see<00:00:42.160> that

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
circular in shape hope you can see that

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.639 
circular in shape hope you can see that
there<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.960> there's<00:00:44.710> an<00:00:44.829> area<00:00:46.079> 3<00:00:47.079> that<00:00:47.289> is<00:00:47.320> semi

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649

circular<00:00:47.859> here<00:00:48.280> for<00:00:48.640> them<00:00:48.760> both<00:00:48.879> just<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:49.269> slot

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
circular here for them both just a slot

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.590 
circular here for them both just a slot
into<00:00:49.750> nicely<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:50.710> slot<00:00:51.039> them<00:00:51.160> in<00:00:51.570> nice<00:00:52.570> and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
going to dip the P pan into the paint

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.000 
going to dip the P pan into the paint
and<00:01:01.739> write<00:01:02.739> up<00:01:03.039> to<00:01:03.579> fill<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.940> Swale<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.600> you're

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and write up to fill the Swale so you're

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.580 
and write up to fill the Swale so you're
popping<00:01:06.010> your<00:01:06.100> pin<00:01:06.370> right<00:01:07.180> in<00:01:07.390> up<00:01:07.660> towards<00:01:08.290> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:27.370 

very<00:03:20.840> quickly

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.450 

is<00:03:27.700> handy<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.910> have<00:03:28.940> next<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.960> you<00:03:31.150> but<00:03:32.150> people

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
because sometimes when you stop to think

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.410 
because sometimes when you stop to think
