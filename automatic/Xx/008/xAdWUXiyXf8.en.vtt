all going to be switched on my arm in a
few<00:01:48.930> layers<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.979> really<00:01:50.340> build<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> color

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
few layers to really build up the color

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.560 
few layers to really build up the color
