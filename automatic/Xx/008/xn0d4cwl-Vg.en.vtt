a<00:06:46.560> it's<00:06:46.740> a<00:06:46.830> twist<00:06:47.070> on<00:06:47.250> this<00:06:47.430> other's<00:06:47.700> game

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
a it's a twist on this other's game

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.800

because the boards no longer variable
hmm<00:06:52.460> but<00:06:53.460> I<00:06:53.730> mean<00:06:54.000> no<00:06:54.150> matter<00:06:54.270> how<00:06:54.480> well<00:06:54.660> you<00:06:54.690> do

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
ultimately you you lose the game because

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.430 
ultimately you you lose the game because
you<00:06:56.640> can't<00:06:56.790> afford<00:06:56.940> health<00:06:57.060> care<00:06:57.180> by<00:06:57.419> the<00:06:57.480> end
