looks a bit more correct because the

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.740 
looks a bit more correct because the

if I want I can get a better look at the

what<00:05:43.110> I<00:05:43.139> can<00:05:43.350> do<00:05:43.470> next<00:05:43.680> is<00:05:43.980> just<00:05:44.160> drag<00:05:44.400> my

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
what I can do next is just drag my

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.500 

and<00:05:51.800> there<00:05:52.800> you<00:05:52.950> have<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.340> I<00:05:53.490> can<00:05:54.180> now<00:05:54.270> position

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
and there you have it I can now position

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.420 
and there you have it I can now position
