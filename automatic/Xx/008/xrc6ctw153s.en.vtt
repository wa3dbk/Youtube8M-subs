00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
especially for something known as the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.970 
especially for something known as the
the<00:02:11.879> puffle<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:13.260> that's<00:02:13.470> kind<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.739> what<00:02:13.860> I'm

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the puffle so that's kind of what I'm

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.149 
the puffle so that's kind of what I'm
hoping<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:15.629> get<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> chance<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.860> buy

more puffles get the racoon puffles the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.259 
more puffles get the racoon puffles the
the<00:02:19.530> rabbit<00:02:19.830> puffles<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:21.000> reindeer

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
puffles and so on but that's kind of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.550 
puffles and so on but that's kind of
what<00:02:23.340> I'm<00:02:23.489> hoping<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:23.909> because<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.319> said
