the model of these glowstone monsters

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.040 
the model of these glowstone monsters
because<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> thought<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.690> were<00:00:36.780> actually

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
because I thought they were actually

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
because I thought they were actually
pretty<00:00:37.110> interesting<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:38.040> looks<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.340> little<00:00:38.550> bit

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
pretty interesting it looks a little bit

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.670 
pretty interesting it looks a little bit
like<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> mutant<00:00:39.329> creatures<00:00:39.719> mod<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.200> my

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
like the mutant creatures mod and my

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.750 
like the mutant creatures mod and my
thought<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.890> was<00:00:40.980> kind<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.250> funny<00:00:41.460> how<00:00:41.610> he's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
thought it was kind of funny how he's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.840 
thought it was kind of funny how he's
always<00:00:41.879> holding<00:00:42.390> his<00:00:42.540> hands<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
always holding his hands out here and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.889 
always holding his hands out here and
yeah<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.450> thing<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.690> thought

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
yeah just one little thing I thought

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.209 
yeah just one little thing I thought
could<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.170> improved<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.649> know<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:47.039> tell

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
could be improved you know you can tell

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.160 
could be improved you know you can tell
that<00:00:47.250> his<00:00:47.430> elbows<00:00:48.180> here<00:00:48.420> don't<00:00:48.660> move<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:49.020> know

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that his elbows here don't move out know

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.450 
that his elbows here don't move out know
it<00:00:49.289> looks<00:00:49.440> kind<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> funny<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.190> he<00:00:50.309> always

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it looks kind of funny like he always

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
it looks kind of funny like he always
wants<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> hug<00:00:51.030> from<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> um<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.890> kind
