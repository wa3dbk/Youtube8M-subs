00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
to me he really wants a chance against

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.089 
to me he really wants a chance against
West<00:04:38.930> Ham<00:04:39.050> so<00:04:39.409> i<00:04:39.440> thought<00:04:39.590> i'd<00:04:39.710> give<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:39.889> to<00:04:39.979> him

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
West Ham so i thought i'd give it to him

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.279 
West Ham so i thought i'd give it to him
see<00:04:40.610> how<00:04:40.849> he<00:04:40.909> performs<00:04:41.419> him<00:04:41.659> a<00:04:41.810> little<00:04:42.169> bit

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
see how he performs him a little bit

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.170 
see how he performs him a little bit
worried<00:04:42.620> because<00:04:43.099> i<00:04:43.370> don't<00:04:43.610> want<00:04:43.669> him<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.000> get

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
worried because i don't want him to get

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.059 
worried because i don't want him to get
injured<00:04:44.509> at<00:04:44.629> all<00:04:44.780> but<00:04:44.960> if<00:04:45.080> he<00:04:45.110> does<00:04:45.349> he's

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
injured at all but if he does he's

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.439 
injured at all but if he does he's
probably<00:04:46.280> one<00:04:46.490> of<00:04:46.520> our<00:04:46.639> best<00:04:46.940> players<00:04:47.120> without

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449
