have<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> same<00:01:23.310> ring<00:01:23.610> design<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.439> do

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
have the same ring design so if they do

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.580 
have the same ring design so if they do
make<00:01:25.830> any<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.509> via<00:01:27.509> premium<00:01:28.020> Bandai<00:01:28.409> or

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.380 
anything of the like I do hope that they
continue<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.549> ring<00:01:32.549> design<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.240> let

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
continue this ring design just to let

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270

do not ask God's truth but anyway

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.730 
do not ask God's truth but anyway
basically<00:05:14.360> when<00:05:14.719> you<00:05:14.810> spin<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:17.319> stop<00:05:18.319> whatever

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
basically when you spin it stop whatever

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.420 
basically when you spin it stop whatever
you're<00:05:19.069> doing<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:20.210> when<00:05:20.449> you<00:05:20.509> spin<00:05:20.749> it<00:05:20.779> once

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.219 

you'll<00:05:25.430> get<00:05:25.699> the<00:05:26.060> jutsu<00:05:28.689> spin<00:05:29.689> it<00:05:29.810> again<00:05:29.930> in

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
you'll get the jutsu spin it again in

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.390 
you'll get the jutsu spin it again in
Newgate<00:05:30.379> Power<00:05:30.770> Ranger

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
Newgate Power Ranger

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.209 
Newgate Power Ranger
so<00:05:31.729> this<00:05:31.939> cycles<00:05:32.389> through<00:05:32.569> those<00:05:32.749> two<00:05:33.020> phrases

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:41.769 

meanwhile<00:05:37.219> when<00:05:37.460> you<00:05:37.550> hit<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:37.759> trigger<00:05:40.779> it

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:41.779 
meanwhile when you hit the trigger it

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.540 
meanwhile when you hit the trigger it
acts<00:05:42.050> just<00:05:42.169> like<00:05:42.379> pressing<00:05:43.219> the<00:05:43.340> back<00:05:43.520> button

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
acts just like pressing the back button

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.809 
acts just like pressing the back button
would<00:05:44.199> so<00:05:45.199> again<00:05:45.650> I'm<00:05:45.919> not<00:05:45.949> really<00:05:46.460> entirely

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:46.819 
would so again I'm not really entirely

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.610 
would so again I'm not really entirely
sure<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.360> order<00:05:47.659> in<00:05:47.870> which<00:05:47.900> you're<00:05:48.349> supposed

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
sure the order in which you're supposed

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.320 
sure the order in which you're supposed

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
to do things the instructions at least

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.850 
to do things the instructions at least
to<00:05:50.539> me<00:05:50.719> I'm<00:05:51.020> probably<00:05:51.169> just<00:05:51.349> missing<00:05:51.710> some

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860
