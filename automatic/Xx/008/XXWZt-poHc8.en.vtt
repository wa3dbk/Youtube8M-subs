00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
I think she's now automatically one of

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.359 
I think she's now automatically one of
the<00:00:15.660> best<00:00:15.839> characters<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.350> Revelations<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369

hundred and I think that I think I did
like<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> quarter<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> levels<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.350> game

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
like a quarter of the levels in the game

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.020 
like a quarter of the levels in the game

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
and I guess you did them all like maybe

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:02.130 
and I guess you did them all like maybe
three<00:03:54.209> or<00:03:54.330> four<00:03:54.390> times<00:03:54.590> yeah<00:03:57.200> sanity
