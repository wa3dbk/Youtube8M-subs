00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
host segment of this video so that I

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.799 
host segment of this video so that I
could<00:00:08.610> appear<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> little<00:00:09.000> bit<00:00:09.240> fresher<00:00:09.450> and

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
could appear a little bit fresher and

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.390 
could appear a little bit fresher and
maybe<00:00:10.050> not<00:00:10.200> get<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.500> many<00:00:10.620> comments<00:00:11.099> about<00:00:11.190> how

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
maybe not get so many comments about how

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.970 
maybe not get so many comments about how
I<00:00:11.429> look<00:00:11.519> Spacey<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.509> videos<00:00:12.840> but<00:00:13.799> then<00:00:13.950> I

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
I look Spacey in my videos but then I

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.160 
I look Spacey in my videos but then I
thought<00:00:14.219> no<00:00:14.610> no<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> perfect

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
thought no no this is the perfect

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.870 
thought no no this is the perfect
allegory<00:00:16.980> for<00:00:17.100> what<00:00:17.369> we're<00:00:17.520> talking<00:00:17.640> about

smartphones alright I know it was a
little<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.949> weak<00:00:29.750> comparison<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:31.170> this

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
little bit of a weak comparison but this

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.830 
little bit of a weak comparison but this

it for about a week and I've found its
endurance<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> high<00:00:37.649> side<00:00:38.010> of

One X that I was trying out a couple
weeks<00:00:49.649> ago<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.219> had<00:00:50.399> pretty<00:00:50.670> good<00:00:50.760> battery

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
weeks ago which had pretty good battery

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.439 
weeks ago which had pretty good battery
life<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> check<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.789> today<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
life so we're going to check out today a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.470 
life so we're going to check out today a
few<00:00:54.750> ways<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> most<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
few ways to get the most out of the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.990 
few ways to get the most out of the
battery<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.500> samsung<00:00:58.920> galaxy<00:00:59.070> s3

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
battery on the samsung galaxy s3

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.430 
battery on the samsung galaxy s3
it's<00:01:00.600> pocket<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.079> let's<00:01:01.620> take<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> look

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.720 

so<00:01:09.440> there<00:01:09.710> are<00:01:09.740> certain<00:01:10.070> steps<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:10.610> we've

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
so there are certain steps that we've

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.790 
so there are certain steps that we've
all<00:01:10.880> become<00:01:11.090> accustomed<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.840> taking<00:01:12.080> when<00:01:12.650> we

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
all become accustomed to taking when we

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.310 
all become accustomed to taking when we
really<00:01:13.430> need<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.760> maximize<00:01:14.110> every<00:01:15.110> last

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
really need to maximize every last

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.290 
really need to maximize every last
second<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:15.890> battery<00:01:16.220> life<00:01:16.400> on<00:01:16.730> our<00:01:16.760> smart

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
second of battery life on our smart

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.060 
second of battery life on our smart
phones<00:01:17.540> sure<00:01:18.260> there<00:01:18.560> are<00:01:18.680> some<00:01:18.830> third-party

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
phones sure there are some third-party

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.740 
phones sure there are some third-party
apps<00:01:19.490> out<00:01:19.700> there<00:01:19.730> that'll<00:01:20.240> do<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.510> trick<00:01:20.540> for

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
apps out there that'll do the trick for

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.840 
apps out there that'll do the trick for
us<00:01:21.080> but<00:01:21.350> for<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:21.650> video<00:01:21.800> let's<00:01:22.460> stick<00:01:22.700> to

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
us but for this video let's stick to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.630 
us but for this video let's stick to
stock<00:01:23.380> some<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.470> these<00:01:24.590> measures<00:01:24.980> include

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
stock some of these measures include

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.970 
stock some of these measures include
steps<00:01:26.210> like<00:01:26.510> shutting<00:01:26.870> off<00:01:27.080> as<00:01:27.290> many<00:01:27.410> radios

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
steps like shutting off as many radios

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
of these radios have more effect on the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.520 
of these radios have more effect on the
battery<00:01:37.820> than<00:01:37.970> others<00:01:38.300> but<00:01:38.840> they<00:01:38.930> all<00:01:38.960> impact

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
battery than others but they all impact
