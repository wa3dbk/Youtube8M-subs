hello everybody I'm presenting you just
another<00:00:04.350> amplifier<00:00:04.740> with<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.730> golf<00:00:06.210> kilo<00:00:06.569> 71

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
another amplifier with the golf kilo 71

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.499 
another amplifier with the golf kilo 71
-<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.830> think<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.570> cube<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.929> love<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.679> most

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
- I think it's the cube I love the most

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.200 
- I think it's the cube I love the most
this<00:00:12.509> time<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.049> called<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.830> amplifier<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
this time I called the amplifier the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.529 
this time I called the amplifier the
Regina<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:17.400> fact<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.970> name<00:00:18.180> chosen

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
Regina and in fact it's a name chosen

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.380 
Regina and in fact it's a name chosen
because<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.410> will<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.100> used<00:00:20.310> by<00:00:20.460> my<00:00:20.789> friends<00:00:21.240> in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
because it will be used by my friends in

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.470 
because it will be used by my friends in

see it on top there is 90 watts 90 watts
and<00:02:41.040> let's<00:02:42.000> start<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.109> amplifier<00:02:45.890> switching

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
and let's start the amplifier switching

00:02:46.890 --> 00:03:00.050 
and let's start the amplifier switching
on<00:02:47.069> 2<00:02:47.250> kilowatt<00:02:47.700> scale<00:02:52.879> tuning<00:02:55.400> ok<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:59.060> let's

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
on 2 kilowatt scale tuning ok and let's

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.500 
on 2 kilowatt scale tuning ok and let's
try<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.989> average<00:03:01.560> mode<00:03:02.010> let's<00:03:03.000> see<00:03:03.299> what

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
try in the average mode let's see what

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:13.819 
try in the average mode let's see what
we<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:10.250> 500<00:03:11.250> watts<00:03:11.819> 500<00:03:12.690> watts<00:03:12.930> from<00:03:13.170> one

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
we have 500 watts 500 watts from one

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.080 
we have 500 watts 500 watts from one

the<00:03:18.329> PEP<00:03:18.859> power<00:03:19.970> let's<00:03:20.970> see<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:26.780> around<00:03:27.949> 7<00:03:28.949> 700

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the PEP power let's see it around 7 700

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.699 
the PEP power let's see it around 7 700
whiskey<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:33.569> want<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.930> show<00:03:34.109> you<00:03:34.169> another

whiskey I just want to show you another
thing<00:03:34.919> about<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.780> power<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.739> power<00:03:38.220> line<00:03:38.720> now

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
thing about the power the power line now

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.400 
thing about the power the power line now
I'm<00:03:39.900> having<00:03:44.269> 223<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.510> starting<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
I'm having 223 and starting the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.990 
I'm having 223 and starting the
amplifier<00:03:46.859> it<00:03:47.099> drops<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:48.349> 240<00:03:49.349> and<00:03:50.000> sometimes

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
amplifier it drops to 240 and sometimes

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.670 
amplifier it drops to 240 and sometimes
even<00:03:51.359> less<00:03:51.660> than<00:03:51.900> that

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.380 

let's<00:03:56.680> try<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.040> on<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.459> top<00:03:57.670> bands<00:03:57.939> because

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
let's try it on the top bands because

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.660 
let's try it on the top bands because
there<00:03:58.930> are<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.079> lot<00:03:59.170> of<00:03:59.379> people<00:03:59.769> saying<00:04:00.189> that<00:04:00.489> it

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
there are a lot of people saying that it

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:13.180 
there are a lot of people saying that it
doesn't<00:04:01.030> work<00:04:01.269> in<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:02.260> 28<00:04:03.129> megahertz<00:04:04.090> band

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:48.070 

just<00:04:13.940> tuning<00:04:14.540> it

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.299 

okay<00:04:49.189> let's<00:04:50.189> see

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:52.309 
okay let's see

00:04:52.309 --> 00:05:03.799 
okay let's see
average<00:04:53.309> mode<00:05:01.219> not<00:05:02.219> so<00:05:02.460> much<00:05:02.669> that<00:05:03.029> in<00:05:03.779> the

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:03.809 
average mode not so much that in the

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:18.189 
average mode not so much that in the
other<00:05:04.309> mode<00:05:13.370> around<00:05:15.229> 450<00:05:16.229> watts<00:05:16.770> in<00:05:17.370> the

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
other mode around 450 watts in the

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.749 
other mode around 450 watts in the
continues<00:05:20.029> carrier<00:05:21.029> and<00:05:21.240> on<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:22.409> PvP<00:05:23.189> mode

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
continues carrier and on the PvP mode

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:36.469 
continues carrier and on the PvP mode
we'll<00:05:24.330> have<00:05:29.120> around<00:05:30.620> 650<00:05:31.620> watt<00:05:35.089> okay<00:05:36.089> that's

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
we'll have around 650 watt okay that's

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.329 
we'll have around 650 watt okay that's
it<00:05:36.689> thanks<00:05:37.020> for<00:05:37.169> watching<00:05:37.529> hope<00:05:37.919> to<00:05:38.069> meet<00:05:38.189> you
