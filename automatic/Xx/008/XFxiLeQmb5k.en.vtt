00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.530 
signal with a reference frequency of 1
kilohertz<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.390> then<00:00:40.570> adjust<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.140> scope

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
kilohertz and then adjust the scope

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.030 
kilohertz and then adjust the scope
accordingly<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.410> first<00:00:50.739> thing<00:00:50.890> you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
accordingly now the first thing you

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.639 
accordingly now the first thing you
notice<00:00:51.190> is<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:51.700> whilst<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.210> frequency<00:00:52.899> is

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
notice is that whilst the frequency is

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.369 
notice is that whilst the frequency is
pretty<00:00:54.010> constant<00:00:54.870> there's<00:00:55.870> quite<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.140> lot<00:00:56.350> of

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379

pretty constant there's quite a lot of
vertical<00:00:56.770> juddering<00:00:57.640> up<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.090> down<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.440> if<00:00:59.559> we

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
vertical juddering up and down and if we

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.160 
vertical juddering up and down and if we
zoom<00:01:00.219> out<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.539> that<00:01:01.690> we<00:01:01.809> can<00:01:01.989> see<00:01:02.230> more<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.820> less

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
what only is the amplitude constant but

what only is the amplitude constant but
the<00:02:19.200> jitter<00:02:21.140> horizontally<00:02:22.140> is

so<00:02:49.650> frequency<00:02:50.650> from<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.040> CD<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:55.180> that's

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
so frequency from the CD and that's

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.870 
so frequency from the CD and that's
because<00:02:56.079> CD<00:02:56.319> is<00:02:56.469> a<00:02:56.530> non-contact<00:02:57.310> system

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
because CD is a non-contact system

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.930 
because CD is a non-contact system

we<00:03:51.390> get<00:03:51.569> this<00:03:51.719> jittery<00:03:53.749> unstable<00:03:56.510> that's<00:03:57.510> what

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
we get this jittery unstable that's what

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.869 
we get this jittery unstable that's what
actually<00:03:57.870> coming<00:03:58.379> off<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:58.499> vinyl<00:03:59.280> if<00:03:59.519> we<00:03:59.639> stop

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
actually coming off the vinyl if we stop

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.360 
actually coming off the vinyl if we stop
it<00:04:02.989> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.139> see<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.560> amplitude<00:04:04.920> which

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
it you can see that the amplitude which

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.360 
it you can see that the amplitude which
is<00:04:05.549> more<00:04:05.879> or<00:04:05.939> less<00:04:06.269> constant<00:04:06.689> is<00:04:07.530> modulated

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.770 
is more or less constant is modulated
it's<00:04:09.030> moving<00:04:09.510> up<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:09.810> down<00:04:10.129> by<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:12.510> could<00:04:12.689> be

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
it's moving up and down by it could be

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.589 
it's moving up and down by it could be
the<00:04:12.900> warp<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.310> disk<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:18.329> if<00:04:18.479> we

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
the warp of the of the disk and if we

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:23.120 
the warp of the of the disk and if we
play<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.930> same<00:04:19.940> frequency<00:04:20.940> 15<00:04:21.509> kilohertz<00:04:22.130> off

play the same frequency 15 kilohertz off

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:34.719 
play the same frequency 15 kilohertz off
CD<00:04:25.940> that's<00:04:26.940> what<00:04:27.120> we<00:04:27.210> get<00:04:28.820> perfectly<00:04:29.820> stable

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.800 

perfectly<00:04:35.729> stable<00:04:36.180> frequency<00:04:36.990> both<00:04:37.500> in

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
amplitude and frequency itself and again

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:56.490 
amplitude and frequency itself and again
if<00:04:43.259> we<00:04:43.349> switch<00:04:43.560> back<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.039> vinyl

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.640 

that's<00:04:57.160> what<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.490> actually<00:04:57.790> comes<00:04:58.240> in

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
that's what it actually comes in

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.380 
that's what it actually comes in
off-the-record<00:04:59.650> looking<00:05:00.190> like<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:01.120> sort<00:05:01.330> of

off-the-record looking like in sort of

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.730 
off-the-record looking like in sort of
real-time<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:03.160> that's<00:05:03.310> if<00:05:03.460> we<00:05:03.610> zoom<00:05:03.850> into

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
real-time and that's if we zoom into

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:16.340 
real-time and that's if we zoom into
individual<00:05:05.740> waveform<00:05:08.730> back<00:05:09.730> to<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:09.970> CD

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.540 

pretty<00:05:17.350> conclusive<00:05:17.890> and<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.860> core<00:05:21.340> of<00:05:21.370> this

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
pretty conclusive and the core of this

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.430 
pretty conclusive and the core of this
problem<00:05:21.940> as<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.150> mentioned<00:05:22.570> is<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:23.110> fact<00:05:23.320> that

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
problem as I mentioned is the fact that

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.900 
problem as I mentioned is the fact that
vinyl<00:05:24.370> is<00:05:24.730> a<00:05:24.840> contact<00:05:25.840> system<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:27.460> purity

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
vinyl is a contact system and the purity

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.570 
vinyl is a contact system and the purity
and<00:05:28.150> stability<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:28.720> any<00:05:29.440> signal<00:05:30.160> that<00:05:30.190> comes

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
and stability of any signal that comes

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.440 
and stability of any signal that comes
off<00:05:30.730> file<00:05:31.000> is<00:05:31.690> directly<00:05:32.500> correlated<00:05:33.280> with<00:05:34.120> the

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
off file is directly correlated with the

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.480 
off file is directly correlated with the
ability<00:05:35.200> of<00:05:35.230> the<00:05:35.410> stylus<00:05:35.860> to<00:05:35.890> maintain

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
ability of the stylus to maintain

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.050 
ability of the stylus to maintain
perfect<00:05:36.790> contact<00:05:37.450> with<00:05:37.720> a<00:05:37.930> groove<00:05:38.200> like<00:05:39.060> that

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
perfect contact with a groove like that

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.250 
perfect contact with a groove like that
haven't<00:05:40.960> so<00:05:41.200> throw<00:05:41.650> some<00:05:41.830> light<00:05:41.980> on<00:05:42.010> this
