00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
video and I guess we will begin the top

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.179 
video and I guess we will begin the top
part<00:00:15.269> which<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.540> terrain<00:00:16.110> goes<00:00:16.380> obviously<00:00:17.009> the

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
part which is terrain goes obviously the

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.069 
part which is terrain goes obviously the
actual<00:00:17.580> base<00:00:17.790> is<00:00:18.119> underground<00:00:21.079> obviously

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:22.079 
actual base is underground obviously

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.380 
actual base is underground obviously
this<00:00:22.200> is<00:00:22.349> Hoth<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.009> this<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.310> all<00:00:23.489> snow<00:00:23.939> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
this is Hoth so this is all snow and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.600 
this is Hoth so this is all snow and
things<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.989> then<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.349> right<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.520> the

things and then this right here in the
middle<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.480> kind<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.899> a<00:00:27.989> hatch<00:00:28.200> that<00:00:28.950> would

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
middle is kind of a hatch that would

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.889 
middle is kind of a hatch that would

and I think there might be another one
nope<00:01:41.820> there's<00:01:42.180> not<00:01:42.360> you'll<00:01:43.259> also<00:01:43.439> see

nope there's not you'll also see

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.849 
nope there's not you'll also see
obviously<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.090> layering<00:01:45.359> of<00:01:45.869> snow<00:01:46.289> so<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
obviously just layering of snow so you

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.190 
obviously just layering of snow so you
get<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.159> hills<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.729> whatnot<00:01:48.170> plus<00:01:49.170> a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200

the area to make it to make the terrain
look<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.390> more<00:02:03.570> interesting<00:02:04.369> focus

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
look a little bit more interesting focus

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.650 
look a little bit more interesting focus
it<00:02:05.640> again

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.199 

and<00:02:09.660> yeah<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:10.950> pretty<00:02:11.250> much<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.940> top

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
and yeah that's pretty much the top

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.900 
and yeah that's pretty much the top
terrain<00:02:12.870> part<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.440> mock<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.730> whole

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
terrain part of this mock so this whole

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.720 
terrain part of this mock so this whole
thing<00:02:15.209> obviously<00:02:15.800> are<00:02:16.800> not<00:02:16.980> really<00:02:17.280> obviously

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
thing obviously are not really obviously

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.280 
thing obviously are not really obviously
but<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.060> does<00:02:18.209> come<00:02:18.720> off<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.780> put<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.080> down

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.830 
but it does come off just put it down
and<00:02:23.160> we<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.489> get<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> look<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:23.970> here<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.330> it

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
and we can get a look in here and it

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.229 
and we can get a look in here and it
looks<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.110> some<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.440> these<00:02:25.590> guys<00:02:26.239> have

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
looks like some of these guys have

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.510 
looks like some of these guys have
fallen<00:02:27.630> over<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.830> I'm<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.040> gonna<00:02:29.130> put<00:02:29.400> them

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
fallen over so I'm just gonna put them

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.300 
fallen over so I'm just gonna put them
back<00:02:29.670> up<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.180> didn't<00:02:30.870> put<00:02:31.319> them<00:02:31.440> on<00:02:31.620> jumpers<00:02:32.130> or

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
back up I didn't put them on jumpers or

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.979 
back up I didn't put them on jumpers or
anything<00:02:32.730> which<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.270> probably<00:02:33.540> should<00:02:33.959> have

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
anything which I probably should have

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.650 
anything which I probably should have
but<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:35.569> didn't<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.580> let's<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
but I didn't so let's just this is the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.330 
but I didn't so let's just this is the
last<00:02:39.870> guy<00:02:41.989> these<00:02:42.989> are<00:02:43.230> all<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.560> SIF<00:02:43.830> troopers

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
last guy these are all the SIF troopers

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.520 
last guy these are all the SIF troopers
in<00:02:45.090> their<00:02:45.600> underground<00:02:46.500> base<00:02:47.870> lots<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.050> detail

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
in their underground base lots of detail

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.830 
in their underground base lots of detail
on<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.160> walls<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.940> they<00:02:51.120> go<00:02:51.330> all<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.660> way

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
on the walls and they go all the way

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.910 
on the walls and they go all the way
around<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.530> walls<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:58.290> guess<00:02:58.470> we'll<00:02:58.680> start

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
around the walls and I guess we'll start

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.750 
around the walls and I guess we'll start
over<00:02:59.130> here

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
over here

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.320 
over here
we're<00:03:02.760> gonna<00:03:02.880> spin<00:03:03.299> this<00:03:03.480> around<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.209> can

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
we're gonna spin this around so we can

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.900 
we're gonna spin this around so we can
get<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.480> better<00:03:06.630> look<00:03:06.780> at<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.760> part<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.819> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
get a better look at this part of the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.280 
get a better look at this part of the
MOC<00:03:09.150> looks<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:10.049> figure<00:03:10.620> fell<00:03:10.769> over<00:03:11.069> again<00:03:11.340> well

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
MOC looks a figure fell over again well

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.420 
MOC looks a figure fell over again well
as<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.380> can<00:03:13.470> see<00:03:13.530> these<00:03:13.769> are<00:03:13.950> kind<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.250> some

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
as you can see these are kind of some

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.970 
as you can see these are kind of some
rocks<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.540> even<00:03:16.170> while<00:03:16.320> they<00:03:16.470> kind<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.709> built

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
rocks and even while they kind of built

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.069 
rocks and even while they kind of built
into<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.579> little<00:03:17.820> rock<00:03:18.209> area<00:03:18.630> right<00:03:18.840> here

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
into this little rock area right here

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.960 
into this little rock area right here
there's<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:19.890> like<00:03:20.010> an<00:03:20.130> underground<00:03:20.400> spring

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
there's just like an underground spring

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.840 
there's just like an underground spring
of<00:03:21.630> water<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.530> then<00:03:22.829> they're<00:03:22.980> piping<00:03:23.549> out<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
of water and then they're piping out the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.670 
of water and then they're piping out the
water<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.480> it's<00:03:24.959> like<00:03:25.079> they're<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.350> little<00:03:25.500> bit

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
water and it's like they're a little bit

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.550 
water and it's like they're a little bit
closer<00:03:25.890> again<00:03:26.160> sorry<00:03:26.430> about<00:03:26.609> all<00:03:26.730> this

focusing<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.989> our<00:03:31.079> piping<00:03:31.620> out<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
focusing so that our piping out the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.370 
focusing so that our piping out the
water<00:03:32.100> through<00:03:32.400> these<00:03:32.549> pipes<00:03:32.850> into<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:34.170> big

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
water through these pipes into this big

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.110 
water through these pipes into this big
tank<00:03:34.820> just<00:03:35.820> for<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:37.290> know<00:03:37.410> uses<00:03:38.100> such<00:03:38.940> as

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
tank just for you know uses such as

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.970 
tank just for you know uses such as
energy<00:03:39.359> or<00:03:39.600> drinking<00:03:40.230> or<00:03:40.320> whatever<00:03:40.500> they<00:03:40.829> have

energy or drinking or whatever they have

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.960 
energy or drinking or whatever they have
to<00:03:41.010> use<00:03:41.190> water<00:03:41.549> for<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:43.010> then<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.430> guess<00:03:44.850> we

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
to use water for and then I guess we

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.840 
to use water for and then I guess we
move<00:03:45.150> on<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.570> some<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.140> wall<00:03:46.560> detailing<00:03:47.160> if

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
move on to some of the wall detailing if

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.670 
move on to some of the wall detailing if
you<00:03:48.030> look<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.660> have<00:03:48.989> random<00:03:49.170> stuff<00:03:49.590> in

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
you look in I just have random stuff in

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.020 
you look in I just have random stuff in
the<00:03:49.799> walls<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.519> then<00:03:50.640> if<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.880> look

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the walls like that and then if you look

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.710 
the walls like that and then if you look
at<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.209> bottom

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
at the bottom

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.900 
at the bottom
I've<00:03:51.780> black<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.010> then<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.280> dark<00:03:53.519> red<00:03:53.730> and

I've black and then I have dark red and
then<00:03:54.030> some<00:03:54.239> trans<00:03:54.660> red<00:03:55.079> pieces<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.829> represent

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
then some trans red pieces to represent

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.580 
then some trans red pieces to represent
the<00:03:56.459> SIF<00:03:56.720> which<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.840> thought<00:03:57.930> was<00:03:58.109> kind<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.440> cool

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
the SIF which I thought was kind of cool

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.390 
the SIF which I thought was kind of cool
and<00:03:58.859> then<00:03:59.010> just<00:03:59.220> some<00:03:59.780> sloping<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:00.900> places<00:04:01.440> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
and then just some sloping in places and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.780 
and then just some sloping in places and
then<00:04:02.609> just<00:04:02.820> wall<00:04:03.060> detail<00:04:03.870> things<00:04:04.609> you<00:04:05.609> spin

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
then just wall detail things you spin

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.910 
then just wall detail things you spin
around<00:04:05.910> there<00:04:06.180> more<00:04:06.510> while<00:04:06.690> detailing<00:04:07.049> this

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
thing in the roof would open and then I

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.770 
thing in the roof would open and then I
just<00:04:33.320> kind<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.530> put<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.860> here<00:04:34.130> -<00:04:34.750> along<00:04:35.750> with

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
just kind of put this here - along with

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.770

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.750 
back here is all the hologram stuff
pretty<00:04:45.290> much<00:04:45.440> -<00:04:45.770> Holograms<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:46.580> either

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
pretty much - Holograms on either

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.670 
pretty much - Holograms on either
hologram<00:04:47.510> tables<00:04:47.900> on<00:04:48.050> either<00:04:48.199> side<00:04:48.650> just

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
hologram tables on either side just

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.760 
hologram tables on either side just
circular<00:04:49.310> ones<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:50.449> one's<00:04:50.720> being<00:04:50.900> used<00:04:51.260> that

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
circular ones this one's being used that

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.430 
circular ones this one's being used that
that<00:04:52.100> one<00:04:52.250> isn't<00:04:52.550> so<00:04:52.610> it's<00:04:52.789> not<00:04:52.910> on<00:04:53.289> and<00:04:54.289> then

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
that one isn't so it's not on and then

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.710 
that one isn't so it's not on and then
this<00:04:54.789> is<00:04:55.789> a<00:04:55.880> big<00:04:56.949> map<00:04:57.949> kind<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.090> simulating

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
this is a big map kind of simulating

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.600 
this is a big map kind of simulating
hills<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:01.000> stuff<00:05:02.000> with<00:05:02.180> these<00:05:02.360> holographic

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
hills and stuff with these holographic

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.370 
hills and stuff with these holographic
stuff<00:05:04.610> which<00:05:04.850> is<00:05:04.880> just<00:05:05.030> studs<00:05:05.600> obviously<00:05:06.199> I

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
stuff which is just studs obviously I

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.430 
stuff which is just studs obviously I
really<00:05:06.860> like<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.280> shape<00:05:07.550> of<00:05:07.729> this<00:05:07.880> table<00:05:08.270> I

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
really like the shape of this table I

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.010 
really like the shape of this table I
thought<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.620> was<00:05:09.740> cool<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:11.389> floor<00:05:11.660> is<00:05:11.780> all

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
thought that was cool the floor is all

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.480 
thought that was cool the floor is all
tiled<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:12.770> then<00:05:13.070> some<00:05:13.340> kind<00:05:14.180> of<00:05:14.389> design<00:05:14.990> with

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
tiled and then some kind of design with

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.159 
tiled and then some kind of design with
dark<00:05:16.490> grey<00:05:16.699> tiles<00:05:19.330> more<00:05:20.330> wall<00:05:20.539> detailing

dark grey tiles more wall detailing

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.240 
dark grey tiles more wall detailing
right<00:05:21.710> along<00:05:22.190> here<00:05:22.430> with<00:05:22.639> slopes<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.300> things

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
right along here with slopes and things

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.950 
right along here with slopes and things
and<00:05:25.250> this<00:05:25.340> is<00:05:25.400> kind<00:05:25.669> of<00:05:25.729> a<00:05:25.820> medical<00:05:26.210> area<00:05:26.450> for

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
and this is kind of a medical area for

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.550 
and this is kind of a medical area for
people<00:05:27.080> who<00:05:27.349> are<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:28.280> know<00:05:28.510> messed<00:05:29.510> up<00:05:29.720> to
