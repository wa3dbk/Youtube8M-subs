00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.150
 good welcome back here we are 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:27.079
 with a new video review 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.279
 in this case we have the maximum 6 impact 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.399
 from asus 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.980
 the new sea ​​that is releasing audio ni 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.290
 to rock series and we will be watching the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.239
 full review and immediately we go 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.420
 to be reviewing what opening the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.920
 product so they can see and know 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.829
 the category of this product that is 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.979
 in the market we are going to develop the 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.730
 product product we find the 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.100
 mothers margin 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.850
 very heavy but it is very small 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.120
 This is a virtue that has added tubes 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.110
 chiquitos to remove and have 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.240
 then the sea in sight for all 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.880
 add very little that we can put in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.150
 Any type of cabinet comes with two 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.750
 r3 rd slots and comes with a slot 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.830
 pci express 2 power connectors and the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.160
 usb 3.0 rear connectors you have the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.869
 sound you have hdmi we will be 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.420
 speaking part by part of everything that 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.720
 is the back panel of everything 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.310
 we have in the chipset socket but 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.560
 spend and accessories given that brings 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.800
 the box the first thing we see is a guide 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.140
 fast we follow and we see a z3 cable in 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.750
 actually come 4 in this combo then 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.850
 we have the wifi antenna another road 3 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.050
 here we have the rock sound plate 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.290
 supreme fx impact others up here 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.760
 we have the mini pci express plate 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.580
 and then we have the extender for 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.340
 internal usb connectors and finally the 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.890
 back plate for the back panel more 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.310
 down in a third compartment we can 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.530
 appreciate the driver cd and the manual 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.180
 complete well explained and in different 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.070
 languages ​​as I always recommend that what 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.570
 lean we also have a form of 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.560
 stickers to identify our 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.660
 cables and hardware 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.540
 among the accessories we see the cards 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.270
 mini pci express combo 2 with dual band 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.190
 802.11 wifi and bluetooth 4.0 module 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.319
 this board maximizes the functions for 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.080
 get a better experience without having 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.730
 to sacrifice a pci express slot 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.260
 important in such a small team and 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.300
 It is also optimized to work 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.010
 as minister is the latter 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.980
 optimized for state disks 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.900
 solid supreme sound plate fx 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.510
 impact offers us a sound 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.080
 practically natural with an output of 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.190
 115 decibels in signal-to-noise ratio 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.049
 this is another of the strong points of 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.480
 this command both in headphones and in 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.819
 audio equipment we also have the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.860
 accessories to your walkman wifi 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.310
 of mobile antennas compatible with 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.549
 protocols of gn and ac the latter with 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.690
 speeds of at least a thousand mp in the 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.600
 50 band 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.270
 something really interesting as we said 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.670
 before the mother minia tx highlights its 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.100
 distinctive black and red 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.610
 republic of a game arts on its panel 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:31.110
 rear has a port hdmi 1 port 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.710
 display port 2 of bach leds a button 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.140
 ok a direct button there is a button 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.170
 create a button to activate or 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.640
 disable rock connect 4 function 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.740
 usb 2.0 ports 4 usb ports 3.0 a 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.170
 esata port to connect discs 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.890
 external can series and a large port 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.890
 for networks 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.760
 as you can see the plate is quite light 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.340
 but it shows its solidity in each of 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.409
 its components the psb is black in the 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.989
 back of Al Manar we can see 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.510
 like the components especially the bm 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.849
 voltage regulator module are very 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.200
 well reinforced each of the 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.660
 components to feel them we give ourselves 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.660
 accounts of its true quality and the 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.220
 grip that has the important plate 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.220
 to know what product we are talking about 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.490
 the microprocessor power is 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.920
 governs through the digital bm that before 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.910
 we mention we emphasize the denominated 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.730
 extreme engine we said 3 with impact wear 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.710
 has back wind shocks with 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.620
 Gold-plated covers to support 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.780
 loads of 600 to pérez with temperatures 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.310
 inferior to other models besides 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.220
 We have solid capacitors for 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.660
 10k comments of Japanese origin all 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.050
 a sample of safety and quality of 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.050
 our product 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.920
 checking the sea we have two connectors 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.440
 of r3 for memories that support up to 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.940
 3000 megahertz in overclock we see 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.130
 also all available connectors 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.890
 including the power of 24 and the 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.840
 4 + 4 feed we also see a 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.720
 start and reset button ideal for 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.940
 tests out of the cabinet the bbm something 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.830
 very important in this product is the 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.240
 only I've seen of 10 phases and in this 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.580
 size for a high product 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.430
 requirement comes with a heatsink and bass 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.980
 play as we have as we see has the 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.920
 blue rock symbol that identifies him 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.400
 we have only one pci express 16 x slot 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.350
 that works in 2.0 and 3.0 here we are 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.850
 a little bit of options but it's 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.380
 clear in such a small product the 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.690
 only limitation that I can find 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.560
 when making a slide or a 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.120
 crossfire the chipset as we see has 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.740
 the same delicate characteristics of 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.510
 asus for your products referred by 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.360
 kmart we also see the connectors 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.160
 serial ata 4 in this case in a 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.990
 interesting location many mothers 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.240
 they bring 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.490
 cans series in complex locations 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.320
 that then become uncomfortable at the time 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.880
 to plug in I think this education is 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.620
 chord in a product of these measures 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.690
 this product since we go there 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.460
 it is surprising that it is a product with 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.260
 high performance and prepared for 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.610
 important demands maintains a 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.920
 excellent voltage regulation in 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.560
 extreme demands offers overclock 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.420
 wifi bluetooth sound quality and 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.430
 many more benefits thanks to their 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.110
 for not knowing better this product 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.030
