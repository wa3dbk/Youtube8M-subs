00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.350
 and 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.260
 and hello to all of these disciplines 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.879
 comfortable and shoes presence of myself 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.730
 and a beautiful sun in minecraft 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:20.300
 to make a tutorial on the map 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.369
 tutorials on the pig factory but 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.320
 it's really important 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.240
 we will start with the receptacle of 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.050
 pigs it will come up by a square 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:35.600
 of 3 x 3 which will be completely filled 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.519
 of hopper is here in place of safe 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.260
 so you're going to made a cage of the 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:43.129
 sort of high catalog 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.620
 to note that on one side I chose the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.760
 right when we look at the chest you 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.370
 will have a hole three blocks high is 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.110
 of course a hole at the very top for 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.760
 knock down the pigs so we have 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.539
 finished the receptacle 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.250
 then we will have to do 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.440
 routing for baby pigs 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.910
 will be done with water is actually 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.770
 they have to come and then 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.930
 here to know that a water source can 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.140
 flow in a straight line up to eight 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:14.060
 blocks so placed or counted 8 from 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.740
 of the hole 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and you place 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.990
 a back block at this level 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.680
 and you can see that the blog is going 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.229
 sink pile hair so far so when 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.450
 ticking babies will arrive in this 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.869
 channel they will be pushed into the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 receptacle 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.850
 you can mount the channel blocks to 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.740
 two blocks up we're going now 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.420
 tackle the receptacle decoking sea 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.070
 they will allow reproduction 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.130
 all the mother pigs positioning themselves 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.689
 on this block one side of the water source 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.909
 you can then everything surrounded by green 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.380
 around , being careful not to 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.539
 not cut access here is very 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.850
 important it is necessary to put a slab to this 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.500
 place because the adult pigs make a 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.330
 high block so can not pass 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.399
 while ticking babies can 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.780
 pass because they make a half block 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.650
 then just place polishing 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.060
 pistons at this place here a block by 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.209
 top and a button 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.220
 because I remind you we are in 1.8 of 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.400
 so will grow in babies 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.100
 pig in the canal to feed the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.630
 moms it's just going to have to 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.560
 position a dee spencer at this location 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.110
 here put him a bucket of water to 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.989
 the inside and a button on the outside 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.890
 so that when you press water 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.810
 so come adult pigs either 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.000
 euro like these and it will be much more 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.980
 simple for us to feed them our 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.620
 factory is now almost finished 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.870
 oh that for us now from this hole 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.370
 on the side what is it going to be used for any 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.420
 simply to pass water to 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.410
 inside the receptacle abb for that 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.530
 when they grow up 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.160
 blow them up at the TNT only 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.500
 when there is water the tnt does not break 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.870
 nothing that is why he is 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.090
 important to feed the water zone 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.940
 to destroy nothing just 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.630
 realize another small channel I put 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.210
 for example one two three four blocks 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.590
 there is not really any rule in this 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.660
 place if you do what you 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.540
 do I want to do four blocks by 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.090
 example in May of the water inside there 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.790
 must now be able to feed red 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.870
 stone is spencer when you want 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.650
 well it is enough simply to 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.280
 to make a circuit 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.550
 redstone up to a block I have 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.440
 positioned right next to the hole here and 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.470
 so we will not be able to destroy anything 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.940
 letting go of the tnt to know it needs to 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.590
 cover the slab channel for example 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.220
 you can then do your own 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.490
 echo in your factory I do whatever 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.010
 random thing here the option that goes 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.540
 to follow is totally optional to 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.990
 know m a sticky piston here 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:14.520
 position a pressure plate at 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.100
 what is it for? 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.359
 it's simply a protection 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.280
 when you turn on the water if you do not want 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.290
 let her be there 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:32.070
 it is therefore sufficient to position oneself on 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.570
 and it's all right and tender 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.300
 will show you by dropping a block 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.810
 it's just extending the piston 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.560
 to cut off the water so that here we 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:47.570
 has nothing and it is enough 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.070
 to get out of the pressure plate for 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.160
 the water recovering to sink it 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.930
 optional protection but it's 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.780
 always good to have it to do 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.720
 reproduce the pigs in support of this 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.770
 button the pigs wishes indeed 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:08.590
 reproduce when these effect one 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:13.850
 disables Bhutan pushed babies 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.889
 here and they will get there there indeed 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.910
 I may have been a little abused on the spot 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.580
 of mobile 6 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.340
 but there is a lot of it with lots of 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.310
 babies but be careful not to overuse 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.510
 a risk of breaking the machine 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.889
 you see that there are many adults 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:35.810
 so for the demo we will make them fart 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:37.960
 you place your TNT here you activate 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.960
 the water 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.950
 and I just discovered a new 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.800
 function by placing the button next to that 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.780
 activate the tnt at the same time and that 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.370
 farting we have a lot of new 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:57.410
 pig how to optimize the harvest 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:04.250
 places a tnt of one below the 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:06.200
 active button and the water activated the 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:11.180
 hue and and take a sword outing 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:14.240
 in hand the tool 3 it explodes you'll have 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:20.240
 a max of xp that you can recover at 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.190
 Using glitch here and you will have 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.260
 facts outing 3 that will be applied on 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.610
 your harvest how is it done 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.250
 it's just that when 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.140
 turn on a tnt there is a time of 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.140
 answer before it explodes 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:40.550
 see for example we had two 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.050
 ribs using pork now if we 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.710
 the lit immediately understands the sword 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.710
 outing in hand 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:53.910
 we had five the outing effect 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.480
 so is well and truly involved with this 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.880
 method 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.530
 which greatly optimizes your harvest 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.360
 more of this machine is everything 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.910
 simply that it is very inexpensive 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.640
 in redstone there are almost 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.160
 structure blocks the disadvantage and that 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.620
 the cutlets his raw but he's all 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.380
 to actually do here to make the 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.690
 automatic cooking that we can do it 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.450
 below for example but hey it's 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.460
 not the subject of the tutorial to know that 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.410
 I did a design absolutely not 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.840
 compact to you to think for the 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.730
 compact and maximum and you can 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.560
 do a control panel also in 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.800
 relaying the buttons or you want to 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.200
 same place it is a design that is not 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.550
 not optimized but I'm not looking 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.710
 optimization I'm looking for the 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:42.200
 feature I hope this tutorial 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.200
 you will have pleased and I tell you ciao
