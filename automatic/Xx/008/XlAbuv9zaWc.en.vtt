00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.100
 i 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.540

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.970
 I was calling to tell you that I still throw you 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.130
 Unless tonight I'm alone in my 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.740
 room that if you miss me here 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.350
 You have this song, I just tell you, no, 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.419

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.279
 got forgotten do not cheat you're 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.140
 alone is a moment of weakness for a 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.300
 I remember that I'm still anchored in my 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.460
 head I think you're happy or so 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.470
 except you say that but sometimes you have 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.510
 that disguise your sad face after past 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.460
 sleepless nights waiting for a call that 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.590
 would you like to hear my voice and once again from 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.600
 early morning, here you have my voice in 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.550
 can between their helmets perhaps something of my 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.380
 breath I escape from your lips that 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.390
 your eyelids close even if only 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.160
 a moment that you fall asleep between notes and 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.290
 if today is that you kissed me no last 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.210
 time but this since the last times it 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.550
 more than a goodbye he meant a up 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.800
 then one until always heals until 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.810
 be prepared one until life does not 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.729
 join in another side next to you I would like 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.380
 this company knew how to hurt you was 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.630
 special prisoner and one more of those who 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.220
 was by your side perhaps the worst then in 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.930
 the one that most endears you because the one with 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.930
 more strength these to your heart 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.490
 the whole life here is passed by your side 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.620
 the two together hand 80 or 90 years 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.570
 embraced tonight can have us 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.120
 married having had a couple of girl is a 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.890
 dream and has destroyed and buried but 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.110
 that I still have not forgotten because I'm still 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.000
 being that damn crazy in love because 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.590
 you were my life that makes me happy 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.270
 the ways so that now the verse and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.250
 pottages that I can not see 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.200
 do you fail to fail I do not know what 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.030
 I speak as in every conversation in the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.740
 that I remained silent in that form of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.690
 avoid yourself so you do not want to hurt yourself 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.369
 to avoid myself to see that 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.440
 is finished problems is this sweet 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.270
 aroma what makes you remember the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.100
 smell of your profile from that night of 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.660
 November I only ask you not to forget me 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.610
 because I do not plan to do it anymore 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.010
 aggravating this day before I deleted it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.630
 the wind and it's true that my head all 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.690
 it's just like I can not change what 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.670
 I felt when I saw you wake up next to me 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.740
 Sunday mornings I've had them 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.630
 wanted to have felt and lost but 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.370
 I have stayed with dreams more 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.290
 agonizing that when I wake up they make me 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.000
 hit the wall with hate translate into a 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.220
 folio my words these feelings 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.940
 hang by God I can no longer follow 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.940
 with this
