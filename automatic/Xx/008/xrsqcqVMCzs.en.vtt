00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
and breaking hard into a corner dawned

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.090 
and breaking hard into a corner dawned
on<00:03:24.030> me<00:03:24.090> why<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:25.560> brakes<00:03:25.769> shouldn't

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
on me why that is the brakes shouldn't

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.160 
on me why that is the brakes shouldn't
feel<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.459> brake<00:03:26.870> they<00:03:27.870> should<00:03:28.019> feel

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
feel like a brake they should feel

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.259 
feel like a brake they should feel
strong<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:28.830> give<00:03:28.950> plenty<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.280> feedback<00:03:29.549> and

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
strong but give plenty of feedback and

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.210 
strong but give plenty of feedback and
that's<00:03:30.480> why<00:03:30.690> they<00:03:30.840> felt<00:03:31.080> different<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:32.070> old

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
that's why they felt different the old

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.430 
that's why they felt different the old
6,700<00:03:33.060> brakes<00:03:33.299> were<00:03:33.750> good<00:03:33.989> but<00:03:34.260> they<00:03:34.410> were

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
6,700 brakes were good but they were

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.410 
6,700 brakes were good but they were
digital<00:03:35.010> either<00:03:35.400> on<00:03:35.670> or<00:03:35.700> off<00:03:35.820> more<00:03:36.150> or<00:03:36.269> less

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
digital either on or off more or less

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.660 
digital either on or off more or less
but<00:03:37.200> by<00:03:37.350> comparison<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:38.070> breaks<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.459> feels

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
but by comparison this breaks it feels

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.090 
but by comparison this breaks it feels
so<00:03:38.850> much<00:03:38.970> more<00:03:39.030> analog<00:03:39.570> powers<00:03:40.320> 8<00:03:40.620> power<00:03:40.890> is

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
so much more analog powers 8 power is

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.490 
so much more analog powers 8 power is
easy<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.459> generate<00:03:41.850> but<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:42.959> feel<00:03:43.230> how

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
easy to generate but you can feel how

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.020 
easy to generate but you can feel how
this<00:03:43.650> power<00:03:43.920> affects<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.310> bike<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.640> whole<00:03:44.820> lot

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
this power affects the bike a whole lot

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.360 
this power affects the bike a whole lot
better<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.900> means<00:03:46.110> more<00:03:46.320> control<00:03:46.739> which<00:03:47.190> is

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
better this means more control which is

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.340 
better this means more control which is
the<00:03:47.459> point<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.730> brakes<00:03:47.940> really<00:03:48.330> we<00:03:48.900> want<00:03:49.110> to

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
the point of brakes really we want to

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.170 
the point of brakes really we want to
control<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.920> bike<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.340> can<00:03:50.489> go<00:03:50.580> harder<00:03:51.030> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
control the bike so we can go harder and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.380 
control the bike so we can go harder and
be<00:03:51.269> safer<00:03:51.799> now<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.830> now<00:03:53.010> refer<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.640> Gerace<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> bit

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
be safer now I now refer to Gerace a bit

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.060 
be safer now I now refer to Gerace a bit
here<00:03:54.600> because<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.260> really<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.830> benchmark

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070

what<00:04:07.920> there<00:04:08.459> is<00:04:08.549> no<00:04:08.880> doubt<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.299> my<00:04:09.329> mind<00:04:09.450> that

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
what there is no doubt in my mind that

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.720 
what there is no doubt in my mind that
the<00:04:10.049> things<00:04:10.410> we've<00:04:10.590> talked<00:04:10.799> about<00:04:10.920> here<00:04:11.250> are<00:04:11.430> a

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
the things we've talked about here are a

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.789 
the things we've talked about here are a
step<00:04:11.970> up<00:04:12.209> there<00:04:13.200> are<00:04:13.290> other<00:04:13.410> things<00:04:13.620> like

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
step up there are other things like

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.580 
step up there are other things like
decrease<00:04:14.310> weight<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.820> improve<00:04:15.120> durability

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
decrease weight and improve durability

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.719 
decrease weight and improve durability
but<00:04:16.590> what<00:04:16.739> really<00:04:16.919> matters<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.280> me<00:04:17.489> are<00:04:17.609> the

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
but what really matters to me are the

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.240 
but what really matters to me are the
things<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.120> I'll<00:04:18.239> notice<00:04:18.630> when<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.870> write<00:04:19.109> it

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
things that I'll notice when I write it

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.320 
things that I'll notice when I write it
if<00:04:20.250> you're<00:04:20.400> thinking<00:04:20.430> about<00:04:20.669> stepping<00:04:20.970> up<00:04:21.209> to

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
if you're thinking about stepping up to

11 speed or even just looking for some
precise<00:04:23.879> shifting<00:04:24.330> there's<00:04:25.050> no<00:04:25.229> doubt<00:04:25.440> that

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
precise shifting there's no doubt that

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.100 
precise shifting there's no doubt that
