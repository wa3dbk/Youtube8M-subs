actually I probably went for risk

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.910 
actually I probably went for risk
regardless<00:02:12.210> if<00:02:12.750> she<00:02:12.960> hid<00:02:13.140> their<00:02:13.320> confusion<00:02:13.680> or

this pad Garuda I'm actually gonna live

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.180 
this pad Garuda I'm actually gonna live
yeah<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:46.170> actually<00:02:46.410> gonna<00:02:46.680> get<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.980> roost

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
yeah I'm actually gonna get the roost

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.090 
yeah I'm actually gonna get the roost
though<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.640> that's<00:02:47.820> just<00:02:48.030> her<00:02:48.590> she<00:02:49.590> had<00:02:49.680> max<00:02:49.890> HP

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
though so that's just her she had max HP

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.040 
though so that's just her she had max HP
obviously<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:50.910> would<00:02:51.060> have<00:02:51.150> died<00:02:51.300> because<00:02:51.510> I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
obviously I would have died because I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.510 
obviously I would have died because I
grew<00:02:52.410> there<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:52.860> has<00:02:52.980> more<00:02:53.130> HP<00:02:53.280> than

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
grew there actually has more HP than

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.870 
grew there actually has more HP than

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
scissor meaning that well how lucky Emma

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.670 
scissor meaning that well how lucky Emma
works<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.540> amount<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.840> HP<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:58.320> have<00:02:58.560> was

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
works is the amount of HP you have was

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.870 
works is the amount of HP you have was
the<00:02:58.800> amount<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.100> damage<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.520> does<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.790> your

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
the amount of damage it does to your

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.140 
the amount of damage it does to your
opponent<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.020> thinks<00:03:01.230> max<00:03:01.440> HP<00:03:01.860> is<00:03:02.370> 364th

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
opponent so that thinks max HP is 364th

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.960 
opponent so that thinks max HP is 364th
means<00:03:03.480> max<00:03:04.440> damage<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.190> can<00:03:05.250> do<00:03:05.400> Denise<00:03:05.610> basics

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
means max damage it can do Denise basics

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.120 
means max damage it can do Denise basics
before<00:03:06.120> anyways<00:03:06.480> she's<00:03:07.410> gonna<00:03:07.530> code<00:03:07.800> for<00:03:08.040> the

every<00:03:36.019> time<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.260> face<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.739> every<00:03:37.189> single<00:03:37.609> time<00:03:37.790> I

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
every time I face a every single time I

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.750 
every time I face a every single time I
get<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.269> suit<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:39.139> get<00:03:39.469> a<00:03:39.499> prior<00:03:39.739> off<00:03:40.099> because

get in a suit I get a prior off because

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.679 
get in a suit I get a prior off because
it's<00:03:40.939> just<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:41.359> like<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:43.010> then<00:03:43.450> attack<00:03:44.450> that

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
it's just so like that then attack that

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:45.940 
it's just so like that then attack that
it<00:03:44.810> uses<00:03:44.989> ancient<00:03:45.499> song

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
it uses ancient song

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.890 
it uses ancient song
there's<00:03:46.519> always<00:03:46.639> switching<00:03:46.939> types<00:03:47.329> so<00:03:47.569> it's

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
there's always switching types so it's

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.679 
there's always switching types so it's
kind<00:03:48.139> of<00:03:48.200> hard<00:03:48.409> to<00:03:48.650> just<00:03:49.269> like<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.359> go<00:03:50.480> for<00:03:50.629> the

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
kind of hard to just like I go for the

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.209 
kind of hard to just like I go for the

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:52.219 
become mightier predicting the chair up

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.069 
become mightier predicting the chair up
and<00:03:52.459> now<00:03:53.060> I'm<00:03:53.120> doing<00:03:53.329> good<00:03:53.450> for<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.629> focus<00:03:53.900> but
