to to lift this this up okay so the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.360 
to to lift this this up okay so the
whole<00:02:21.569> assembly<00:02:21.989> comes<00:02:22.230> away<00:02:22.560> you've<00:02:23.130> got<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
whole assembly comes away you've got to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.800 
whole assembly comes away you've got to
work<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.790> out<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> little<00:02:24.209> bit<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.510> you've<00:02:24.690> got
