of food and one of the main reasons why

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.810 
of food and one of the main reasons why
was<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.149> pig<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.809> eat<00:00:43.020> anything<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.860> pig<00:00:44.579> it's

but<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> pig<00:00:48.480> were<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.930> its<00:00:49.110> own<00:00:49.379> dead<00:00:49.710> child<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
but a pig were it its own dead child a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.330 
but a pig were it its own dead child a
pig<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.660> eat<00:00:51.809> other<00:00:52.050> sick<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.770> infected

animals<00:00:54.090> they're<00:00:54.420> scavengers<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.320> what's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
animals they're scavengers and what's

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
animals they're scavengers and what's
interesting<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.270> pig<00:00:57.539> has<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
interesting is the pig has one of the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.670 
interesting is the pig has one of the
quickest<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.120> porous<00:01:00.120> digestive<00:01:00.989> systems<00:01:01.469> of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
quickest and porous digestive systems of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860 
quickest and porous digestive systems of
any<00:01:02.010> animal<00:01:02.280> takes<00:01:02.820> only<00:01:03.000> four<00:01:03.300> hours<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
any animal takes only four hours and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
any animal takes only four hours and
that's<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.760> digestive

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that's not good because the digestive

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.560 
that's not good because the digestive
system<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.320> quick<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:07.979> poor<00:01:08.640> many

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
system is so quick and so poor many

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.649 
system is so quick and so poor many
times<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.710> toxins<00:01:11.369> from<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.760> food<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.390> not

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
times the toxins from the food are not

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
times the toxins from the food are not
properly<00:01:13.100> eliminated<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.820> stored

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
properly eliminated and they are stored

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.320 
properly eliminated and they are stored
in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> pigs<00:01:15.960> fat<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:17.250> means<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.759> pig<00:01:18.150> can

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
in the pigs fat that means that pig can

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.179 
in the pigs fat that means that pig can
eat<00:01:18.450> all<00:01:18.570> kinds<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:19.020> filth<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.590> garbage<00:01:19.860> it

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
