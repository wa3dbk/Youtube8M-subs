00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.053
 Ego, or Latin - me. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.580
 Ego is one of the basic concepts in the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud. 

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:24.400
 Ego is us, our zone of consciousness. 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.453
 Ego is a resonance band, space, 

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:33.146
 which we feel and identify as Ja. 

00:00:33.146 --> 00:00:36.406
 Ego is a Pentagram phone. 

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:41.273
 Pentagram Ego is a phone equipped with two SIM card slots 

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:43.533
 with support for the Aero 2 network, 

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.213
 which provides free internet access. 

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:49.780
 Traditionally, slots have been placed under the lid. 

00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:54.646
 There is also a Micro SD card slot next to it, and a battery below. 

00:00:55.213 --> 00:00:57.360
 The lid is plastic and white. 

00:00:58.046 --> 00:01:02.653
 A similar color is the edges of the phone, which in effect looks very nice. 

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:06.313
 At the bottom edge, the producer only placed a microphone. 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.713
 On the left, in turn, we find only the volume control button, 

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.113
 on the right - the power key. 

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:18.340
 At the top there are two sockets - headphone and USB mic 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.886
 used to charge your smartphone and connect to a computer. 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.733
 The back of the phone has been equipped with a flash, camera and loudspeaker. 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.040
 The front is of course primarily a 4.5-inch IPS display 

00:01:32.213 --> 00:01:35.873
 with 960 x 540 resolution, 

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:40.606
 The screen displays very vivid colors and also has good contrast. 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.173
 Above it there is a proximity sensor for the loudspeaker and a camera. 

00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:51.160
 Below the screen there are three classic android buttons, 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.300
 and under them - the notification light. 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.680
 The phone is pleasantly in the palm of your hand, giving the impression of being longer than wider, 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.893
 which in turn facilitates speaking. 

00:02:02.053 --> 00:02:04.746
 The weight does not differ from typical smartphones. 

00:02:04.746 --> 00:02:08.260
 it is thinner than most competing models. 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.940
 A Snapdragon processor was installed on the Pentagram Ego 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.833
 supplemented with the Andreno graphic layout, 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.300
 768MB of memory and 4GB of built-in memory. 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.413
 All are responsible for the Android operating system version 4.0.4.
