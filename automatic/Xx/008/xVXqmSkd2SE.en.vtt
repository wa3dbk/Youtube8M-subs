they<00:02:00.719> both<00:02:00.899> chose<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:02.040> white<00:02:02.850> /<00:02:03.329> grey<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.290> grant

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
they both chose a white / grey but grant

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.980 
they both chose a white / grey but grant
would<00:02:04.740> work<00:02:05.009> fine<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.420> ended<00:02:06.869> up

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
would work fine but then I ended up

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.869 
would work fine but then I ended up
choosing<00:02:07.200> gold<00:02:07.710> accessories<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.550> would

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
choosing gold accessories so I would

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.529 
choosing gold accessories so I would
still<00:02:09.149> pick<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.360> white<00:02:09.569> one<00:02:09.750> over

and as you guys can see it's too only

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.420 
and as you guys can see it's too only
one<00:04:42.870> thing<00:04:43.140> in<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.500> center<00:04:43.890> and<00:04:43.920> I<00:04:44.190> didn't

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
reason why I picked this outfit is

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.550 
reason why I picked this outfit is
because<00:06:05.400> it<00:06:05.820> was<00:06:06.360> a<00:06:06.390> really<00:06:06.660> hot<00:06:06.930> day<00:06:06.960> today<00:06:07.170> so

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
because it was a really hot day today so

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.550 
because it was a really hot day today so
um<00:06:08.370> but<00:06:09.120> I<00:06:09.150> do<00:06:09.270> have<00:06:09.510> school<00:06:09.810> so<00:06:09.960> I<00:06:10.020> do<00:06:10.110> want<00:06:10.410> to

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
um but I do have school so I do want to

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.260 
um but I do have school so I do want to
go<00:06:10.680> with<00:06:10.860> shorts<00:06:11.340> or<00:06:11.430> a<00:06:11.550> skirt<00:06:11.580> or<00:06:11.940> something

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
go with shorts or a skirt or something

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.120 
go with shorts or a skirt or something
so<00:06:12.720> I<00:06:12.750> did<00:06:12.810> go<00:06:13.080> with<00:06:13.260> regular<00:06:13.620> jeans<00:06:13.920> just

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
so I did go with regular jeans just

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.380 
so I did go with regular jeans just
because<00:06:14.460> they're<00:06:14.610> casual<00:06:15.060> and<00:06:15.270> they're

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
because they're casual and they're

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.510 
because they're casual and they're
comfortable<00:06:15.810> and<00:06:16.080> then<00:06:16.650> I<00:06:16.680> picked<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:17.280> top

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.210 
comfortable and then I picked the top
because<00:06:17.910> I<00:06:18.000> didn't<00:06:18.480> want<00:06:18.510> to<00:06:18.720> wear<00:06:18.870> a<00:06:18.930> to
