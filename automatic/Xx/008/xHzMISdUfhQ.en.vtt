00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.650
 so listen sir alary hello whose 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.510
 you are a public figure so 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.199
 Republic 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.449
 I wanted to do it for the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.769
 back home so talk to us about your little ones 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.810
 scruples as a lexicologist at 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.970
 know the words so the birth of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 words their course and ultimately even 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.199
 their senses then learned that very often 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 we say that the meaning of words makes sense 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.850
 of a sentence it really depends on 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.320
 mummies of the deceased member is not 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.610
 all in case my soul's stadiums and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.680
 mummies in the sentence 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.090
 It really depends on 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.469
 the arrangement of the mountains in the sentence 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.270
 is that that gives meaning for example if 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.840
 you take a phrase that looks like 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.579
 lopez tape morin and morin tape lopez 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.850
 there are the same mans and yet it's 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.199
 not the same as badly and you it's not 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 that's not what you're interested in 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.820
 you what what tickles you is the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.359
 senses that exist in every word all 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.489
 only 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.080
 lopez alone you have all alone morin 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.880
 alone to say that you make of it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.220
 what titillates you finally do not know 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.290
 the beauty of the necklace not the arrangement 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.610
 water repellent trail is the pearl itself 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.900
 the pair yet take it like that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.490
 when we look at her what is she 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 tells where it comes from 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 in the oyster you what do you like in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 done it's the oyster cc it rolls so he 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.390
 put in the molds you like the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.930
 mold if you like the muss I do not want 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.490
 to say that this is your own 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.320
 circus we see here is one word 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.400
 that changes between you ml you like from a 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.610
 mold and right away we have others 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.610
 imagery 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.320
 the oyster farmer of the culture are you 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.729
 look and form homo in its 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.770
 context as we could keep a 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.170
 pearl form in the seashell at 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.490
 tide tell that for the world 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.079
 it's like for the pearl this start well 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.009
 an accident not a grain of sand in 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.960
 the mold and in angola him and then in 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.000
 public on this sand grain are going to get 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.890
 deposit successive layers of nac 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.360
 who will give the pearl the same way that 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.979
 first for the wet an accident and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.840
 then evolutionary transformation 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.849
 appropriation so we will take some 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.350
 examples a sure man for example me the 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.319
 word vinegar the day I discovered 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.150
 vinegar sour wine messi but here it is 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.950
 is the guy who happened he made 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.080
 mold his wine instead of throwing it away and 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.069
 not talk about it he spun a buddy to 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.930
 well during my six months if he drinks 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.180
 montbarrey nicola group and that's it and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.640
 his final outfits where for example the word 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.370
 facing the seated das one the rest is to 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.470
 eybens and certainly what the guy the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.790
 French with a total mandate that he 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.810
 hear black noise but that makes strong 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.530
 he means honestly what is that 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.610
 it is but normandy he believes that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.610
 it's the window that's called like that 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.239
 and after there is also a lot for them 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.989
 plants and rosemary no it's not 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.010
 that's not the dandelion the dandelion 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.660
 well, the guy who made an infusion 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.170
 and call them like that royer was 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.760
 not done 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.230
 we see that there is first the word is not 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.060
 that she is the word that is the world 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.190
 as claude lemonnier would say and 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.180
 then the word evolved the homo seeks himself 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.280
 the moc is at the whim of moods and 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.350
 times so the words rider times morale 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.750
 sometimes the teasing times the dead 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.139
 to rents they evolve over time 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.639
 once the motorcycles default the bikers 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.780
 story that boils down in the word is 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.000
 in the same way as if we 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.400
 scratch the layers of mother-of-pearl on the pearl 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.810
 and ben in sixth we scratch the word as 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.200
 that we can reconstruct all its sound 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.730
 history 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.130
 and I see for example there is a 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.980
 beach where I often go wearing the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.540
 name the best one sees the best page 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.700
 times that a year ago the fact that they who 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.130
 sounds very professional 25 years as well as 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.190
 vegetables tianhe the gabian them them 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.270
 smelts lifted 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.070
 of white wine and yet if we scratch the 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.720
 polish of the southern orthography that is 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.910
 what we see and that this pair is not 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.920
 but the best beaches the 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.300
 bear because order and that's how 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.520
 what had the Allied 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.350
 americans frankly demarcating 44 out of 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.910
 the lands no it's true and yes it's 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.410
 true and then certainly now 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.270
 the inn we know a word this all 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.560
 little my but that reminds us that if 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.270
 cattle today we can see 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.330
 the redone breasts of liberated women 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.130
 it's because one day there was 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.380
 released by former heavy helmets 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.269
 past etc from six nowadays eh 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.900
 Ben the bombs failed on this beach 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.609
 are more the same 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.609
 it remains explosive
