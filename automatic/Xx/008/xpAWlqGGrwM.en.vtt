of<00:02:36.380> them<00:02:36.500> as<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.769> said<00:02:37.010> we're<00:02:37.370> probably<00:02:37.489> safe

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
sure if I agree with that fully because

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.830 
sure if I agree with that fully because
I<00:03:04.370> know<00:03:04.430> who<00:03:04.760> couldn't<00:03:05.239> pull<00:03:05.389> out<00:03:05.540> something

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
to go I expected a top half finish and

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.920 
to go I expected a top half finish and
we<00:04:58.580> should<00:04:58.850> be<00:04:59.000> getting<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.270> top<00:04:59.450> half<00:04:59.630> finish

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
they always were singing and that's what

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.760 
they always were singing and that's what
we<00:05:41.539> need<00:05:41.720> we<00:05:41.840> need<00:05:41.900> to<00:05:42.050> get<00:05:42.169> behind<00:05:42.259> the<00:05:42.620> lines

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
we need we need to get behind the lines

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.649 
we need we need to get behind the lines
but<00:05:42.949> it's<00:05:43.039> so<00:05:43.220> hard<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.610> when<00:05:44.240> we're<00:05:44.389> sitting

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
but it's so hard to when we're sitting

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.860 
but it's so hard to when we're sitting
so<00:05:44.990> deep<00:05:45.409> and<00:05:46.340> when<00:05:46.520> we<00:05:46.610> do<00:05:46.789> get<00:05:47.000> forward<00:05:47.449> we're

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
so deep and when we do get forward we're

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.589 
so deep and when we do get forward we're
just<00:05:48.050> very<00:05:48.349> wasteful<00:05:48.949> and<00:05:49.360> that's<00:05:50.360> what

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
just very wasteful and that's what

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.450 
just very wasteful and that's what
that's<00:05:51.139> why<00:05:51.289> I'm<00:05:51.349> not<00:05:51.469> mad<00:05:51.680> massive<00:05:52.129> fan<00:05:52.310> off
