00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.770
 we are happy to meet you again at 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.570
 the news from our orchards 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.400
 the flowering period and fruiting 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.220
 call attention to our growers 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.020
 in this video from the end of March to the beginning of June 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.800
 You will see how you perform daily activities 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.800
 in this sensor 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.989
 at the end of the winter after the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.980
 severe frost the growers go the trees 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.540
 pruning 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.820
 they choose the best fruit branches and 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.500
 the excess buds remove 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.270
 quantity of fruit must be limited 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.270
 to prevent the branches from breaking 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.160
 this also ensures that the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.579
 future apples plenty of sunshine 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.579
 to get 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.190
 The goal is that the fruit be a good one 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.560
 color gets as a sign from the rich 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.690
 taste and that production in regular 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.689
 has quality with a good variation 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.040
 of the calibers at the time of harvest 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.290
 the flowering time is an important period 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.520
 for the success of the harvest the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.240
 apple trees cannot themselves 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.920
 fertilize 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.899
 therefore the growers in the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.759
 orchards for pollination others 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.720
 apple varieties planted that on 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.720
 bloom at the same time 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.150
 the apple tree blossom consists of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.890
 five little farmer 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.480
 the flower in the middle goes first 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 Open 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.680
 enter their lifetime amount 2 to 10 days 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.040
 pollination must take place in this short period 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.040
 Place 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.670
 the with you and sometimes the day to play with us 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.850
 the main role for a successful one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.850
 fertilization 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.479
 from the beehives that come in at once 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.800
 placed near the orchard 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.690
 they go from flower to flower to 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.990
 enjoy the numerous and nutritious 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.990
 bump 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.110
 to protect the future apples 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.260
 the growers place pheromone dispensers 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.820
 go into the tree 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.890
 this happens before the start of the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.570
 reproduction period of the fruit moth 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.640
 chief attacker of the apples 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.040
 this prevents mating and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.080
 so multiplication limits this 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.210
 preventive sustainable and not kill 'the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.210
 method does not affect biodiversity 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.910
 when the apples begin to grow 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.230
 following growers and qualitative 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.300
 selection from 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.890
 they remove the excess deformed 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.540
 and damaged apples to get a good one 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.930
 distribution of the most beautiful fruits too 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.930
 guarantee 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.360
 is the optimum number of apples per branch 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.360
 depending on the thickness of the branch 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.420
 the quality the format and the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.740
 sugar content of the apple 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.960
 are determined by the nutrition of the 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.590
 tree and therefore due to the soil quality in the 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.590
 photosynthesis 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.660
 the growers check whether the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.760
 nutrients that are necessary 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.870
 for growth and fill it if necessary 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.850
 to 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.160
 thanks to sins placed in the soil 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.810
 pass on information to and measure box 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.760
 they can also be of the drip irrigation at 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.320
 set the right one without waste 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.240
 amount of water to give for one 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.600
 harmonious development of the tree and 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.600
 the corridor 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.090
 to do 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.609
 selective and effective 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.040
 pruning method a careful and optimal 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.959
 pollination and protective and controlled 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.489
 fruit developments 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.950
 the growers are working every day 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.689
 with a goal in mind production 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.189
 of quality apples that meet the 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.189
 requirements of the pink lady quality mark
