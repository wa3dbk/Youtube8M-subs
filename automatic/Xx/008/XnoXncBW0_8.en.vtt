00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that under circles in my jump let's say

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.340 
that under circles in my jump let's say
10<00:01:10.080> meters<00:01:10.409> better<00:01:11.390> my<00:01:12.390> first<00:01:12.659> jump<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:13.049> not

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
10 meters better my first jump was not

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.399 
10 meters better my first jump was not
the<00:01:13.470> best<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.900> relaxed

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the best one so I was not so relaxed

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.020 
the best one so I was not so relaxed
when<00:01:17.150> I<00:01:18.150> heard<00:01:18.479> analyst<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.400> behind<00:01:20.400> me<00:01:20.670> after

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
when I heard analyst was behind me after

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.810 
when I heard analyst was behind me after
the<00:01:21.119> first<00:01:21.270> jumped<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.490> was<00:01:23.490> really

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the first jumped and I I was really

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.819 
the first jumped and I I was really
relaxed<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.820> yeah<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.200> think<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.560> was

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
relaxed there and yeah I think this was

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.719 
relaxed there and yeah I think this was
a<00:01:29.689> really<00:01:30.689> nice<00:01:30.990> point<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.530> me<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.729> the
