with it here at all sometimes not even

with it here at all sometimes not even
really<00:02:18.980> paying<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.520> close<00:02:19.700> attention<00:02:20.270> dude

really paying that close attention dude
that<00:02:20.840> fence<00:02:21.170> just<00:02:21.470> totally<00:02:21.950> appeared<00:02:22.310> for<00:02:22.490> no

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
that fence just totally appeared for no

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.350 
that fence just totally appeared for no
reason<00:02:22.990> but<00:02:23.990> um<00:02:24.250> yeah<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.670> seemed<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.180> lot

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
reason but um yeah this seemed a lot

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.280 
reason but um yeah this seemed a lot
harder<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.959> my<00:02:26.990> head<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.740> don't<00:02:28.340> know<00:02:28.430> why<00:02:28.610> I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
harder in my head I don't know why I

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.630 
harder in my head I don't know why I
think<00:02:30.290> originally<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:31.010> wanted<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.490> do

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
think originally I wanted to do

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.460 
think originally I wanted to do
something<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.270> like<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.750> link<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.290> past

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
something with like a link to the past

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.390 
something with like a link to the past
or<00:02:33.860> something<00:02:34.370> because<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:36.230> don't<00:02:36.860> know<00:02:36.920> part

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
or something because I don't know part

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.800 
or something because I don't know part
of<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.550> problem<00:02:37.700> with<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.150> though<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.510> that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
of the problem with that though is that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.660 
of the problem with that though is that
you<00:02:39.050> have<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.290> keep<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.680> original<00:02:40.160> chicken<00:02:40.400> on

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
you have to keep the original chicken on

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.840 
you have to keep the original chicken on
screen<00:02:41.150> otherwise<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.220> chicken<00:02:43.580> stop

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
screen otherwise that the chicken stop

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.280 
screen otherwise that the chicken stop
attacking<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.750> didn't<00:02:44.959> make<00:02:45.080> much<00:02:45.230> sense

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
attacking you it didn't make much sense

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.420 
attacking you it didn't make much sense
to<00:02:45.650> me<00:02:45.860> but<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.100> know<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.420> yeah<00:02:48.200> see<00:02:48.890> it's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
to me but you know so yeah see it's

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.310 
to me but you know so yeah see it's
obviously<00:02:49.850> fairly<00:02:50.330> easy<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.630> manipulate<00:02:50.930> the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
obviously fairly easy to manipulate the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.530 
obviously fairly easy to manipulate the
chickens<00:02:51.739> it<00:02:51.890> kind<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.280> leave<00:02:52.730> back<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.180> forth

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
chickens it kind of leave back and forth

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.190 
chickens it kind of leave back and forth
that<00:02:53.780> now<00:02:54.260> noticed<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.270> know<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:57.050> know

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
that now noticed so you know you know

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.500 
that now noticed so you know you know
plus<00:02:57.680> they<00:02:57.890> also<00:02:58.040> fly<00:02:58.430> right<00:02:58.820> on<00:02:58.970> through<00:02:59.330> you

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
plus they also fly right on through you

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.720 
plus they also fly right on through you
it<00:02:59.690> doesn't<00:02:59.870> really<00:03:00.050> make<00:03:00.260> much<00:03:00.320> sense<00:03:00.730> you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
it doesn't really make much sense you

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.449 
it doesn't really make much sense you
know<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.239> really<00:03:02.420> doesn't<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.650> um<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.340> know

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
know it really doesn't so um you know

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.340 
know it really doesn't so um you know
I'm<00:03:04.730> already<00:03:05.000> on<00:03:05.150> lap<00:03:05.480> three<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.870> haven't<00:03:06.230> done

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
I'm already on lap three I haven't done

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.250 
I'm already on lap three I haven't done
anything<00:03:07.510> particularly<00:03:08.510> interesting<00:03:08.630> in

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
anything particularly interesting in

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.720 
anything particularly interesting in
this<00:03:09.350> video<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.980> guess<00:03:11.950> next<00:03:12.950> challenge<00:03:13.549> i'm

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
this video I guess next challenge i'm

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.460 
this video I guess next challenge i'm
probably<00:03:14.150> going<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.660> do<00:03:14.840> I'm<00:03:15.140> going<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.320> have

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
probably going to do I'm going to have

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.410 
probably going to do I'm going to have
like<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.739> separate<00:03:16.220> update<00:03:16.580> video<00:03:16.940> at<00:03:17.180> some

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
like a separate update video at some

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.840 
like a separate update video at some
point<00:03:17.690> in<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.870> near<00:03:18.019> future<00:03:18.080> for<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:18.890> kind

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
point in the near future for that kind

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.130 
point in the near future for that kind
of<00:03:19.910> doing<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> same<00:03:20.450> thing<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.810> did<00:03:20.870> before

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
of doing the same thing I did before

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.170 
of doing the same thing I did before
where<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.620> kind<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:21.980> announce<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.489> game<00:03:22.670> first

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
where I kind of announce the game first

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.780 
where I kind of announce the game first
and<00:03:23.540> then<00:03:23.660> eventually<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.190> video<00:03:25.579> about

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
and then eventually have a video about

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.240 
and then eventually have a video about
it<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.690> know<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.959> sort<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.290> thing<00:03:27.350> give<00:03:28.130> you

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
it you know that sort of thing give you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.310 
it you know that sort of thing give you
a<00:03:28.310> chance<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.700> prepare<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.540> know<00:03:29.660> all<00:03:30.140> that

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
a chance to prepare you know all that

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.100 
a chance to prepare you know all that
kind<00:03:30.380> of<00:03:30.650> stuff<00:03:30.709> yeah<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:31.880> suppose<00:03:32.840> as<00:03:33.019> an

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
kind of stuff yeah I suppose as an

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.800 
kind of stuff yeah I suppose as an
alternative<00:03:33.650> i<00:03:33.799> could<00:03:34.040> probably<00:03:34.430> no<00:03:35.030> no<00:03:35.329> I

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
alternative i could probably no no I

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.670 
alternative i could probably no no I
could<00:03:36.500> probably<00:03:36.739> um<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.959> don't<00:03:38.959> know<00:03:39.170> make<00:03:39.470> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
could probably um I don't know make the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.160 
could probably um I don't know make the
video<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.549> just<00:03:40.730> extend<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.420> time<00:03:41.630> limit<00:03:42.079> or

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
video and just extend the time limit or

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.800 
video and just extend the time limit or
something<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.739> don't<00:03:42.829> know<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.450> suppose<00:03:44.450> I'll

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
something I don't know I suppose I'll

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.240 
something I don't know I suppose I'll
leave<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.019> up<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.620> guys<00:03:45.650> because<00:03:46.040> I'm
