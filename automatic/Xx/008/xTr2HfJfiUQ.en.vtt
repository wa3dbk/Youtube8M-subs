00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.540
 and on the web 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.689
 hi to all at all friendly wiki CGT 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.919
 how are you me I'm fine 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.289
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.230
 little particular video because it 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.640
 this is simply there will not be 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.470
 of gameplay already we will not talk about 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.570
 foot not talk about since fake know 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.100
 just a little tutorial we can 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.010
 call it a tutor how to be 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.820
 to have free fifo points without 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.260
 use money 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.390
 so it's simple that we could 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.860
 see already after my intro and I put 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.379
 a small intro of the site called 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 xbox paradise do not worry it's 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.030
 xbox but it also works for 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.890
 playstation3 and for pc in fact it was 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.440
 just not you can have 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.170
 free microsoft points cards 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.049
 psn free and on pc I do not know 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.220
 what's it called so I'm sorry 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.390
 so already just when you 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.909
 are when you are on the site 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.040
 so I'm already connected so he 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.689
 will have a little english connection so 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.369
 connect nothing more complicated 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.530
 you will put a username and password 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.970
 an email address you accept the email 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.890
 by clicking on the link and here you are 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.799
 are connected then you will tell me 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.330
 games what is the site for the site 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.700
 it's just that you're going 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.039
 to be able to realize your package 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 portable have to say its faults you 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.119
 have a package and that often at the end 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.189
 of the month he could go 10 even 5 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.770
 euros on your package and will you go 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.490
 to be able to concretize this low cost 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.229
 credits and be able to concretize we're going 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.890
 tell this credit in psn cards 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.939
 so for that jo you go on the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.759
 little tab called credit so 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.909
 you click on it 1 to the water nothing 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.789
 of sorcerer so we could see you 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.670
 have different payment methods 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.670
 whether it's mobile sms audiotel 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.810
 after you paid directly by 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.220
 credit card prayssas may not be 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.990
 badly i will come back after why so 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.550
 simply i'm on the tab at 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.400
 water because we could see you have 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.400
 of hosts are you throw yourself a little gore 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.810
 low excuse me the little bug when 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.840
 we could see you can change 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.490
 then you send a sms wants the sms 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.930
 you sort of you will be penniless I do not 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.080
 know it is not said but we are 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.300
 stamp here and it will be fixed 80 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.210
 50 on your credit and that will make you 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.400
 earn 105 credit then I have Roma 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.700
 she is very worthy I have nothing to 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.840
 fuck 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.970
 what are we doing credits after 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.040
 and well I come here I come here do you 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.830
 do not worry guys so then you 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.480
 simply have it in shop 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.570
 down to the water I think everything is fine 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.430
 and there you can see that look 20 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.070
 euros the card pay the one of 20 euros that 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.490
 costs 1050 points so and the trick that 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.490
 is good too 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.020
 so the thing that's good is that 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.440
 here he could have you also 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.640
 psn cards 5 or 10 or sorry I made 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.190
 a dodo killer I hope it's not 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.120
 too heard you have psn cards from 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.590
 5 10 15 and 20 euros 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.850
 so frankly it's not bad then 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.790
 you can even take a subscription 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.380
 at playstation more so already after 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.620
 nothing more simple you do on ht 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.750
 whose age is not I do not have the credits 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.940
 we will say and we could see you 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.830
 have a promotion code 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.300
 what is the promotion code actually 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.650
 it's going to be said as I signed a 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.890
 little pact of how to explain to a 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:48.310
 little partnership pack we will say 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.410
 iman all kindly offered a code of 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.390
 promotion so the code as can go 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.300
 freeze noted c8 which ps n 10 on the other hand 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.830
 really sorry but the promo code 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.510
 relies only on the playstation 3 which 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.420
 that you will not be able to see points 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.209
 microsoft really sorry and being myself 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.970
 serves to see how 10% did not separate 1 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.100
 10% still 10% goes on your purchase 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.959
 of the psn map so instead of seeing her 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.690
 we're going to say 10% of a ps map of bone a 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.420
 does 1050 credit down calculations and 10% 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.100
 sinking credit in less so that's getting 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.940
 you still pay more than 900 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.980
 then around 950 credit or the 2050 credit 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.280
 so I think it's still okay 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.540
 it's not bad so here I did a 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.370
 little tour of the site then it's 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.840
 exactly the same this sound if you have a 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.760
 worry my skype and in the description 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.620
 do not hesitate then I would like 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.800
 thank arm sergio what is down 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.300

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.370
 this site I know that are the two to handle 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.290

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.210
 skype we talked a lot about skype 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.550

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.790

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.970

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.270
