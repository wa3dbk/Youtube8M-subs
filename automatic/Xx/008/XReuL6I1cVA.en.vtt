all<00:00:20.640> good<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.570> their<00:00:21.750> own<00:00:21.779> use<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.519> there<00:00:23.519> are

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
all good in their own use but there are

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.810 
all good in their own use but there are
certain<00:00:24.180> times<00:00:24.480> when<00:00:24.990> me<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.340> an<00:00:26.490> angler

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
certain times when me I as an angler

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.779 
certain times when me I as an angler
just<00:00:27.090> want<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> fine-tune<00:00:27.510> things<00:00:28.429> and<00:00:29.429> this

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
just want to fine-tune things and this

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.970 
just want to fine-tune things and this
usually<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> shade<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> groundbait

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
usually is the shade of the groundbait

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.400 
usually is the shade of the groundbait
so<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:32.940> thing<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.750> I'm<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.230> big

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
so one thing I really do I'm a big

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.590 
so one thing I really do I'm a big
believer<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.790> using<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.980> black<00:00:38.270> swim<00:00:39.270> stem

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
believer in is using the black swim stem

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.520 
believer in is using the black swim stem
now<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:41.820> allows<00:00:42.149> me<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.809> slightly<00:00:43.170> older

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
now this allows me just a slightly older

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.740 
now this allows me just a slightly older
shade<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> groundbait<00:00:44.940> when<00:00:45.270> needed<00:00:45.719> so

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
shade of the groundbait when needed so

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
shade of the groundbait when needed so
take<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.500> example<00:00:46.590> today<00:00:47.250> we're<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
take for example today we're on the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.090 
take for example today we're on the
local<00:00:48.000> lake<00:00:48.239> only<00:00:48.899> using<00:00:49.620> red<00:00:49.800> krill

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
local lake only using red krill

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.760 
local lake only using red krill
groundbait<00:00:50.719> but<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.930> want<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> darken<00:00:52.410> off

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
groundbait but I just want to darken off

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
groundbait but I just want to darken off
just<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.219> little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.270> bright

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
just a little bit so it's not as bright

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.889 
just a little bit so it's not as bright
and<00:00:55.699> obviously<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.149> helps<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> fish

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and obviously it just helps the fish

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
and obviously it just helps the fish
give<00:00:58.170> more<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> bit<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.859> confidence<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.489> my

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
give more a bit more confidence in my

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
give more a bit more confidence in my
belief<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.359> coming<00:01:00.660> down<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.960> edge<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> bit

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
belief just coming down the edge a bit

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.759 
belief just coming down the edge a bit
quicker<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.619> is<00:01:04.619> I'm

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
quicker so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.719 
quicker so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.040> some<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.339> red<00:01:05.519> krill<00:01:07.729> I'm

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
going to get some of this red krill I'm

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.679 
going to get some of this red krill I'm
going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> mix<00:01:09.150> them<00:01:09.330> all<00:01:11.150> now<00:01:12.150> I've<00:01:12.420> already

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
going to mix them all now I've already

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.740 
going to mix them all now I've already
mixed<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> groundbait<00:01:14.060> for<00:01:15.060> today's<00:01:15.390> but

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
mixed up the groundbait for today's but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.969 
mixed up the groundbait for today's but
I'm<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.049> show<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> difference<00:01:16.799> in

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
I'm going to show you the difference in

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.469 
I'm going to show you the difference in
shades<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:22.700> little<00:01:23.700> bit<00:01:23.820> what<00:01:24.000> I'm<00:01:24.150> only<00:01:24.299> going

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
shades a little bit what I'm only going

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.760 
shades a little bit what I'm only going
to<00:01:24.509> mix<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.900> little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> show<00:01:25.710> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to mix up a little bit just to show you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.300 
to mix up a little bit just to show you
the<00:01:25.890> difference<00:01:27.290> now<00:01:28.290> I've<00:01:28.590> been<00:01:28.770> using<00:01:28.950> red

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the difference now I've been using red

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.039 
the difference now I've been using red
cloth<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.790> ages<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.930> good

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
cloth for ages really really good

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.700 
cloth for ages really really good
groundbait<00:01:32.750> but<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.840> course<00:01:33.900> will<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.409> black

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
groundbait but of course will this black

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.270 
groundbait but of course will this black
you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.670> change<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> core<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> which

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
you can just change the core of it which

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.450 
you can just change the core of it which
has<00:01:38.280> its<00:01:38.549> advantages<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:43.740> roughly<00:01:44.040> mix<00:01:44.310> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
has its advantages it's roughly mix it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.310 
has its advantages it's roughly mix it
up

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:08.580 

so<00:01:53.320> riddle<00:02:01.860> push<00:02:02.860> everything<00:02:03.159> through<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
so riddle push everything through and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.190 
so riddle push everything through and
they'll<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.869> glowing<00:02:10.869> red<00:02:11.110> lovely<00:02:12.099> color

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
they'll have it glowing red lovely color

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.270 
they'll have it glowing red lovely color
but<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.349> is<00:02:14.500> what<00:02:14.650> happens<00:02:14.920> when<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.160> have

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
but this is what happens when you have

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.920 
but this is what happens when you have
the<00:02:15.370> black<00:02:16.830> same<00:02:17.830> brown<00:02:18.130> bait<00:02:18.599> but<00:02:19.599> as<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.810> can

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the black same brown bait but as you can

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.440 
the black same brown bait but as you can
see<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:21.010> now<00:02:21.310> kind<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:21.880> blended<00:02:22.330> in

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
see it's now kind of like blended in

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.910 
see it's now kind of like blended in
with<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.690> light<00:02:22.989> bottom<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.380> little<00:02:23.590> bit<00:02:23.709> more

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
with the light bottom a little bit more

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.830 
with the light bottom a little bit more
and<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.880> does<00:02:25.030> seem<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.330> make<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.599> bit<00:02:25.810> of

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and it does seem to make a bit of

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.479 
and it does seem to make a bit of
difference<00:02:25.930> on<00:02:26.470> this<00:02:26.620> particular<00:02:26.950> Lake<00:02:27.280> and

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
difference on this particular Lake and

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.400 
difference on this particular Lake and
I'm<00:02:27.580> sure<00:02:27.790> with<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.569> in<00:02:28.750> mind<00:02:28.959> you'll<00:02:29.319> be

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
I'm sure with this in mind you'll be

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.259 
I'm sure with this in mind you'll be
able<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.650> use<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.040> ground<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:30.700> this<00:02:30.790> you

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
able to use this ground but this you

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.690 
able to use this ground but this you
know<00:02:31.390> add<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.930> your<00:02:32.019> groundbait<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.769> just

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
know add it to your groundbait and just

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.850 
know add it to your groundbait and just
tweak<00:02:34.390> your<00:02:34.630> ground<00:02:34.900> based<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.680> how<00:02:35.799> you

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
tweak your ground based to how you

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.979 
tweak your ground based to how you
wanted<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.519> be<00:02:36.700> rather<00:02:37.330> than<00:02:37.630> just<00:02:37.810> taking

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
wanted to be rather than just taking
