initially<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.580> part<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
initially is it's not a part that you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.110 
initially is it's not a part that you
see<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.330> lot<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.540> people<00:00:45.720> work<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.940> but<00:00:47.940> now

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it's an odd number it's a 1 2 3 1 2 3 1

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.160 
it's an odd number it's a 1 2 3 1 2 3 1
2<00:01:23.549> 3<00:01:23.729> 1<00:01:24.000> 2<00:01:24.210> 3<00:01:24.390> 1<00:01:24.660> 2<00:01:24.840> 3<00:01:25.020> 4<00:01:26.180> yeah<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:27.660> right<00:01:27.870> so

because<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.010> an<00:01:29.100> odd<00:01:29.220> number<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.640> gonna

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
because it's an odd number it's gonna

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.980 
because it's an odd number it's gonna
probably<00:01:30.030> feel<00:01:30.300> a<00:01:30.330> little<00:01:30.450> weird<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.810> your

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
that too gives it more choppy that's how

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.729

they're<00:02:36.860> doing<00:02:37.099> it<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.370> then<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.739> started

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
they're doing it and then you started

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.300 
they're doing it and then you started
over<00:02:40.840> open<00:02:41.840> one<00:02:42.079> E<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.560> then<00:02:42.650> second<00:02:43.010> fret<00:02:43.160> a

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.900 
over open one E and then second fret a
and<00:02:43.549> then<00:02:43.819> right<00:02:43.970> here<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.209> kind<00:02:44.329> of<00:02:44.420> cool

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.430 

so<00:02:47.120> everything<00:02:47.450> on<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.629> east<00:02:47.870> palm<00:02:48.079> muted

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
so everything on the east palm muted

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.490 
so everything on the east palm muted
think<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.040> way<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:53.049> then<00:02:54.049> go<00:02:54.200> third

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
think of it that way and then go third

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.630 
think of it that way and then go third
