00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.100
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.840
 to bring running review dotcom today 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.240
 we analyze the riding jacket in 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.450
 hardware the effusion a thought jacket 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.570
 for those days where it's cold where we 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.730
 water is going to fall down where we're going 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 to have to give all that day that day is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.119
 the day of this jacket's one 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.730
 Membrane membrane jacket drive 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.789
 active designed to perspire a 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.380
 membrane designed to exercise not 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.900
 only to walk but when we already run 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.180
 that more heat is generated than we need 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.590
 evaporate more and especially what more 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.110
 impresses of this membrane is that it is 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.970
 a membrane 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.080
 very soft very similar touch to 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.120
 cotton we do not have here the 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.980
 cartoning of other types of 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.040
 membranes that you notice the jacket very 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.950
 stiff and in addition it is elastic to fix 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.230
 ok it's an elastic membrane all and 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.679
 that inside he still carries the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.500
 heat-sealed seams 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:02.120
 I do not know if it is appreciated there all agree 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.549
 the seams are thermosealed this 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.290
 guarantees that water would not enter or 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.530
 nor are we going to suffer 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.600
 inside moisture as you see the iron 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 a jacket that follows are carved 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.400
 that we are very adjusted to the body 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.790
 so much ahead 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.200
 as from behind we also have everything 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.120
 that would be the brand here front 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.590
 reflective then we see it and here in what 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.810
 which is at the level of shoulders we have 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.990
 also reflective parts we got a 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.370
 rucksack is going to cover us a little but 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.410
 everything in staying here on the shoulder looks 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.820
 ok you see here all the height is of 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.290
 the armpit what are the reflective ones are 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.140
 take advantage of his back 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.750
 we are here this jacket takes in the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.800
 pocket here behind is worth a pocket 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.990
 here of a half measure it is worth 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.820
 will enter possible we put the proof of 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.820
 iphone now you have to do your back 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.940
 we get the iphone just 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.940
 It's going to cost us to close 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.460
 but we do not mind what is not 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.750
 has any kind of eye hole for 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.740
 take out the cable from the headphones and what 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.220
 yes, it is 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.240
 very good is to carry the gels keys 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.240
 and other things that we should 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.210
 we can fit without problems closed and here 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.540
 we carry it is not an upper zone that 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.970
 sometimes up here as they bounce 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.680
 we carry here below annoying less to the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.770
 time to run you have to take into account 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.050
 that in all the subject of seams carries 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.520
 how are they heat-sealed and is thought 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.420
 to be a waterproof jacket is 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.610
 thought with the minimum number d 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.480
 of zippers or seams and if you 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.430
 Another theme is the theme of the manga 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.010
 it's not a normal seam it's a seam 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.080
 it's worth crooked 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.909
 and this favors us two things this 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.349
 stitching helps us that the sleeve 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.390
 it is always down, it does not come up 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.450
 while we are running, worth and apart 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.090
 it's a manga if you notice this one is not 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.590
 finished off in an elastic way but yes 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.180
 It has a sealed thermos to avoid 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.680
 so that we are more adjusted and 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.260
 prevent us from getting water when 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.970
 we run, it's worth noting that it's going downhill 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.319
 if it is on rainy days we have said that 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.390
 It is a jacket designed for those days 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.269
 that we are very cold is raining 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.290
 It's going to prevent us from more 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.209
 Water 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.280
 I take the opportunity to show you the zipper 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:34.739
 here in front the system is perfect 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.780
 you close and the same one goes down does not take 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.000
 no type of clip or anything is endured 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.269
 just what the zipper remains 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.180
 perfectly covered up here if 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.720
 we close up our open and the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.480
 zipper in this case takes a chunk 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.659
 of rubber that helps us close it when 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.340
 this is closed and it is above this 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.349
 prevents the zipper from bouncing and go 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.930
 making this clip some some 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.790
 Jackets to make him salt does not 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.230
 being this way I take advantage and I teach you the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.489
 perfect hat is a hat very 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.139
 tight 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.810
 the familiar feeling of this kind of 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:15.299
 membrane is that it is perfect 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.650
 the touch a very similar sensibility 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.889
 to cotton or any other garment 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.650
 textile and from behind 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.780
 as you will see 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.650
 it was a jacket the hat looks good 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.650
 adjusted to the head 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.860
 it also seriously below no 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:35.630
 he wears rubber and he goes on one side he wears a 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.490
 clip where we can make adjustment 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.310
 so that we have to keep in mind 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.790
 especially that it is thought for days 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.790
 for difficult days 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:51.270
 inside and the teachers but truth 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.270
 I'll take off my life see 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.689
 all seams 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.220
 all the seams inside 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.500
 thermosealed here we have the hole 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.970
 where will the pockets stop and here 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.509
 inside we have a small eyelet for 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.800
 remove the cable anyway taking 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.210
 note that it is not protected 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.940
 any electronic device that 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.130
 let's carry on this site it's going to get wet 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.410
 from our own sweat of what we 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.960
 it's outside but sweat but it will be 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.639
 need to take it with something so that it does not 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.060
 we do not go soaking in our 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:30.400
 own of our own sweat like 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.960
 we always double it 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.030
 it can be a membrane jacket 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.210
 note that neither does creex cracks nor does 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.340
 noises or anything compressed always 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.289
 I tell you that my hands are big 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.090
 quite compressed to be a 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.600
 jacket with membrane we had in 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.600
 count this 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.310
 is a jacket that yes to carry 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.190
 halfway while we're doing 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.220
 the trail as we always finish the 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.920
 reviews we can not jump here to the 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.620
 old fashioned and well this is all 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.470
 up here the montaigne jacket 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.100
 fusion hardware and until next time 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.100
 review
