hello everybody, today am going to teach you an easy recipe to make sweet Halawa

00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:05.556
with pistachio 

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:08.974
you can do this Halawa in a very easy and fast way

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.740
 with available ingredient

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.820
same flavor of the halawa in the shops, let's do it

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:25.420
1/2 cup of tehina, 3/4 cup of milk powder, 3/4 cup of sugar powder, 1/4 cup of pistachio

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:44.620
ok then, the ingredient: 1/4 cup of pistachio, 1/2 cup of tehina,  3/4 cup of milk powder, 3/4 cup of sugar powder

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:59.940
we put the sugar powder, then we add the milk powder, and we mix them well together.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.560
and now we add the tehina

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.140
fast recipe,and the same flavor as the one in the shops

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.120
you can use dry halawa leaves if you want, but this halawa recipe is made by home ingredient

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:38.400
and now we will mix them together very well

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:55.498
as we see, after mixing them together, we will add now the pistachio, and again mix everything together

00:01:55.498 --> 00:02:00.378
Ok now, after everything is mixed very well together, we will place it in a bowle

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.320
as we see

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.600
