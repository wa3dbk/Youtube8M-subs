00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.450
 I just tried it from now 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.980
 follow the instructions to a photo tutorial 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.070
 that did not work out so well 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.450
 Now try a video 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.309
 and I would like to show you how to do it 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.680
 with short to medium length space so 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.710
 about my length a little short passes 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.189
 also determines a nice there 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.080
 gets without is my missing yes for that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.310
 needs everything I need is one 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.329
 hair band so luck against the scarf 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:37.140
 Something you just have to do the hair 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.600
 first book over it so completely normal hair 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.570
 nice back to make 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 looks nice and after that too 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.960
 then the cloth just over it is the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.210
 all hair from the center to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.289
 The outside looks a bit wild 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.420
 but you'll see why and then 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.040
 you start down with your hair on 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.260
 so the middle take out the hooks 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.260
 and always turn the inside of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.030
 the hair band straight away 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.810
 just put over the hair band that could 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 very easy to take away and then always 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.580
 Just turn the hairband inside 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 follow, turn it firmly on hold 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 once completely rum as arrived below 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.540
 be around two more times to collect and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.909
 then he goes to the beaches of her 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.810
 have the beginning as I am here once 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.350
 you can see it so easy 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.570
 pull through and start with me could 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.390
 because only a small number plug in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.430
 that's why i'll start below 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.170
 look something out somewhere and 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.780
 you already have that faster 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.560
 simple but chic I hope you 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.560
 like that
