00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.240
Can't we just survive with the power of friendship?

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.250
SHUT UP!

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.310
Cartoons

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:21.420
Jimmy you’re not supposed to use
cell phones!

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.490
I’m not waiting 5 hours to play
Words With Friends.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.810
It attracts pterodactyls!

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.099
I’m about to beat Clyde...

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.090
CLYDE!

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.670
I ate all the airplane food.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.239
I
figured it was only fair.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.170
Uh oh, looks like you kids are
stranded on a desert island.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.780
Dessert Island?!

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.399
No, idiot.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.539
Time is short so let’s go over some
essential survival tips.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.859
Can’t we just survive with the
power of friendship?

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.850
Since that’s not a real thing and
since friends will turn on each

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.859
other in survival scenarios, we
need some practical solutions.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.460
I can make a knife out of this
plane metal.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.460
Good, Jimmy.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.460
For cutting and
killing.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.680
And we can use this lighter for
fire!

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.820
Nice work Susie.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.560
You have a unique
skill set.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.740
I’m thirsty.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.220
Ocean water will make you sick, so
we’re going to have to find a

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.230
natural water source.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.230
So romantic!

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.250
And we’re the only 2
people left.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.490
Don’t get any ideas.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.790
No time for romance you love birds!

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.790
Not love birds.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.290
We need to find you some shelter.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.130
We can just kick the monkeys out of
their tree fort!

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.990
Good thinking, Susie, they seems to
have a liking for you already.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.360
It’s my natural banana and feces
smell.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.740
Hey, look, the monkeys have a map!

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.450
Seems as though we’re here...

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.900
Right
next to Gravy Island.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.900
WHAT?!

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.920
Can this day get any
WORSE?!

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.920
It might.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.160
In the absence of food,
your last resort will have to be

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.160
cannibalism.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.310
It’ll be wise to pick
out the fattest and weakest of the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.660
group to eat since they provide
less value but make up for it in

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.340
serving size.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.010
I PROVIDE adorable commentary!

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:16.920
Well you can’t kill what you can’t
catch!

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.359
It’s important to remain
resourceful.

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.849
The Indians used
every part of the buffalo, so make

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.219
sure you use every part of your
friend.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.950
Do: Preserve the meat with salt and
sun.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.950
Jerky.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.150
With the flavor of
friendship.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.530
Don’t: Cut off your friend’s face
and wear it to blend in with native

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.010
monkey tribes... they’ll know.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.450
This whole situation just got
really dark.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.290
Yes, but then you really didn’t
have to go and do that yet.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.519
Only
when food runs out.

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.560
Oh I just assumed--

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.470
Only when food runs out.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.079
Now that you’ve got your survival
steps in order, it’s time to build

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.480
a rescue message.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.090
You can use
rocks, trees, even the bones of the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.090
friend you just killed.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.510
Ok I got it, I’m sorry, jeeze!

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.510
Perfect!

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.989
And now all we can do is
wait.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:04.989
Oh great, what now?!

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.239
A giant plume of black smoke rises up from
the trees.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.510
Jimmy
looks over at a man dressed in white coming

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.510
up to him.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.510
Jimmy, it’s me, Jacob.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.510
There’s no
time to explain... nor will there

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:39.360
ever be, but a war is coming and we
need you kids!
