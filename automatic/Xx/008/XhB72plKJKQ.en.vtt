00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
seriously i put that as it's the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.670 
seriously i put that as it's the
probably<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.099> most<00:05:08.400> overhyped<00:05:08.880> and<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:10.410> most

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
probably the most overhyped and the most

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.430 
probably the most overhyped and the most
annoying<00:05:11.460> story<00:05:12.030> that<00:05:12.300> doesn't<00:05:12.479> make<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.320> whole

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
annoying story that doesn't make a whole

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.439 
annoying story that doesn't make a whole
lot<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:14.160> sense<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:15.349> the<00:05:16.349> most<00:05:16.650> dissimilar<00:05:17.550> not

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
lot of sense and the most dissimilar not

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.700 
lot of sense and the most dissimilar not
similar<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.530> vampire<00:05:20.099> lore<00:05:20.690> okay<00:05:21.690> they<00:05:22.560> have

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710

head off they glitter and what's up with

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.830 
head off they glitter and what's up with
the<00:05:31.409> story<00:05:31.710> okay<00:05:32.720> if<00:05:33.720> bella<00:05:35.240> was<00:05:36.240> turned<00:05:36.599> into

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
the story okay if bella was turned into

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.140 
the story okay if bella was turned into
a<00:05:37.020> vampire<00:05:37.139> in<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:37.889> first<00:05:38.280> movie<00:05:38.699> you

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
a vampire in the first movie you

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.839 
a vampire in the first movie you
literally<00:05:39.479> would<00:05:39.720> have<00:05:39.870> no<00:05:40.050> more<00:05:40.229> books

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
literally would have no more books

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.000 
literally would have no more books
because<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.930> whole<00:05:43.139> point<00:05:43.169> of<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.710> rest<00:05:43.889> of

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
because the whole point of the rest of

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.710 
because the whole point of the rest of
the<00:05:44.070> books<00:05:44.280> is<00:05:44.430> for<00:05:44.669> her<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.849> get<00:05:45.240> to<00:05:45.449> the<00:05:45.539> point

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
the books is for her to get to the point

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.899 
the books is for her to get to the point
where<00:05:45.930> she<00:05:46.080> says<00:05:46.320> okay<00:05:46.710> i'm<00:05:46.919> gonna<00:05:47.520> turn<00:05:47.729> into

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
where she says okay i'm gonna turn into

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.670 
where she says okay i'm gonna turn into
a<00:05:48.030> vampire<00:05:48.120> but<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:49.020> know<00:05:49.139> if<00:05:49.349> she<00:05:49.500> would<00:05:49.650> have

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
a vampire but you know if she would have

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.200 
a vampire but you know if she would have
turned<00:05:49.919> into<00:05:50.130> a<00:05:50.159> vampire<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.760> first<00:05:51.000> one

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
turned into a vampire the first one

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.580 
turned into a vampire the first one
would<00:05:51.960> have<00:05:52.139> negated<00:05:52.380> everything<00:05:52.650> else<00:05:53.190> and

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
would have negated everything else and

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.870 
would have negated everything else and
one<00:05:55.590> of<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.800> things<00:05:55.860> i<00:05:56.190> think<00:05:56.250> is<00:05:56.580> sort<00:05:56.760> of

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
one of the things i think is sort of

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.250 
one of the things i think is sort of
funny<00:05:57.090> is<00:05:57.979> so<00:05:58.979> the<00:05:59.130> vampires<00:05:59.870> don't<00:06:00.870> want

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
funny is so the vampires don't want

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.770 
funny is so the vampires don't want
humans<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:01.979> know<00:06:02.310> that<00:06:03.060> they're<00:06:03.240> a<00:06:03.270> vampire

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
humans to know that they're a vampire

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.570 
humans to know that they're a vampire
because<00:06:04.409> when<00:06:04.800> they<00:06:04.919> step<00:06:05.099> out<00:06:05.280> into<00:06:05.460> the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
because when they step out into the

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.140 
because when they step out into the
semiotic<00:06:06.030> litter<00:06:06.740> but<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:08.370> vampires<00:06:08.849> who

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
semiotic litter but the vampires who

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.909 
semiotic litter but the vampires who
feed<00:06:09.389> on<00:06:09.510> human<00:06:09.840> blood<00:06:09.870> their<00:06:10.260> eyes<00:06:10.409> are<00:06:10.710> red

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
feed on human blood their eyes are red

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.640 
feed on human blood their eyes are red
like<00:06:11.580> blood<00:06:11.820> red<00:06:12.330> you<00:06:12.990> don't<00:06:13.139> think<00:06:13.229> in<00:06:13.530> a

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
like blood red you don't think in a

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.230 
like blood red you don't think in a
human<00:06:13.979> is<00:06:14.099> going<00:06:14.310> to<00:06:14.400> notice<00:06:14.580> that<00:06:14.909> your<00:06:15.090> eyes

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
human is going to notice that your eyes

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.760 
human is going to notice that your eyes
are<00:06:15.270> blood<00:06:15.780> red<00:06:16.020> and<00:06:16.050> that's<00:06:16.470> something

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
are blood red and that's something

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.249 
are blood red and that's something
that's<00:06:17.070> odd<00:06:17.430> you<00:06:18.030> know<00:06:18.659> if<00:06:18.840> that's<00:06:19.020> not<00:06:19.199> a

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
that's odd you know if that's not a

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.680 
that's odd you know if that's not a
natural<00:06:19.800> eye<00:06:20.009> color<00:06:20.300> clearly<00:06:21.300> they<00:06:21.449> should

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
natural eye color clearly they should

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.240 
natural eye color clearly they should
have<00:06:21.780> maybe<00:06:22.139> thought<00:06:22.500> about<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:22.919> a<00:06:22.979> little

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
have maybe thought about that a little

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.600 
have maybe thought about that a little
bit<00:06:23.370> more<00:06:23.669> as<00:06:23.849> well<00:06:24.060> so<00:06:24.539> I<00:06:24.750> know<00:06:25.409> who<00:06:25.860> I'm<00:06:26.219> going

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
bit more as well so I know who I'm going
