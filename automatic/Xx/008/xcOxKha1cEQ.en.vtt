we<00:00:03.820> have<00:00:04.029> formula<00:00:04.660> number<00:00:05.020> two<00:00:05.910> very<00:00:06.910> simple

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
we have formula number two very simple

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.330 
we have formula number two very simple
formula<00:00:07.899> this<00:00:08.230> is<00:00:08.440> the<00:00:08.590> formula<00:00:09.130> we're<00:00:09.250> gonna

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
formula this is the formula we're gonna

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.080

MLS does the patient receive in order to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.900 
MLS does the patient receive in order to
administer<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.570> correct<00:00:45.020> dose<00:00:45.460> now<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:46.519> say

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
administer the correct dose now you say

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.790 
administer the correct dose now you say
to<00:00:46.940> yourself<00:00:47.199> what's<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.290> first<00:00:48.530> thing<00:00:48.710> I<00:00:48.769> got

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
to yourself what's the first thing I got

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.979 
to yourself what's the first thing I got
to<00:00:48.920> figure<00:00:49.010> out<00:00:49.370> what<00:00:50.059> formula<00:00:50.540> I'm<00:00:50.780> going<00:00:50.930> to

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
to figure out what formula I'm going to

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.090 
to figure out what formula I'm going to
use<00:00:51.170> what's<00:00:51.680> my<00:00:51.860> desired<00:00:52.400> dose<00:00:53.710> Barry<00:00:54.710> what's

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
use what's my desired dose Barry what's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.630 
use what's my desired dose Barry what's
my<00:00:55.250> total<00:00:55.519> volume<00:00:56.589> that's<00:00:57.589> all<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.040> need<00:00:58.309> very

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
my total volume that's all you need very

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.350 
my total volume that's all you need very
good<00:00:59.000> where's<00:00:59.629> my<00:00:59.780> total<00:01:00.199> weight<00:01:00.910> boom<00:01:01.910> done

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
good where's my total weight boom done

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.240 
good where's my total weight boom done
done<00:01:03.289> that's<00:01:03.800> it

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
done that's it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.820 
done that's it
so<00:01:04.789> now<00:01:05.330> I<00:01:05.360> would<00:01:05.660> take<00:01:05.869> these<00:01:06.110> numbers<00:01:06.619> and

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
so now I would take these numbers and

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.580 
so now I would take these numbers and
plug<00:01:07.399> them<00:01:07.700> into<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.030> right<00:01:08.210> places<00:01:08.539> so<00:01:09.289> I<00:01:09.320> can

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
plug them into the right places so I can

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.440 
plug them into the right places so I can
make<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:09.770> look<00:01:09.920> like<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.310> well<00:01:10.789> I<00:01:11.030> know<00:01:11.180> I

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
make it look like that well I know I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.160 
make it look like that well I know I
need<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.840> line<00:01:12.289> and<00:01:12.619> I<00:01:12.800> know<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:13.070> need<00:01:13.430> that

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
need that line and I know I need that

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.690 
need that line and I know I need that
so<00:01:15.170> what<00:01:15.470> I'll<00:01:15.560> put<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.860> right<00:01:15.979> here<00:01:16.039> will<00:01:16.490> goes

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
so what I'll put it right here will goes

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.919 
so what I'll put it right here will goes
here<00:01:16.910> Leo<00:01:17.350> eight<00:01:18.350> milligrams<00:01:19.330> what<00:01:20.330> goes<00:01:20.570> here

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
here Leo eight milligrams what goes here

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.810 
here Leo eight milligrams what goes here
one<00:01:21.670> ml<00:01:22.899> what<00:01:23.899> goes<00:01:24.140> here

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
one ml what goes here

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.070 
one ml what goes here
ten<00:01:25.820> milligrams<00:01:26.830> what's<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.009> same<00:01:28.280> Leo<00:01:29.080> cross

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
ten milligrams what's the same Leo cross

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.960 
ten milligrams what's the same Leo cross
them<00:01:30.289> out<00:01:30.440> eight<00:01:31.100> times<00:01:31.160> one<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:31.910> one

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
them out eight times one is one

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.870 
them out eight times one is one
8/10<00:01:35.619> so<00:01:36.619> we<00:01:36.770> take<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.009> bar<00:01:37.429> number<00:01:37.700> and

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
8/10 so we take that bar number and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.550 
8/10 so we take that bar number and
divide<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.300> to<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.479> top<00:01:38.720> number<00:01:39.140> if<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:39.349> have

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
divide it to the top number if you have

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.710 
divide it to the top number if you have
to<00:01:39.800> do<00:01:39.979> this

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
to do this

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.260 
to do this
there's<00:01:41.720> ten<00:01:41.990> go<00:01:42.170> into<00:01:42.410> eight<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.880> what<00:01:44.030> we<00:01:44.149> do

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
there's ten go into eight so what we do

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.089 
there's ten go into eight so what we do
add<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.509> decimal<00:01:45.050> so<00:01:45.289> we<00:01:45.410> can<00:01:45.560> add<00:01:45.739> a<00:01:45.770> zero

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:46.099 
add a decimal so we can add a zero

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.120 
add a decimal so we can add a zero
correct<00:01:46.599> 10<00:01:47.599> goes<00:01:47.840> into<00:01:48.170> 80<00:01:48.380> how<00:01:48.649> many<00:01:48.860> times

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
correct 10 goes into 80 how many times

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.930 
correct 10 goes into 80 how many times
hey<00:01:50.119> did<00:01:50.989> we<00:01:51.020> use<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.410> eight<00:01:51.580> did<00:01:52.580> we<00:01:52.670> use<00:01:52.819> the

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
hey did we use the eight did we use the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.370 
hey did we use the eight did we use the
one<00:01:53.149> did<00:01:53.899> we<00:01:53.959> use<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.229> tenth<00:01:54.500> what's<00:01:55.069> left

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
one did we use the tenth what's left

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:09.330 
one did we use the tenth what's left
point<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.470> what

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.399 

you
