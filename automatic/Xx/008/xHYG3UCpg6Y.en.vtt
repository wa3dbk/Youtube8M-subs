I've been in need of a new black bag for

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.820 
I've been in need of a new black bag for
ages<00:04:27.160> because<00:04:27.479> my<00:04:28.479> old<00:04:28.720> one<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:29.229> used<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.620> use

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
ages because my old one I used to use

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.310 
ages because my old one I used to use
basically<00:04:30.460> everyday<00:04:31.000> for<00:04:31.600> about<00:04:31.810> two<00:04:32.289> years

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320

flesh<00:07:02.530> and<00:07:02.950> body<00:07:03.190> will<00:07:03.670> be<00:07:03.820> on<00:07:04.000> the<00:07:04.090> show<00:07:04.330> so<00:07:05.110> I

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
flesh and body will be on the show so I

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.100 
flesh and body will be on the show so I
wanted<00:07:05.590> to<00:07:05.680> start<00:07:05.890> exercising<00:07:06.700> I<00:07:07.450> just<00:07:07.870> eat<00:07:08.080> a

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
okay I figured that I should probably

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.870 
okay I figured that I should probably
change<00:07:13.840> my<00:07:14.140> ways<00:07:14.350> and<00:07:14.380> start<00:07:15.340> getting<00:07:15.610> fit<00:07:15.850> and
