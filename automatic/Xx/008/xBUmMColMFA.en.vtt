00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.220 
but the band is so whenever you got if
you<00:04:04.099> guys<00:04:04.220> are<00:04:04.430> ever<00:04:04.549> taking<00:04:04.970> a<00:04:05.060> solo<00:04:05.299> this<00:04:06.110> is

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
you guys are ever taking a solo this is

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.630 
you guys are ever taking a solo this is
an<00:04:06.290> important<00:04:06.709> thing<00:04:06.829> to<00:04:06.950> think<00:04:07.010> about<00:04:07.280> what's

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
an important thing to think about what's

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.880 
an important thing to think about what's
the<00:04:07.790> band<00:04:08.090> doing<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.720> should<00:04:09.260> do<00:04:09.409> something

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
the band doing I should do something

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.470 
the band doing I should do something
that<00:04:10.069> ties<00:04:10.519> in<00:04:10.849> with<00:04:10.879> that

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
that ties in with that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.680 
that ties in with that
so<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:11.900> played<00:04:12.170> out<00:04:12.319> like<00:04:12.500> at<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.680> beginning<00:04:14.140> a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
so I played out like at the beginning a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.510 
so I played out like at the beginning a
fast<00:04:17.690> leg<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:21.350> I'd<00:04:21.500> do<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.739> exact<00:04:21.979> same<00:04:22.010> leg

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
fast leg that I'd do the exact same leg

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.570 
fast leg that I'd do the exact same leg
it<00:04:22.669> just<00:04:22.850> moves<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.270> forecourt<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.990> then

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
it just moves to the forecourt and then

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:34.659 
it just moves to the forecourt and then
the<00:04:25.580> four<00:04:25.910> chord<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.570> it<00:04:27.020> goes<00:04:32.979> and<00:04:33.979> then

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
the four chord and it goes and then

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.000 
the four chord and it goes and then
there's<00:04:34.910> more<00:04:35.330> fast<00:04:35.720> stuff<00:04:36.199> well<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.710> string

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
there's more fast stuff well to string

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.420 
there's more fast stuff well to string
pattern<00:04:41.020> which<00:04:42.020> very<00:04:42.289> interestingly<00:04:42.590> starts

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
pattern which very interestingly starts

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.629 
pattern which very interestingly starts
in<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.639> Dorian<00:04:44.060> mode<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:45.130> ends<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.340> it

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
in the Dorian mode and ends and it

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.370 
in the Dorian mode and ends and it
starts<00:04:46.910> in<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.060> Aeolian<00:04:47.570> mode<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:48.050> ends<00:04:48.289> in

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
starts in the Aeolian mode and ends in

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.080 
starts in the Aeolian mode and ends in
the<00:04:48.470> Dorian<00:04:48.889> mode<00:04:49.510> don't<00:04:50.510> ask<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:51.020> then<00:04:52.090> ask

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
the Dorian mode don't ask and then ask

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.909 
the Dorian mode don't ask and then ask
your<00:04:53.389> teacher<00:04:53.600> they<00:04:53.840> explained<00:04:54.350> it<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.710> I

but somebody told me that joe satriani

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.550 
but somebody told me that joe satriani
has<00:05:36.240> used<00:05:36.479> it<00:05:36.660> so<00:05:36.870> i'm<00:05:36.990> gonna<00:05:37.169> have<00:05:37.229> to<00:05:37.380> assume

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
has used it so i'm gonna have to assume

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.080 
has used it so i'm gonna have to assume
that<00:05:37.830> he<00:05:37.919> stole<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.280> from<00:05:38.310> me<00:05:38.639> and<00:05:39.030> then<00:05:41.090> and

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
that he stole it from me and then and

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.980 
that he stole it from me and then and
then<00:05:42.990> because<00:05:43.520> at<00:05:44.520> that<00:05:45.030> point<00:05:45.300> at<00:05:45.540> that<00:05:45.600> point

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
then because at that point at that point

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.740 
then because at that point at that point
the<00:05:46.080> solo<00:05:46.350> was<00:05:46.680> too<00:05:46.919> composed<00:05:47.430> so<00:05:48.120> i<00:05:48.150> needed<00:05:48.720> to

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
the solo was too composed so i needed to

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.260 
the solo was too composed so i needed to
put<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.199> little<00:05:49.350> more<00:05:49.740> loosey-goosey<00:05:50.400> rock<00:05:51.060> and

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
put a little more loosey-goosey rock and

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.110 
put a little more loosey-goosey rock and
roll<00:05:51.479> back<00:05:51.780> in<00:05:51.990> it<00:05:52.139> or<00:05:52.380> get<00:05:53.010> some<00:05:53.310> beer<00:05:53.729> on<00:05:53.760> the

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
roll back in it or get some beer on the

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.260 
roll back in it or get some beer on the
frets<00:05:54.449> as<00:05:54.780> I<00:05:54.960> like<00:05:55.169> to<00:05:55.260> say<00:05:55.320> it<00:05:56.000> you<00:05:57.000> can<00:05:57.120> ask

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
frets as I like to say it you can ask

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.719 
frets as I like to say it you can ask
your<00:05:57.479> teachers<00:05:57.780> about<00:05:58.050> that<00:05:58.260> too<00:05:58.500> and<00:05:58.800> that's

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
your teachers about that too and that's

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.890 

I<00:06:09.520> think<00:06:10.520> double<00:06:10.850> stop<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:11.330> that's<00:06:11.449> very

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
I think double stop and that's very

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.230 
I think double stop and that's very
Randy<00:06:12.470> Rhoads<00:06:12.759> reminiscent<00:06:13.759> of<00:06:13.970> the<00:06:14.060> whole
