00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.170
 ms is going to say a little nephew started so it was voted so unique 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.940
 embarrassment and warming pointed out a three-year agreement 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:15.619
 As we know if it was so easy, it was much better to do what we 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.199
 make the force in voting today 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.649
 however in the left hand we will make the siege to hand 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:22.369
 left 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.810
 now finally 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.439
 given zeroed around from home so few little foals chance to get 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.929
 pass the course 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.509
 to the medical center 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.969
 nothing is certain very small squeezed computed do not know 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.289
 do strength so good program does not know where to put your feet to do the curve 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.089
 if you close the entire race very closely and will definitely make a 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.750
 unbalanced tack 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.700
 so can make a good circle speed is not morning the middle 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.710
 being that you feel like a comfortable bitch to make the curve 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.480
 and time and two turns on the earliest at 1pm will be perfect face shape if 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.060
 posting the 34 are in an uproar for balanced and balanced baby 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.780
 with the palettes very close 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.880
 this kind of prey version of it the first lesson bucket in the direction 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.590
 the gold from outside to favor the horse becomes confused simpa in the ditches in 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.890
 foot and body well and drink well aligned 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.390
 so you do not really have to go through the horse on the way you can go wrong 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.409
 the coach to apple for you that italy get a very precious thing 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590
 pro horse too in the beginning 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.770
 completed the first day I said that everything indicates another side has to do 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.590
 punctuated 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.280
 a continuity now as it was made to the left will now be done 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.990
 unpublished right 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.800
 adauto in the right hand 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.810
 the opposite with the foot 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.800
 It's the right hand up front that's very important. 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.020
 now they are already treated 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.380
 after table with the name and neither china line in the next so wet because 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.660
 being as it does as it did now movement in the direction from where it went to 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.660
 car favor was stayed all Brazil the right position 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.550
 without many chances without much controversial pressure after table they fall ill 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.760
 of the very work the body is that I look for the horses how much closer 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.189
 the current position of the horse 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.300
 more satisfied says satisfied 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.900
 the proposal presented in s if it is not long since his death by 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.150
 very good position he well centered in the cell pointed in the plane in turn would have 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.650
 I also sealed it without making too much effort he stepped on the palate 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.519
 home is for you to start practicing at a gallop 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.749
 you have a potentate a very great constancy in the trot and try on your 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:30.229
 hand 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:34.539
 and there could not have been a movement in the trot when I felt a percentage of the value 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:35.340
 good 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.470
 if you want to send too much it drops if you can give continuity and support 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.099
 increasing speed 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.530
 if it can deal with crisis recession rooster that later 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.209
 I've been well outside the project. 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.399
 advice to another of the drums 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.950
 seventy certainty 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.290
 created the fucking battle 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.430
 doing well to the previous exercise 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.370
 this can have a then little degree of difficulty with the dog can faster 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.580
 the lapel card you can be sure you will see that the board 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.360
 voting today is going to be successful 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.030
 no problem but the chamber and it's another class of three drums 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.430
 I count on you in the next program.
