00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.069
 my name is bad already 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.369
 it can happen during this cold period 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.499
 that you do not start up value 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.980
 for example with a flat battery so that mouth shut 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.980
 it comes from a family celebration and there 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.519
 I have you the party's cities 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.519
 if you still have someone with the city cables 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.249
 further on their way 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.640
 to start willem ii's the shell jumper cables 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.140
 these jumper cables are that knot 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.990
 you should always pay attention to that 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.120
 turn the slots on first to purchase jumper cables 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.750
 with the craftsman 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.210
 when we start 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.580
 just like this car needs to be started up deeper 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.630
 and this is going to help these wares start up 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.120
 we take the role the climb 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.120
 the veste york on the plus pole of the battery 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.780
 on any city plus battery 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.260
 the other cable, on the other hand, does not yet connect the shutter 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 and then must confirm the pro round 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.090
 also clamp on the plus pole of the wake that help us start up money 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.010
 I will take it then 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.979
 the toughest climb in this case and the places that are on the negative 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.160
 of the battery of the car that will help us start up 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 the room next to the car to be started 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.470
 And now it is very important to go again 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.510
 the first climb 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.220
 never directly on the negative born and and I have the pulse then the battery 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.760
 make way for the but on a goal on the body 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.520
 on the engine block 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 as he is 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.730
 when this cost has been achieved 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.450
 let's grope the cars 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.710

 and then the boys make it start up 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.300
 needed to be 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.440
 before starting the pc ware we will make sure 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.009
 all consumers are switched off 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.829
 this has as a trainer that the starter motor 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.709
 need all the energy 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.329
 to start 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.170
 which should never do so when starting 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.170
 the make later they appreciate 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.409
 when our make 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.449
 run stationed for ten minutes 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.449
 others were on the other hand who makes evicting 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.899
 this doesn't matter to us 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.009
 remove the battery and the engine block 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.569
 to release 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.959
 fish value 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.359
 and after that 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.959
 according to liverpool 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 of the floor plates 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.769
 when they put on the negative consequences of the loop often one 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:10.369
 negative 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.369
 that on the engine block of the sweepers 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.400
