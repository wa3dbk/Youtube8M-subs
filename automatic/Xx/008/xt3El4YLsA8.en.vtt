how long you want the screen to stay on
four<00:01:22.380> times<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.900> about<00:01:25.140> three

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
four times out and you get about three

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.649 
four times out and you get about three
hours<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.100> battery<00:01:26.549> life<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.390> particular

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
hours of battery life on this particular

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
hours of battery life on this particular
unit<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.250> most<00:01:29.460> interesting<00:01:29.850> thing<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
unit the most interesting thing is that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.289 
unit the most interesting thing is that
this<00:01:30.720> DVR<00:01:31.110> records<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.659> m-jpeg<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
this DVR records in m-jpeg and so the

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.200 
this DVR records in m-jpeg and so the
video<00:01:36.299> quality<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.200> outstanding<00:01:37.560> at<00:01:38.520> 640<00:01:39.090> by

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
video quality is outstanding at 640 by

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.200 
video quality is outstanding at 640 by
480<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:39.990> 30<00:01:40.259> frames<00:01:40.409> per<00:01:40.650> second<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.970> EM

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
480 at 30 frames per second but in EM

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.149 
480 at 30 frames per second but in EM
JPEG<00:01:42.780> compression<00:01:42.810> format<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> video

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
JPEG compression format so the video

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.969 
JPEG compression format so the video
quality<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.820> fantastic<00:01:46.070> records<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.340> a
