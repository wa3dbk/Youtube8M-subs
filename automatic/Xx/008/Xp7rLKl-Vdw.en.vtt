00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.229 
consideration of the particular model of
bicycle<00:03:50.450> being<00:03:51.139> looked<00:03:51.380> at<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.799> think<00:03:52.430> for<00:03:53.060> the

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
bicycle being looked at I think for the

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.410 
bicycle being looked at I think for the
extra<00:03:53.720> between<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.470> 10<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.950> 15<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.180> a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
extra between the 10 and the 15 it is a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.740 
extra between the 10 and the 15 it is a
worthwhile<00:03:57.609> investment

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.960 

for<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.870> degree<00:04:03.049> of<00:04:03.349> difficulty<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.400> balance

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
for the degree of difficulty and balance

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.960 
for the degree of difficulty and balance
but<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.049> has<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.530> power<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.920> pull<00:04:07.370> me<00:04:07.549> up<00:04:07.670> in

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
but it has the power to pull me up in

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.210 
but it has the power to pull me up in
first<00:04:08.360> gear

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.530 

okay<00:04:16.410> hope<00:04:17.410> you've<00:04:17.620> enjoyed<00:04:17.950> that<00:04:17.980> I<00:04:18.540> was

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
okay hope you've enjoyed that I was

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.360 
okay hope you've enjoyed that I was
doing<00:04:19.780> about<00:04:19.930> 28<00:04:20.380> kilometers<00:04:20.890> an<00:04:20.980> hour<00:04:21.100> across

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
doing about 28 kilometers an hour across

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.440 
doing about 28 kilometers an hour across
the<00:04:21.580> grass<00:04:21.790> there<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:24.340> you're<00:04:25.240> going<00:04:25.330> to

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
the grass there and as you're going to

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.500 
the grass there and as you're going to
see<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:26.320> bike<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.800> very<00:04:27.070> suited<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.700> off-road

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
see the bike is very suited to off-road

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:50.869

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:59.480 
this is a add-on that I use for riding
my<00:04:56.020> grandchildren<00:04:56.860> around<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.370> caravan<00:04:57.969> park

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490
