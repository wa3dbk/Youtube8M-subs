00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.929 

you<00:01:33.409> see<00:01:33.619> how<00:01:33.799> I<00:01:33.829> like<00:01:34.130> died<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:34.520> purpose

you see how I like died on purpose
that's<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.600> good<00:01:35.780> idea<00:01:35.840> because<00:01:36.229> if<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.619> die

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829

then<00:01:36.859> you<00:01:37.100> have<00:01:37.280> more<00:01:37.490> chances<00:01:38.000> going<00:01:38.420> that

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
then you have more chances going that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.630 
then you have more chances going that
part<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.259> course<00:01:40.689> so<00:01:41.689> if<00:01:42.560> i<00:01:42.770> use<00:01:42.979> off<00:01:43.130> but

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
part of the course so if i use off but

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.599 
part of the course so if i use off but
make<00:01:43.939> sure<00:01:43.969> you<00:01:44.240> don't<00:01:44.390> die<00:01:45.189> after<00:01:46.189> doing<00:01:46.369> all

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
make sure you don't die after doing all

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.340 
make sure you don't die after doing all
of<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.850> then<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:47.719> should<00:01:47.929> get<00:01:48.140> at<00:01:48.319> least

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350
