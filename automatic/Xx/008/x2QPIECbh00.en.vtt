00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:03.239
 hello dear friends today i am you 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:05.669
 representing the interests of the phone company does not 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.890
 digs up the model when it is engaged in heat 13 05 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.210
 the most interesting is that this model will be 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.570
 based on operating system 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 android as you know i am by no means 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.689
 indifferent 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.489
 So I went to the delivery set 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.649
 I can't show you a box 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.659
 so let's go straight 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.589
 the place where I talk about those 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.339
 the elements of which it consists 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.079
 as you can understand on the top 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.039
 there is a speaker on the left 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:36.829
 interesting that there is a proximity sensor 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.710
 kitchen and lighting sensor this is already 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.990
 not bad 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.500
 on the big soon contact 3 2 inches 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.490
 touchscreen time 320 at 480 resolution so 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.000
 to guarantee below the censor 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.920
 hinted kim they by the way here are similar in 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.740
 difference for example from 50 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.780
 what are the tables of the tenth because there are such 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.120
 the buttons were very small here and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.050
 it was not very convenient to click on them 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.590
 there is 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.220
 when the screen is up 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.840
 the program has been turned off backlight 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.450
 bright for example in the evening beeline 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.720
 announced in the eyes 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.900
 and these keys were not clearly visible next two 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690
 quarter keys 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.960
 departure call directly 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.800
 Borisov they still translucent 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.150
 plastic pipes 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.990
 brooke frame area as it comes down with 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.020
 design point of view but it seems to me 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.470
 we seem to be well centered 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.880
 from track ball mechanical 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.650
 I can show you 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.800
 what does he look like 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 This is what Zemlyansky looks like. 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 so looks like part of the management 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.200
 here he is a little microphone here 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.330
 is on the right side it is located 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
 activation circle camera 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.240
 farther 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.490
 volume control such 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.950
 little rocker 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.630
 I will not say that it is convenient because 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.130
 Tobin's tax to the corps 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.169
 the intention is very convenient 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.370
 further up is he 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.720
 phone power key or im 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.259
 putting his debut on hold 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:17.779
 here is on vacation 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.849
 address half millimeter connector 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.309
 PE for headphones 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.129
 From the left side 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.749
 we have 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.199
 Yuriy careful entry here such here 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.359
 stub because it is a long stub 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.849
 very comfortably 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.889
 protocol closes 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.809
 and recessed into the housing 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.809
 back panel compact mark ii 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.169
 so now it will rub 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.039
 Here Nalchik on the back you can 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.039
 see the speaker here it is the speaker 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.429
 the process is 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.049
 5 megapixel camera module with 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.049
 flash unfortunately two but on courses 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.569
 that's everywhere actually just no bottom 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.849
 connectors and that is so small 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.749
 depth so that you can with 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.749
 ease to open and cover 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:08.909
 but so far everything is on it
