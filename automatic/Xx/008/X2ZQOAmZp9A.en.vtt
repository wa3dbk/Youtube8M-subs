00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.580
 lentils 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:16.170

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.030
 suitable for vegetarians but not 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.810
 just for the victorians and just who 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.530
 wants to eat something tasty 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.090

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:35.749
 bunch of lettuce leaf lettuce

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.670
 olive oil for frying well that is 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.679
 when we fry onions with tomato 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.390
 pasta 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:56.249

 lentils wash it and boil it in 4 in 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:02.490
 we measure water in cups of water in the same way 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.920
 brewed she must 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:10.530
 almost to readiness about 5 minutes before 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.870

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:28.860
 I have to learn to buy in Turkey 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.890
 In principle, she is clean enough for her 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.710
 you can wash it very quickly but I know that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.090
 we sell lentils in Russia 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:45.080
 which is such a chicken and you need 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:48.590
 wash well this lentil i'm a little bit 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.590
 under running water 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:03.720

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 Lentils acted here I am a little bit 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.739
 salted god and now we are waiting when 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.330
 lentils almost love in the area 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:19.550

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.550
 god in olive oil with tomato paste 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.870
 fry onions on medium heat 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.890
 world, we have one glass of bulgur and 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.890
 pour out almost ready lentils 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.060
 mix 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.860
 mix 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.030
 let it take literally 1 2 minutes and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.030
 can be turned off 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.210
 then the onions are fried 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.210
 and became a bit soft I added a couple 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:14.890
 spoons of tomato paste now slow 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.810
 a little fire this boil for some time so 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.980
 tomato tomato paste 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.360
 mass of you ready main mix for 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.760
 chops with us 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.640
 or under the cover here you see that 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.310
 virtually no water is absorbed 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.270
 you need to wait for the mass to cool and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.580
 got warm 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:40.630
 at this time you can cut the onion was me 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.700
 It took about 9 feathers lukan and as I already 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.890
 said you need to cut off only green 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.900
 part to our cakes turned out 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:58.410
 gentle and so probably passed about 15 minutes and 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:02.230
 it can be seen that the mass absorbed water and 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.720
 now we come here a little differently 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.950
 cool so that it becomes so warm we 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.010
 add the tomato spice paste here 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.690

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.479

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:30.130
 with a towel and put it on our platter 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:34.229
 the mass has cooled I added green onions here 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:38.440
 tomato paste with roasted onions 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.750
