pickers love those V's like that and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.399 
pickers love those V's like that and
especially<00:01:14.580> when<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.570> locked<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.200> clay

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
especially when it's locked up in clay

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.219 
especially when it's locked up in clay
because<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.060> floods<00:01:18.330> again<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.080> it's

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
because if it floods again and it's

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.480 
because if it floods again and it's
locked<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.740> clay<00:01:19.920> there's<00:01:20.159> less<00:01:20.460> chance

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
locked up in clay there's less chance

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.649 
locked up in clay there's less chance
that<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> come<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that it's going to come out of that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
that it's going to come out of that
pocket<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.070> bare<00:01:23.250> bedrock<00:01:23.729> with

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
pocket if it's just bare bedrock with

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.920 
pocket if it's just bare bedrock with
some<00:01:24.119> gravel<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.630> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
some gravel on it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.600 
some gravel on it
odds<00:01:25.350> are<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> next<00:01:25.950> floods<00:01:26.159> gonna<00:01:26.340> carry

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
odds are the next floods gonna carry

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.390 
odds are the next floods gonna carry
that<00:01:26.729> piece<00:01:26.970> away<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.290> when<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.920> got<00:01:29.100> locked

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
literally sealing that gold in the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.109 
literally sealing that gold in the
pocket<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:34.229> there<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.500> go<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.670> worth
