00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
not show depths along the curve you can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.479 
not show depths along the curve you can
determine<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.140> depth<00:01:01.379> by<00:01:01.680> realizing<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
determine the depth by realizing that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.170 
determine the depth by realizing that
all<00:01:02.850> curves<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.290> increments<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.860> 6<00:01:05.339> this
