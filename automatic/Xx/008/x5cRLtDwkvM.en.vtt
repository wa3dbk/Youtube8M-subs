00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
whatever campus is very specific and I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.639 
whatever campus is very specific and I
think<00:01:08.969> that<00:01:09.180> majority<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.259> great<00:01:10.409> majority

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
think that majority the great majority

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.609 
think that majority the great majority
of<00:01:10.829> students<00:01:11.340> who<00:01:11.490> graduate<00:01:12.299> from<00:01:12.539> a<00:01:12.990> BBA<00:01:13.289> or

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
of students who graduate from a BBA or

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.709 
of students who graduate from a BBA or
communication<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.579> other<00:01:15.649> program<00:01:16.649> end<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.909> 5

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
communication or other program end up 5

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.800 
communication or other program end up 5
10<00:01:19.140> years<00:01:19.170> 15<00:01:20.039> years<00:01:20.070> from<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.810> very

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
10 years 15 years from here in very

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.660 
10 years 15 years from here in very
interesting<00:01:23.359> professional<00:01:24.359> positions<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
interesting professional positions and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.950 
interesting professional positions and
it's<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.119> very<00:01:27.359> important<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it's think it's very important that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
it's think it's very important that
somehow<00:01:28.289> students<00:01:29.280> keep<00:01:29.490> track<00:01:29.789> of<00:01:29.969> each

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
somehow students keep track of each

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.050 
somehow students keep track of each
other<00:01:30.270> today<00:01:31.100> tools<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.340> LinkedIn<00:01:32.789> or

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
other today tools like LinkedIn or

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.660 
other today tools like LinkedIn or
whatever<00:01:33.719> you<00:01:33.869> want<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.140> use<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.950> very<00:01:35.070> very

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
whatever you want to use it's very very

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.179 
whatever you want to use it's very very
interesting<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.929> that<00:01:37.200> today<00:01:37.770> maybe

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
interesting and I think that today maybe

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
interesting and I think that today maybe
you<00:01:38.369> don't<00:01:38.549> recognize<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.149> because<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.719> start

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
you don't recognize it because you start

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.990 
you don't recognize it because you start
working<00:01:40.469> but<00:01:40.619> people<00:01:41.399> have<00:01:41.549> very<00:01:41.820> much

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
working but people have very much

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.810 
working but people have very much
potential<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.719> recommend<00:01:43.590> them<00:01:43.710> strongly<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
potential I recommend them strongly to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
potential I recommend them strongly to
fight<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.299> kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.570> ways<00:01:45.749> and<00:01:45.990> stay<00:01:46.499> in<00:01:46.740> touch

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
fight all kind of ways and stay in touch

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.760 
fight all kind of ways and stay in touch
you<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.249> actually

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
you don't actually

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.139 
you don't actually
each<00:01:47.829> other<00:01:48.009> but<00:01:48.189> you<00:01:48.280> know<00:01:48.430> where<00:01:48.759> everybody

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
each other but you know where everybody

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.660 
each other but you know where everybody
years<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.869> just<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.770> can<00:01:51.070> show<00:01:51.219> me<00:01:51.340> once<00:01:51.549> a

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
years and just you can show me once a

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.359 
years and just you can show me once a
year<00:01:51.909> which<00:01:52.090> why<00:01:52.240> do<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.539> have<00:01:52.750> some<00:01:52.929> kind<00:01:53.140> of

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
year which why do you have some kind of

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.340 
year which why do you have some kind of
contacts<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.909> gamble<00:01:55.210> or<00:01:55.630> call<00:01:55.990> or<00:01:56.020> whatever

contacts to gamble or call or whatever

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.139 
contacts to gamble or call or whatever
that's<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:56.979> think<00:01:57.159> that's<00:01:57.310> very<00:01:57.429> important<00:01:57.939> and

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
that's I think that's very important and

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.200 
that's I think that's very important and
that's<00:01:58.810> that's<00:01:59.369> the<00:02:00.369> drooping<00:02:00.729> one<00:02:00.969> of<00:02:01.090> the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
that's that's the drooping one of the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.050 
that's that's the drooping one of the
added<00:02:01.869> values<00:02:02.289> which<00:02:02.590> your<00:02:03.429> university<00:02:03.939> has

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
added values which your university has

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.329 
added values which your university has
to<00:02:04.210> offer
