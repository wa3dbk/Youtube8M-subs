 alarcon had the country braaten maynard 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.590
 in case of failure 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.610
 it was estimated that in October 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.700
 is questioning 10 chf at these clubs have for example progressed sanchez m 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.980

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.970
 we do not search for me 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.720
 in the same month in europe

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.180
 on average per month so neither in 2009 his research to train his classy 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.340
 and percent to 102 5 slightly lower before his birth and the 40 was not 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.420
 a lot 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.390
 but it gives us a good idea to come here cammas has spent his darling 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.830
 put together interesting 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.910
 before that would give someone who would like for example 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.460
 because at this source how to place his darling 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.119
 and stone we almost expected these machines for a good idea of 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.630
 mines who even sees keywords before it was bars like these 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.440
 grind 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.050
 marvel 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.380
 and other than that and it's this campaign here 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.770
 that's why we pay if we go to a lot of people 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.390
 who 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.449
 optimized for the point of sale that the commune has 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.399
