under<00:01:10.800> we<00:01:11.340> call<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> power<00:01:11.970> jump<00:01:12.360> because

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
under we call it the power jump because

under we call it the power jump because
from<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> power<00:01:13.380> jump<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:13.950> doubles

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
from the power jump you can do doubles
