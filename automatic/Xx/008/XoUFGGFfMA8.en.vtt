00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.410
 everybody in the video today would like 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.480
 I show how to make such flowers 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.610
 they grow in the meadows and are about 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 50 cm tall they are blue or 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.390
 different shades of gray me 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.110
 I have chosen these beads 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.809
 and they fit well if you like 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.879
 it is darker or brighter then 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.510
 it is also ok for the flowers 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.010
 of course I need such a grat 0.3 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.410
 millimeters long and 30 centimeters long 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.520
 I need a flower seven pieces because 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.780
 these are the bracts and exactly 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.160
 that's how we start 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.899
 I take my partner and collect three 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:17.640
 piece then I search the rent and do 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:23.160
 so a bit I bend so that I 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:27.270
 rent very well see and feel then lead 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:31.340
 I stepped through the first and one 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.420
 second wave one stays that alone 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.060
 then I pull it because I'm the middle 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.780
 all pearls are found exactly 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:48.479
 in the rent then I collect on one 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.790
 side would have three pieces and by the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.490
 doctors and by the second for me 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:59.100
 again the advice the one remains again 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.710
 alone and I see and see that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.310
 almost no space between them 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.590
 she must stay very close to each other 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.690
 lie 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.040
 from one side I did that and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:19.200
 now the same from the other side 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:22.700
 on two pieces and again through the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.850
 Doctors teach second act performed 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.350
 a pearl stays alone on the 3 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.270
 then I pull back tight 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.550
 and if they are like this, for example 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.060
 two look up and this one after 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.310
 below 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.460
 that does not matter i can give it to him 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:50.550
 turn around then I gather them hard 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:53.250
 Be on one side and they are not 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:03:00.200
 I lead balance through these 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:04.560
 seven in the other direction, so to speak 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.160
 and now draw up a bit 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.730
 so that all rows very close together 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.950
 lie 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:19.760
 and then I'm supposed to be six berlin and 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.760
 again the same 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:34.620
 and further objectively 5432 a pearl and 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.620
 always do the same thing and always 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.620
 here 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:58.940
 that's the last berlin a pearl 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:03.120
 now I have this 1 7 6 5 4 3 2 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.390
 walter all other bracts must 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.950
 to add to this part or to 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:15.410
 back even, that's why I make a leaf 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:19.950
 only up to the series of tri berlin are 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.620
 Then I take a rat, and carry him 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.910
 from the bottom up 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:31.680
 between these three and two berlin 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:34.680
 are just like that and now he is holding 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:41.120
 but does not last well that's why I collect 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:44.700
 Two again will be on one side and 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.730
 again, follow this part from the left 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.730
 right 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:00.569
 and now I am leading the wheel 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:03.949
 between those no where two balls and 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.949
 a pearl is 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.990
 Now I only have a pair of glasses 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.340
 you do not have counseling as 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.150
 connecting nothing happens 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.760
 Everything is fine and I do the same 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.370
 five more times in total must be here 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.540
 Be seven leaves after you all 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:48.160
 six petals have joined together 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:52.000
 there is still a sheet the seventh and the 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.000
 with you have the two parts already 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.860
 connect not only a part but the 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.100
 2 and that happens so I run the rat 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.160
 again between the halls 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:09.010
 2 and two pieces are from one side 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:13.210
 and the same thing I do 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:16.470
 the other side now officially two pearls 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.470
 on these crowed 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:40.430
 tighten and now I have just the 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.500
 are black find between the second 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.770
 and the first berlin 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:49.540
 that's not easy because 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:54.250
 the whole thing is so small and very tight 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.250
 but side by side and do it all 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.659
 now a barrel the last 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:17.930
 and tighten 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:21.260
 Now we have the flowers, that is 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.020
 not ready for those yet 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.360
 that it looks okay 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.390
 you can leave so only the 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.560
 I really want to rent this one 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:36.110
 make a green part because in the 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.370
 Reality in nature has such 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:44.350
 flowers here such a sphere circles and 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.350
 I'm doing this on the white
