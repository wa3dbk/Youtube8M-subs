 attentive 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.059
 we search 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.210
 I was born and now 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:59.930

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.909

 we can not see anyone but we're 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.940
 in this area 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.610
 my accomplice has made a double 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.860
 what it tells us 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:49.539
 effectively this area of 100 points 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.539

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.409

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.540

 we will take effect there is another 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:16.500
 or else the thing is to know where 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.190
 because we are going to look attentive to that is 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.790
 where they are stuck 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.790
 come on 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.479
 around here we recharge fast 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.050
 I knew I was coming from behind another 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.050
 more over here 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.849
 attentive attentive 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.800
 goodbye 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.080
 had to die before finishing the 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.089
 departure had to die but now he 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.729
 we have messed up and in the end we were screwed 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:47.550
 the hv and we saw almost nothing more than 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.050
 226 4 that is not bad at all they have come 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.969
 by my opinion they are already shooting me 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.369
 three uncles and just charge the one I 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.809
 I had played but good guys 26-4 the 

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:56.249
 truth is that they are all prestigious already 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:59.309
 stop power is fairly well 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.719
 good game especially seeing that no 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.729
 I have seen none of them on the radar 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.020
 so the game is pretty good 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.909
 has had to deal with me alone and we have 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.709
 I've been looking for solutions there 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.999
 new things that have been coming out 

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:10.199
 without a decision I hope we have already given 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:14.029
 you know leave your likes 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.029
