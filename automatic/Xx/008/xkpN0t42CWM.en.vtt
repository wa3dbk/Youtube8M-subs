00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.889
 welcome everyone to a new video 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.840
 before starting I wanted to subscribe 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.540
 that would help me a lot and obviously give me 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.369
 like the video now yes we start with 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 this video will talk about the history of the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.720
 there are already gynes and their planet has 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.670
 seen about the origin of the sayayin is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.220
 where each argument instead of clarifying 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.500
 certain things simply generated more 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.420
 questions is this video I gathered all the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 information that has currently been given to 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.760
 know and I looked for the meaning so that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.710
 it's easier for you to understand this whole subject 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.930
 the story begins on the planet plan 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.699
 which unfortunately came to be 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.920
 destroyed by a mysterious character 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.080
 nicknamed the super saiyans who 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.119
 greatly increased his powers up 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.400
 take a transformation similar to that of 

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.350
 10 and thereby destroy the planet of 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.089
 unconscious way ending with great 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.010
 part of their race while the 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.710
 survivors managed to escape to a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.210
 planet with two suns the planet plant 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.369
 was inhabited by a race called 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.979
 seedlings that created the medicine 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.990
 ancestral which in theory were 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.880
 killed by the suffered hits when 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.370
 these for unknown reasons also 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.710
 they landed on the planet planet 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.630
 the sayayin if the subgroups would agree 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.030
 that each race would be left with one half 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.010
 of the planet quickly formed a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.020
 great friendship but as passed 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.420
 some conflicts were created 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.660
 between these two races where the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.430
 envy of travel from said deal 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.530
 many years would pass and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.140
 sulphides and the sayayin shawn coexisted 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.810
 on the same planet their forus lived 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.790
 in large cities they occupied the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.460
 most of the planet thanks to its 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.560
 great technological development while 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.560
 the sayayin lived in caves or small 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.750
 peoples their culture was very backward not 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 they had as much technology as 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.310
 their forus were quite primitive but 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.140
 they were a tough warrior race 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.870
 to adversities and they were twice as 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.300
 size of what was a future for the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.760
 Fortune Sayayin emerged a leader among 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.830
 the marginalized called vegeta who was 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.780
 different from the others sayayin because of 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.240
 that with his intelligence he managed to create a 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.640
 great plan of conquest which consisted 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.470
 in taking the planet completely supported 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.870
 by the fact that before they achieved 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.190
 take ground through short attacks and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.110
 finally on the day 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.880
 the great confrontation the Sayayin are 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.190
 they took the planet completely thank you 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.290
 to the full moon which gave them their 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.630
 metamorphosis turning them into monkeys 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.670
 giant vegeta that had been 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.830
 self-proclaimed king of the there are already jeans 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.690
 for being the smartest and clever 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.580
 highlighted at the time of the total 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.320
 victory they decided to change the name 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.290
 of the planet and put the name of the young 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.630
 sayayin after the total destruction 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.210
 of the suffrages the technology 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.800
 delayed a lot for there are already hits but 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.770
 they were able to rescue things like 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.170
 tracker still had very technology 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.790
 old and old so then they joined 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.770
 forces with aliens that 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.600
 they provided current technology and 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.670
 money times later when giving 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.680
 know as mercenaries would begin to 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.810
 work to offer who added to the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.930
 plant planet commercial empire that 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.110
 this one governed the being a race more than 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.670
 the many that worked to offer 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.320
 they were looking for a planet with a good medium 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.030
 environment and eliminated all 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.040
 individuals who lived for then 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.070
 sell the planet at a high price to the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.200
 extraterrestrials to vegeta be a king 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.940
 with all possible luxuries he turned it 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.010
 even more greedy and per year 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.840
 what they wanted, however, does not challenge 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.940
 to offer because he was aware of the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.650
 danger that reflected until one day 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.630
 he was armed with courage and together with his great 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.940
 elite squad and he wanted to face the 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.190
 Emperor with the ambition to dethrone him 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.080
 and take over the universe which was a 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.150
 waste because his men 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.130
 they turned their backs and finally the great 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.200
 King was killed by a blow 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.110
 special and his men would follow the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.270
 same destiny as the king after the 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.340
 storm did not come the calm grow already 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.590
 I was determined to end the Sayayin 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.660
 so they were not a nuisance and it was a 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.820
 plan that I was already carrying out finished 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.680
 with a squadron of the planet ming then 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.840
 of killing the king decides to end the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.940
 sayayin is once and for all when 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.280
 He goes out to the hatch of his spaceship 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.500
 he meets the only sayayin that 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.750
 Its purpose was to save your planet and 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.500
 change the future of his son and 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.209
 all the sayayin is his name was bard 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.130
 bardot dedicates a few words to offer and 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.260
 defies him by launching an attack of 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.240
 energy which accomplishes nothing through 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.100
 the supernova technique of offering the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.169
 which by far was superior and is 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.820
 then when the attack goes to 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.220
 planet vegeta defeat 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.380
 a bard when in fact this undertakes 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.630
 a mysterious journey in time and the 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.120
 planet is completely destroyed with the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.830
 great majority of the giants except those who 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.740
 they met or directed others 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.900
 planets long after it 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.120
 discover that offering not only destroyed the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.250
 planet vegeta because the sayayin will be 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.080
 a nuisance but hiding others 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.360
 reasons which were the fear of 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.190
 old legend of super saiyan that bard 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.020
 -who was responsible for disclosing in the race 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.000
 of the tyrant by that trip in the 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.100
 time beating an ancestor called 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.380
 screamed who was a space pirate and a 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.450
 new little credible motive where bills the 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.280
 god of destruction just be it 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.220
 he ordered because he did not like the attitude 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.650
 of the king vegeta I hope that this video will 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.780
 have liked you already know that if you liked it 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.210

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.520
 up that helps me a lot I hope that 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.110
 subscribe as I said and nothing until 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.110
