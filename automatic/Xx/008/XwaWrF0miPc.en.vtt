00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
into the amp and the guitar input here

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
into the amp and the guitar input here
is<00:01:31.979> important<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.729> lieutenant<00:01:32.970> guitar

no lights come on until you plug the
guitar<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.329> now<00:01:39.780> I'm<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> look<00:01:40.350> at

guitar in now I'm just going to look at
some<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> effects<00:01:41.159> we've<00:01:41.340> got<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:42.259> first

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
some of the effects we've got here first

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.370 
some of the effects we've got here first

simulator first of all we've got off

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.080 
simulator first of all we've got off
then<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.860> use<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.130> EQ<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:50.850> we've<00:01:50.970> got

amplifier noir to simulate here next
we've<00:02:03.750> got<00:02:03.780> gain<00:02:04.250> bass<00:02:05.360> middle<00:02:06.360> treble<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
we've got gain bass middle treble and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.690 
we've got gain bass middle treble and
then<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.280> level<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.789> effects

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
then the level of the effects

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.250 
then the level of the effects
so<00:02:10.240> that<00:02:10.420> would<00:02:10.509> be<00:02:10.599> where<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.810> would<00:02:10.899> first

we've<00:04:55.870> got<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.080> tuner<00:04:56.530> when<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.800> press<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:58.120> two

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
we've got a tuner when you press the two

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.120 
we've got a tuner when you press the two
these<00:04:58.810> two<00:04:59.020> pedals<00:04:59.320> down<00:04:59.530> it's<00:04:59.890> actually

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
these two pedals down it's actually

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.000 
these two pedals down it's actually
comes<00:05:00.790> in<00:05:00.940> as<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.060> tumor<00:05:01.480> but<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.440> fantastic

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
comes in as a tumor but the fantastic

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.370 
comes in as a tumor but the fantastic
thing<00:05:03.220> is<00:05:03.370> that<00:05:03.580> once<00:05:03.730> you've<00:05:03.970> got<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.630> sound

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
thing is that once you've got a sound

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.520 
thing is that once you've got a sound
that<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:05.590> like<00:05:05.860> its<00:05:06.460> simplicity<00:05:07.060> itself<00:05:07.750> to

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
that you like its simplicity itself to

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.610 
that you like its simplicity itself to
store<00:05:08.890> it<00:05:09.100> you<00:05:10.090> get<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.420> same<00:05:10.810> we've<00:05:10.960> got<00:05:11.140> a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
store it you get the same we've got a

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.650 
store it you get the same we've got a
nice<00:05:11.860> sample<00:05:12.850> that<00:05:13.060> we've<00:05:13.150> got<00:05:13.330> here<00:05:13.480> we<00:05:13.540> want

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
nice sample that we've got here we want

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.620 
nice sample that we've got here we want
to<00:05:13.720> store<00:05:13.990> it<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.590> press<00:05:14.800> right<00:05:15.510> then<00:05:16.510> we

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
to store it the press right then we

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.120 
to store it the press right then we
press<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.020> pedal<00:05:17.320> that<00:05:17.440> we<00:05:17.530> want<00:05:17.680> it<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.890> be<00:05:18.040> in

effect<00:05:30.880> I'm<00:05:31.030> going<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.240> take<00:05:31.390> a<00:05:31.419> couple<00:05:31.810> of

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
effect I'm going to take a couple of

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.650 
effect I'm going to take a couple of
videos<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.860> go<00:05:32.980> through<00:05:33.310> it<00:05:33.400> so<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.210> next<00:05:34.390> time

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
videos to go through it so the next time

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.870 
videos to go through it so the next time
I'll<00:05:34.990> just<00:05:35.200> be<00:05:35.350> going<00:05:35.470> through<00:05:35.890> the<00:05:36.550> different

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
I'll just be going through the different

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.730 
I'll just be going through the different
sounds<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.480> we<00:05:37.600> can<00:05:37.810> get<00:05:37.990> from<00:05:38.169> this<00:05:38.410> pedal

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
sounds that we can get from this pedal
