00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
economic situation is kind of so complex

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.150 
economic situation is kind of so complex
but<00:00:21.030> we<00:00:21.270> kind<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.960> really<00:00:22.170> need<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.530> you<00:00:23.070> know

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
but we kind of really need to you know

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.660 
but we kind of really need to you know
focus<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.990> we<00:00:24.990> had<00:00:25.289> our<00:00:25.470> hands<00:00:25.710> full<00:00:25.860> and

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
focus on that we had our hands full and

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.240 
focus on that we had our hands full and
then<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.030> year<00:00:27.360> ago<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.600> saw<00:00:28.020> silver<00:00:28.380> rotor<00:00:28.770> in

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
then a year ago I saw silver rotor in

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.070 
then a year ago I saw silver rotor in
the<00:00:29.550> vanilla<00:00:29.940> in<00:00:30.270> Venice

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the vanilla in Venice

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.919 
the vanilla in Venice
it<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.740> very<00:00:31.920> beautifully<00:00:32.399> done<00:00:32.789> so<00:00:33.239> we

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:33.929 
it was very beautifully done so we

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.079 
it was very beautifully done so we
basically<00:00:34.260> invited<00:00:35.159> them<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.940> our

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
basically invited them to be our

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.239 
basically invited them to be our
curators<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:36.960> completely<00:00:37.440> surrender<00:00:38.039> to

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
curators and we completely surrender to

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:41.569 
curators and we completely surrender to
them<00:00:38.429> and<00:00:38.699> I'm<00:00:39.629> very<00:00:40.019> happy<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.530> did<00:00:40.679> it<00:00:40.859> we

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
them and I'm very happy we did it we

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.059 
them and I'm very happy we did it we
have<00:00:41.699> a<00:00:41.789> long<00:00:41.969> history<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:43.589> they

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:44.069 
have a long history we have I think they

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.219 
have a long history we have I think they
calculated<00:00:44.699> that<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.030> did<00:00:45.359> four<00:00:45.989> enough

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
calculated that we did four enough

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.270 
calculated that we did four enough
million<00:00:46.620> images<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.739> we<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.859> done<00:00:50.069> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
million images so we we have done so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.309 
million images so we we have done so
much<00:00:50.519> that<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.300> way<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.629> can't<00:00:51.899> represent

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:52.319 
much that in a way you can't represent

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.489 
much that in a way you can't represent
it<00:00:52.710> anymore<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> kind<00:00:54.179> of<00:00:54.210> linear<00:00:54.510> thing<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
it anymore as a kind of linear thing and

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.349 
it anymore as a kind of linear thing and
what<00:00:55.920> they<00:00:56.069> did<00:00:56.249> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.969> think<00:00:57.179> in<00:00:57.269> a<00:00:57.299> very

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
what they did and I think in a very

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.389 
what they did and I think in a very
smart<00:00:57.749> thing<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.319> make<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> number<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
smart thing is make a number of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.869 
smart thing is make a number of
intersections<00:01:00.179> that<00:01:01.100> enabled<00:01:02.100> them<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.249> talk

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
intersections that enabled them to talk

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.840 
intersections that enabled them to talk
about<00:01:03.030> things<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.569> past<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> things<00:01:05.129> we

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
about things in the past the things we

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
about things in the past the things we
are<00:01:05.909> currently<00:01:06.149> involved<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.380> things<00:01:07.619> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
are currently involved in and things in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
are currently involved in and things in
the<00:01:07.829> future<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.789> room<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.360> very<00:01:09.539> nice

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the future this room is very nice

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.529 
the future this room is very nice
because<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> older<00:01:11.539> whenever

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
because it's kind of older whenever

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.600 
because it's kind of older whenever
there's<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> show<00:01:13.259> you<00:01:13.590> know<00:01:13.829> kind<00:01:14.219> of<00:01:14.250> part<00:01:14.549> of

cannot show that you kind of do this you
cannot<00:01:18.359> do<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.719> so<00:01:19.439> basically<00:01:19.609> we<00:01:21.049> insisted

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
cannot do that so basically we insisted

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.289 
cannot do that so basically we insisted
that<00:01:22.109> we<00:01:22.439> should<00:01:22.890> surrender<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.969> so<00:01:24.119> whatever

we actually cannot you know it's going

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.660 
we actually cannot you know it's going
to<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.939> basically<00:01:27.149> blacked<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:29.310> it's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
to be basically blacked out but it's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.370 
to be basically blacked out but it's
it's<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.020> me<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.320> very

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it's there and for me it's very

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.740 
it's there and for me it's very
important<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.250> kind<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
important because this kind of

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.429 
important because this kind of
declaration<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:34.770> almost<00:01:35.100> never<00:01:35.369> made<00:01:35.729> by<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
declaration it's almost never made by a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.279 
declaration it's almost never made by a
traditional<00:01:38.280> architecture<00:01:39.149> office<00:01:39.329> other

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
traditional architecture office other

this<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.870> film<00:01:56.230> made<00:01:56.500> out<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:56.890> every<00:01:57.160> image

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
this is a film made out of every image

this is a film made out of every image
we<00:01:57.490> ever<00:01:57.790> produced<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.900> so<00:01:59.140> according<00:01:59.620> to

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
we ever produced and so according to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.390 
we ever produced and so according to
them<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.310> increases<00:02:00.880> with<00:02:01.830> 1,500<00:02:02.830> images

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
them it increases with 1,500 images

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.650 
of a skirt we we had to kind of rotate
it<00:04:14.740> there<00:04:15.459> is<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.610> kind<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:15.910> platform<00:04:16.120> that

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
it there is a kind of platform that

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.780 
it there is a kind of platform that
moves<00:04:16.959> through<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.709> building<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.700> it

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
moves through the building and it

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.909 
moves through the building and it
changes<00:04:19.269> their<00:04:19.450> architecture<00:04:20.139> this<00:04:20.709> is

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
changes their architecture this is

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.420 
changes their architecture this is
another<00:04:21.100> beautiful<00:04:21.609> example<00:04:21.820> it's<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.360> kind<00:04:22.540> of

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
another beautiful example it's a kind of

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.120 
another beautiful example it's a kind of
escalator<00:04:24.430> that<00:04:24.880> we<00:04:25.389> handmade<00:04:25.990> with<00:04:26.710> a<00:04:26.740> hinge

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
escalator that we handmade with a hinge

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.580 
escalator that we handmade with a hinge
so<00:04:27.880> that's<00:04:28.060> kind<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.330> in<00:04:28.540> certain<00:04:29.110> cases<00:04:29.320> you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
so that's kind of in certain cases you

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.250 
so that's kind of in certain cases you
can<00:04:29.770> liberate<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.370> entire<00:04:30.700> floor<00:04:31.389> for<00:04:32.230> a

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
can liberate the entire floor for a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.530 
can liberate the entire floor for a
building<00:04:32.590> in<00:04:32.740> Venice<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.940> very<00:04:34.180> irritating

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
building in Venice it's very irritating

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.720 
building in Venice it's very irritating
how<00:04:35.110> architecture<00:04:36.100> is<00:04:36.220> typically

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
how architecture is typically

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.640 
how architecture is typically
represented<00:04:37.540> it's<00:04:37.750> people<00:04:38.110> looking<00:04:38.410> at

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
represented it's people looking at

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.310 
represented it's people looking at
buildings<00:04:39.190> so<00:04:39.700> this<00:04:39.970> is<00:04:40.120> all<00:04:40.419> how<00:04:41.260> the

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
buildings so this is all how the

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.550 
buildings so this is all how the
building<00:04:41.950> acts<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.460> frame<00:04:43.169> so<00:04:44.169> this<00:04:44.350> is<00:04:44.530> a

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
building acts like a frame so this is a

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.400 
building acts like a frame so this is a
building<00:04:44.980> that<00:04:45.040> is<00:04:45.550> it's<00:04:45.820> like<00:04:46.060> a<00:04:46.090> friend<00:04:46.510> this

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
building that is it's like a friend this

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.990 
building that is it's like a friend this
is<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.620> kind<00:04:47.919> of<00:04:47.980> building<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.520> embassy

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
is the kind of building of the embassy

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.500 
is the kind of building of the embassy
in<00:04:49.530> Berlin<00:04:50.530> which<00:04:51.220> is<00:04:51.370> actually<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.910> tool<00:04:52.180> to

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
in Berlin which is actually the tool to

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.240 
in Berlin which is actually the tool to
look<00:04:52.660> at<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.930> environment<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:53.800> so<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.220> look

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
look at the environment and so to look

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.570 
look at the environment and so to look
at<00:04:54.760> this<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:56.230> look<00:04:56.440> at<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.770> conversationalist

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
at this to look at the conversationalist

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.030 
at this to look at the conversationalist
kind<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.390> buildings<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:58.990> past<00:04:59.229> this<00:04:59.860> is<00:05:00.010> a

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
kind of buildings of the past this is a

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.610 
kind of buildings of the past this is a
building<00:05:00.340> in<00:05:00.430> London<00:05:00.880> which<00:05:01.600> again<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.260> a<00:05:02.290> tool

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
building in London which again is a tool

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.360 
building in London which again is a tool
to<00:05:02.950> look<00:05:03.160> at<00:05:03.310> a<00:05:03.340> kind<00:05:03.610> of<00:05:03.640> Church<00:05:03.970> of<00:05:04.410> Ren<00:05:05.410> which

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
to look at a kind of Church of Ren which

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.659 
to look at a kind of Church of Ren which
is<00:05:06.550> behind<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:07.900> in<00:05:08.200> all<00:05:08.770> of<00:05:08.800> these<00:05:08.950> it's

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
is behind it so in all of these it's

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.010 
is behind it so in all of these it's
kind<00:05:09.940> of<00:05:09.970> really<00:05:10.120> not<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.510> building<00:05:10.900> that

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
kind of really not the building that

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.760 
kind of really not the building that
wants<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.500> attention<00:05:11.760> but<00:05:12.760> it's<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.410> way<00:05:14.410> in

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
wants the attention but it's the way in

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.200 
wants the attention but it's the way in
which<00:05:14.830> you<00:05:15.130> use<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.460> building<00:05:15.760> as<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:15.850> kind<00:05:16.150> of

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
which you use the building as a kind of

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.880 
which you use the building as a kind of
lens<00:05:17.520> these<00:05:18.520> are<00:05:18.760> just<00:05:19.030> converters<00:05:19.660> that<00:05:19.900> we

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.469 

we've<00:05:23.890> always<00:05:24.160> been<00:05:24.490> obsessed<00:05:24.669> with<00:05:25.030> with

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
we've always been obsessed with with

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.200 
we've always been obsessed with with
structure<00:05:26.220> so<00:05:27.220> these<00:05:27.370> are<00:05:27.580> kind<00:05:27.760> of<00:05:27.850> simply

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
structure so these are kind of simply

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.240 
structure so these are kind of simply
some<00:05:28.390> examples<00:05:28.900> of<00:05:29.020> that<00:05:29.169> of<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:30.010> kind<00:05:30.190> of

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
some examples of that of the kind of

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.950 
some examples of that of the kind of
presence<00:05:30.640> of<00:05:30.789> structure<00:05:31.270> and<00:05:31.510> in<00:05:31.840> the

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
presence of structure and in the

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.390 
presence of structure and in the
converse<00:05:32.229> is<00:05:32.350> to<00:05:32.530> be<00:05:32.680> building<00:05:33.039> from<00:05:33.250> the

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
converse is to be building from the

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.600 
converse is to be building from the
inside<00:05:33.850> but<00:05:34.780> here<00:05:35.140> also<00:05:35.560> how<00:05:35.950> structure<00:05:36.490> is

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
inside but here also how structure is

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.790 
inside but here also how structure is
actually<00:05:37.030> kind<00:05:37.240> of<00:05:37.300> one<00:05:37.479> of<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.840> more

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
actually kind of one of the more

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.580 
actually kind of one of the more
important<00:05:39.640> kind<00:05:40.450> of<00:05:40.479> forms<00:05:40.810> of<00:05:40.960> dialogue<00:05:41.229> or

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
important kind of forms of dialogue or

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.700 
important kind of forms of dialogue or
collaboration<00:05:42.370> is<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.180> kind<00:05:43.479> of

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
collaboration is the kind of

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.250 
collaboration is the kind of
conversation<00:05:44.710> with<00:05:45.250> Arab<00:05:45.610> in<00:05:46.479> its<00:05:46.690> entirety

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
conversation with Arab in its entirety

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.820 
conversation with Arab in its entirety
kind<00:05:47.530> of<00:05:47.590> leading<00:05:47.800> kind<00:05:48.789> of<00:05:48.880> from<00:05:49.830> story

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
battles in a way traditional basically

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.190 
battles in a way traditional basically
to<00:05:53.979> the<00:05:54.010> structure<00:05:54.580> that<00:05:54.729> we<00:05:54.910> eventually<00:05:55.750> got

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
to the structure that we eventually got

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.040 
to the structure that we eventually got
on<00:05:56.229> CCTV<00:05:56.770> these<00:05:57.760> are<00:05:57.970> kind<00:05:58.270> of<00:05:58.300> site<00:05:58.539> visits

on CCTV these are kind of site visits

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.770 
on CCTV these are kind of site visits
and<00:05:59.229> the<00:06:00.160> way<00:06:00.460> they<00:06:00.700> eventually<00:06:01.300> kind<00:06:01.479> of<00:06:01.600> lead

like this as a kind of plaster model so

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.490 
like this as a kind of plaster model so
kind<00:06:26.670> of<00:06:26.730> one<00:06:27.000> when<00:06:27.480> we<00:06:27.660> were<00:06:27.690> almost<00:06:28.050> about<00:06:28.440> to

kind of one when we were almost about to

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.580 
kind of one when we were almost about to
render<00:06:28.980> the<00:06:29.400> Chinese<00:06:30.240> said<00:06:30.450> you<00:06:31.140> have<00:06:31.260> to<00:06:31.410> make

render the Chinese said you have to make

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.890 
render the Chinese said you have to make
a<00:06:31.620> different<00:06:32.070> model<00:06:32.280> which<00:06:32.700> is<00:06:32.900> transparent

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
a different model which is transparent

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.450 
a different model which is transparent
for<00:06:34.140> our<00:06:34.320> leaders<00:06:34.680> because<00:06:35.070> they<00:06:35.160> will<00:06:35.340> not

for our leaders because they will not
understand<00:06:37.670> this<00:06:38.670> conferral<00:06:39.560> situation<00:06:40.560> is

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
understand this conferral situation is

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.650 
understand this conferral situation is
kind<00:06:40.920> of<00:06:40.950> really<00:06:41.070> dedicated<00:06:41.700> to<00:06:41.730> the<00:06:41.970> constant

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
kind of really dedicated to the constant

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.440 
kind of really dedicated to the constant
escalation<00:06:43.620> of<00:06:43.800> the<00:06:44.010> size<00:06:44.280> of<00:06:44.490> museums<00:06:44.940> this

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
escalation of the size of museums this

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.320 
escalation of the size of museums this
is<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.810> increase<00:06:46.740> of<00:06:46.770> Wall<00:06:47.100> Street<00:06:47.520> and<00:06:47.790> you

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
is the increase of Wall Street and you

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.160 
is the increase of Wall Street and you
see<00:06:48.750> how<00:06:49.340> it<00:06:50.340> totally<00:06:51.000> is<00:06:51.300> mirrored<00:06:51.870> by<00:06:52.110> the

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170 
see how it totally is mirrored by the

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.490 
see how it totally is mirrored by the
increase<00:06:52.680> in<00:06:52.710> museums<00:06:53.250> and<00:06:54.240> and<00:06:54.600> and<00:06:54.990> so<00:06:55.170> that

increase in museums and and and so that

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.340 
increase in museums and and and so that

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
kind of fundamental complicitous between

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.820 
kind of fundamental complicitous between
money<00:06:59.280> and<00:06:59.610> art<00:07:00.000> it's<00:07:00.780> been<00:07:01.050> really<00:07:01.260> shown

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
money and art it's been really shown

money and art it's been really shown
here<00:07:02.220> and<00:07:02.400> that<00:07:02.850> has<00:07:03.000> a<00:07:03.030> lot<00:07:03.270> of<00:07:03.300> consequences

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
here and that has a lot of consequences

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.730 
here and that has a lot of consequences
here<00:07:05.850> it<00:07:05.940> is<00:07:06.060> the<00:07:06.180> museum<00:07:06.570> for<00:07:06.870> Beijing<00:07:07.410> for

here it is the museum for Beijing for
Modern<00:07:08.280> Art<00:07:08.460> it's<00:07:09.120> so<00:07:09.330> big<00:07:09.600> like<00:07:09.990> under<00:07:10.260> 20

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
Modern Art it's so big like under 20

that<00:07:13.500> is<00:07:13.680> kind<00:07:14.070> of<00:07:14.130> like<00:07:14.250> 8<00:07:14.790> times<00:07:15.120> the<00:07:15.360> date

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 
that is kind of like 8 times the date

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.810 
that is kind of like 8 times the date
that<00:07:16.350> you<00:07:16.590> have<00:07:16.710> to<00:07:16.860> begin<00:07:17.130> to<00:07:17.280> think<00:07:17.430> of

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 
that you have to begin to think of

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.150 
that you have to begin to think of
museums<00:07:18.240> as<00:07:18.480> small<00:07:18.750> cities<00:07:19.170> rather<00:07:19.680> than<00:07:19.950> kind

museums as small cities rather than kind

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.010 
museums as small cities rather than kind
of<00:07:20.280> big<00:07:20.460> architecture<00:07:21.350> our<00:07:22.350> obsession<00:07:22.890> with

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
of big architecture our obsession with

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.500 
of big architecture our obsession with
travertine<00:07:26.330> this<00:07:27.330> room<00:07:27.570> is<00:07:27.690> unfinished<00:07:29.510> and

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.510 
travertine this room is unfinished and

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.780 
travertine this room is unfinished and
this<00:07:30.810> is<00:07:31.140> a<00:07:31.200> kind<00:07:31.650> of<00:07:31.680> interesting<00:07:32.310> room

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.790 
this is a kind of interesting room

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.380 
this is a kind of interesting room
because<00:07:33.120> it<00:07:33.330> kind<00:07:33.630> of<00:07:33.690> simply<00:07:34.230> shows<00:07:35.390> how

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:36.390 
because it kind of simply shows how

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.070 
because it kind of simply shows how
things<00:07:37.550> can<00:07:38.550> be<00:07:38.610> adapted<00:07:39.270> it's<00:07:39.810> called

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
things can be adapted it's called

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.350 
things can be adapted it's called
adaptation<00:07:40.290> instead<00:07:41.070> of<00:07:41.190> creating<00:07:44.180> this<00:07:45.180> is

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 
adaptation instead of creating this is

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.790 
adaptation instead of creating this is
case<00:07:45.900> in<00:07:46.110> point<00:07:46.290> this<00:07:46.710> was<00:07:46.950> look<00:07:47.130> kind<00:07:47.340> of

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 
case in point this was look kind of

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.010 
case in point this was look kind of
exhibition<00:07:49.800> center<00:07:50.570> conference<00:07:51.570> center<00:07:51.900> in

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 
exhibition center conference center in

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.300 
exhibition center conference center in
hotel<00:07:52.410> in<00:07:52.590> Cordoba<00:07:54.230> at<00:07:55.230> some<00:07:55.470> point<00:07:55.680> it<00:07:55.920> got

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.310 
hotel in Cordoba at some point it got

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.310 
hotel in Cordoba at some point it got
into<00:07:56.670> all<00:07:56.850> kinds<00:07:57.090> of<00:07:57.180> forms<00:07:57.510> and<00:07:57.690> so<00:07:57.840> we<00:07:57.990> simply

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:58.320 
into all kinds of forms and so we simply

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.240 
into all kinds of forms and so we simply
cut<00:07:58.680> off<00:07:58.890> the<00:07:59.220> hotel<00:07:59.390> you<00:08:00.390> know<00:08:00.510> and<00:08:00.750> and<00:08:01.220> had<00:08:02.220> a

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.250 
cut off the hotel you know and and had a

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.890 
cut off the hotel you know and and had a
building<00:08:02.700> which<00:08:02.910> actually<00:08:03.480> I<00:08:03.570> think<00:08:03.600> is<00:08:03.840> a

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 
building which actually I think is a

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.220 
building which actually I think is a
much<00:08:04.140> nicer<00:08:04.350> building<00:08:05.000> so<00:08:06.000> that's<00:08:06.660> that's<00:08:07.050> a

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.230 
much nicer building so that's that's a

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.980 
much nicer building so that's that's a
show

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:07.990 
show

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.050 
show
you
