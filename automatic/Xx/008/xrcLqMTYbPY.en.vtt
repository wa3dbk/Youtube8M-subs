00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.850 

for<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.210> sake<00:00:19.450> of<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.750> video<00:00:20.080> I<00:00:20.380> am<00:00:20.590> washing

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.260 
for the sake of the video I am washing
my<00:00:21.100> hair<00:00:21.550> at<00:00:21.760> my<00:00:21.990> bathroom<00:00:22.990> sink<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.820> because

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
my hair at my bathroom sink just because

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.100 
my hair at my bathroom sink just because
it<00:00:25.510> was<00:00:25.540> easier<00:00:26.080> to<00:00:26.140> record<00:00:26.800> this<00:00:27.010> way<00:00:27.279> um<00:00:28.110> but

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
it was easier to record this way um but

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.410 
it was easier to record this way um but
one<00:00:29.470> thing<00:00:29.680> I<00:00:29.800> do<00:00:29.860> do<00:00:30.369> is<00:00:30.550> finger<00:00:30.760> detangle

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
one thing I do do is finger detangle

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.290 
one thing I do do is finger detangle
just<00:00:31.840> like<00:00:32.050> this<00:00:32.489> my<00:00:33.489> hair<00:00:33.700> was<00:00:33.790> pretty<00:00:34.090> much

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
just like this my hair was pretty much

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.530 
just like this my hair was pretty much
to<00:00:34.480> tangle<00:00:34.840> from<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.170> last<00:00:35.440> style<00:00:35.800> that<00:00:36.129> I<00:00:36.160> had

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
to tangle from the last style that I had

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.240 
to tangle from the last style that I had
so<00:00:37.540> there<00:00:37.989> wasn't<00:00:38.199> a<00:00:38.410> lot<00:00:38.530> of<00:00:38.590> tangles<00:00:39.100> but

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
so there wasn't a lot of tangles but

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.570 
so there wasn't a lot of tangles but
some<00:00:39.610> of<00:00:39.879> my<00:00:40.180> strands<00:00:40.540> did<00:00:40.900> have<00:00:41.170> some<00:00:42.040> nuts<00:00:42.309> in

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
some of my strands did have some nuts in

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.890 
some of my strands did have some nuts in
there<00:00:42.850> I<00:00:43.890> decided<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:45.250> do<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:45.640> close-up<00:00:46.000> on<00:00:46.360> the

I'm just showing you guys the protein

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.929 
I'm just showing you guys the protein
treatment<00:02:53.349> that<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.530> ended<00:02:53.829> up<00:02:53.950> using<00:02:54.159> and<00:02:54.640> I've

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
treatment that I ended up using and I've

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.059 
treatment that I ended up using and I've
been<00:02:55.450> using<00:02:55.689> this<00:02:55.930> protein<00:02:56.379> treatment<00:02:56.859> since

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
been using this protein treatment since

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.599 
been using this protein treatment since
I<00:02:57.280> was<00:02:57.459> relaxed<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.329> like<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.739> I<00:03:00.400> always

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
I was relaxed and I like it and I always

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.250 
I was relaxed and I like it and I always
follow<00:03:00.909> up<00:03:01.209> with<00:03:01.359> a<00:03:01.390> deep<00:03:01.629> condition<00:03:02.109> after

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
follow up with a deep condition after

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.949 
follow up with a deep condition after
the<00:03:02.470> protein<00:03:02.889> and<00:03:03.159> this<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.489> my<00:03:03.639> go-to<00:03:03.909> on<00:03:04.480> d

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
the protein and this is my go-to on d

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.309 
the protein and this is my go-to on d
Trishna<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:07.090> don't<00:03:07.299> have<00:03:07.420> any<00:03:07.690> plastic

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
Trishna and I don't have any plastic

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.750 
Trishna and I don't have any plastic
caps<00:03:08.799> so<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:10.000> grocery<00:03:10.450> bag<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.349> it<00:03:12.250> works

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
caps so the grocery bag it is it works

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.319 
caps so the grocery bag it is it works
just<00:03:12.940> fine<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:14.170> if<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.620> don't<00:03:14.739> have<00:03:14.950> one<00:03:15.329> get

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
just fine so if you don't have one get

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:25.949 
just fine so if you don't have one get
that<00:03:16.510> plastic<00:03:16.989> bag<00:03:17.230> girl<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:24.569> here<00:03:25.569> I'm<00:03:25.720> just

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
that plastic bag girl and here I'm just

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.660 
that plastic bag girl and here I'm just
showing<00:03:26.079> you<00:03:26.260> guys<00:03:26.349> the<00:03:26.530> dryer<00:03:26.920> i<00:03:27.190> sat<00:03:27.519> under

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
showing you guys the dryer i sat under

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.530 
showing you guys the dryer i sat under
here<00:03:27.970> for<00:03:28.209> about<00:03:28.389> maybe<00:03:29.139> 15<00:03:29.799> minutes<00:03:30.010> or<00:03:30.280> so

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
here for about maybe 15 minutes or so

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.670 
here for about maybe 15 minutes or so
not<00:03:31.540> too<00:03:31.780> long

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.589 

so<00:03:38.680> this<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.099> shot<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.490> my<00:03:39.700> hair<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:40.030> on

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
so this is a shot of my hair just on

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.760 
so this is a shot of my hair just on
with<00:03:41.200> no<00:03:41.349> part<00:03:41.620> in<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:42.660> wet<00:03:43.660> from<00:03:44.140> like<00:03:44.560> right

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
with no part in it wet from like right

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.170 
with no part in it wet from like right
after<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.250> finish<00:03:45.819> washing<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.780> conditioning

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
after I finish washing and conditioning

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.760 
after I finish washing and conditioning
protein<00:03:49.180> treating<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.930> deep<00:03:50.230> conditioning

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
protein treating and deep conditioning

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.090 
protein treating and deep conditioning
so<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.580> was<00:03:51.760> after<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.209> whole<00:03:52.390> process<00:03:52.840> was

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
so this was after the whole process was

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.220 
so this was after the whole process was
done<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.280> over<00:03:54.610> wit<00:03:54.790> my<00:03:55.420> hair<00:03:55.660> felt<00:03:55.900> really

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
done and over wit my hair felt really

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.650 
done and over wit my hair felt really
really<00:03:56.530> soft<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.459> like<00:03:57.819> our<00:03:58.030> black<00:03:58.270> my<00:03:58.450> hair

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
really soft I like our black my hair

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.270 
really soft I like our black my hair
looks<00:03:58.870> even<00:03:59.200> though<00:03:59.290> it's<00:03:59.530> not<00:03:59.620> black<00:04:00.040> as

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
looks even though it's not black as

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.670 
looks even though it's not black as
brown<00:04:00.660> but<00:04:01.660> I'm<00:04:02.050> actually<00:04:02.200> thinking<00:04:02.530> about

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
brown but I'm actually thinking about

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.550 
brown but I'm actually thinking about
jet<00:04:03.340> black<00:04:03.580> in<00:04:03.730> my<00:04:03.819> hair<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.330> don't<00:04:04.780> know<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.170> want

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
jet black in my hair I don't know I want

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.400 
jet black in my hair I don't know I want
some<00:04:05.739> color<00:04:08.190> before<00:04:09.190> i<00:04:09.640> continue<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.959> air<00:04:11.170> dry

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
some color before i continue to air dry

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.280 
some color before i continue to air dry
I<00:04:11.830> kind<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.430> just<00:04:12.670> um<00:04:12.970> just<00:04:13.450> squeeze<00:04:13.989> out<00:04:14.170> the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
I kind of just um just squeeze out the

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.409 
I kind of just um just squeeze out the
excess<00:04:14.319> water<00:04:14.739> that's<00:04:15.280> in<00:04:15.430> my<00:04:15.580> hair<00:04:15.880> so<00:04:15.910> that

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
excess water that's in my hair so that

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.719 
excess water that's in my hair so that
I'm<00:04:17.169> not<00:04:17.229> walking<00:04:17.709> around<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.340> house<00:04:18.489> with

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
I'm not walking around the house with

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.670 
I'm not walking around the house with
water<00:04:19.000> dripping<00:04:19.510> all<00:04:19.660> over<00:04:19.690> my<00:04:20.019> face<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.410> my

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
water dripping all over my face and my

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.140 
water dripping all over my face and my
neck<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:24.340> kind<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.669> squeeze<00:04:24.880> the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
neck and so I just kind of squeeze the

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.060 
neck and so I just kind of squeeze the
water<00:04:25.300> out<00:04:25.479> with<00:04:25.900> this<00:04:26.110> towel<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> lot<00:04:26.979> of

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
water out with this towel a lot of

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.190 
water out with this towel a lot of
people<00:04:27.340> don't<00:04:27.580> do<00:04:27.760> that<00:04:27.940> but<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.419> didn't<00:04:29.020> have<00:04:29.169> a

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
people don't do that but I didn't have a

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.070 
people don't do that but I didn't have a
problem<00:04:29.530> doing<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:31.330> this<00:04:31.720> is<00:04:31.780> basically

much the only thing that I didn't show
in<00:05:12.320> this<00:05:12.470> video<00:05:12.680> was<00:05:13.160> what<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.430> did<00:05:13.820> with<00:05:13.970> my

hair<00:05:14.389> afterwards<00:05:14.900> and<00:05:15.470> that's<00:05:15.650> because<00:05:15.830> I

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
hair afterwards and that's because I

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.180 
hair afterwards and that's because I
ended<00:05:16.370> up<00:05:16.460> air<00:05:16.729> drying<00:05:16.940> longer<00:05:17.780> than<00:05:17.960> I<00:05:18.190> wanted

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
doing the lco method works better and is

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.379 
doing the lco method works better and is
more<00:05:36.289> effective<00:05:36.889> at<00:05:37.160> making<00:05:37.210> well<00:05:38.210> actually

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
more effective at making well actually

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.500

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
realized when I do it that way I don't

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.629 
realized when I do it that way I don't
have<00:05:44.060> to<00:05:44.210> continuously<00:05:44.960> do<00:05:45.320> it<00:05:45.470> so<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.430> works

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
have to continuously do it so that works
