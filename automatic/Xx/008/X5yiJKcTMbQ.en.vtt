00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
you create this anti-gravity feel that

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.949 
you create this anti-gravity feel that
right<00:02:46.230> raises<00:02:46.800> this<00:02:46.920> platform<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.840> get<00:02:48.840> to

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
get the platform I we get the Chimera

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.190 
get the platform I we get the Chimera
because<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.300> Frog<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.540> just<00:04:11.900> too<00:04:12.020> freakin

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200

issues with certain things not being
drawn<00:05:02.380> as<00:05:03.130> you<00:05:03.310> saw<00:05:03.460> there<00:05:03.490> that's<00:05:03.850> actually<00:05:04.150> a

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
drawn as you saw there that's actually a

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.120 
drawn as you saw there that's actually a
laser<00:05:04.389> beam<00:05:04.600> coming<00:05:04.870> down<00:05:05.110> then<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.530> couldn't<00:05:05.889> I

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
laser beam coming down then I couldn't I

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:41.129 
laser beam coming down then I couldn't I
had<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.460> wait<00:05:06.639> for<00:05:06.669> it<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:06.940> clear

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:47.159 

alright<00:05:41.949> so<00:05:43.560> here<00:05:44.560> we<00:05:44.650> are<00:05:44.800> at<00:05:45.159> the<00:05:45.729> boss<00:05:46.509> volt

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
alright so here we are at the boss volt

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.850 
alright so here we are at the boss volt
catfish<00:05:47.710> now<00:05:48.520> he's<00:05:49.509> pretty<00:05:49.840> simple<00:05:50.229> he's<00:05:50.529> weak

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.610 
jump and sort of Bounce land towards you
so<00:06:06.360> didn't<00:06:07.360> do<00:06:07.479> such<00:06:07.659> a<00:06:07.689> good<00:06:07.779> job<00:06:07.930> here<00:06:08.319> but<00:06:08.349> if

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
so didn't do such a good job here but if

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.249 
so didn't do such a good job here but if
you<00:06:08.830> time<00:06:09.370> it<00:06:09.400> right<00:06:09.580> it<00:06:10.029> is<00:06:10.360> possible<00:06:10.930> such

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
you time it right it is possible such

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.350 
you time it right it is possible such
that<00:06:11.499> when<00:06:11.830> you<00:06:11.949> jump<00:06:12.249> to<00:06:12.939> the<00:06:13.060> other<00:06:13.090> side

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
that when you jump to the other side

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.050 
that when you jump to the other side
that<00:06:13.689> tornado<00:06:14.110> will<00:06:14.439> actually<00:06:14.830> that<00:06:15.340> your

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
that tornado will actually that your

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.450 
that tornado will actually that your
first<00:06:16.240> T<00:06:16.389> thing<00:06:16.539> Willie<00:06:16.900> hit<00:06:17.050> him<00:06:17.169> again<00:06:17.460> but

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
first T thing Willie hit him again but

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.320 
first T thing Willie hit him again but
it<00:06:18.520> doesn't<00:06:18.759> really<00:06:18.819> matter<00:06:19.090> just<00:06:19.689> the<00:06:21.330> avoid

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
it doesn't really matter just the avoid

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.700 
it doesn't really matter just the avoid
him<00:06:22.509> I'm<00:06:22.960> not<00:06:23.139> really<00:06:23.259> doing<00:06:23.469> a<00:06:23.529> good<00:06:23.650> job

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
him I'm not really doing a good job

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.830 
him I'm not really doing a good job
actually<00:06:24.159> what<00:06:24.400> you<00:06:24.789> should<00:06:25.000> do<00:06:25.150> is<00:06:25.360> dash

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
actually what you should do is dash

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.929 
actually what you should do is dash
underneath<00:06:26.349> him<00:06:26.529> when<00:06:26.710> he<00:06:26.860> jumps<00:06:27.430> at<00:06:27.520> you<00:06:27.550> not

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:27.939 
underneath him when he jumps at you not

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.330 
underneath him when he jumps at you not
try<00:06:28.150> to<00:06:28.180> jump<00:06:28.449> over<00:06:28.629> the<00:06:28.719> top<00:06:28.930> of<00:06:28.960> him<00:06:29.189> now<00:06:30.189> when

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
try to jump over the top of him now when

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.709 
try to jump over the top of him now when
you've<00:06:30.430> taken<00:06:30.580> off<00:06:30.789> half<00:06:30.969> his<00:06:31.000> energy<00:06:31.449> and

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
you've taken off half his energy and

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:32.939 
you've taken off half his energy and
sort<00:06:32.050> of<00:06:32.110> comes<00:06:32.259> to<00:06:32.379> the<00:06:32.469> middle<00:06:32.680> and<00:06:32.770> tries<00:06:32.919> to

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
sort of comes to the middle and tries to

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.860 
sort of comes to the middle and tries to
use<00:06:33.219> this<00:06:33.370> electricity<00:06:33.819> attack<00:06:34.360> against<00:06:34.750> you

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
use this electricity attack against you

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.409 
use this electricity attack against you
but<00:06:35.080> just<00:06:35.370> stand<00:06:36.370> next<00:06:36.460> to<00:06:36.729> him<00:06:36.819> and<00:06:37.120> whenever

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
but just stand next to him and whenever

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.899 
but just stand next to him and whenever
he<00:06:37.740> jumps<00:06:38.740> and<00:06:38.889> then<00:06:38.979> lands<00:06:39.279> again<00:06:39.490> hitting

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
he jumps and then lands again hitting

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:41.689 
he jumps and then lands again hitting
with<00:06:40.120> the<00:06:40.150> tornado<00:06:40.419> Fang<00:06:40.810> and<00:06:41.050> it'll<00:06:41.529> just

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
with the tornado Fang and it'll just

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.089 
with the tornado Fang and it'll just
take<00:06:42.699> these<00:06:42.849> energy<00:06:43.210> way<00:06:43.389> it's<00:06:44.009> after<00:06:45.009> the

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
take these energy way it's after the

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.899 
take these energy way it's after the
second<00:06:45.339> half<00:06:45.580> it's<00:06:45.759> very<00:06:46.150> simple<00:06:46.449> so<00:06:47.909> rinse

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:48.909 
second half it's very simple so rinse

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.279 
second half it's very simple so rinse
and<00:06:49.000> repeat<00:06:49.120> and<00:06:49.509> you<00:06:49.689> shouldn't<00:06:49.900> have<00:06:49.990> any

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.289 
and repeat and you shouldn't have any

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:57.800 
and repeat and you shouldn't have any
problems<00:06:51.219> with<00:06:51.279> this<00:06:51.520> guy<00:06:52.919> fillet<00:06:53.919> him

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.570 

alright<00:06:58.810> with<00:06:59.050> that<00:06:59.080> I'll<00:06:59.500> see<00:07:00.189> what<00:07:00.310> the<00:07:00.430> next

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
alright with that I'll see what the next

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:07.679 
alright with that I'll see what the next
level

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:07.689 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:31.890 

ah

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:31.900 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.960 

you
