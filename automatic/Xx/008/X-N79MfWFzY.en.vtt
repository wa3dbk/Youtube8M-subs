00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
at the motherboard I'll hold this up to

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.240 
at the motherboard I'll hold this up to

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
going those three holes you see that's

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.880 
going those three holes you see that's
illuminating<00:01:03.880> through<00:01:04.379> there's<00:01:05.379> three<00:01:05.560> holes

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
illuminating through there's three holes

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.980 
illuminating through there's three holes

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
in the center and there's three holes at

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.249 
in the center and there's three holes at
the<00:01:08.049> bottom<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.790> cannot<00:01:10.600> stress<00:01:11.020> this

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
the bottom now I cannot stress this

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.660 
the bottom now I cannot stress this
enough<00:01:11.439> because<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.070> happened<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.520> me

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
enough because this happened to me

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.889 
enough because this happened to me
before<00:01:14.579> use<00:01:15.579> only<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:16.119> brass<00:01:16.329> stand-ups<00:01:16.780> this

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
before use only the brass stand-ups this

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.390 
before use only the brass stand-ups this
unique<00:01:17.200> don't<00:01:17.439> put<00:01:17.620> them<00:01:17.680> in<00:01:17.830> every<00:01:17.979> hole<00:01:18.280> in

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
unique don't put them in every hole in

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.790 
unique don't put them in every hole in
there<00:01:18.550> otherwise<00:01:19.450> on<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.440> back<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.740> the

motherboard you see all these little

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.090 
motherboard you see all these little
metal<00:01:22.240> pieces<00:01:22.540> yeah<00:01:23.470> they're<00:01:23.680> going<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:23.890> touch

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
metal pieces yeah they're going to touch

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.219 
metal pieces yeah they're going to touch
one<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.400> them<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.790> it's<00:01:24.970> going<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.180> short<00:01:26.080> it

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
one of them and it's going to short it

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.800

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
and you won't be able to use this

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.340 
and you won't be able to use this
computer<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.890> use<00:01:30.159> only<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:31.200> stand-ups<00:01:32.200> that

right there let me go now when

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.550 
right there let me go now when
installing<00:03:55.010> hard<00:03:55.310> drives

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.370 

here<00:03:58.739> let<00:03:59.130> me<00:03:59.190> get<00:03:59.370> my<00:04:04.910> okay<00:04:05.910> there<00:04:06.060> we<00:04:06.090> go<00:04:06.380> your

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
here let me get my okay there we go your

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.180 
here let me get my okay there we go your
connector<00:04:08.209> your<00:04:09.209> serial<00:04:09.720> ata<00:04:10.050> connector<00:04:10.560> this

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
connector your serial ata connector this

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.089 
connector your serial ata connector this
should<00:04:11.459> go<00:04:11.610> on<00:04:12.230> things<00:04:13.230> right<00:04:13.470> here<00:04:13.650> like<00:04:13.860> that

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
should go on things right here like that

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.840 
should go on things right here like that
so<00:04:15.090> they<00:04:15.269> only<00:04:15.390> go<00:04:15.660> in<00:04:15.870> one<00:04:15.900> way<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:17.700> just

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
so they only go in one way and you just

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.879 
so they only go in one way and you just
get<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.060> visual<00:04:18.329> look<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.470> locks<00:04:19.680> in<00:04:19.829> that

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
get a visual look and it locks in that

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.460 
get a visual look and it locks in that
way<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.459> can't<00:04:21.120> go<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.389> backwards<00:04:21.570> as<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.380> can

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
way it can't go in backwards as you can

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.600 
way it can't go in backwards as you can
tell<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:23.340> only<00:04:23.520> goes<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:23.760> one<00:04:23.910> way<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:26.460> can

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
tell it only goes in one way and you can

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.840 
tell it only goes in one way and you can
rub<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.030> wherever<00:04:27.480> you<00:04:27.690> want<00:04:28.340> then<00:04:29.340> fine<00:04:29.460> on

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
rub this wherever you want then fine on

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.680 
rub this wherever you want then fine on
your<00:04:29.940> hard<00:04:30.180> drive<00:04:30.330> where<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:31.139> goes<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:33.120> like

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
your hard drive where that goes it like

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.530 
your hard drive where that goes it like
like<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.110> said<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.650> goes<00:04:34.830> on<00:04:34.860> in<00:04:35.040> one<00:04:35.220> way<00:04:35.370> to

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
like I said that goes on in one way to

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.960 
like I said that goes on in one way to

ever<00:04:43.740> ever<00:04:44.340> ever<00:04:45.240> ever<00:04:45.570> put<00:04:46.080> them<00:04:46.229> both<00:04:46.350> at<00:04:46.560> the

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
ever ever ever ever put them both at the

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.800 
ever ever ever ever put them both at the
same<00:04:46.650> time<00:04:46.910> so<00:04:47.910> it's<00:04:48.150> either<00:04:48.419> or<00:04:49.280> so<00:04:50.419> you<00:04:51.419> get

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
same time so it's either or so you get

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.170 
same time so it's either or so you get
your<00:04:51.840> molex<00:04:52.770> connector<00:04:53.280> which<00:04:53.430> sup<00:04:53.700> look

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
your molex connector which sup look

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.390 
your molex connector which sup look
something<00:04:54.479> like<00:04:54.510> this<00:04:55.100> connect<00:04:56.100> that<00:04:56.250> in

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
something like this connect that in

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.750 
something like this connect that in
there<00:04:56.750> or<00:04:57.750> if<00:04:58.350> you<00:04:58.590> want<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.510> can<00:05:01.520> get<00:05:02.520> one<00:05:02.669> of

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
there or if you want you can get one of

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.029 
there or if you want you can get one of
these<00:05:02.850> things<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.660> usually<00:05:04.500> come<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:04.830> your

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
these things that usually come to your

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.600 
these things that usually come to your
motherboard<00:05:05.510> molex<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.630> serial<00:05:07.140> ata<00:05:07.610> adapter

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
motherboard molex to serial ata adapter

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.260 
motherboard molex to serial ata adapter
just<00:05:09.450> connect<00:05:09.810> those<00:05:10.020> from<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.800> molex

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
just connect those from to the molex

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.000 
just connect those from to the molex
then<00:05:12.270> you're<00:05:12.479> sooo<00:05:12.630> ATA<00:05:13.110> power<00:05:13.530> connector

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
then you're sooo ATA power connector

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.469 
then you're sooo ATA power connector
goes<00:05:14.160> in<00:05:14.669> like<00:05:15.410> like<00:05:16.410> that<00:05:16.789> see<00:05:17.789> you<00:05:18.270> have<00:05:18.419> to

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
goes in like like that see you have to

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.140 
goes in like like that see you have to
repeat<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:19.110> hope<00:05:19.260> not<00:05:19.470> and<00:05:20.000> that's<00:05:21.000> how

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
repeat that I hope not and that's how

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.920 
repeat that I hope not and that's how
you<00:05:21.210> put<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.840> hard<00:05:22.020> drive<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.380> then

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
you put the hard drive it then

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.279 
you put the hard drive it then
to<00:05:24.289> computer<00:05:25.150> come<00:05:26.150> to<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.360> hard<00:05:26.570> drive<00:05:26.750> cage

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.640 

the<00:05:30.289> hard<00:05:30.500> drive<00:05:30.680> cage<00:05:30.949> I<00:05:32.350> would<00:05:33.350> strongly

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
the hard drive cage I would strongly

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.110 
the hard drive cage I would strongly
recommend<00:05:34.120> put<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.240> this<00:05:35.419> way<00:05:35.690> and<00:05:36.650> then<00:05:37.160> stick

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
recommend put it this way and then stick

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.390 
recommend put it this way and then stick
it<00:05:38.150> in<00:05:38.360> as<00:05:38.539> far<00:05:38.630> as<00:05:38.900> you<00:05:38.990> can<00:05:39.199> and<00:05:39.470> then<00:05:40.100> this

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
it in as far as you can and then this

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.430 
it in as far as you can and then this
should<00:05:40.580> be<00:05:40.729> on<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.240> side<00:05:41.479> the<00:05:41.840> whole<00:05:42.050> should

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
should be on the side the whole should

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.770 
should be on the side the whole should
line<00:05:42.680> up<00:05:42.759> that<00:05:43.759> you<00:05:43.850> can<00:05:44.000> put<00:05:44.150> screws<00:05:44.539> into

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
line up that you can put screws into

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.610 
line up that you can put screws into
there<00:05:45.050> and<00:05:46.150> I<00:05:47.150> assume<00:05:47.840> you<00:05:48.020> guys<00:05:48.169> are<00:05:48.500> very

there and I assume you guys are very

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.200 
there and I assume you guys are very
knowledgeable<00:05:48.830> how<00:05:49.310> to<00:05:49.370> do<00:05:49.580> that<00:05:49.729> so<00:05:49.940> I<00:05:49.970> don't

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
knowledgeable how to do that so I don't

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.629 
knowledgeable how to do that so I don't
show<00:05:50.479> you<00:05:50.509> that<00:05:50.750> is<00:05:51.020> I<00:05:51.410> don't<00:05:51.889> have<00:05:51.979> enough

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
show you that is I don't have enough

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.290 
show you that is I don't have enough
screws<00:05:53.000> cuz<00:05:53.720> they're<00:05:53.900> all<00:05:54.020> missing<00:05:54.259> or

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
screws cuz they're all missing or

whatever you know what to do or how ever
the<00:06:00.110> case<00:06:02.199> however<00:06:03.199> the<00:06:03.320> case<00:06:03.530> comes<00:06:04.280> like

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
the case however the case comes like

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.999 
the case however the case comes like
with<00:06:04.940> a<00:06:04.970> hard<00:06:05.210> drive<00:06:05.330> cage<00:06:05.660> or<00:06:06.259> you<00:06:06.620> stick<00:06:06.919> it

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
with a hard drive cage or you stick it

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.680 
with a hard drive cage or you stick it
in<00:06:07.130> there<00:06:07.280> manually<00:06:07.820> or<00:06:08.090> you<00:06:08.930> know<00:06:09.080> etc<00:06:09.860> etc

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
in there manually or you know etc etc

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.960 
in there manually or you know etc etc
just<00:06:11.690> do<00:06:11.870> it<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:12.020> way<00:06:12.110> I<00:06:12.669> think<00:06:13.669> you<00:06:13.789> should

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
just do it the way I think you should

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.960 
just do it the way I think you should
work<00:06:14.180> some<00:06:15.110> people<00:06:15.139> the<00:06:16.039> hard<00:06:16.280> drive<00:06:16.430> sits<00:06:16.820> in

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
work some people the hard drive sits in

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.480 
work some people the hard drive sits in
this<00:06:17.180> way<00:06:17.360> some<00:06:17.960> sit<00:06:18.199> in<00:06:18.289> that<00:06:18.470> way<00:06:18.710> like<00:06:19.400> I

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
this way some sit in that way like I

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.129 
this way some sit in that way like I
said<00:06:19.550> every<00:06:20.210> case<00:06:20.630> is<00:06:20.660> different<00:06:21.250> so<00:06:22.660> just<00:06:23.660> go

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
said every case is different so just go

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.629 
said every case is different so just go
by<00:06:24.320> what<00:06:24.530> you<00:06:24.650> think<00:06:24.860> is<00:06:24.949> right<00:06:24.979> and<00:06:27.639> that's

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
by what you think is right and that's

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.879 
by what you think is right and that's
the<00:06:28.789> hardware<00:06:29.240> part<00:06:29.539> of<00:06:31.599> doing<00:06:32.599> all<00:06:32.840> that<00:06:33.050> like

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
the hardware part of doing all that like

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.279 
the hardware part of doing all that like
I<00:06:33.919> said<00:06:34.159> the<00:06:34.250> toughest<00:06:34.610> part<00:06:34.849> is<00:06:35.289> putting

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
I said the toughest part is putting

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.140 
I said the toughest part is putting
those<00:06:36.560> connector<00:06:37.130> switches<00:06:37.520> on<00:06:37.669> their<00:06:37.849> power

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
those connector switches on their power

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.719 
those connector switches on their power
source<00:06:38.419> reset<00:06:38.810> switch<00:06:39.050> exec<00:06:39.409> cetera<00:06:39.860> and<00:06:40.039> then

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:40.729 
source reset switch exec cetera and then

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:47.439 
source reset switch exec cetera and then
of<00:06:40.849> course<00:06:43.539> the<00:06:44.539> power<00:06:45.159> there's<00:06:46.159> the<00:06:46.610> main<00:06:47.180> pin

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
of course the power there's the main pin

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.680 
of course the power there's the main pin
the<00:06:47.960> 24-pin<00:06:48.710> connector<00:06:48.940> get<00:06:49.940> the<00:06:50.060> molex<00:06:50.419> right

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
the 24-pin connector get the molex right

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.850 
the 24-pin connector get the molex right
here<00:06:51.669> you<00:06:52.669> either<00:06:52.880> have<00:06:53.090> a<00:06:53.180> 4<00:06:53.479> or<00:06:53.509> 8<00:06:54.050> pin

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
here you either have a 4 or 8 pin

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.310 
here you either have a 4 or 8 pin
connector<00:06:55.550> here<00:06:55.759> too<00:06:55.970> and<00:06:56.720> if<00:06:57.050> your<00:06:57.169> video

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320 
connector here too and if your video

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.490 
connector here too and if your video
card<00:06:57.620> comes<00:06:57.860> with<00:06:58.039> it<00:06:58.190> you'll<00:06:58.639> have<00:06:58.880> a<00:06:59.500> 6-pin

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
card comes with it you'll have a 6-pin

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.339 
card comes with it you'll have a 6-pin
connector<00:07:00.800> or<00:07:01.639> you<00:07:02.000> have<00:07:02.150> a<00:07:02.180> molex<00:07:02.720> to<00:07:02.870> 6-pin

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
connector or you have a molex to 6-pin

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.330 
connector or you have a molex to 6-pin
adapter<00:07:04.159> and<00:07:05.050> just<00:07:06.050> do<00:07:06.169> it<00:07:06.289> from<00:07:06.440> there<00:07:06.650> and<00:07:07.070> of

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
adapter and just do it from there and of

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.129 
adapter and just do it from there and of
course<00:07:07.370> you<00:07:08.270> got<00:07:08.419> this<00:07:09.820> this<00:07:10.820> is<00:07:11.000> a<00:07:11.030> old<00:07:11.780> one

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:12.139 
course you got this this is a old one
