such a long time since i last posted a

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.379 
such a long time since i last posted a
video<00:00:10.230> being<00:00:10.620> rather<00:00:10.799> busy<00:00:11.129> of<00:00:11.340> late<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:11.760> here

we<00:00:12.510> go<00:00:12.540> again<00:00:13.219> ok<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.279> today's<00:00:14.789> video<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.240> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
we go again ok so today's video is a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.779 
we go again ok so today's video is a
about<00:00:16.080> my<00:00:16.520> new<00:00:17.520> esc<00:00:18.330> I've<00:00:18.690> bought<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> yep<00:00:19.920> 40

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
about my new esc I've bought a yep 40

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.089 
about my new esc I've bought a yep 40
amp<00:00:21.000> PSC<00:00:21.689> from<00:00:21.929> hobbyking<00:00:22.259> and<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> reason

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
amp PSC from hobbyking and the reason

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.460 
amp PSC from hobbyking and the reason
for<00:00:23.250> doing<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.849> I've<00:00:24.660> been<00:00:24.720> wanting<00:00:25.349> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
for doing that is I've been wanting to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.720 
for doing that is I've been wanting to
try<00:00:25.589> good<00:00:25.919> about<00:00:26.220> for<00:00:26.519> some<00:00:26.699> time<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.730> finally

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
try good about for some time so finally

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.150 
try good about for some time so finally
got<00:00:29.970> down<00:00:29.999> to<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> set<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.320> done<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
got down to it set it up done the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.210 
got down to it set it up done the
calibrations<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.560> we'll<00:00:34.560> see<00:00:34.800> how<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.040> goes

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
calibrations and we'll see how it goes

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.470 
calibrations and we'll see how it goes
in<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.850> test<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.840> now<00:00:37.220> I've<00:00:38.240> done<00:00:39.240> a<00:00:39.300> little

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
in a test I just now I've done a little

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.990 
in a test I just now I've done a little
banks<00:00:39.960> test<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.950> tethered<00:00:41.370> down<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
banks test with it tethered down of the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.720 
banks test with it tethered down of the
duration<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.630> a<00:00:42.830> battery<00:00:43.830> pack<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.400> load

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
duration of a battery pack on the load

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.600 
duration of a battery pack on the load
and<00:00:45.030> i'll<00:00:45.870> post<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> graph<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.040> now<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and i'll post up the graph just now and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.020 
and i'll post up the graph just now and
yeah<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.540> does<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.840> does<00:00:49.170> keep<00:00:49.560> the<00:00:50.250> head<00:00:50.760> speed

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
yeah it does it does keep the head speed

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.460 
yeah it does it does keep the head speed
constant<00:00:51.560> so<00:00:53.510> that's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.630> promise<00:00:55.080> inside

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
constant so that's a promise inside

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
constant so that's a promise inside
let's<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.160> how<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.310> performs<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.880> flight<00:01:05.210> here

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
let's see how it performs in flight here

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.710 
let's see how it performs in flight here
we<00:01:06.390> go<00:01:06.600> then

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.540 

that's<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.440> nice<00:01:10.590> soft<00:01:10.980> start<00:01:11.370> doesn't<00:01:11.790> take

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
that's a nice soft start doesn't take

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.020 
that's a nice soft start doesn't take
right<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.420> little<00:01:14.690> twit<00:01:14.990> just<00:01:15.320> and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
right that little twit just and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.440 
right that little twit just and
apparently<00:01:17.030> means<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.570> governor<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.140> active

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
apparently means the governor is active

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.210 
apparently means the governor is active
so<00:01:20.450> here<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.230> go<00:01:21.500> allegedly<00:01:22.420> 2,800<00:01:23.420> head<00:01:23.600> speed

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
so here we go allegedly 2,800 head speed

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.300 
so here we go allegedly 2,800 head speed
that's<00:01:25.220> just<00:01:26.290> in<00:01:27.290> recognition<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.160> it's

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
that's just in recognition that it's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.770 
that's just in recognition that it's
been<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.550> while<00:01:28.790> since<00:01:29.090> I've<00:01:29.300> had<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.480> flight

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
been a while since I've had a flight

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.350 
been a while since I've had a flight
let's<00:01:30.110> have<00:01:30.320> a<00:01:30.350> few<00:01:30.620> circuits<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:31.880> see<00:01:32.060> how<00:01:32.180> it

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
let's have a few circuits to see how it

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.440 
let's have a few circuits to see how it
feels

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.929 

okay<00:01:41.380> well<00:01:41.619> you<00:01:41.740> can<00:01:41.770> hear<00:01:42.219> that<00:01:42.369> it's<00:01:42.610> holding

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
okay well you can hear that it's holding

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.350 
okay well you can hear that it's holding
a<00:01:43.060> constant<00:01:43.509> head<00:01:43.659> speed<00:01:43.930> already<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:46.149> the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
a constant head speed already in the

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.169 
a constant head speed already in the
turns<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.619> change<00:01:48.430> in<00:01:48.579> load<00:01:48.850> in

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
turns and the change in load in

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.870 
turns and the change in load in
fast-forward<00:01:49.659> fly<00:01:50.049> it's<00:01:50.409> actually<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.640> is

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
fast-forward fly it's actually it is

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.719 
fast-forward fly it's actually it is
working<00:01:53.039> especially<00:01:54.039> if<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.189> shuts<00:01:54.429> up<00:01:54.579> and

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
working especially if I shuts up and

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:03.710 
working especially if I shuts up and
just<00:01:54.880> listen

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.410 

that's<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.800> bit

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.570 

yeah<00:02:09.420> how<00:02:10.080> about<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:13.010> one<00:02:14.010> thing<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.340> will<00:02:14.400> say

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
yeah how about that one thing I will say

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.410 
yeah how about that one thing I will say
is<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.150> speed<00:02:15.450> controller<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:17.280> yet<00:02:17.700> 40<00:02:18.239> amp

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
is the speed controller this yet 40 amp

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
is the speed controller this yet 40 amp
it's<00:02:20.569> five<00:02:21.569> grams<00:02:21.900> heavier<00:02:22.110> than<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.590> turnigy

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
it's five grams heavier than the turnigy

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.760 
it's five grams heavier than the turnigy
blusher<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.760> replaced<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.900> as<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.440> mucked

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
blusher it's replaced so as just mucked

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.070 
blusher it's replaced so as just mucked
up<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.280> center<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.150> gravity<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.630> little<00:02:27.900> bit

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
up the center of gravity a little bit

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.430 
up the center of gravity a little bit
and<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:30.090> hear<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.480> very<00:02:30.720> slight<00:02:31.110> tail

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
and I do just hear the very slight tail

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.550 
and I do just hear the very slight tail
wag<00:02:31.770> as<00:02:31.980> well<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.630> helicopter<00:02:34.200> does<00:02:34.380> need

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
wag as well so the helicopter does need

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.040 
wag as well so the helicopter does need
fine-tuning<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.239> new<00:02:36.510> head<00:02:36.750> speed

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
fine-tuning to the to the new head speed

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.710 
fine-tuning to the to the new head speed
in<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.440> new<00:02:37.620> setup<00:02:42.650> but<00:02:43.650> yeah<00:02:43.830> that's<00:02:44.190> working

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
in the new setup but yeah that's working

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.440 
in the new setup but yeah that's working
all<00:02:45.720> right<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:46.019> let's<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:46.709> bring<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.450> now

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
all right now let's just bring it in now

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.300 
all right now let's just bring it in now
if<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.569> try<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> flip<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.380> roll<00:02:49.650> just<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
if we try to flip a roll just have a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.920 
if we try to flip a roll just have a
look<00:02:50.459> at<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.700> pillows<00:02:51.090> with<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.569> center<00:02:51.900> of

look at the pillows with the center of
gravity<00:02:51.989> beam<00:02:52.500> off<00:02:54.620> I'd<00:02:55.620> see<00:02:55.890> what<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.160> think

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.920 

okay<00:03:01.560> flip<00:03:02.560> side<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:03.430> little<00:03:04.090> bit<00:03:04.270> rusty<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:04.840> the

okay flip side a little bit rusty on the
side<00:03:05.320> just<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:10.300> time<00:03:10.630> is<00:03:10.870> slightly<00:03:13.020> it's

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
side just this time is slightly it's

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.870 
side just this time is slightly it's
quite<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.320> stiff<00:03:14.710> breeze<00:03:15.010> as<00:03:15.370> well<00:03:15.610> from

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
quite a stiff breeze as well from

quite a stiff breeze as well from
directly<00:03:16.510> behind<00:03:16.720> me<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.460> nose<00:03:18.760> is

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790

pointing<00:03:19.420> into<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.780> wind<00:03:19.960> now<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:20.560> just<00:03:20.850> bear

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
pointing into the wind now so just bear

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:30.900 
pointing into the wind now so just bear
that<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.060> mind<00:03:22.180> with<00:03:22.570> what<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.840> see<00:03:29.910> rolls

that in mind with what you see rolls
nice<00:03:31.210> I<00:03:31.860> hear<00:03:32.860> no<00:03:33.100> changing<00:03:33.670> head<00:03:33.850> speed<00:03:34.180> it

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
nice I hear no changing head speed it

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.390 
nice I hear no changing head speed it
sounds<00:03:35.140> just<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.590> when<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.040> battery<00:03:36.370> is

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
sounds just like when the battery is

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.140 
sounds just like when the battery is
flesh<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.510> we're<00:03:37.750> going<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.900> look<00:03:38.050> at<00:03:38.200> now<00:03:38.410> Oh

had<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.930> be<00:04:03.019> beautifully<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.709> down<00:04:05.049> obviously

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
had to be beautifully and down obviously

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.039 
had to be beautifully and down obviously
it<00:04:06.799> picked<00:04:07.099> up<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.400> bit<00:04:07.580> there<00:04:07.819> because<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.930> was

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
it picked up a bit there because it was

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.869 
it picked up a bit there because it was
also<00:04:09.260> rotating<00:04:10.099> but<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.430> head<00:04:10.580> speed

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
also rotating but the head speed

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.330 
also rotating but the head speed
remained<00:04:11.269> very<00:04:12.019> constant<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.890> that's<00:04:13.010> 12

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
remained very constant and that's 12

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.270 
remained very constant and that's 12
degrees<00:04:13.819> plus<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.239> negative<00:04:14.510> pitch<00:04:15.140> use<00:04:16.100> of

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
degrees plus a negative pitch use of

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.840 
degrees plus a negative pitch use of
full<00:04:16.459> lanes<00:04:16.729> then<00:04:17.030> right<00:04:17.959> well<00:04:18.850> let's
