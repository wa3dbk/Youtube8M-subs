back as you can see separated by these
two<00:01:46.140> bars<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.100> found<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.670> cable<00:01:48.149> fits

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
all the time it works really well with a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.740 
all the time it works really well with a
keyboard<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.580> wanted<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.970> double<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.539> up

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
keyboard if you wanted to double this up

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.839 
keyboard if you wanted to double this up
and<00:02:09.929> make<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.379> into<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> mobile<00:02:11.190> office<00:02:11.670> I

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
and make it into like a mobile office I

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.950 
and make it into like a mobile office I
could<00:02:11.910> set<00:02:12.270> up<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
could set up the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.740 
could set up the
I<00:02:13.020> pad<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.950> position<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.640> then<00:02:15.120> bring<00:02:15.510> in

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
I pad in this position and then bring in

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.660 
I pad in this position and then bring in
any<00:02:15.960> keyboard<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.740> happen<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.280> Apple

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
any keyboard I happen to have the Apple

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.280 
any keyboard I happen to have the Apple
one<00:02:17.820> right<00:02:18.090> there<00:02:18.330> for<00:02:18.870> kind<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
one right there for kind of like a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.710 
one right there for kind of like a
mobile<00:02:19.650> office<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.910> looks<00:02:21.120> like<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.330> mini

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
mobile office really looks like a mini

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.260 
mobile office really looks like a mini
version<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.410> iMac<00:02:22.860> almost<00:02:23.340> when<00:02:23.880> it's<00:02:24.030> in

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
version of the iMac almost when it's in

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.200 
version of the iMac almost when it's in
this<00:02:24.690> setup<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.560> really<00:02:26.040> dig<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.520> lot<00:02:26.700> now<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
this setup I really dig it a lot now the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.120 
this setup I really dig it a lot now the
one<00:02:27.420> thing<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.840> upstand<00:02:28.260> doesn't<00:02:28.650> do<00:02:28.830> is

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
one thing that the upstand doesn't do is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.610 
one thing that the upstand doesn't do is
swivel<00:02:29.850> it's<00:02:30.240> locked<00:02:30.600> into<00:02:30.960> this<00:02:31.080> kind<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.380> one

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
swivel it's locked into this kind of one

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.650 
swivel it's locked into this kind of one
position<00:02:31.950> there's<00:02:32.580> no<00:02:32.820> movement<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.570> a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
position there's no movement but it's a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.170 
position there's no movement but it's a
very<00:02:33.840> nice<00:02:34.050> angle<00:02:34.560> for<00:02:35.100> both<00:02:35.340> viewing<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
very nice angle for both viewing and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.270 
very nice angle for both viewing and
tapping<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.110> typing<00:02:37.410> around<00:02:37.710> if<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.100> so

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
tapping and typing around if you so

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.080 
tapping and typing around if you so
desire

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
desire

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.870 
desire
very<00:02:39.600> secure<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.110> doesn't<00:02:40.410> knock<00:02:40.770> over<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:41.790> you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
very secure it doesn't knock over so you

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.480 
very secure it doesn't knock over so you
can<00:02:42.060> feel<00:02:42.330> secure<00:02:43.170> putting<00:02:43.860> any<00:02:44.040> amount<00:02:44.370> of

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
can feel secure putting any amount of

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.340 
can feel secure putting any amount of
pressure<00:02:44.820> on<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.090> screen<00:02:45.570> while<00:02:46.170> you're

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
pressure on the screen while you're

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.830 
pressure on the screen while you're
tapping<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.010> or<00:02:47.370> typing<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.480> but<00:02:48.810> I

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
tapping on it or typing on it but I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.110 
tapping on it or typing on it but I
think<00:02:49.140> obviously<00:02:49.320> with<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> keyboard<00:02:50.310> setup<00:02:50.820> it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
think obviously with a keyboard setup it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.410 
think obviously with a keyboard setup it
works<00:02:51.450> best<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.400> has<00:02:53.640> been<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.880> brief<00:02:54.180> look

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
works best so that has been a brief look

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.230 
works best so that has been a brief look
at<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.690> adjust<00:02:55.350> mobile<00:02:55.890> up<00:02:56.070> stand<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:57.030> is
