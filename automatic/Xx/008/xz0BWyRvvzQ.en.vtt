inspired by the world as if if there was

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.900 
inspired by the world as if if there was
no<00:02:31.750> love<00:02:32.020> ya<00:02:32.380> world<00:02:32.710> that<00:02:32.860> i<00:02:32.890> read<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.430> Thun<00:02:33.760> i

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
thought that was a really cool approach

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.900 
thought that was a really cool approach
you<00:02:35.740> know<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.100> really<00:02:36.490> makes<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.850> think

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
you know it really makes you think

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.340 
you know it really makes you think
differently<00:02:37.360> about<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.720> album<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.230> know

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
differently about the album and you know

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.080 
differently about the album and you know
that<00:02:38.560> yeah<00:02:38.830> like<00:02:39.040> wow<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.430> puts<00:02:39.640> everything<00:02:39.760> in

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
that yeah like wow it puts everything in

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.760 
that yeah like wow it puts everything in
perspective<00:02:40.120> cuz<00:02:40.900> that's<00:02:41.080> what<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.440> terror

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
perspective cuz that's what the terror

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.310 
perspective cuz that's what the terror
is<00:02:42.250> today<00:02:42.760> did<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.360> terror<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.780> knowing<00:02:44.080> that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
is today did the terror of knowing that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.130 
is today did the terror of knowing that
really<00:02:44.830> we<00:02:45.370> would<00:02:45.580> all<00:02:45.730> still<00:02:46.140> scientifically

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
really we would all still scientifically

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.680 
really we would all still scientifically
and<00:02:47.260> biologically<00:02:48.010> survive<00:02:48.459> without<00:02:49.090> love

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
and biologically survive without love

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.440 
and biologically survive without love
and<00:02:49.720> without<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.260> human<00:02:50.800> compassion<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:52.209> so

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
and without that human compassion and so

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.490 
and without that human compassion and so
when<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.810> think<00:02:53.050> about<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.320> from<00:02:53.410> that

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
when you think about it from that

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.890 
when you think about it from that
perspective<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:54.820> is<00:02:54.880> almost<00:02:55.360> like<00:02:55.600> a

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
perspective this is almost like a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.680 
perspective this is almost like a
soundtrack<00:02:56.680> or<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.130> case<00:02:57.400> study<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.300> idea

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
soundtrack or a case study of that idea

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.210 
soundtrack or a case study of that idea
in<00:02:58.930> music<00:02:59.650> form<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.489> as<00:03:00.910> an<00:03:01.500> expressive<00:03:02.500> music

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
in music form so as an expressive music

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.160 
in music form so as an expressive music
I<00:03:03.310> think<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.610> succeeds<00:03:04.180> around<00:03:04.600> well<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:04.989> that

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
I think it succeeds around well on that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.170 
I think it succeeds around well on that
level<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.709> actually<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.340> would<00:03:06.610> even<00:03:06.700> say<00:03:06.850> that

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
level and actually I would even say that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.150 
level and actually I would even say that
the<00:03:07.270> album<00:03:07.450> artwork<00:03:07.959> plays<00:03:08.350> into<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.739> you<00:03:08.950> have

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
the album artwork plays into it you have

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.120 
the album artwork plays into it you have
those<00:03:09.400> just<00:03:09.670> very<00:03:09.970> very<00:03:10.660> sharp<00:03:11.350> colors<00:03:11.950> but

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
those just very very sharp colors but

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.670 
those just very very sharp colors but
they<00:03:12.250> all<00:03:12.370> kind<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:12.820> blur<00:03:13.209> together<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
they all kind of just blur together to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.130 
they all kind of just blur together to
form<00:03:15.030> kind<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.239> an<00:03:16.330> image<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:16.959> can

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
form kind of an image that you can

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.229 
form kind of an image that you can
almost<00:03:17.290> make<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.830> edges<00:03:17.950> out<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.940> and

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
almost make the edges out of and and and

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.880 
almost make the edges out of and and and
that's<00:03:19.390> how<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.540> think<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> music<00:03:20.350> sounds<00:03:20.709> too

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
that's how I think the music sounds too

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.190 
that's how I think the music sounds too
everything<00:03:21.459> just<00:03:21.640> bleeds<00:03:22.030> together<00:03:22.510> but<00:03:23.110> you

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
everything just bleeds together but you

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.140 
everything just bleeds together but you
still<00:03:23.260> have<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:23.770> like<00:03:24.010> voice<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
still have this like voice of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.240 
still have this like voice of
desperation<00:03:25.690> which<00:03:26.020> is<00:03:26.170> Wayne<00:03:26.350> Coyne<00:03:26.680> singing

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
desperation which is Wayne Coyne singing

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.070 
desperation which is Wayne Coyne singing
through<00:03:27.550> all<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.850> noise<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.660> that's

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
through all the noise and and that's

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.990 
through all the noise and and that's
what<00:03:29.290> really<00:03:29.440> took<00:03:29.920> this<00:03:30.190> album<00:03:30.549> a<00:03:30.580> long<00:03:30.730> time

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
what really took this album a long time

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.680 
what really took this album a long time
to<00:03:31.120> get<00:03:31.239> used<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.750> me<00:03:31.980> because<00:03:33.480> really<00:03:34.480> the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
to get used to for me because really the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.870 
to get used to for me because really the
only<00:03:34.780> thing<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.110> can<00:03:35.290> attach<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:36.310> wayne

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
only thing you can attach to is wayne

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.000 
only thing you can attach to is wayne
coyne's<00:03:37.239> vocals<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.930> then<00:03:38.320> just<00:03:38.590> everything

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
coyne's vocals and then just everything

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.830 
coyne's vocals and then just everything
that<00:03:39.040> swirling<00:03:39.489> around<00:03:39.610> it<00:03:40.030> provides<00:03:40.690> a

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
that swirling around it provides a

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.930 
that swirling around it provides a
context<00:03:41.500> for<00:03:41.620> those<00:03:41.769> vocals<00:03:42.280> yeah<00:03:42.549> but<00:03:42.820> the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
context for those vocals yeah but the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.030 
context for those vocals yeah but the
vocals<00:03:43.299> are<00:03:43.390> also<00:03:43.510> solo<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.320> obscured<00:03:44.799> in<00:03:44.920> the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
vocals are also solo and obscured in the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.729 
vocals are also solo and obscured in the
mix<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.790> often<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.900> just<00:03:47.170> takes<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.530> lot<00:03:47.709> of

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
mix so often that it just takes a lot of

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.620 
mix so often that it just takes a lot of
listens<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.310> understand<00:03:48.850> exactly<00:03:49.030> what<00:03:49.540> he's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
listens to understand exactly what he's

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.810 
listens to understand exactly what he's
doing<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.140> think<00:03:50.380> once<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:50.769> do<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.400> once

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
doing and I think once you do and once

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.390 
doing and I think once you do and once
you<00:03:51.910> understand<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.959> lyrics<00:03:53.170> then<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.220> think

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
you understand the lyrics then I think

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.000 
you understand the lyrics then I think
this<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.549> a<00:03:54.670> really<00:03:54.970> cool<00:03:55.269> record<00:03:55.540> now<00:03:55.930> at<00:03:56.590> the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
this is a really cool record now at the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.370 
this is a really cool record now at the
same<00:03:57.190> time<00:03:57.250> well<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.120> respect<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.959> hell<00:03:58.989> out<00:03:59.200> of

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
same time well I respect the hell out of

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.000 
same time well I respect the hell out of
it<00:03:59.590> from<00:03:59.829> that<00:03:59.980> kind<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.340> experimental<00:04:01.030> and

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
it from that kind of experimental and

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.560 
it from that kind of experimental and
expressive<00:04:03.010> standpoint<00:04:03.700> it's<00:04:04.150> also<00:04:04.360> not

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
expressive standpoint it's also not

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.150 
expressive standpoint it's also not
something<00:04:04.959> I'm<00:04:05.049> going<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.380> come<00:04:05.590> back<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:06.010> all

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
something I'm going to come back to all

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.500 
something I'm going to come back to all
the<00:04:06.280> time<00:04:06.489> just<00:04:06.670> because<00:04:06.880> it<00:04:07.150> doesn't<00:04:07.420> really

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
the time just because it doesn't really

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.690 
the time just because it doesn't really
have<00:04:07.780> anything<00:04:08.049> pulling<00:04:08.739> me<00:04:08.950> in<00:04:09.130> well<00:04:09.549> there's

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
have anything pulling me in well there's

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.220 
have anything pulling me in well there's
not<00:04:09.760> a<00:04:09.820> lot<00:04:09.970> of<00:04:10.000> hooks<00:04:10.269> on<00:04:10.390> this<00:04:10.510> not<00:04:10.780> really<00:04:11.140> at

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
not a lot of hooks on this not really at

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.750 
not a lot of hooks on this not really at
all<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.350> mean<00:04:11.440> even<00:04:11.709> Wayne<00:04:11.980> Coyne<00:04:12.190> vocals<00:04:12.670> you

all I mean even Wayne Coyne vocals you
know<00:04:12.850> we<00:04:12.970> say<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.390> that's<00:04:13.540> where<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.750> melody

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
know we say that that's where the melody

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
know we say that that's where the melody
said<00:04:14.320> that<00:04:14.440> doesn't<00:04:14.590> mean<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:14.829> there's<00:04:15.070> a

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
said that doesn't mean that there's a

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.159 
said that doesn't mean that there's a
lot<00:04:15.280> of<00:04:15.310> melody<00:04:15.700> in<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.880> vocal<00:04:16.299> team<00:04:16.479> yeah<00:04:16.690> and

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
lot of melody in the vocal team yeah and

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.810 
lot of melody in the vocal team yeah and
really<00:04:17.470> his<00:04:17.769> vocal<00:04:18.130> parts<00:04:18.400> aren't<00:04:18.549> anything

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
really his vocal parts aren't anything

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.880 
really his vocal parts aren't anything
they're<00:04:19.419> not<00:04:19.570> his<00:04:19.840> most<00:04:20.049> catchy<00:04:20.290> vocal<00:04:20.680> parts

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
they're not his most catchy vocal parts

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.620 
they're not his most catchy vocal parts
that<00:04:21.010> he<00:04:21.070> ever<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.370> music<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.060> then<00:04:22.210> in<00:04:22.479> the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
that he ever the music and then in the

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.170 
that he ever the music and then in the
drums<00:04:22.930> don't<00:04:23.320> lend<00:04:23.620> itself<00:04:23.950> to<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.280> catchy

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
drums don't lend itself to a catchy

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.000 
drums don't lend itself to a catchy
vocal<00:04:25.630> part<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:26.110> mean<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.470> wouldn't<00:04:26.650> have<00:04:26.770> fit

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
vocal part I mean it wouldn't have fit

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.469 
vocal part I mean it wouldn't have fit
with<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.640> thing<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.030> they<00:04:28.120> were<00:04:28.180> going<00:04:28.450> for

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
the hell out of this album for really

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.779 
the hell out of this album for really
going<00:04:32.350> after<00:04:32.500> an<00:04:32.800> idea<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.310> setting<00:04:33.640> their

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
going after an idea and setting their

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.610 
going after an idea and setting their
scope<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.210> very<00:04:34.450> defining<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.110> nailing<00:04:35.349> it

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
scope is very defining and nailing it

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.900 
scope is very defining and nailing it
yeah<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.250> only<00:04:36.430> downside

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
yeah the only downside

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.330 
yeah the only downside
is<00:04:37.600> there<00:04:37.930> just<00:04:38.080> isn't<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.560> lot<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:39.010> real

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
is there just isn't a lot of real

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.360 
is there just isn't a lot of real
quality<00:04:39.700> songwriting<00:04:40.630> if<00:04:41.350> this<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:41.920> album

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
quality songwriting if this this album

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.520 
quality songwriting if this this album
and<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:43.180> almost<00:04:43.360> reminds<00:04:43.780> me<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.050> lot<00:04:44.200> of<00:04:44.230> the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
and it almost reminds me of a lot of the

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.380 
and it almost reminds me of a lot of the
electronic<00:04:45.070> music<00:04:45.430> in<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.910> electronic

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
electronic music in the electronic

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.820 
electronic music in the electronic
albums<00:04:46.660> we<00:04:46.750> reviewed<00:04:47.110> in<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.290> past<00:04:47.530> year<00:04:47.710> or

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
albums we reviewed in the past year or

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.160 
albums we reviewed in the past year or
two<00:04:47.980> where<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:48.760> all<00:04:48.940> focused<00:04:49.300> on<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.840> sound

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
two where it's all focused on the sound

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.050 
two where it's all focused on the sound
itself<00:04:50.380> in<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.830> actual<00:04:51.310> songwriting

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
itself in the actual songwriting

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.580 
itself in the actual songwriting
elements<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.690> how<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.840> songs<00:04:53.230> are<00:04:53.440> put

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
elements and how the songs are put

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.620 
elements and how the songs are put
together<00:04:53.700> really<00:04:54.700> isn't<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.120> advanced

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
together really isn't that advanced

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.200 
together really isn't that advanced
these<00:04:55.840> songs<00:04:56.110> are<00:04:56.350> just<00:04:56.590> kind<00:04:56.890> of<00:04:57.010> they<00:04:57.430> range

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
these songs are just kind of they range

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.910 
these songs are just kind of they range
in<00:04:58.390> track<00:04:58.630> lengths<00:04:58.990> from<00:04:59.080> anywhere<00:04:59.380> from<00:04:59.440> four

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
think that as the album gets towards the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.710 
think that as the album gets towards the
end<00:05:35.530> I<00:05:35.770> feel<00:05:35.980> like<00:05:36.130> this<00:05:36.310> album<00:05:36.520> gets<00:05:36.880> is<00:05:37.660> a

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
end I feel like this album gets is a

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.120 
end I feel like this album gets is a
little<00:05:37.960> bit<00:05:38.050> stronger<00:05:38.230> just<00:05:38.470> on<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.710> back<00:05:38.890> end

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
little bit stronger just on the back end

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.920
