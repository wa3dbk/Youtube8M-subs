00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 the new mercedes amg petronas f1 like 05 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.680
 will be one of this season 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.910
 technical revolution driven the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.059
 power unit 106 a left the tu 106 a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.770
 hybrid united in a v6 engine 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.690
 turbo-charging and direct injection 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.670
 with a novel hybrid system for 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.560
 Energy recovery and will be so 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.109
 most modern drive unit in the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.539
 history of formula 1 the new rules 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.029
 reduce the engine by two pistons 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.180
 a v6 with a displacement of 1.6 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.390
 The city ​​is 18,000 revolutions 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.969
 the limit of 15,000 for more efficient 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.550
 power exploitation come turbo charging and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.469
 gasoline direct injection for use 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 The turbocharger will be with you ever since 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.190
 Unused exhaust on the outside 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.350
 Turbine wheel driven 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.879
 Torque then gets over the shaft 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.489
 the compressor rat in the intake tract 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.680
 transfer and thus increase performance and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.960
 efficiency around the energy density too 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.719
 the air in the intercooler increases 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.149
 Chosen before she gets to the engine 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.479
 Hybrid system becomes energy recovery system 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.960
 called in short it consists of two 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.659
 electrical units mgs the motor 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.330
 and generator are also part of it 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.150
 of the energy storage battery, mg 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.689
 ucar stores the braking energy similarly 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.360
 the previous kers and the mgh generated 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.340
 from exhaust gas in the turbocharger energy both 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.810
 send power to the battery if you have 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.210
 work as generators 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.040
 You will use them as motors 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.810
 Use the battery as power storage 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.759
 they can each other 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.130
 drive while they generate more 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.710
 performance as a mid-size car this 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.570
 is the most advanced hybrid system ever 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.610
 racing was used 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.649
 every driver has everything from start to finish 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.860
 this year only 100 kilograms 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.790
 Fuel was available in 2013 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.800
 another 150 kilograms 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.500
 Therefore, the new hybrid technology 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.210
 needed for maximum efficiency 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.190
 take advantage of this 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.920
 to make the challenge 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.540
 mercedes benz partner petronas power and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.610
 Lubricants are developing 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.399
 molecule exactly meets the requirements of 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.620
 Motors adjust the result of the new 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.570
 Drive gets 30 percent more power 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.720
 out of every drop of fuel than that 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.020
 predecessor v8 engine is the hybrid drive 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.400
 the beginning of a new fascinating 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.030
 chapter in the royal class of the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.030
 motorsports
