 my dad when he drives is not driving and near the beach we 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.380

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.650
 He knows what kind of pictures as you can 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.240
 It is also talking about them as if you did not like 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.680

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.729
 and the little change in emaya canever did not make it 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.159
 it becomes like the exorcist in the head to the genre 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.539
 but think about going around and my mom ribadesella 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.860
