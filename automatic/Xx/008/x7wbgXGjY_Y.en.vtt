 hi everyone is welcome to a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.200
 new tutorial 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.220
 where to find tera and how to have 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.010
 laterite 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.639
 yes but have a lot of people who 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.730
 suggested it 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.119
 so I decided to make this video 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.359
 just for that so before starting 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.600
 in my video of the contest winners 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.769
 you might have noticed that he 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.279
 had to film screen with my 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.500
 camera 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.669
 I do not know if I told you so thank you 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.110
 because of my microphone was broken so 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.290
 manage javaux revival micro and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.360
 maybe maybe quality but 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:45.510
 buy my best so let's start 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.840
 the video that is first of all before 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.520
 show you or have peace wright I 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.860
 will show you or have the pokemon in 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.309
 as such terra so m 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.199
 in the beginning you would need it's a 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.010
 pokemon who knows bursts dress in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.309
 your team 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.810
 it's very important so in my case 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:13.710
 I have class who knows and 4 hoc 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:16.549

 pokemon with the 4 1 in your team 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:25.229
 you have to go to the sparkling cave ci 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.400
 which is at the end of the road 9 so m I 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.210
 am going to cut the video because 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.759
 frankly I do not need you 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.840
 show the way to go so I 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.240
 am sold here is the sparkling cave 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.509
 so you have to go to the bottom of the cave 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.369
 is insolent so I'll come back to you so 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.560
 I'm back in the cave

 sparkling so as I said you 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.950
 would need barter shine 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.860
 you have to use rock burst 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.630
 is dead just like the rocks here a 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.219
 alphonse allows you to find a point 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.829
 just laterite but any 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.810

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.250
 time you have the terrible so much 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.219
 that even if you know not been to 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.890
 burst rock that would surprise me 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.270
 paris to a rock actually better and to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.800
 troll shrapnel 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.500
 appears either you will find an object 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.210
 either dior is happening or in the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.130
 case of the sparkling cave you 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.870
 find an easy one like the fair game of 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.340
 find an easy strike so you 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.260
 did it just in time to find a 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.360

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.740
 last thing I forgot about you 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.709
 mention if you ever had everything 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.280
 burst rock rock that had a 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.680
 burst in bottom there is more and he 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.510
 no longer beautiful before taxes the fees 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.820
 generated as you see here I did 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.360
 burst on search and left some 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:56.860
 points here 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:03:00.760
 but lauren you get you out here and 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.180
 you laugh back and as you can 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.940
 see the rock has regenerated so this 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.520
 way of doing is generated the rock if 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.640
 never there is more m so just one 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.780

 so she commits for you can see 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.250
 it's possible so after that you have to 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.220
 obviously go out of the cave and 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.060
