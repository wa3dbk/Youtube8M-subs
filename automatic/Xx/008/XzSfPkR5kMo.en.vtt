00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.230
 and what you do here is there 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.360
 video tutorial to teach them how 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 play multiplayer minecraft well 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.140
 multiplayer and so on will go so 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.270
 that are not premium to play too 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.820
 in case you are wondering I am not premium 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.320
 so that's a way in which 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.650
 I play that is what most of the 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.140
 people so good many people 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.530
 I'm not implementing as I go with 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.440
 plays with franco on your server and so on and 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.390
 good that I bring you the tutorial what 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.120
 first you must be connected to 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 internet obviously if not then they will not be able to 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.010
 Do nothing 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.589
 so good know who multiplayer 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.550
 and here I already have one servers here already 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:01.520
 you see this so the connection 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.269
 but good as adding a server 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.850
 down here where adserver says here you 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.190
 give and here you can name it 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.400
 you want like I do not know if they want 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:20.570
 that your third party here put me poop like that 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:24.649
 but good and here I will leave an ip 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.140
 from a server which then teaches that 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:31.070
 most of the time or with frank and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.310
 Pablo to the Hunger Games is this one in 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.540
 the description so you do not have 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.700
 lean atom as we see here is here 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.380
 here and nothing else to put 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.380
 have me kinchil server 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.689
 it will be charged 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.619
 about how he told me now is not so 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.619
 good to say 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.470
 own 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.030
 to me that intern 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.530
 and many people 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.200
 Let's see 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.660
 to me with the TV is written and as you see 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.900
 there he is very user then what you 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.370
 have to do when entering you would put 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.250
 register bar 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.120
 and your password as 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.360
 horse helmet could be a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.440
 well and you read it record it 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.960
 nothing happens 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.530
 is that first I'm going to achieve myself but that 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.870
 what you should do for when 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.000
 for when they are going to enter and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.850
 register here we see that someone already 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.300
 have that password so good 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.940
 this has been all by the way more something 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.540
 well on disk 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.900
 Now here many people ask me yes 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.640
 because once the sale so 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.240
 simply because it 's connection to 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.860
 internet or that or the brain is closed 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.810
 so there is no way to enter unless 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.500
 that he opens it 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.720
 or if your internet connection is already good and 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.300
 many tell me that this comes out and a 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.400
 number above 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.830
 number as I do not know how it looks 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.379
 normal 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.550
 to show you a little how to how 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.770
 they expose some 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.090
 so good I'm even entering the 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:41.239
 flat world not who they give in you 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.390
 this no no no no they should not 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.420
 only after the Lord how does one come out 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.140
 it knows you like 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.420
 a new point 4.7 something like that and you get them 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.170
 with the X that they can not enter 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.260
 Well, this is not because of an error 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.209
 of your computer or something like that but the 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.150
 server is not updated to the 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.280
 version have the one you are for 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.220
 example if you are in version 1.6 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.260
 points like me that center a know that 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.110
 is in the 1.4 points 7 you will not be able to 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.870
 enter unless you put yourself in that 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.940
 version or the server is updated to the 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.720
 option in which you are 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.480
 and in the games of hunger ' also 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.780
 these are the hunger games here 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.890
 says it starts in a minute and in this 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.140
 period is where you can 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.240
 enter only yesterday french attend more 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.569
 players 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:42.030
 and so but they say well try with another 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.860
 server is because they are already in the 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.670
 game can not enter a game 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.920
 that is started 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.009
 so good if you ask 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.900
 So, here is the answer 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.900
 and well I think that has been all 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.950
 today we are before xl and here I say goodbye 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.950
 goodbye
