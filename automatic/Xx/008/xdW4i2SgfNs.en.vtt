00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.000
 well in this election we will continue 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.309
 with our introduction course to maya 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.960
 presented by king 3 of let's create the 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.029
 tail of the other side but now 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.829
 duplicating the model ok 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.990
 So, more than duplicating, we're going to 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.119
 duplicate more than create but we're going to 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.850
 duplicate the model let's go to the view 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.490
 front 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.740
 let's select our model 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 press the number 1 to see how 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.780
 really is our model we're going 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.660
 to face mode and we're going to eliminate half 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.150
 that does not have the tail tail ok so that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.500
 half that if you have the rear tail the 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.350
 we duplicate the other side 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 make sure to eliminate just half 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.670
 of the model that's why it's important to go 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.170
 creating your model right in the center of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.559
 the grid to duplicate the other side 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.960
 is not easier obviously you can create 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.909
 your model here and also duplicate it 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.860
 another side but it will help you with the 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.750
 central grid you can adjust vertices 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.720
 to the center more easily leaving 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.050
 pressed the x key and adjusting on the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.900
 X axis 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.200
 if cerciÃ³rate to eliminate 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.890
 half of the model 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.890
 they had all 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.310
 just half that I noticed about or not 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.290
 do not miss any face 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.729
 and ready, since we have half of the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.829
 model 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.750
 make sure it's important that you really 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.930
 you only have half if you're not going to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.640
 cause problems that you think 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.259
 take your time that everything is 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 perfectly 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.840
 in half remember that without your sight 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.590
 front you were in vertex mode by 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.270
 example a somewhat assumed vertex only 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.220
 a bit and a vertex a little left that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.440
 it's going to cause you problems ok 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.520
 so make sure that all the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.009
 vertices are right in the center 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.840
 for example this one that is missing a bit 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.550
 you select them you leave pressed the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.880
 key x and sticks it to the grid 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.190
 central 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.650
 that's why, as I told you, it's important 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.680
 go creating your model 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.170
 right in the center of brick and now 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.140
 yes 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.540
 let's duplicate it to the other side we 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.810
 we go at least a month mirror 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.000
 biometric option box to set 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.680
 the options we will use the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.340
 default options or you can move 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.340
 Many options 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.320
 but to return to the options 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.530
 predetermined mesh we go to 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.020
 menu risk settings and that's ok 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.840
 Now he is telling us that you are going to 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.750
 duplicate that in this case it's going to be in the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.740
 x axis of course where has the arrow 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.080
 It's the s 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.610
 the positive side and where you do not have the 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.800
 arrow is the negative side then 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.140
 would be on the negative x axis what 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.970
 we select we leave active the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.190
 options to join or vertices we are going to 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.900
 give mirror and ready 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.570
 ok now we have to make sure that 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.340
 everything looks good you realize that there is a 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.900
 small mistake especially in the parts 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.960
 Central is where there will always be 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.810
 small mistakes and joined vertices 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.460
 other the only thing we can do what 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.440
 we have to do to correct the 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.000
 problem remember that here are all 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.070
 the transformations that we have gone 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.020
 making our dirigible since it was 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.760
 a simple cylinder like that is that in the 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.920
 part of above is the last 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.960
 transformation done and it is just this that 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.270
 we made poly mirror we give a click 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.880
 to open your options you realize 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.100
 that we can specify the union or the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.260
 junction distance between vertices let's 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.250
 to decrease the since they joined others 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.200
 the vertices from point 1 to point 0 1 and 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.750
 problem solved is what you guys 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.730
 I commented in the previous election 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.710
 that if joining their vertices join 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.620
 others or there are errors going down 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.120
 Of course the distance you realize 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.760
 that here in the back there is also 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.560
 a small mistake we are going to decrease the a 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.910
 the minimum bonding distance between 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.570
 vertices that is point 0 0 1 and problem 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.780
 resolved 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.730
 let's press the number 3 we 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.670
 make sure there are no gaps 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.680
 there are errors especially in the part 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.150
 central to the model is right where it has 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.820
 joined the duplicate part 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.720
 and you realize that it really looks good 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.000
 okay 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.630
 in this way we already have the 4 tails of 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.810
 our airship we have treated them 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.810
 do everything differently from 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.060
 then 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.720
 cover the largest number of tools 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.270
 in maya ok we can certainly do it 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.160
 excluding this then exclude this later 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.919
 destroy this with the same method 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.510
 but we try to make or cover the 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.210
 more tools in Maya 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.260
 so that you go well-known ok we're going to 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.270
 stop the lesson up here 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.270
 we continue in our next lesson
