00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.840 

let's<00:00:00.810> look<00:00:00.989> at<00:00:01.110> how<00:00:01.290> we<00:00:01.350> add<00:00:01.740> sign<00:00:02.340> numbers

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
let's look at how we add sign numbers

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.030 
let's look at how we add sign numbers
when<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.419> first<00:00:03.659> number<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.170> positive<00:00:04.770> and

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
when the first number is positive and

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.970 
when the first number is positive and
the<00:00:05.910> rule<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.210> we're<00:00:06.330> going<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.480> use<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:07.170> that

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
the rule that we're going to use is that

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.610 
the rule that we're going to use is that
adding<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.580> negative<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.300> exactly<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.410> same

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
adding a negative is exactly the same

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.499 
adding a negative is exactly the same
thing<00:00:11.070> as<00:00:11.400> subtracting<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.960> positive<00:00:14.089> in<00:00:15.089> other

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
thing as subtracting a positive in other

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.349 
thing as subtracting a positive in other
words<00:00:15.780> if<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.619> take<00:00:16.650> some<00:00:17.400> number<00:00:17.640> let's<00:00:18.090> call

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
words if I take some number let's call

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.130 
words if I take some number let's call
it<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.710> and<00:00:19.760> I<00:00:20.760> add<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:22.310> negative<00:00:23.689> let's<00:00:24.689> call<00:00:24.960> it

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
it a and I add a negative let's call it

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.830 
it a and I add a negative let's call it
B<00:00:26.210> it<00:00:27.210> doesn't<00:00:27.390> matter<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.810> have

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
B it doesn't matter if I have

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.640 
B it doesn't matter if I have
parentheses<00:00:28.470> or<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> exact

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
parentheses or not that is the exact

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.450 
parentheses or not that is the exact
same<00:00:31.949> thing<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> equals<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:34.590> same<00:00:34.920> thing

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
same thing so it equals the same thing

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.080 
same thing so it equals the same thing
if<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.239> were<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.630> simply<00:00:36.870> say<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:38.660> minus<00:00:39.660> B<00:00:40.910> now<00:00:41.910> if

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
if I were to simply say a minus B now if

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
if I were to simply say a minus B now if
you<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.600> those<00:00:42.750> numbers<00:00:43.170> let's<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.530> it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
you don't like those numbers let's do it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.889 
you don't like those numbers let's do it
with<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.070> don't<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.550> those<00:00:44.700> letters<00:00:45.090> sorry

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
with I don't like those letters sorry

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.250 
with I don't like those letters sorry
let's<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.489> some<00:00:47.879> numbers<00:00:48.660> let's<00:00:48.930> say

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
let's do it with some numbers let's say

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.529 
let's do it with some numbers let's say
I<00:00:49.559> took<00:00:50.420> 8<00:00:51.620> plus<00:00:52.850> negative<00:00:53.850> 4<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.360> this

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
I took 8 plus negative 4 and what this

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.330 
I took 8 plus negative 4 and what this
rule<00:00:57.809> says<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.710> 8<00:00:59.699> plus<00:01:00.239> negative<00:01:00.629> 4<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.500> no

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
rule says is 8 plus negative 4 is no

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
rule says is 8 plus negative 4 is no
different<00:01:03.030> than<00:01:03.809> 8<00:01:05.210> minus<00:01:06.350> 4<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.299> don't

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
different than 8 minus 4 and I don't

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.800 
different than 8 minus 4 and I don't
know<00:01:09.540> about<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:11.369> me<00:01:11.549> D<00:01:11.700> 8<00:01:11.820> minus<00:01:12.210> 4<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
know about you but to me D 8 minus 4 is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.440 
know about you but to me D 8 minus 4 is
a<00:01:12.840> lot<00:01:13.140> easier<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.979> figure<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.490> than<00:01:14.640> 8<00:01:15.150> plus

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
a lot easier to figure out than 8 plus

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.800 
a lot easier to figure out than 8 plus
negative<00:01:15.659> 4<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.850> even<00:01:18.270> though<00:01:18.479> we

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
negative 4 and so even though we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
negative 4 and so even though we
obviously<00:01:19.290> should<00:01:19.920> already<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> answer

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
obviously should already know the answer

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.149 
obviously should already know the answer
to<00:01:21.180> 8<00:01:21.420> minus<00:01:21.750> 4<00:01:21.930> let's<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.590> works<00:01:22.830> on

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
to 8 minus 4 let's see how this works on

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.289 
to 8 minus 4 let's see how this works on
a<00:01:23.220> number<00:01:23.850> line<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.610> when<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> add<00:01:27.000> or

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
a number line so when you add or

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.319 
a number line so when you add or
subtract<00:01:27.840> numbers<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:29.520> start<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
subtract numbers you start with the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.910 
subtract numbers you start with the
first<00:01:30.479> number<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.110> start<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:32.579> 8<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
first number so we start here at 8 and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.420 
first number so we start here at 8 and
subtraction<00:01:34.920> means<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.180> take<00:01:36.960> away<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.250> go

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
subtraction means to take away or to go

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.510 
subtraction means to take away or to go
left<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.479> we're<00:01:39.659> gonna<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.290> way<00:01:40.520> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
left so we're gonna go this way and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.319 
left so we're gonna go this way and
we're<00:01:41.640> gonna<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.119> way

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
we're gonna go that way

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.450 
we're gonna go that way
4<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.740> we're<00:01:43.860> gonna<00:01:43.950> subtract<00:01:44.640> 4<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.320> 1<00:01:46.560> 2

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
4 so we're gonna subtract 4 so we go 1 2

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.749 
4 so we're gonna subtract 4 so we go 1 2
3<00:01:48.320> 4<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:49.979> should<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.549> already

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
3 4 and just like we should have already

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
3 4 and just like we should have already
known<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.439> difference<00:01:52.439> between<00:01:53.280> 8<00:01:53.610> &amp;<00:01:53.820> 4<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.810> of

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
known the difference between 8 &amp; 4 is of

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.630 
known the difference between 8 &amp; 4 is of
course<00:01:55.710> 4<00:01:56.840> let's<00:01:57.840> try<00:01:58.049> another<00:01:58.259> problem<00:01:58.640> let's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
course 4 let's try another problem let's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.389 
course 4 let's try another problem let's
take<00:01:59.820> 5<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.659> add<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:02.270> negative<00:02:03.270> 8

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.240 

okay<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.140> like<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.289> said<00:02:09.349> before<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:10.160> this

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
okay and so like I said before in this

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.920 
okay and so like I said before in this
video<00:02:10.550> we're<00:02:10.759> focusing<00:02:11.239> on<00:02:11.390> adding<00:02:11.870> a

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
video we're focusing on adding a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.290 
video we're focusing on adding a
negative<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.650> same<00:02:12.890> as<00:02:13.129> subtracting<00:02:13.430> so

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
negative is the same as subtracting so

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.339 
negative is the same as subtracting so
five<00:02:14.569> plus<00:02:14.989> negative<00:02:15.349> eight<00:02:15.769> means<00:02:16.550> five

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
five plus negative eight means five

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.009 
five plus negative eight means five
minus<00:02:18.349> eight<00:02:19.180> well<00:02:20.180> at<00:02:20.269> this<00:02:20.390> point<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.840> might

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
minus eight well at this point you might

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.720 
minus eight well at this point you might
be<00:02:21.200> tempted<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.650> say<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.280> answer<00:02:22.430> is

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
be tempted to say that the answer is

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.210 
be tempted to say that the answer is
three<00:02:23.360> because<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.650> an<00:02:24.739> eight<00:02:24.890> we<00:02:25.069> have<00:02:25.099> a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
three because we have an eight we have a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.580 
three because we have an eight we have a
five<00:02:25.459> we<00:02:25.730> subtract<00:02:26.180> them<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.900> problem<00:02:27.349> is

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
five we subtract them the problem is

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.530 
five we subtract them the problem is
with<00:02:28.280> subtraction<00:02:28.900> order<00:02:29.900> matters<00:02:31.360> let's<00:02:32.360> do

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
with subtraction order matters let's do

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.900 
with subtraction order matters let's do
this<00:02:32.690> one<00:02:32.989> again<00:02:33.140> on<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> number<00:02:33.830> line<00:02:33.910> here

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
this one again on the number line here

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.350 
this one again on the number line here
we<00:02:35.060> are<00:02:35.090> starting<00:02:35.629> at<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.110> number<00:02:36.799> five<00:02:37.360> again

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
we are starting at the number five again

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.570 
we are starting at the number five again
we<00:02:38.510> always<00:02:38.840> start<00:02:39.110> at<00:02:39.950> our<00:02:40.069> first<00:02:40.250> number

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
we always start at our first number

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.600 
we always start at our first number
right<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.260> again<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:42.470> are<00:02:42.500> subtracting<00:02:42.830> or

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
right and again we are subtracting or

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.449 
right and again we are subtracting or
going<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.630> left<00:02:44.900> eight<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.220> we're<00:02:46.370> going

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
going to the left eight so we're going

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.449 
going to the left eight so we're going
to<00:02:46.519> subtract<00:02:47.269> eight<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.799> we<00:02:48.920> count<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
to subtract eight so we count to the

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.059 
to subtract eight so we count to the
left<00:02:49.640> eight<00:02:49.849> one<00:02:50.209> two<00:02:50.569> three<00:02:52.060> four<00:02:53.060> five<00:02:54.069> six

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
left eight one two three four five six

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.289 
left eight one two three four five six
seven<00:02:55.970> eight<00:02:57.069> well<00:02:58.069> this<00:02:58.220> time<00:02:58.549> by<00:02:58.880> going<00:02:59.209> to

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
seven eight well this time by going to

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.140 
seven eight well this time by going to
the<00:02:59.420> left<00:02:59.569> eight<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.680> took<00:03:00.950> us<00:03:01.160> all<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:02.030> way

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
the left eight that took us all the way

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.140 
the left eight that took us all the way
to<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.390> negative<00:03:02.930> side<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.709> number<00:03:03.980> line

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
to the negative side of the number line

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.979 
to the negative side of the number line
and<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:06.140> five<00:03:06.500> minus<00:03:06.739> eight<00:03:07.130> is<00:03:07.989> negative

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
and so five minus eight is negative

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.110 
and so five minus eight is negative
three<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:12.230> one<00:03:12.470> way<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.650> look<00:03:12.769> at<00:03:13.010> this<00:03:13.220> is

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
three and so one way to look at this is

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.750 
three and so one way to look at this is
to<00:03:14.450> notice<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:15.410> course<00:03:15.650> adding<00:03:16.639> us

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
to notice that of course adding us

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.110 
to notice that of course adding us
negative<00:03:17.329> is<00:03:17.540> subtracting<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.739> when<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.700> am

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
negative is subtracting and when I am

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.199 
negative is subtracting and when I am
subtracting<00:03:21.280> when<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.459> bigger<00:03:22.760> number<00:03:23.180> is

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
subtracting when the bigger number is

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.860 
subtracting when the bigger number is
first<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:24.500> ten<00:03:24.950> minus<00:03:25.400> three<00:03:25.870> it's

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
first like ten minus three it's

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.420 
first like ten minus three it's
subtraction<00:03:27.139> just<00:03:27.739> like<00:03:27.859> it<00:03:27.980> always<00:03:28.130> has<00:03:28.400> been

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
subtraction just like it always has been

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.259 
subtraction just like it always has been
since<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:29.209> don't<00:03:29.269> know<00:03:29.450> what<00:03:29.739> second<00:03:30.739> grade<00:03:31.269> but

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
since I don't know what second grade but

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.479 
since I don't know what second grade but
if<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:32.510> smaller<00:03:32.870> number<00:03:33.350> comes<00:03:33.859> first<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.459> I

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
if the smaller number comes first and I

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.490 
if the smaller number comes first and I
subtract<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.180> bigger<00:03:35.420> number<00:03:35.630> like<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.049> am<00:03:36.230> here

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
subtract a bigger number like I am here

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.220 
subtract a bigger number like I am here
with<00:03:36.680> five<00:03:36.920> minus<00:03:37.340> eight<00:03:37.519> my<00:03:38.180> answer<00:03:38.630> will<00:03:39.200> be

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
with five minus eight my answer will be

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.970 
with five minus eight my answer will be
negative<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:40.069> that's<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.420> first<00:03:41.980> very

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
negative and that's the first very

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.370 
negative and that's the first very
important<00:03:43.579> lesson<00:03:44.000> in<00:03:44.209> adding<00:03:45.079> and

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
important lesson in adding and

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.729 
important lesson in adding and
subtracting<00:03:45.889> signed<00:03:46.579> numbers<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:48.200> let's<00:03:48.410> try

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
subtracting signed numbers so let's try

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.460 
subtracting signed numbers so let's try
say<00:03:49.280> maybe<00:03:49.609> four<00:03:50.030> quick<00:03:50.420> examples<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.260> see<00:03:51.380> if

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
say maybe four quick examples and see if

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.430 
say maybe four quick examples and see if
you<00:03:51.560> can<00:03:51.680> catch<00:03:51.889> them<00:03:52.069> if<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:53.060> can't<00:03:53.440> maybe

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
you can catch them if you can't maybe

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.069 
you can catch them if you can't maybe
try<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.799> watch<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.010> video<00:03:55.340> again<00:03:55.400> or<00:03:56.030> get<00:03:56.930> some

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
try to watch the video again or get some

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.170 
try to watch the video again or get some
extra<00:03:57.319> help<00:03:57.560> from<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.920> tutor<00:03:58.099> but<00:03:58.790> let's<00:03:58.940> try

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
extra help from a tutor but let's try

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.470 
extra help from a tutor but let's try
some<00:03:59.420> real<00:03:59.660> quick<00:03:59.930> let's<00:04:00.260> try<00:04:00.530> 15<00:04:01.480> plus

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
some real quick let's try 15 plus

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.979 
some real quick let's try 15 plus
negative<00:04:03.250> six<00:04:06.430> let's<00:04:07.430> also<00:04:07.609> try<00:04:08.799> 20<00:04:09.799> plus

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
negative six let's also try 20 plus

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.170 
negative six let's also try 20 plus
negative<00:04:12.190> twenty-five

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
negative twenty-five

plus<00:04:21.290> negative<00:04:22.729> 150<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:26.600> let's<00:04:27.600> try<00:04:28.220> zero

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
plus negative 150 and let's try zero

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.050 
plus negative 150 and let's try zero
plus<00:04:29.759> negative<00:04:30.449> 10<00:04:33.949> okay<00:04:34.949> if<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.729> have<00:04:35.880> to

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
plus negative 10 okay if you have to

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.640 
plus negative 10 okay if you have to
pause<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.600> work<00:04:36.780> these<00:04:36.960> out<00:04:37.169> but<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.470> should

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
pause to work these out but you should

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.920 
pause to work these out but you should
be<00:04:37.770> able<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:37.949> do<00:04:38.039> these<00:04:38.160> pretty<00:04:38.520> quickly<00:04:38.930> 15

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
be able to do these pretty quickly 15

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.460 
be able to do these pretty quickly 15
plus<00:04:40.199> negative<00:04:40.229> 16<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.460> really<00:04:42.080> 15<00:04:43.080> minus<00:04:43.440> 6

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
plus negative 16 is really 15 minus 6

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.180 
plus negative 16 is really 15 minus 6
which<00:04:44.009> of<00:04:44.160> course<00:04:44.190> is<00:04:44.610> just<00:04:44.880> 9<00:04:45.949> 20<00:04:46.949> plus

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
which of course is just 9 20 plus

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.370 
which of course is just 9 20 plus
negative<00:04:47.460> 25<00:04:48.180> well<00:04:48.479> now<00:04:48.630> we<00:04:48.690> have<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.110> smaller

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
negative 25 well now we have the smaller

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.740 
negative 25 well now we have the smaller
number<00:04:49.800> first<00:04:50.039> and<00:04:50.340> we're<00:04:50.430> subtracting<00:04:50.580> 25<00:04:51.360> so

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
number first and we're subtracting 25 so

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.490 
number first and we're subtracting 25 so
that<00:04:51.900> gives<00:04:52.050> us<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.320> negative<00:04:52.850> 5<00:04:54.320> I'm<00:04:55.320> going<00:04:55.440> to

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
that gives us a negative 5 I'm going to

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.170 
that gives us a negative 5 I'm going to
write<00:04:55.620> underneath<00:04:55.860> here<00:04:56.190> 100<00:04:56.760> plus<00:04:56.940> negative

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
write underneath here 100 plus negative

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.330 
write underneath here 100 plus negative
150<00:04:58.080> well<00:04:58.199> this<00:04:58.320> is<00:04:58.410> just<00:04:58.590> like<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.830> last<00:04:59.039> one

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
150 well this is just like the last one

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.540 
150 well this is just like the last one
and<00:04:59.820> we<00:04:59.880> get<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.150> negative<00:05:00.389> 50<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.380> zero<00:05:02.250> plus

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
and we get a negative 50 and zero plus

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.529 
and we get a negative 50 and zero plus
negative<00:05:02.820> 10
