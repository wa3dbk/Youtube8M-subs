 They thought not but I liked it a lot. 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.229
 So beauty will start remembering that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.329
 all the codes or motivations that I 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.009
 here you will have nothing that you will 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.170
 appearing for you on the screen beauty 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.920
 so let's get started then let's get started 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.759
 so the first neon the man 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.119
 There are 91 spiders we will make you 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.460

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.390
 our old lady the law climbing is 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 very little even though it's normal then 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.740
 we stay up there the only for those who 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.289
 do not know tac got sniper i think 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.870
 Most of you know it's already here 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.860
 Type grip so I want to go down I 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.620
 I stopped pressing the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.510
 1 now when I want for example 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.990
 stay if I get too tight 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.100
 for example let's come on and looked okay 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.440
 too far to sin for example I want 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.410
 Do you want to, for example, walk around 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.410
 town suffers with a tight there he goes 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.560
 jumping by where I got it and why 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.590
 example is worth to attack the Fluminense here 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.480
 O I stay tight and I look only for one 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.880
 Place that I want to go pretty cool, huh? 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.500
 So let's make a second that 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.660
 is one or more legal 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.260
 remembering that in the mold of osce no longer 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.720
 dies from fall high and things are 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.280
 would be normal but in sydney for example 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.110
 fell from a building to die for 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.700
 but as we are in a mold he does not 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.280
 die then we'll find it may be the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.320
 swings right there to bullets those looks 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.050

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.680
 does not normally it's expensive it's scalar 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.170

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.910
 Jump and simoninha here and we will climb 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.880
