00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
o'clock in the morning so my voice is

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.570 
o'clock in the morning so my voice is
probably<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.500> little<00:00:07.680> deeper<00:00:08.130> than<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.460> guys

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
probably a little deeper than you guys

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.410 
probably a little deeper than you guys
are<00:00:08.639> used<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:10.250> but<00:00:11.250> anyway<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.809> um

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
are used to but anyway I have this um

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.010 
are used to but anyway I have this um
tutorial<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.599> massive<00:00:16.139> yet<00:00:16.800> again<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:18.020> this

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
tutorial in massive yet again in this

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.980 
tutorial in massive yet again in this
time<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.550> guitar<00:00:20.810> reggae<00:00:21.810> guitar

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
time it is on a guitar reggae guitar

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:40.340 
time it is on a guitar reggae guitar
pluck<00:00:22.850> sound<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.859> sounds<00:00:26.220> like<00:00:26.250> this

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.040 

I<00:00:40.379> don't<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.280> my<00:00:41.460> court<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.270> leave<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> lot

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.990 

well<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.739> pretty<00:00:46.949> easy<00:00:47.070> sound<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> make<00:00:47.730> so

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
well it's pretty easy sound to make so

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.389 
well it's pretty easy sound to make so
let's<00:00:48.210> get<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
let's get to it

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:57.290 
let's get to it
Ableton<00:00:50.930> just<00:00:51.930> dragged<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.670> massive<00:00:56.300> data

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
Ableton just dragged in massive data

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.259 
Ableton just dragged in massive data
that<00:00:57.800> okay<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> first<00:00:59.820> thing<00:01:00.030> we're<00:01:00.180> going

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
that okay so the first thing we're going

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.950 
that okay so the first thing we're going
to<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.110> on<00:01:01.500> oscillator<00:01:02.190> 1<00:01:02.960> under

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
to want to do is on oscillator 1 under

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.070 
to want to do is on oscillator 1 under
this<00:01:04.140> digital<00:01:04.440> /<00:01:05.100> hybrid<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:06.119> these<00:01:06.899> wave

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
this digital / hybrid all these wave

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
this digital / hybrid all these wave
tables<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> very<00:01:08.520> bottom<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.030> you'll

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
tables go to the very bottom and you'll

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:19.950 
tables go to the very bottom and you'll
see<00:01:09.390> Qatar<00:01:09.720> pulse<00:01:10.250> convenient<00:01:11.600> now

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.780 

that's<00:01:20.960> how<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.140> make<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.380> sound<00:01:21.790> there's

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
that's how you make the sound there's

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.520 
that's how you make the sound there's
some<00:01:23.090> more<00:01:23.300> stuff<00:01:23.360> we<00:01:23.630> could<00:01:23.750> do<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.170> let's

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
some more stuff we could do to it let's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.100 
some more stuff we could do to it let's
route<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.100> filter<00:01:25.580> one<00:01:25.880> oh<00:01:26.150> yeah<00:01:27.020> it

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
route it to filter one oh yeah it

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.150 
route it to filter one oh yeah it
changed<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.470> wave<00:01:27.590> table<00:01:27.800> position<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.610> the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
changed the wave table position to the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.760 
changed the wave table position to the
all<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.340> way<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.640> right<00:01:32.410> it's<00:01:33.410> really<00:01:33.620> up

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
all the way to the right it's really up

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.219 
all the way to the right it's really up
to<00:01:33.800> you<00:01:34.070> what<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:34.250> want<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:36.110> could

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
to you what you want and you could

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.200 
to you what you want and you could
really<00:01:36.500> play<00:01:36.740> with<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.920> Bend<00:01:37.190> plus<00:01:37.490> minus<00:01:38.000> or

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
really play with the Bend plus minus or

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.219 
really play with the Bend plus minus or
minus<00:01:38.270> plus<00:01:40.390> but<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:41.510> just<00:01:41.720> keep<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:42.050> on<00:01:42.140> the

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
minus plus but I just keep it on the

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.880 
minus plus but I just keep it on the
spectrum

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.680 

okay<00:01:49.890> now<00:01:50.130> we're<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.970> bit<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.240> through<00:01:51.480> filter

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
okay now we're a bit it through filter

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.930 
okay now we're a bit it through filter
one<00:01:52.050> we<00:01:52.950> could<00:01:53.100> change<00:01:53.310> filter<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.910> a

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
one we could change filter one to a

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.920 
one we could change filter one to a
high-pass<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:55.790> bring<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.120> volume<00:01:57.510> of<00:01:57.690> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
high-pass for bring the volume of the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.670 
high-pass for bring the volume of the
filter<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.820> resonance<00:01:59.820> pretty<00:02:00.810> high<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
filter up resonance pretty high in the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.000 
filter up resonance pretty high in the
cutoff<00:02:02.120> not<00:02:03.120> to<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.480> I<00:02:03.510> maybe<00:02:03.900> around<00:02:04.080> nine

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010

somewhere<00:02:12.060> around<00:02:12.150> there<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.780> get<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.050> loads

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
somewhere around there to get the loads

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.750 
somewhere around there to get the loads
away<00:02:14.630> set<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.750> mix<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.470> only<00:02:16.950> mix<00:02:17.400> one<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:19.760> guess

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
away set the mix to only mix one I guess

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.470 
away set the mix to only mix one I guess
these<00:02:21.030> ah<00:02:22.010> it's<00:02:23.010> right<00:02:23.190> there<00:02:23.459> guy<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.150> hate

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
these ah it's right there guy I hate

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:34.360 
these ah it's right there guy I hate
that<00:02:25.070> okay<00:02:26.070> okay<00:02:26.550> turn<00:02:26.820> your<00:02:26.940> EQ<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:28.340> up<00:02:29.340> uh

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.960 

okay<00:02:35.450> low<00:02:36.450> shelf<00:02:36.750> down<00:02:37.459> it's<00:02:38.459> not<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:38.880> to

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
okay low shelf down it's not going to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.190 
okay low shelf down it's not going to
really<00:02:39.300> do<00:02:39.420> anything<00:02:39.660> because<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
really do anything because we have a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.770 
really do anything because we have a
high-pass<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.160> case<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.660> could

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
high-pass but just in case and we could

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.890 
high-pass but just in case and we could
turn<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.170> highs<00:02:43.500> up<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:44.100> bit

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.640 

put<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> master<00:02:51.040> volume<00:02:51.250> up<00:02:55.409> right<00:02:56.409> that's

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
put the master volume up right that's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.990 
put the master volume up right that's
good<00:02:56.860> enough<00:02:56.980> for<00:02:57.129> now<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:59.170> our<00:03:00.129> amp<00:03:00.580> envelope

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
good enough for now on our amp envelope

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000 
good enough for now on our amp envelope
which<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.780> fourth<00:03:02.110> envelope<00:03:02.500> if<00:03:02.769> you

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
which is the fourth envelope if you

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.160 
which is the fourth envelope if you
haven't<00:03:03.280> seen<00:03:03.970> any<00:03:04.299> of<00:03:04.420> these<00:03:04.569> before

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.250 

what<00:03:08.170> we're<00:03:08.319> going<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.500> want<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.739> do<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:10.260> quick

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
what we're going to want to do is quick

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.250 
what we're going to want to do is quick

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.990 
attack for the guitar block a long ish I
guess<00:03:17.440> like<00:03:17.650> medium<00:03:18.870> decay<00:03:19.870> for<00:03:20.670> your<00:03:21.670> decay

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
guess like medium decay for your decay

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.150 
guess like medium decay for your decay
and<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.720> turn<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.109> sustain<00:03:23.530> down<00:03:23.799> which<00:03:24.040> is

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
and you turn the sustain down which is

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.220 
and you turn the sustain down which is
this<00:03:24.310> level<00:03:24.760> knob<00:03:24.940> don't<00:03:25.569> know<00:03:25.720> why<00:03:25.900> it's<00:03:26.109> not

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
this level knob don't know why it's not

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.970 
this level knob don't know why it's not
called<00:03:26.500> sustain<00:03:27.010> but<00:03:27.750> whatever<00:03:28.980> actually

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
called sustain but whatever actually

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.280 
called sustain but whatever actually
turned<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.760> decay<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.359> little<00:03:31.720> down<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:31.900> put

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
turned the decay a little down and put

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:42.599 
turned the decay a little down and put
the<00:03:32.379> release<00:03:32.650> up<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:33.400> halfway<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:42.220> now<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.400> get

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
the release up to halfway so now you get

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.399 
the release up to halfway so now you get
that<00:03:42.790> when<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.120> just<00:03:43.299> press<00:03:43.599> really<00:03:43.930> quick<00:03:44.260> on

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
that when you just press really quick on

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.770 
that when you just press really quick on
your<00:03:44.650> keys<00:03:45.099> so<00:03:45.459> I'm<00:03:46.209> just<00:03:46.420> going<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.629> press

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
your keys so I'm just going to press

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.599 
your keys so I'm just going to press
really<00:03:46.959> quick<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.349> let<00:03:47.470> go<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:51.310> release

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
really quick and let go and the release

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.539 
really quick and let go and the release
will<00:03:51.849> change<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:55.049> okay<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.349> if<00:03:56.950> we<00:03:57.220> want<00:03:57.459> a

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
will change that okay and if we want a

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:07.650 
will change that okay and if we want a
longer<00:03:57.790> pluck<00:03:58.180> we<00:03:58.419> just<00:03:58.630> play<00:03:58.840> with<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.079> decay

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.790 

so<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.810> was<00:04:08.930> fun<00:04:09.489> um<00:04:10.489> more<00:04:11.530> stuff<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.650> could

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
so that was fun um more stuff you could

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.759 
so that was fun um more stuff you could
do<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.129> go<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.370> your<00:04:14.110> voicing<00:04:15.110> tab<00:04:15.290> turn

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
do is you go to your voicing tab turn

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.140 
do is you go to your voicing tab turn
the<00:04:15.890> Unison<00:04:16.220> up<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.459> 4<00:04:16.760> or<00:04:16.970> 5<00:04:17.530> pan<00:04:18.530> position

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
the Unison up to 4 or 5 pan position

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:33.150 
the Unison up to 4 or 5 pan position
widen<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:22.030> wave<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.240> position<00:04:23.780> don't<00:04:24.410> care

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.620 

so<00:04:34.160> that's<00:04:34.280> good<00:04:34.550> now<00:04:34.820> we<00:04:34.880> can<00:04:35.240> go<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:37.060> FX<00:04:38.060> 1<00:04:38.330> and

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
so that's good now we can go to FX 1 and

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.460 
so that's good now we can go to FX 1 and
we<00:04:38.690> get<00:04:38.840> put<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:40.330> dimension<00:04:41.330> expander

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
we get put a dimension expander

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.530 
we get put a dimension expander
double-click<00:04:42.470> on<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.710> wet/dry<00:04:43.300> bring<00:04:44.300> the

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
double-click on the wet/dry bring the

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.440 
double-click on the wet/dry bring the
list<00:04:44.750> size<00:04:45.050> down<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.470> bit

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
list size down a bit

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.550 
list size down a bit
turn<00:04:47.450> our<00:04:47.570> level<00:04:47.810> down<00:04:47.930> because<00:04:48.169> we're<00:04:48.320> clip

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
turn our level down because we're clip

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.800 
turn our level down because we're clip
our<00:04:48.979> master<00:04:49.400> volume<00:04:49.760> down<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.060> mean<00:04:50.240> because

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
our master volume down I mean because

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.830 
our master volume down I mean because
we're<00:04:50.930> clipping<00:04:54.700> ok<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:55.910> now<00:04:56.090> finally<00:04:56.419> we

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
we're clipping ok and now finally we

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.370 
we're clipping ok and now finally we
could<00:04:57.410> do<00:04:57.590> our<00:04:58.479> reverb<00:04:59.479> double<00:04:59.960> click<00:05:00.139> on<00:05:00.229> the

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
could do our reverb double click on the

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.000 
could do our reverb double click on the
dry/wet

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:14.340 

of<00:05:04.010> G's<00:05:06.520> let's<00:05:07.520> change<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.940> to<00:05:07.970> a<00:05:08.120> small<00:05:08.479> reverb

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.960 

turn<00:05:15.350> the<00:05:15.500> color<00:05:15.710> all<00:05:15.950> the<00:05:16.039> way<00:05:16.070> up<00:05:16.310> the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
turn the color all the way up the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:33.469 
turn the color all the way up the
density<00:05:17.450> to<00:05:17.630> whatever<00:05:17.810> you<00:05:17.990> want

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479

draw up to you and I'm just gonna

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:42.569 
draw up to you and I'm just gonna
double-click<00:05:40.739> just<00:05:41.739> so<00:05:41.859> it's<00:05:42.009> not<00:05:42.129> clipping

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:42.579 
double-click just so it's not clipping

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:50.939 
double-click just so it's not clipping
but<00:05:42.699> it's<00:05:42.879> at<00:05:43.059> the<00:05:43.179> highest<00:05:43.329> it<00:05:43.569> can<00:05:43.689> be<00:05:43.839> so<00:05:49.949> so
