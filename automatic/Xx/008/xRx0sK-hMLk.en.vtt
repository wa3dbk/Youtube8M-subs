 salvetti welcome to the eighth part of the tutorial on how and montani e 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.409
 assemble from rectorate use 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.399
 perfect 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.399
 and today we need you 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.299
 d 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.150
 the two sclero sides of the normal two washers increased one by one 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.259
 ball bearing 608 a balorda 7 centimeters by 5 centimeters sorry 50 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.769
 millimeters we need one of the two previously mounted supports 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.400
 because you have previously cash 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.080
 and then we need in TV photo bolts in diameter 4 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.350
 system 4 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.740
 is x 2 bars 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.960
 to last of wax 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.670
 from 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.610
 which are these 49cm and a half 495mm more we need 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.390
 of 4 exit let us be sure antigua who bucinasco rare to perfection is 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.330
 this is important 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.810
 let's move on to assembly 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.680
 then first of all we attach a drawing from outgoing 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.970
 so when this father does not serve us then then we put from one 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.880
 stick part 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.620
 instead we take our and two ex griffon mounts 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.130
 come these here 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.439
 inter 1 2 network 4 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.620
 we open 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 net we put limits on care 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.660
 let's take a light inhabited I don't care too much because then I drive in 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.720
 around the world iboutlet lassie the two wings two bars will be 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.440
 mister hummingbird 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.160
 let's take support 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.430
 for what he doesn't have 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.759
 does not bring you motor 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.919
 that is this 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:13.609
 this this on one hand we now take our marrazzo brackets 5 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:14.789
 centimeters 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.259
 5 centimeters 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:20.579
 and let it pass in the middle of this follow up costume 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.609
 advice 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.039
 and back 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.039
 behind we put baroque uhm 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.679
 advice 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.369
 we put with from 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.369
 perfect now we take a normal washer 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:49.030
 then we put a larger washer and a normal washer 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.589
 ball bearing 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.729
 normal washer plus washer 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.729
 let's hope. a damage 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.950
 and the ball bearing serves to make the pass 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.950
 wild boar art 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.869
 here we are advise to tighten no matter why so much then eledofe most 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.959
 intense taste let's make sure we have the gt ball bearing safely 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.339
 in fact, here they put the strap 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:43.639
 perfect 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.109
 Now let's take the two barrettas together 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.020
 the bars must be my feelings between mind 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.819
 from the two lines 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.019
 teletu support save an important thing to leave the part where 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.759
 we have put florentine pantyhose on the outside 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.049
 therefore the hexagonal part committed towards the inside as well 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.370
 so oh oh oh 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.110
 gpl size 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.770
 now we are not trendonline we will follow in the sense and we tighten the bolts so much me 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.960
 stop class as then and then will go setup and functions of the land of the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.199
 printer itself 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.870
 the press yourself then we tighten 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.300
 a bit' 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.249
 paoloni 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:37.249
 I know 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.699
 here 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.699
 hahaha so 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.639
 and we are also this time 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.509
 bridge 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.650
 and now that we have cost support 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.740
 clearly also this other case the part where bushings have to go towards 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.740
 external from the hexagonal side towards the inside 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.870
 so 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.680
 here's shoes 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.080
 also here the setting moment is as it will then all go into a relationship 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.349
 art. the printer shaken 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:44.059
 to the 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.960
 to the 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.520
 to the 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.710
 for me 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.479
 and so we have finished feeling to fit the board class 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:04.969
 at this point all you have to do is mount it on the printer together 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.709
 to the z axis thanks for viewing
