00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.520
 What do I have to look like today? 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.010
 everything teaches like 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.780
 look for the drivers of a laptop 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.570
 a computer a computer does not leave the only thing that 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.020
 you have to do is go to google open 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.020
 lenovo 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.430
 the new group system of 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.440
 google leaves you several options only 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.440
 you have to choose is the first blanket is 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.879
 and here you have a series of 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.930
 options and which one to choose this 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.350
 band 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.620
 if this update has to be said that it is for 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.899
 windows 8 8.1 and 7 ok 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.870
 it's click if you start downloading your 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.570
 program 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.230
 this software what is going to help you 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 what it gives you to serve is how to look 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.180
 quickly the drivers that you 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.159
 Missing Saleh when you miss the network 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.159
 what you have to do is go to google 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.250
 and put him for example de novo x 230 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.890
 tablet drivers 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.020
 saleh and only then you are going to download 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.410
 the network that you have allows you to use 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.870
 the 56 tv because remember that if not 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.220
 you have the network driver because it's going to 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.040
 be very complicated that you can 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.479
 download the have anda if this mobile and 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.479
 especially that you can install it 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.720
 While searching for it, we will install the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.720
 program and once you have it 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 installed 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.470
 we are not going to open the start menu it puts you 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.000
 system of it 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.000
 and this menu appears 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.610
 system 25 I have version 5 that is 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.300
 the first screen that you will come across 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.120
 pink where they say next 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.360
 and I want to do is check for updates 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.350
 so to speak in this case for 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.340
 my Lenovo laptop only works 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.260
 for devices 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.730
 then lenovo October 1 hp or so as 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.730
 it will not work 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.800
 we let it work quickly 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.260
 and see if it works 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.950
 and is processing information here 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.290
 the packages 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.290
 91 percent 92 percent 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.130
 the first time but like here goes 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.850
 take a little bit because we're 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.030
 taking out the drivers for your team 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.160

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.120
 is looking for all the packages that already 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.450
