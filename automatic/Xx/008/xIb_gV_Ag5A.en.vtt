 ask a question to interact well with 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.189
 you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.090
 I wanted to know what each dream is. 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.520
 some are ashamed others are not but I am 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.770
 I wanted to know what your dream is 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.860
 Do you have a car quote internet has a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.660
 computer on the internet is fuck né 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:54.539
 she is a silicon blonde she sometimes 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.180
 Face alone and with that, it's good and because I 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.910
 I am asked why I am today 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 starting a dream right? 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.760
 today they do not make it last Thursday 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.750
 I spent two weeks together with my father. 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 and my brother threw the store 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 now my father has been around for 25 years already 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.780
 the top is my father has more than 12 thousand 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.310
 6 thousand machines do not even remember much machine 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.920
 that he already rode and we created the top 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.650
 hunger games that is to sell computer 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.350
 and accessory or online né 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.420
 so this is the first step of a 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.710
 dream that I always wanted to have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.439
 since the time I played cs and I came back 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.210
 to be active in the same game I always wanted 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.720
 having a physical or virtual store is 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.250
 preferably virtual after physical 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.630
 and the luck that the top until the two have 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.700
 physical and virtual 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.340
 so we started to do this 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.619
 I dream there and it depends a lot on me 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.689
 brother and my father too and also 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.880
 obviously from customers buying on the 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.920
 business ahead but we will do 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.220
 Everything's going to work out right? 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.050
 and was more or less because I wanted to do 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.900
 a video to explain some of the top 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.650
 to disclose a little and also speaks of the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.010
 my dream 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.739
 one of my dreams right it is to have this 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.140
 physical and virtual store right 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.829
 in the future perhaps the arena is perhaps the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.329
 arena beauty beauty left the paper but it is 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.980
 a future investment plan is high 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.739
 another footprint we will go a little bit in 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:38.000
 A little bit then I wanted to know which one 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:40.409
 It's up to you what your microphone is and the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.700
 Do you really want to know your dream? 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.319

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:52.079

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.030

 This is whoever wants to meet the top 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.370

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.819
