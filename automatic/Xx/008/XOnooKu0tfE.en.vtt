00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello youtube friends today and today will make a 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.209
 video of how to download and install the 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.849
 sims 3 but first they have to look 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:16.530
 if they have these two programs the torrent 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.250
 and that of montull 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.340
 well once they have us both 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.880
 they have to go to the link that will leave them in 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.880
 the description 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.580
 to this file 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.580
 good open it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.329
 start downloading your 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.809
 I canceled it 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.950
 at the beginning of the canceled because I already 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.280
 I have left 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.600
 [Music] 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.809
 because it has already been downloaded 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.640
 for example something like nine hours but 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.789
 it depends on your internet 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.789
 [Music] 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.080
 will appear 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.080
 it's symbolic 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.109
 Double click 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.429
 this will appear 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.429
 for auto good course they give to 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.390
 in my case Spanish 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.290
 The next 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.490
 here they put where 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.659
 where your country what is your country 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.659
 in my case Argentina 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.020
 great next good 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.020
 in all terms the following 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.140
 good 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.370
 good cereal 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.370
 I will also leave it not for inclusion 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.099
 [Music] 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.090
 a little bit so it's the posture 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.390
 well here you have already finished 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.610
 Carles unmark this and the next 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.520
 if they want to see but I do not want to 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.100
 they are going to make official 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.120
 good 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.810
 [Music] 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.810
 the integration 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.190
 then they go to a folder after 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.900
 go to the caracas folder 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.900
 and they buy these two files 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.320
 after a local disk and place that 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.320
 program file 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.600
 electronic arts 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.700
 give to me 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.700
 all right 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.540
 and nothing sticks 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.460
 to replace the two with 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.000
 good 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.699
 I hope you walk them and this has been all 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.570
