towns to visit and dungeons to delve

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.380 
towns to visit and dungeons to delve
into<00:00:33.160> but<00:00:34.160> really<00:00:34.489> most<00:00:34.640> of<00:00:34.850> your<00:00:34.940> time<00:00:35.120> in<00:00:35.300> the

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390

game<00:00:35.540> will<00:00:35.750> be<00:00:35.840> spent<00:00:36.170> in<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.410> combat<00:00:37.060> so<00:00:38.060> we

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
game will be spent in the combat so we

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.520 
game will be spent in the combat so we
thought<00:00:38.360> we<00:00:38.510> put<00:00:38.660> together<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:39.110> short<00:00:39.410> video

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
thought we put together this short video

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.200 
thought we put together this short video
to<00:00:39.770> give<00:00:40.040> you<00:00:40.070> an<00:00:40.220> idea<00:00:40.309> of<00:00:40.520> what<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.850> combat

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
to give you an idea of what the combat

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.569 
to give you an idea of what the combat
looks<00:00:41.420> like<00:00:41.660> in<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.829> footage<00:00:43.040> here<00:00:43.399> you'll

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
looks like in the footage here you'll

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.130 
looks like in the footage here you'll
see<00:00:43.640> me<00:00:43.940> slaughtering<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.570> enemies<00:00:44.840> quite

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
see me slaughtering the enemies quite

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.259 
see me slaughtering the enemies quite
easily<00:00:45.399> but<00:00:46.399> I<00:00:46.429> should<00:00:46.699> know<00:00:46.850> that<00:00:46.879> that's

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
easily but I should know that that's

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:48.490 
easily but I should know that that's
simply<00:00:47.629> because<00:00:47.660> I've<00:00:48.079> done<00:00:48.109> a<00:00:48.260> lot<00:00:48.469> of

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
simply because I've done a lot of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.619 
simply because I've done a lot of
grinding<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.280> if<00:00:49.820> your<00:00:49.969> characters<00:00:50.390> are<00:00:50.510> not

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
grinding and if your characters are not

and each of these abilities also level

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.350 
and each of these abilities also level
up<00:01:32.450> based<00:01:32.899> on<00:01:33.079> how<00:01:33.259> often<00:01:33.469> they're<00:01:33.799> used<00:01:34.159> for<00:01:34.460> a

up based on how often they're used for a
well-rounded<00:01:35.960> party<00:01:36.590> it's<00:01:36.829> important<00:01:37.340> to

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
well-rounded party it's important to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:38.889 
well-rounded party it's important to
level<00:01:37.670> up<00:01:37.820> all<00:01:38.030> these<00:01:38.149> different<00:01:38.390> abilities

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
level up all these different abilities

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.450 
level up all these different abilities
to<00:01:39.140> take<00:01:39.320> advantage<00:01:39.829> of<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.130> different

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
to take advantage of the different

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.889 
to take advantage of the different
situations<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.299> game<00:01:41.450> will<00:01:41.600> throw<00:01:41.780> at

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
situations that the game will throw at

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.020 
situations that the game will throw at
you<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:43.039> there's<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.340> bit<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.520> branding

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
you so there's a bit of branding

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.149 
you so there's a bit of branding
involved<00:01:44.450> there<00:01:44.600> as<00:01:44.750> well<00:01:44.990> you'll<00:01:45.890> need<00:01:46.009> to

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
involved there as well you'll need to

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.560 
involved there as well you'll need to
grind<00:01:46.340> up<00:01:46.520> your<00:01:46.670> character's<00:01:47.119> levels<00:01:47.420> and

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
grind up your character's levels and

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.029 
grind up your character's levels and
then<00:01:48.140> you'll<00:01:48.289> need<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.530> ground<00:01:48.710> up<00:01:48.860> their

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
then you'll need to ground up their

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.029 
then you'll need to ground up their
special<00:01:49.369> abilities<00:01:50.110> now<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.170> enemy<00:01:51.649> AI<00:01:51.829> is

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
special abilities now the enemy AI is

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.039 
special abilities now the enemy AI is
not<00:01:52.460> particularly<00:01:52.789> good<00:01:52.969> and<00:01:53.360> there's<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.899> lot

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
not particularly good and there's a lot

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.499 
not particularly good and there's a lot
of<00:01:54.079> pallet<00:01:54.439> swapping<00:01:54.829> and<00:01:55.000> if<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.119> combats

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
of pallet swapping and if the combats

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.029 
of pallet swapping and if the combats
were<00:01:56.659> more<00:01:56.840> drawn<00:01:57.109> out<00:01:57.320> this<00:01:57.710> will<00:01:57.920> become

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
were more drawn out this will become

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.330 
were more drawn out this will become
very<00:01:58.430> tedious<00:01:58.700> very<00:01:59.090> quickly<00:01:59.920> but<00:02:00.920> as<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:01.219> can
