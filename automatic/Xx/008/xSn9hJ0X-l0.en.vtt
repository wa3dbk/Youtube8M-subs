00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.650
 mister we start from barusso has arrived 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.720
 here for a couple of days, how it is and what 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.940
 is planning to register it or ours 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.010
 but I don't want to miss the player of 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.930
 undoubtedly there is no doubt 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.850
 we are doing all the exams too 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.550
 instrumental this morning we sent him to 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.250
 make an MRI of myself 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.379
 I tested it in what may be the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.850
 force start the explosive force with the 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.969
 ball for me is an integral player 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.160
 he seriously misses the condition though 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.859
 I see it very curious very helpful 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.829
 had to convince me I will weave it 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.629
 also depending on the perspective why 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.749
 if he knows still young 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.449
 thirty years a great player 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:56.300
 thickness possibly in what role of 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.370
 midfield should play wanted but is 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.370
 a structure player is a player 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.409
 there cm in my opinion he can play 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.479
 both tremble and two because the pain that 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.399
 tina consistency and normal than his 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.439
 role maybe even for the presence 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.240
 physical ideal would be in front of 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.750
 defense but in my opinion can also do the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.369
 mezzala after the game is postponed 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.020
 of lumezzane for snow are not fifteen 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.939
 forced break days for the vehicle 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.009
 what pitfalls there may also be to 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.229
 psychological level for the school but 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.240
 all you teach me is that management 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.649
 of defeat is much easier than 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.719
 victory management in 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.700
 likely what others think 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.830
 normal that we won one 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.930
 important match 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.670
 even the ninetieth a game 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.030
 very difficult therefore this had us 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.650
 created enthusiasm so we wanted it 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.850
 play the lumezzane game 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.330
 unfortunately we have had this 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.110
 difficulty arising from this aspect 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.980
 weather that has prevented us from 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.360
 to be able to play 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:59.630
 and normal that now maybe this break 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.570
 they will do us good for the recovery of 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.970
 some players is definitely the stage 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.650
 of impact to play the race would have us 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.149
 brought more enthusiasm 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.920
 this morning he said before he did 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.170
 come the team here at 8 in the morning 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.550
 because yesterday in the view how to train 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.430
 he wants her so but i'm one who 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.530
 it tries that surely works that tries 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.860
 to inculcate to the team of certain 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.020
 concepts that enjoyed the concepts have us 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.390
 led to make 30 points at the moment 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.770
 something unthinkable as we were 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.510
 parties 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.560
 surely yesterday I saw the team not 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.360
 she trained as a capuano team 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.239
 I reported it on the field as right 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.800
 both a worker gets up at 7 in the morning 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.840
 I don't see why a player or a 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.170
 coach can't do it we are gods 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.340
 lucky compared to many other people and 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.800
 one of the fittest teams matures 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.400
 of the championship that difficulty expects 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.170
 Monday night when in a big schoolgirl 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.849
 it won't be that she left to win the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.739
 league not to do the playoffs then 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.569
 has had corporate problems 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.950
 at the beginning is a team that plays a 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.349
 good football 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.970
 a 4 3 3 not true because they in 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.830
 effects do not play with a tip 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.319
 central because caridi is lowered 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.180
 very much they play with two wide points 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.370
 that come in short , we don't have it 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.989
 well studied we are working well 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.780
 we know we play with a big one 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.060
 team, however, I see them against the not 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.890
 it is never easy to play for anyone 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.239
 Tuesday the present wounds met 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.040
 football gardens and tenants 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.900
 academy there is a chance to see 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.340
 some guy from the nursery ministries in 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.739
 field here at the end of the season 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.860
 I repeat a concept then me if 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.799
 I can do 45 tried to make 46 if I can 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.799
 make time to do me 44 what I want 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.780
 to say in the points is not that if it should 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.180
 even this miracle happen 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.970
 save us with what a day in advance 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.940
 they hurry up because I broke the 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.620
 heart together with the property that has me 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.630
 given this possibility together with the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.120
 group that I have the honor to lead e 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.450
 normal that if I were to convince myself 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.850
 which in the students in the beretti there is 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.040
 some worthy players you can 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.260
 I play with a limited 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.880
 pleasure if i have to put someone in 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.030
 right field to show who has 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.250
 I would only hurt him then 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.979
 does not belong to the philosophy of capua e 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.370
 to one last thing about benassi mister how 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.959
 he found it these days and if 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.240
 I don't know who said anything for 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.750
 cheer him up assuming that benassi has some 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.760
 need 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.919
 benassi I know him better than anyone else 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.820
 I would like to say many things but I can't 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.460
 to say 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.590
 understanding that my concept on 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.810
 you know these situations very well 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.699
 who kills a person takes 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.350
 life imprisonment who sells games not 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.660
 should play more football because 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.750
 when more dirty than more shiny can 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.300
 happen benassi a morality guy 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.010
 very high I had the pleasure of 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.010
 take it early in your career 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.650
 when he played with the sansolino and I know 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.010
 very well what he did when 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.300
 we rejoiced together and when Italy 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.100
 whole did not speak when even 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.080
 they put the bombs in Castellammare 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.910
 di stabia not letting us play the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.970
 Sunday playing Monday and beating 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.949
 so many these stories 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.410
 who say they talk and write yes 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.510
 they also documented everything on things about 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.880
 very high morality that go above 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.699
 of the game rectangle 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.500
 benassi when he was accused I called him 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.110
 and I told him I don't believe it 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.110
 and has been cleared twice and vi 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.300
 I assure you that you will be acquitted by 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.700
 sports justice is much more difficult 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.380
 of ordinary justice as 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.840
 in sports justice you must 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.940
 prove that you didn't do it in 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.120
 ordinary justice I have to prove 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.810
 that you did it well and therefore not there 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.789
 are words 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.449
 I don't believe it and I'll never believe it 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:54.419
 because one of the greatest men 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.430
 morality that I had the honor in 26 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.780
 career years of having allen to mine 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.210
 layout 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.389
 having said that I congratulate de 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.419
 Martino's public ministry cremona 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:08.760
 who has taken away so much garbage and 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:11.310
 which unfortunately we in Italian football 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.130
 we let them play this is great 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.090
 incongruity and unlimited shame 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.310
 having said that I trust this great 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.070
 also of martino and I am convinced that of 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.460
 will evaluate calmly and benassi can 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:30.310
 come out clean because benassi is one 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.310
 person of the highest morality
