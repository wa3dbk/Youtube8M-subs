think halo 2 multiplayer has been played

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.400 
think halo 2 multiplayer has been played
like<00:01:23.920> four<00:01:24.340> billion<00:01:24.880> times<00:01:25.410> competing

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
like four billion times competing

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.490 
like four billion times competing
against<00:01:26.680> yourself<00:01:26.770> is<00:01:27.310> stressful<00:01:28.410> coming<00:01:29.410> up

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
against yourself is stressful coming up

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.200 
against yourself is stressful coming up
with<00:01:29.770> these<00:01:29.950> scenarios<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.820> people<00:01:31.120> play

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
with these scenarios that people play

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.360 
with these scenarios that people play
over<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.660> over<00:01:31.780> again<00:01:32.050> now<00:01:32.860> how<00:01:33.070> can<00:01:33.130> we

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
over and over again now how can we

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.800 
over and over again now how can we
rethink<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.210> create<00:01:34.480> something<00:01:34.630> that's

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
rethink that and create something that's

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.490 
rethink that and create something that's
new<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.320> interesting<00:01:36.510> we<00:01:37.510> started<00:01:38.230> getting

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
new and interesting we started getting

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.940 
new and interesting we started getting
more<00:01:38.680> djs<00:01:39.130> much

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.260 

we're<00:01:42.950> that's<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.250> choke<00:01:43.460> point<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.120> want

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
we're that's a choke point that you want

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.900 
we're that's a choke point that you want
to<00:01:44.330> hold<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:45.800> think<00:01:46.010> high<00:01:46.130> ground<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:46.640> an

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
to hold and I think high ground is an

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.500 
to hold and I think high ground is an
example<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:48.850> some<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.030> specific

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
example of that some of the specific

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.480 
example of that some of the specific
things<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:50.960> try<00:01:51.140> it<00:01:51.260> out<00:01:51.440> we're<00:01:51.950> having<00:01:52.340> a

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
things that we try it out we're having a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.610 
things that we try it out we're having a
wall<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.240> have<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.420> get<00:01:53.510> past<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:54.320> sort

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
wall that you have to get past that sort

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.500 
wall that you have to get past that sort
of<00:01:54.650> defined<00:01:55.070> whether<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.490> want<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:55.790> lost<00:01:56.060> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.480 
well as to turn the other tower so
there's<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.200> lot<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.440> firepower<00:02:21.709> coming<00:02:22.340> down

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
there's a lot of firepower coming down

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.300 
there's a lot of firepower coming down
the<00:02:22.700> hill<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.150> got<00:02:24.140> all<00:02:24.350> simplified<00:02:24.950> into

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
the hill that got all simplified into

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.190 
the hill that got all simplified into
one<00:02:25.550> turret<00:02:25.820> actually<00:02:26.450> right<00:02:26.630> above<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.990> gate

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
one turret actually right above the gate

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.620 
one turret actually right above the gate
which<00:02:27.620> we<00:02:27.980> felt<00:02:28.160> was<00:02:28.280> not<00:02:28.520> as<00:02:28.640> critical<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.540> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
which we felt was not as critical to the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.070 
which we felt was not as critical to the
attackers<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:31.700> pretty<00:02:32.030> obvious<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.630> us<00:02:32.780> when

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
attackers it's pretty obvious to us when

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.750 
attackers it's pretty obvious to us when
when<00:02:33.410> we<00:02:33.530> start<00:02:33.740> working<00:02:34.070> on<00:02:34.160> these<00:02:34.280> maps<00:02:34.520> that

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
when we start working on these maps that

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.940 
when we start working on these maps that
they<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.180> be<00:02:35.300> fun<00:02:35.600> for<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.590> hundredth

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
they have to be fun for the hundredth

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.530 
they have to be fun for the hundredth
and<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> 200th<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.270> one<00:02:38.360> thousandth<00:02:38.780> time

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
and the 200th and one thousandth time

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.699 
and the 200th and one thousandth time
you<00:02:41.540> are<00:02:41.660> figuring<00:02:42.080> out<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.290> switch<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.620> the

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
you are figuring out the switch in the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.410 
you are figuring out the switch in the
doors<00:02:42.890> yeah<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.459> closer<00:02:43.760> look<00:02:44.030> like<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.330> want

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
doors yeah the closer look like you want

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.880 
doors yeah the closer look like you want
to<00:02:44.510> perform<00:02:44.750> I'm<00:02:45.110> watching<00:02:45.230> people<00:02:45.709> run

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
to perform I'm watching people run

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.410 
to perform I'm watching people run
through<00:02:46.070> your<00:02:46.160> map<00:02:46.370> challenges<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.030> lot<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
through your map challenges a lot of the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.729 
through your map challenges a lot of the
assumptions<00:02:47.840> made<00:02:48.080> about<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.590> oh<00:02:48.709> I

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
assumptions made about it like oh I

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.610 
assumptions made about it like oh I
think<00:02:49.070> people<00:02:49.190> will<00:02:49.459> use<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:49.880> Hill<00:02:50.090> for

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
think people will use this Hill for

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.170 
think people will use this Hill for
sniping<00:02:51.620> line<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:51.950> then<00:02:52.489> no<00:02:52.640> one<00:02:52.760> needs<00:02:52.940> it

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
sniping line and then no one needs it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.630 
sniping line and then no one needs it
then<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.050> get<00:02:54.140> great<00:02:54.350> comments<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.070> this

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
then you get great comments like this

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.470 
then you get great comments like this
map<00:02:55.880> sucks<00:02:56.239> i<00:02:57.310> hate<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.519> spot<00:02:58.910> i<00:02:59.180> hate<00:02:59.450> you<00:03:00.250> a

map sucks i hate the spot i hate you a

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.280 
map sucks i hate the spot i hate you a
lot<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.750> time

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
lot of the time

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.160 
lot of the time

different areas getting the distance is

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.059

although<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.909> was<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> great<00:03:48.299> way<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.510> get

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689 
although it was a great way to get

although it was a great way to get
around<00:03:48.810> quickly<00:03:49.349> it<00:03:49.620> didn't<00:03:50.010> provide<00:03:50.310> as<00:03:50.760> much

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
around quickly it didn't provide as much

around quickly it didn't provide as much
inherent<00:03:51.659> danger<00:03:52.139> as<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.859> man<00:03:53.040> cannon<00:03:53.400> does
