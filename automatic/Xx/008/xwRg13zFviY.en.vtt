00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.450 
this is on top of spire we were working
on<00:04:29.290> our<00:04:29.470> GOI<00:04:29.800> our<00:04:30.580> own<00:04:31.090> GOI<00:04:31.450> but<00:04:32.010> spire<00:04:33.010> doesn't

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
on our GOI our own GOI but spire doesn't

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.590 
on our GOI our own GOI but spire doesn't
purpose<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.000> we're<00:04:34.120> also<00:04:34.240> going<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.480> be<00:04:34.570> using

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
purpose and we're also going to be using

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.020 
purpose and we're also going to be using
spire<00:04:35.110> when<00:04:35.410> our<00:04:35.560> full<00:04:35.920> server<00:04:36.310> for<00:04:36.730> people

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
spire when our full server for people

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.990 
spire when our full server for people
who<00:04:37.510> don't<00:04:37.720> have<00:04:37.900> iphone<00:04:38.380> 4<00:04:38.650> s's<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:39.640> connect

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
who don't have iphone 4 s's to connect

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.100 
who don't have iphone 4 s's to connect
so<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:41.290> little<00:04:42.010> more<00:04:42.220> info<00:04:42.580> on<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.210> server

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
so a little more info on the server

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.100 
so a little more info on the server
itself<00:04:44.670> it's<00:04:45.670> basically<00:04:46.180> going<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.540> cancel

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
itself it's basically going to cancel

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.740 
itself it's basically going to cancel
out<00:04:47.530> Apple<00:04:48.040> out<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.520> equation<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:49.300> Siri

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
out Apple out of the equation of Siri

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.860 
out Apple out of the equation of Siri
off<00:04:50.020> so<00:04:50.740> when<00:04:51.160> you<00:04:51.370> make<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.580> dictation<00:04:52.060> right

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
off so when you make a dictation right

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.850 
off so when you make a dictation right
on<00:04:53.080> your<00:04:53.290> device<00:04:53.620> like<00:04:54.490> this<00:04:55.620> it's<00:04:56.620> going<00:04:56.800> to

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
on your device like this it's going to

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.070 
on your device like this it's going to
connect<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.370> our<00:04:57.610> server<00:04:58.000> then<00:04:58.750> it's<00:04:58.900> going<00:04:58.990> to

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
connect to our server then it's going to

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.410 
connect to our server then it's going to
go<00:04:59.230> to<00:04:59.290> Google<00:04:59.830> to<00:05:00.280> process<00:05:00.730> what<00:05:00.940> you<00:05:01.090> said

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
go to Google to process what you said

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.230 
go to Google to process what you said
then<00:05:02.110> it's<00:05:02.290> going<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.470> go<00:05:02.650> back<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
then it's going to go back to the the

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.000 
then it's going to go back to the the
server<00:05:04.480> that<00:05:04.750> we<00:05:04.870> have<00:05:05.110> it's<00:05:05.710> going<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:05.890> return

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
server that we have it's going to return

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.700 
server that we have it's going to return
a<00:05:06.220> string<00:05:06.430> or<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:06.970> text<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.660> say<00:05:08.050> exactly<00:05:08.230> what

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
a string or a text and say exactly what

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.590 
a string or a text and say exactly what
you<00:05:08.800> said<00:05:08.980> that<00:05:09.580> text<00:05:09.970> is<00:05:10.000> going<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.240> be<00:05:10.330> run

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
you said that text is going to be run

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.370 
you said that text is going to be run
through<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.770> plugins<00:05:12.760> on<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.480> Serie<00:05:13.870> proxy

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
through the plugins on the Serie proxy

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.430 
through the plugins on the Serie proxy
setup<00:05:14.770> so<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:15.790> then<00:05:15.940> it'll<00:05:16.240> put<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.200> final

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
setup so and then it'll put the final

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.400 
setup so and then it'll put the final
outcome<00:05:18.250> back<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.120> device<00:05:19.450> so<00:05:20.020> won't<00:05:20.320> be

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
outcome back to the device so won't be

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.590 
outcome back to the device so won't be
using<00:05:20.590> Apple<00:05:21.040> at<00:05:21.190> all<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.580> won't<00:05:22.030> be<00:05:22.210> official

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
using Apple at all it won't be official

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.930 
using Apple at all it won't be official
series<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:23.440> some<00:05:24.100> things<00:05:24.130> may<00:05:24.550> be<00:05:24.610> missing

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
series so some things may be missing

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.850 
series so some things may be missing
like<00:05:25.419> the<00:05:25.690> main<00:05:25.900> functions<00:05:26.440> but<00:05:26.620> we're<00:05:26.770> going

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
like the main functions but we're going

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.770 
like the main functions but we're going
to<00:05:26.919> be<00:05:27.040> programming<00:05:27.640> those<00:05:27.820> into<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.240> plugins

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
to be programming those into the plugins

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.190 
to be programming those into the plugins
so<00:05:29.350> overall<00:05:29.860> series<00:05:30.790> series<00:05:31.419> voice<00:05:31.780> won't<00:05:32.080> be

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
so overall series series voice won't be

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.440 
so overall series series voice won't be
different<00:05:32.650> it's<00:05:33.010> going<00:05:33.160> to<00:05:33.190> be<00:05:33.310> Seri<00:05:33.669> itself

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
different it's going to be Seri itself

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.390 
different it's going to be Seri itself
it's<00:05:35.110> just<00:05:35.350> going<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.560> be<00:05:35.650> a<00:05:35.980> different

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
it's just going to be a different

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.190 
it's just going to be a different
connection<00:05:36.640> so<00:05:37.060> it's<00:05:37.300> going<00:05:37.419> to<00:05:37.480> go<00:05:37.630> for<00:05:37.960> to

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
connection so it's going to go for to

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.650 
connection so it's going to go for to
google<00:05:38.680> for<00:05:38.860> processing<00:05:39.460> rather<00:05:40.120> than<00:05:40.390> going

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
google for processing rather than going

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.040 
google for processing rather than going
to<00:05:40.840> apple<00:05:41.200> with<00:05:41.410> authentication<00:05:42.130> so<00:05:42.970> i<00:05:43.270> hope

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
to apple with authentication so i hope

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.510 
to apple with authentication so i hope
you<00:05:44.080> guys<00:05:44.320> like<00:05:44.530> this<00:05:44.650> video<00:05:44.800> i<00:05:44.979> hope<00:05:45.310> it
