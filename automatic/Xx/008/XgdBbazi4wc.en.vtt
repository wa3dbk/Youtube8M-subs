00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.020 

and<00:01:17.150> then<00:01:17.509> we're<00:01:17.600> going<00:01:17.689> to<00:01:17.750> use<00:01:17.990> our<00:01:19.030> small

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
and then we're going to use our small

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.929 
and then we're going to use our small
finger<00:01:20.450> on<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.720> fourth<00:01:20.960> fret<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:21.560> come<00:01:22.549> up<00:01:22.700> to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.760 

then<00:01:30.500> we're<00:01:30.619> going<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.860> slide<00:01:31.310> up<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:32.770> come

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
then we're going to slide up and come

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.460 
then we're going to slide up and come
into<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.070> fifth<00:01:34.600> fret<00:01:35.600> on<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:35.960> third<00:01:36.439> string

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
into the fifth fret on the third string

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.399 
into the fifth fret on the third string
and<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:38.180> third<00:01:38.840> fret<00:01:39.110> on<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.380> second<00:01:39.890> string

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
and the third fret on the second string

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.020 
and the third fret on the second string
then<00:01:42.409> we<00:01:42.530> take<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.770> down<00:01:43.220> one<00:01:43.580> two<00:01:43.970> four<00:01:44.840> and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
then we take that down one two four and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.220 
then we take that down one two four and
three<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:48.320> then<00:01:48.590> back<00:01:48.799> to<00:01:48.979> our<00:01:49.009> D

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.480 

so<00:01:55.190> what<00:01:55.340> he's<00:01:55.430> doing<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.850> referencing<00:01:56.480> a<00:01:56.600> c

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
so what he's doing is referencing a c

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:09.910 
so what he's doing is referencing a c
a.g<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.450> then<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.200> D

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:23.089 

so<00:02:10.670> during<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.120> verse<00:02:11.390> he's<00:02:12.380> just<00:02:12.620> doing<00:02:12.920> that

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.580 

so<00:02:23.819> after<00:02:24.090> he<00:02:24.150> talks<00:02:24.390> about<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.079> verse<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
so after he talks about in the verse the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.649 
so after he talks about in the verse the
first<00:02:25.620> verse<00:02:26.069> about<00:02:26.340> moonshine<00:02:27.060> he<00:02:27.209> goes<00:02:27.390> into

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
first verse about moonshine he goes into

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.149 
first verse about moonshine he goes into
a<00:02:27.689> break<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.829> break<00:02:29.099> is<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> gene<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.359> a<00:02:30.900> C<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:32.129> a

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
a break the break is a gene to a C to a

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:46.729 
a break the break is a gene to a C to a
D<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.969> I'll<00:02:33.719> show<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.079> at<00:02:34.409> speed<00:02:34.769> here

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:55.050 

back<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.640> copperhead<00:02:48.450> room

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.600 

I<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.200> play<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.620> G<00:02:56.830> with<00:02:57.069> my<00:02:57.250> small

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
I like to play the G with my small

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.540 
I like to play the G with my small
finger<00:02:58.120> here<00:02:59.130> on<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.400> first<00:03:00.819> string<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:03.400> I'm

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
finger here on the first string then I'm

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.820 
finger here on the first string then I'm
referencing<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.360> C<00:03:04.690> by<00:03:05.080> putting<00:03:05.440> my<00:03:05.560> first

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
referencing the C by putting my first

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.890 
referencing the C by putting my first
finger<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> second<00:03:07.060> string<00:03:07.090> at<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.660> first

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
finger on the second string at the first

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.220 
finger on the second string at the first
fret<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:11.230> then<00:03:11.410> into<00:03:11.739> D<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:13.390> think<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.870> sounds

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
fret and then into D I think it sounds

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.630 
fret and then into D I think it sounds
better<00:03:14.380> than<00:03:14.530> doing<00:03:14.890> maybe<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.310> full<00:03:15.700> C<00:03:16.230> by

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
better than doing maybe a full C by

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.100 
better than doing maybe a full C by
putting<00:03:18.640> your<00:03:18.760> first<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.390> second<00:03:19.780> finger<00:03:20.080> on

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
putting your first and second finger on

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.339 
putting your first and second finger on
the<00:03:20.260> second<00:03:20.739> string<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:21.069> fourth<00:03:21.430> string

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.280 

it's<00:03:26.349> to<00:03:26.590> base<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.959> listen<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
it's to base so if you listen to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.780 
it's to base so if you listen to
recording<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:29.859> think<00:03:30.069> he's<00:03:30.189> just<00:03:30.310> using<00:03:30.549> his

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
recording I think he's just using his

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:43.880 
recording I think he's just using his
first<00:03:31.180> finger

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.740 

and<00:03:44.490> then<00:03:44.670> you're<00:03:44.850> back<00:03:45.000> into<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> little

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
and then you're back into the little

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.450 
and then you're back into the little
lick<00:03:45.900> where<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.230> come<00:03:46.410> up<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:46.740> reference<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.160> C

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
lick where you come up in reference to C

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.970 
lick where you come up in reference to C
to<00:03:47.700> G<00:03:47.940> back<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.240> D

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.949 

so<00:03:52.489> it's<00:03:52.640> kind<00:03:52.910> of<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.090> mellow<00:03:53.330> part<00:03:53.750> you're

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
so it's kind of a mellow part you're

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.510 
so it's kind of a mellow part you're
still<00:03:54.200> playing<00:03:54.440> with<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.709> mandolin<00:03:55.190> through

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
still playing with the mandolin through

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.940 
still playing with the mandolin through
the<00:03:55.640> first<00:03:55.910> two<00:03:56.270> verses<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.440> second<00:03:57.800> verse

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the first two verses so second verse

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.400 
the first two verses so second verse
kind<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.430> builds<00:03:58.849> the<00:03:59.030> tension<00:03:59.540> you<00:04:00.050> can<00:04:00.080> just

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
kind of builds the tension you can just

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.949 
kind of builds the tension you can just
feel<00:04:00.790> like<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:02.000> going<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.209> break<00:04:02.420> loose<00:04:02.690> any

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
feel like it's going to break loose any

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.729 
feel like it's going to break loose any
minute<00:04:03.319> with<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.650> droning<00:04:05.500> chord<00:04:06.500> in<00:04:06.650> the

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
minute with the droning chord in the

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:19.220 
minute with the droning chord in the
background<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:12.230> you're<00:04:12.470> doing<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.860> break

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.950 

second<00:04:20.070> half<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.460> the<00:04:20.550> break

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.690 

that<00:04:24.960> too<00:04:25.260> Copperhead<00:04:25.860> Road<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.370> where

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
that too Copperhead Road this is where

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.610 
that too Copperhead Road this is where
it<00:04:26.820> cuts<00:04:27.060> loose<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.720> you're<00:04:27.840> going<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.020> do<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.230> D

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
it cuts loose and you're going to do a D

00:04:28.620 --> 00:05:04.510 
it cuts loose and you're going to do a D
and<00:04:29.370> we're<00:04:29.550> going<00:04:29.670> to<00:04:29.700> come<00:04:29.880> in

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.460 

so<00:05:05.520> their<00:05:05.669> break<00:05:06.030> follows<00:05:06.629> the<00:05:06.870> basically<00:05:07.229> the

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
so their break follows the basically the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.230 
so their break follows the basically the
chords<00:05:07.919> but<00:05:08.099> it's<00:05:08.250> played<00:05:08.490> with<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.729> lot<00:05:08.970> more

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
chords but it's played with a lot more

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.909 
chords but it's played with a lot more
of<00:05:09.590> we<00:05:10.590> come<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:10.949> with<00:05:11.069> the<00:05:11.220> D<00:05:13.789> data<00:05:14.789> data<00:05:15.120> dot

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
of we come in with the D data data dot

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.520 
of we come in with the D data data dot
and<00:05:16.919> then<00:05:17.159> you're<00:05:17.370> into<00:05:17.729> the<00:05:17.909> very<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.930> actual

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
and then you're into the very the actual

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.010 
and then you're into the very the actual
course<00:05:19.770> where<00:05:20.069> you<00:05:20.159> doing

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.950 

just<00:05:23.740> a<00:05:23.830> lot<00:05:24.009> more<00:05:24.250> up-tempo<00:05:24.699> and<00:05:24.970> play<00:05:25.840> it

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
just a lot more up-tempo and play it

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:36.239 
just a lot more up-tempo and play it
with<00:05:25.990> some<00:05:26.289> feeling

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:36.249 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:38.909 

and<00:05:36.339> then<00:05:36.519> again<00:05:37.179> he<00:05:37.749> does<00:05:37.929> that<00:05:38.139> twice<00:05:38.439> it's

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
and then again he does that twice it's

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:54.240 
and then again he does that twice it's
like<00:05:39.099> the<00:05:39.249> break<00:05:39.429> you<00:05:39.639> go<00:05:39.759> into<00:05:40.059> the<00:05:40.209> G<00:05:40.779> C<00:05:41.319> and<00:05:41.709> D

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.700 

so<00:05:55.000> it<00:05:55.060> does<00:05:55.210> add<00:05:55.390> twice<00:05:55.720> also<00:05:56.320> and<00:05:56.560> then

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
so it does add twice also and then

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.710 
so it does add twice also and then
you're<00:05:56.920> in<00:05:57.070> you<00:05:57.370> just<00:05:57.550> kind<00:05:57.820> of<00:05:57.850> hold<00:05:58.030> a<00:05:58.180> D<00:05:58.390> and

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
you're in you just kind of hold a D and

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.290 
you're in you just kind of hold a D and
you're<00:05:58.840> back<00:05:59.020> into<00:05:59.290> the<00:05:59.590> actual<00:05:59.980> third<00:06:00.970> verse

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
you're back into the actual third verse

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.900 
you're back into the actual third verse
which<00:06:01.720> is<00:06:01.930> a<00:06:01.960> lot<00:06:02.230> more<00:06:02.410> up-tempo<00:06:02.950> okay<00:06:03.670> that's

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
which is a lot more up-tempo okay that's

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.110 
which is a lot more up-tempo okay that's
