first<00:00:11.429> i<00:00:11.670> will<00:00:12.420> start<00:00:12.809> out<00:00:12.990> with<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.290> ports

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.810 

here's<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.359> magsafe<00:00:21.720> power<00:00:22.199> doctor<00:00:22.949> it's

here's a magsafe power doctor it's

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.140 
here's a magsafe power doctor it's
really<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:25.350> much<00:00:25.740> better<00:00:26.039> than<00:00:26.369> pcs<00:00:26.820> because

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
really it's much better than pcs because

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.570 
really it's much better than pcs because
someone<00:00:28.080> trips<00:00:28.320> over<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.680> power<00:00:28.980> wire<00:00:29.250> it

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
someone trips over the power wire it

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.650 
someone trips over the power wire it

use<00:01:29.189> mini<00:01:29.490> display<00:01:29.970> ports<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.900> many

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
use mini display ports but not that many

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.649 
use mini display ports but not that many
so<00:01:31.829> that's<00:01:32.189> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.610> annoying<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:36.060> is

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
you can replace the hard drive which is

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.390 
you can replace the hard drive which is
right<00:02:12.569> there<00:02:12.599> or<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.620> battery<00:02:13.980> which<00:02:14.250> is

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
right there or the battery which is

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.040 

ok

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.780 

and<00:02:31.430> here<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.580> we're<00:02:33.090> going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.420> go<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.630> screen

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
and here you we're going to go to screen

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.340 
and here you we're going to go to screen
here's<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.970> magnetic<00:02:36.540> latch<00:02:36.780> which<00:02:37.170> is

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
here's the magnetic latch which is

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.750 
here's the magnetic latch which is
really<00:02:37.620> nice<00:02:37.920> because<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:39.620> PCs<00:02:40.620> usually<00:02:41.580> they

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
really nice because on PCs usually they

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.090 
really nice because on PCs usually they
have<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.210> latch<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.840> goes<00:02:43.050> straight<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.800> and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
have a latch that goes straight in and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.540 
have a latch that goes straight in and
its<00:02:44.460> fizz<00:02:44.760> more<00:02:45.150> physical<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.010> those<00:02:47.310> can

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
its fizz more physical so and those can

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.210 
its fizz more physical so and those can
break<00:02:47.790> pretty<00:02:48.120> easily<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.810> magnetic<00:02:49.800> latches

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
break pretty easily so magnetic latches

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.080 
I have noticed that smaller than the old
old<00:03:25.290> macbooks<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.720> employee<00:03:28.470> captures<00:03:29.310> better

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
old macbooks so employee captures better

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.660

video<00:03:30.600> quality<00:03:30.840> now<00:03:31.440> too<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.390> they<00:03:33.390> move<00:03:33.750> the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
video quality now too and they move the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.690 
video quality now too and they move the
microphone<00:03:35.750> down<00:03:36.750> here<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.380> doubt<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.520> see

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700

other video new macbook it has much
better<00:03:44.130> voice<00:03:44.610> quality<00:03:45.080> because<00:03:46.340> Apple<00:03:47.340> makes

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
better voice quality because Apple makes

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.260 
better voice quality because Apple makes
better<00:03:47.940> things<00:03:48.330> than<00:03:48.660> canon<00:03:49.560> powershot<00:03:50.390> and
