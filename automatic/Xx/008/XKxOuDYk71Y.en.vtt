00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello everyone as we are bringing another 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.350
 video more commenting live live 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.390
 I already like the games a lot 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.189
 because good makes me pretty 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.779
 entertaining comment live not by the 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:27.010
 experiences in this game 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.710
 unfortunately I had a team 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.189
 who would not like to help us in the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.189
 distance 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.190
 I told them why I started recording 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.370
 because I want to record a kind of 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.100
 revenge I did not get a quick game and 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.769
 it was practically finished and it's 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.159
 an almost whole team that they are 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.100
 mocking all that kind of people do not 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.450
 pleases the truth for nothing or is it not no 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.550
 you want 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.350
 if there is something to me that bothers me in a 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.090
 Video game is someone who loves 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:09.120
 talk about the rival just because he plays 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:09.120
 plus one that returns to be easy death and 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:18.120
 I almost killed myself just do that fail 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.120
 really good I think I've recovered 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.680
 fighting with three guys 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.110
 this is a team that was very good to me 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.430
 I disliked a lot of pity that it touched me 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.930
 his side would have liked to eliminate them but 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.320
 notice how nothing else they are 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.790
 trying to lock them all in there 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.520
 they came several I better go back 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.430
 by the gÃºmer fortunately appeared 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.890
 there come all great nothing else is the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.710
 classic team that tries to lock up 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:56.659
 the others in the shot I was not wrong 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:00.050
 twice the essential thing is the support in 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.990
 this is mocked when when they can is 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.000
 a team that must believe a lot of 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.860
 very unpleasant truth like no no 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.769
 it's all good to support them there is not the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.340
 sniper let's give it I'm average which 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.340
 shoot 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.829
 sniper shot with back but 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.829
 nothing and it was worth 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.740
 coverage at the end of accounts is a 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.810
 helped my friend should you have approached 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.460
 if you had eliminated I think that there 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.060
 come the others are not in their 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.060
 response 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.450
 good look how they started 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.430
 well the opposite team trimmed not 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.960
 I'm surprised if they start to take out lancer 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.330
 retro 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.360
 is that the team that touched me like 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.700
 I say is those people who make fun 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.240
 have a clipped shotgun imagine 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.220
 makes retro nothing else are waiting and 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.610
 they still start to tease you already know 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.410
 we are gaining relatively easy for 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.380
 because nothing else are waiting or not 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.620
 it's a team that we say can fight 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.120
 I just want 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.739
 Well, this quick game is over. 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.349
 they are already doing their dancing 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.950
 we have won, I have to hurry back 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.680
 pure weapons are like that with dancing 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.110
 I'm really shocked to play with people like that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.890
 is a team that I want to help them 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.079
 truth is very unpleasant this kind of 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.390
 football but webb we already won the first 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:43.290
 round to see how it goes to use as 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.579
 we were left I was more or less well another 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.930
 well no wonder that here in the first 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.510
 place is nothing else with the number 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.319
 waiting for the other team they go from this 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.209
 this hand one of the reasons that I 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.129
 always good one of the things that 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.769
 I always defend in any game in 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.440
 line is that one winning a game does not 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:06.280
 it does better than the others there are many 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.690
 situations for example have advantage 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.190
 I better focus on him boomer because 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.190
 help us 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.930
 and this helped me I think they have them already 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.020
 courage those guys and it would not surprise me 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.330
 and I tell them that winning a game does not 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.360
 It makes you better than the rest of us 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.240
 they were part mocking that's nonsense 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.100
 In my opinion there may be conditions 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.320
 favorable 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.419
 just when I was going to grab the water 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.840
 damn it I do not want to leave them to me 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.870
 team but good 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.240
 for example in this game the team 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.880
 that I have, it's basically 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.350
 coordinated nothing else are waiting 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.120
 so they have an advantage over the 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.220
 team that is entering little by little 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.750
 that are not coordinated by ovum in 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.320
 next I wanted to leave nothing else are 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.900
 doing that waiting and with the return 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.360
 causes the opposing team justly 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.300
 is what they are revealing more or 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.430
 they are giving better battle I the truth 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.840
 is that it is not for so much 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:19.660
 be waiting until you respect your 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:25.510
 deaths 19 much throw her the blessed 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:31.380
 granada by the mind area in your store 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.380
 how intelligent because what a horrible 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.070
 but it does not matter I'm fine 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.810
 in it it can be good that I do not 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.750
 I want to stay there because I feel like I'm going 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.700
 to help them lock up the team 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.100
 contrary despite the fact that the other team 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.900
 he is already giving a better fighter or nothing 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.180
 I'd better go try to fight for others 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.820
 sides because the truth is I 'm not that 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.110
 type of player that you like to lock in 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.760
 the responsos the things the truth 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.490
 that team this kind of people know if 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.040
 they annoy do not be there it bothers to play 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.930
 against people with nothing and looking 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:16.800
 can not be provided that is that mocking 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:21.030
 but they came in the back and I think that 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.210
 he started dancing I can not even 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.210
 even 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:28.079
 to claim something that player is 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:29.629
 well that is being mocked because it is in 

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:33.719
 all right because the other team 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:36.239
 is more doing that or is it people who 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.709
 he gets bad for his way of playing 

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:39.749
 It is even that they are good, be it, tell me 

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:43.369
 how are they going to be good that are 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:48.469
 waiting to be in the retro wisps 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:48.469
 cropped do not want to leave the boom soto 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:55.700
 with retro lance 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:59.060
 and the number is not a team that we say 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.100
 highlight by skill the way in which 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.570
 they act even worse is still that's what 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.280
 upset 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.310
 gianni that use certain weapons but that 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.050
 they are waiting we are approaching 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.820
 I think that at the end of this half game 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.370
 nothing else left 12 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.310
 because I believe that in the end they are going to 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.590
 be making fun of that kind of player already 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.200
 nothing got two can not kill it 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:25.020
 a young woman is already dead what they are going to 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:28.560
 start making fun of what is left I will see 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.170
 if I can get to see it, they are already 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.360
 running 

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:36.030
 there they are making fun of the rival of 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.460
 really bother this kind of people the 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.800
 chivas that I found on my computer like this 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.050
 but good with this already reached the end of 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.800
 this video that you think about that and we 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.800
 we see another time
