smart<00:03:55.280> truck<00:03:55.520> in<00:03:55.849> Homeland<00:03:56.180> Security<00:03:56.660> the

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
smart truck in Homeland Security the

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.660 
smart truck in Homeland Security the
smart<00:03:57.200> truck<00:03:57.410> can<00:03:57.590> be<00:03:57.620> up<00:03:58.069> fitted<00:03:58.489> with

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
smart truck can be up fitted with

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.150 
smart truck can be up fitted with
nuclear<00:03:59.270> biological<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.930> chemical

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
nuclear biological and chemical

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.650 
nuclear biological and chemical
detection<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.280> filtration<00:04:01.550> units<00:04:02.120> we<00:04:02.510> can

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
detection and filtration units we can

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.960 
detection and filtration units we can
also<00:04:02.810> filter<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.530> cab<00:04:03.769> air<00:04:04.130> so<00:04:04.700> that<00:04:04.849> the

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
also filter the cab air so that the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.430 
also filter the cab air so that the
occupants<00:04:05.090> inside<00:04:05.599> are<00:04:05.930> protected<00:04:06.410> from

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
occupants inside are protected from

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.589 
occupants inside are protected from
whatever<00:04:06.950> agent<00:04:07.459> may<00:04:07.550> be<00:04:07.580> out<00:04:07.790> there<00:04:08.030> these

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
whatever agent may be out there these

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.690 
whatever agent may be out there these
types<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.959> things<00:04:09.019> are<00:04:09.470> what<00:04:09.890> we<00:04:10.010> may<00:04:10.190> face<00:04:10.459> in

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
types of things are what we may face in

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.000 
types of things are what we may face in
the<00:04:10.880> coming<00:04:11.030> years<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:12.080> smart<00:04:12.500> truck<00:04:12.769> is

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
the coming years the smart truck is

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.009 
the coming years the smart truck is
packed<00:04:13.340> with<00:04:13.459> potential<00:04:14.209> but<00:04:14.630> don't<00:04:14.900> expect

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
packed with potential but don't expect

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.900 
packed with potential but don't expect
to<00:04:15.440> see<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.650> patrolling<00:04:16.100> your<00:04:16.370> neighborhood

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
to see a patrolling your neighborhood

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.690 
to see a patrolling your neighborhood
anytime<00:04:17.389> soon<00:04:17.829> as<00:04:18.829> thrilling<00:04:19.220> as<00:04:19.459> the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
anytime soon as thrilling as the

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.120 
anytime soon as thrilling as the
prototype<00:04:20.239> is<00:04:20.479> there<00:04:21.019> are<00:04:21.139> no<00:04:21.350> plans<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.979> move

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
prototype is there are no plans to move

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.340 
prototype is there are no plans to move
it<00:04:22.310> into<00:04:22.430> production<00:04:22.669> just<00:04:23.360> yet<00:04:23.600> we<00:04:24.169> may<00:04:24.320> not

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
it into production just yet we may not

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.730 
it into production just yet we may not
see<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.880> smart<00:04:26.270> truck<00:04:26.510> in<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.900> incarnation

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
see the smart truck in the incarnation

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.500 
see the smart truck in the incarnation
that's<00:04:27.889> in<00:04:28.040> now<00:04:28.190> but<00:04:28.490> bits<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:28.880> pieces<00:04:29.240> of<00:04:29.270> it

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
that's in now but bits and pieces of it

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.240 
that's in now but bits and pieces of it
will<00:04:29.660> probably<00:04:29.960> make<00:04:30.200> it<00:04:30.260> to<00:04:30.590> other<00:04:30.800> military

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
will probably make it to other military

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.090 
will probably make it to other military
programs<00:04:31.669> it's<00:04:32.030> in<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.389> conceptual<00:04:33.139> stage<00:04:33.500> so

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
programs it's in the conceptual stage so

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.300 
programs it's in the conceptual stage so
it's<00:04:34.250> not<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:35.150> smart<00:04:35.540> as<00:04:35.810> of<00:04:36.380> yet<00:04:36.650> but<00:04:36.860> we're

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
it's not so smart as of yet but we're

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.490 
it's not so smart as of yet but we're
working
