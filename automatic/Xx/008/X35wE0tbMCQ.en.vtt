Wisconsin receivers and try to rear out
them<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:30.939> mean<00:01:31.240> they<00:01:31.329> just<00:01:31.359> walked<00:01:31.780> down<00:01:32.020> this

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
them I mean they just walked down this

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.500 
them I mean they just walked down this
with<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:32.979> clock<00:01:33.250> now

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.430 

I'm<00:01:38.080> not<00:01:38.320> sure<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:39.130> got<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.490> off<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:40.440> think

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
I'm not sure that it got it off I think

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.500 
I'm not sure that it got it off I think
is<00:01:41.530> going<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.770> be<00:01:41.890> really<00:01:42.160> close<00:01:42.520> i<00:01:42.760> listened

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
is going to be really close i listened

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.480 
is going to be really close i listened
two<00:01:43.690> seconds<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.230> a<00:01:44.350> big<00:01:44.590> gamble<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:45.220> attention

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
two seconds is a big gamble to attention

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.790 
two seconds is a big gamble to attention
i<00:01:46.120> just<00:01:46.450> i<00:01:46.630> assumed<00:01:46.960> he's<00:01:47.080> going<00:01:47.230> to<00:01:47.290> spike<00:01:47.770> it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
i just i assumed he's going to spike it

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.110 
i just i assumed he's going to spike it
because<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.370> alignment<00:01:48.850> of<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.940> wide

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
because of the alignment of the wide

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.240 
because of the alignment of the wide
receivers<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:50.500> doesn't<00:01:50.830> look<00:01:50.890> like<00:01:50.950> an
