00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 and talk to everyone in peace today you do not 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.020
 for you here as you have recorded games 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.540
 of xbox 360 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.700
 in my last video-lesson you who 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.389
 people got it today and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.550
 dug by ibge bath in case we 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.140
 will record by cd clone 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.750
 first of all we 'll do 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.050
 Then you have downloaded the game, right? 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.000
 returning to the game and after 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.750
 distract or need if these two 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.650
 images 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.070
 so in case you will never record ac 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.130
 milan 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.510
 the iso file and will never record the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.180
 file this because that goes from there I 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.660
 I always saw the dvd because he who goes 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.870
 to record this image that will 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.219
 help to play the game in xbox 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.620
 so if we delete it, I ask why 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.530
 Is it because we paid, right? 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 you paid more because by the time I 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.000
 can protect 3 60 he will create a 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.520
 another image because there you go 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.119
 confuse the time the image is with the image 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.710
 so to get a sense if it's already paid 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 To that I do not have much confidence for 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.549
 Cause I do not know if this game is true. 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.920
 this game I was afraid then ever 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.369
 Let's see in the bible of 360 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.680
 in my case this game here is 2.0 and it's me 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.810
 I'll move on to 3.0 you're practically the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:31.920
 almost the same thing a validity of 60 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:34.079
 he does what he does the rest of the game I 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
 said you have downloaded a game from 3.0 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.780
 You have to go there because 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.950
 if you play soon on the clone cd it goes from there 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:48.990
 if it has 99% of recording and 1% does not then this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:55.860
 1% is drastic and that's how I give that name 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:59.670
 Finally, in the case that surgery is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.490
 expensive then we have to prove then to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 good people and save money and knew 300 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.429
 it helps us a lot then if so 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.780
 As you enter when you are not 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.900
 configured you set up a thousand goal 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.900
 here o 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.130
 here in the month and stirs up nothing you leave 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.980
 who will probably be here at two 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.340
 times leaving 3 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.790
 here we will stay here more often 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.300
 button right here on this people button 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.830
 Portuguese is not Portuguese and that 's it 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.630
 will have finally will be here have 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.140
 But the boot is right here. 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.300
 After that you see, it saves beauty. 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.360
 go there and only in the case of the monsanto that I 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.980
 I have mine here already saved in case 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.980
 we are looking for iso 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.360
 then soon xvii when needed 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.360
 it will create what another image 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.910
 then homemade was a diagnosis of the game 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.330
 asked for this game has no error 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:14.790
 he retired here and you can see that 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:17.070
 The percentage he 's in is daylight. 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.800
 is checking is a game to see if 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.430
 do not have any errors 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:29.850
 all the achievements is here too, right? 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:32.610
 shows that there is play a strawberry jackpot 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:38.910
 in but it's fast in the very fashion world 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:41.640
 new environment 300 each type makes a 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.780
 process all come has another way 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.290
 also ne 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:50.090
 but once has 300 and does the process 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.440
 so it's easier for you to apply 3.0 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.620
 then you too how to download 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.800
 xbox 360 games on my next 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:06.560
 videotape I do this by checking 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.560
 It takes a little bit longer but still 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.219
 here you leave open such a never date 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.660
 This always leaves you open. 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:22.060
 If you close this one, you will too. 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.580
 close it up , then close it 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.550
 and it will close this game has a 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.740
 correct and incorrect attack verification 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.060
 successfully, right? 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:38.320
 if you notice any key enter a 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.210
 car then we have to check there 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.410
 There was no mistake in the game. 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.300
 huh 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.460
 we closed here closed now 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:54.970
 we open and flowers ideli is a version this 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:59.410
 here is is free it is 21 days right 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.690
 it is paid in the trial version after 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.630
 be afraid it is important for you here 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.680
 being open has never done this here is the 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:16.620
 People come here to record pictures. 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:16.620
 find ours this is what the next 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:36.680
 I do not know how I go, it also increases 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:39.439
 people I'm going to put here that's the 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.560
 I'm sorry, I'm putting my order here. 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:45.020
 4.7 just to show you just 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.379
 because there is one has an option there in the 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.159
 The end that went wrong here, my God. 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.800
 from the sky 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:54.279
 is an option there that will have two options 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.279
 huh 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:06.650
 now here then in case at the time that 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.349
 You go first, you have to put the 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.039
 duty of 8.5 giga right for you can 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:16.729
 record italy having appeared 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:19.339
 there until they business there you always 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.330
 leaves the cni on purpose for the game he 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.339
 it's gonna take a while 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.110
 who enters a version here also that 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:26.120
 Go fast but I'd rather leave it here. 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.339
 because it will take time and it will 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:33.319
 to analyze his father today he will what kind goes 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:35.270
 So record it by part 1. 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:38.150
 the game does not stop 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.969
 then in the case after put the dvd and 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.560
 when he asked for it then we 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:48.699
 come here on dvd 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.699
 We give what in the case 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.449
 then he will ask for these two options 

00:06:55.339 --> 00:07:03.469
 This is the only option he will record until 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:06.589
 the end of it is as far as the disk goes 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:08.930
 where you have a disk but in case you do not 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:11.330
 new a house option because it will give error 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.080
 even if the game is not correctly 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:18.020
 have any is like having 60 do not boot this 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.199
 option because it will give I always leaves 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.180
 in this option here because this option you 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:26.779
 will be able to record the game quietly 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.750
 even if the game is 8.14 gigs better than 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:31.399
 that the DVD you will be able to record like this 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:37.190
 correctly 

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:40.820
 I will not record with 4.7 say 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.170
 in any case it was only so it's small 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.450
 video lesson 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:49.060
 I hope you enjoyed it was disclosed 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.060
