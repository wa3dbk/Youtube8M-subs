you know you can really improve your
driving<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.050> lot<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.289> amazing<00:00:46.589> also<00:00:46.710> how<00:00:46.980> much

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
driving a lot it's amazing also how much

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430 
driving a lot it's amazing also how much
further<00:00:48.359> ahead<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.690> makes<00:00:48.839> you<00:00:48.929> look<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.379> how

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
further ahead it makes you look and how

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.709 
further ahead it makes you look and how
much<00:00:49.760> higher<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.999> makes<00:00:51.179> you<00:00:51.269> maintain<00:00:51.569> your

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
much higher it makes you maintain your

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.719 
much higher it makes you maintain your
vision<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.260> looking<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:53.100> something

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
vision and I was looking up at something

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.069 
vision and I was looking up at something
that<00:00:53.969> distance<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.420> opposed<00:00:54.659> to<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:54.839> kind<00:00:54.929> of

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
that distance as opposed to just kind of

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.709 
that distance as opposed to just kind of
your<00:00:55.260> eyes<00:00:55.350> dropping<00:00:56.339> and<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.569> not

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
your eyes dropping and you know not

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.719 
your eyes dropping and you know not
scanning<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.199> far<00:00:58.379> ahead

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
scanning that far ahead

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.889 
scanning that far ahead
and<00:00:59.729> so<00:00:59.969> I<00:00:59.999> think<00:01:00.089> it's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.479> useful<00:01:00.659> tool

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and so I think it's a really useful tool

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.149 
and so I think it's a really useful tool

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
form which still is in the video so you

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.720 
form which still is in the video so you
know<00:01:29.280> when<00:01:29.370> you're<00:01:29.490> actually<00:01:29.580> doing

when we talk out loud and we're driving

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.260 
when we talk out loud and we're driving

what<00:01:42.900> we<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.340> what<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.460> can't<00:01:44.730> see<00:01:45.000> but

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
what we can see what we can't see but

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270 
what we can see what we can't see but
reasonably<00:01:45.660> can<00:01:45.810> expect<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.230> happen<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:46.740> then

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
reasonably can expect to happen and then

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
reasonably can expect to happen and then
finally<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:47.730> we're<00:01:47.820> planning<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.270> about

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
finally what we're planning to do about

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.740 
finally what we're planning to do about
it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.320 
it
and<00:01:48.980> it's<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.130> dynamic<00:01:50.370> plan<00:01:50.760> it's<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.150> I

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
and it's the dynamic plan it's not I

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.300 
and it's the dynamic plan it's not I
mean<00:01:51.390> obviously<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.290> luck<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.010> it<00:01:53.160> really

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
mean obviously if to luck to it really

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.680 
mean obviously if to luck to it really
there's<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.850> couple<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.150> key<00:01:54.270> things<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.600> you

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
there's a couple of key things that you

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.970 
there's a couple of key things that you
want<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.020> when<00:01:55.230> you're<00:01:55.290> driving<00:01:55.620> along<00:01:55.710> and

fixated<00:01:59.370> on<00:01:59.550> any<00:01:59.700> particular<00:01:59.820> hazard<00:02:00.300> just<00:02:00.570> as

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
fixated on any particular hazard just as

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.520 
fixated on any particular hazard just as
you<00:02:00.780> wouldn't<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.140> you're<00:02:01.260> driving<00:02:01.470> on

whatever do know you wouldn't have eyes
just<00:02:02.790> gaze<00:02:03.330> at<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> hazard<00:02:03.900> to<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> detriment

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
just gaze at a hazard to the detriment

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.410 
just gaze at a hazard to the detriment
of<00:02:04.650> an<00:02:04.770> area<00:02:04.980> has<00:02:05.130> done<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> road<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.790> costly

talk about what you're planning to do at
the<00:02:35.920> mall<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.670> talk<00:02:36.910> about<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.120> ones<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.360> are

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
the mall is talk about the ones that are

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.030 
the mall is talk about the ones that are
most<00:02:37.510> important<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.140> generally<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> most

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
most important and generally the most

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.080 
most important and generally the most
important<00:02:39.490> hazards<00:02:39.760> are<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.940> most

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
important hazards are the most

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.080 
important hazards are the most
vulnerable<00:02:40.300> road<00:02:40.690> users<00:02:40.840> for<00:02:41.740> example

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
vulnerable road users for example

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.000 
vulnerable road users for example
pedestrians<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.420> cyclists<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.860> most

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
pedestrians and cyclists and the most

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.170 
pedestrians and cyclists and the most
vulnerable<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.490> those<00:02:45.670> are<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.940> ones<00:02:46.120> that

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
vulnerable of those are the ones that

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.120 
vulnerable of those are the ones that
look<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.630> concept<00:02:46.930> developed<00:02:47.710> if<00:02:47.830> you

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
look like the concept developed if you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.070 
look like the concept developed if you
have<00:02:48.250> any<00:02:48.370> reason<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:49.420> know<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.960> might

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
have any reason you know that you might

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.260 
have any reason you know that you might
come<00:02:50.470> into<00:02:50.590> conflict<00:02:50.830> with<00:02:51.070> them<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:52.090> that's

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
come into conflict with them so that's

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.460 
come into conflict with them so that's
that's<00:02:52.540> your<00:02:52.660> priority<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.080> then<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.290> can

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
that's your priority and then you can

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.620 
that's your priority and then you can
you<00:02:53.860> know<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.910> generally<00:02:55.270> what<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.450> find
