of them and it's due to us also as far

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.460 
of them and it's due to us also as far
as<00:02:46.700> some<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.120> some<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.959> struggles<00:02:48.200> we've

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
as some of some of the struggles we've

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.900 
as some of some of the struggles we've
had<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:50.440> know<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:52.130> thought<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.519> second

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
had so you know and I thought the second

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.339 
had so you know and I thought the second
half<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.299> game<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.780> thought<00:02:54.140> we<00:02:54.260> were

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
half of the game I thought we were

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.979 
half of the game I thought we were
better<00:02:55.120> certainly<00:02:56.120> Hank<00:02:56.360> gave<00:02:56.569> us<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.720> chance

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
better certainly Hank gave us a chance

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.339 
better certainly Hank gave us a chance
in<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.260> first<00:02:57.440> half<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:59.599> second<00:03:00.019> half<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:00.260> the

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
in the first half the second half of the

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.600 
in the first half the second half of the
game<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.650> thought<00:03:00.829> we<00:03:00.920> were<00:03:00.980> much<00:03:01.160> better<00:03:01.370> as

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
game I thought we were much better as

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.140 
game I thought we were much better as
far<00:03:01.790> as<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.239> gaining<00:03:02.599> some<00:03:02.930> territory<00:03:04.150> John

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
far as just gaining some territory John

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.940 
far as just gaining some territory John

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
who we are we know how we have to play

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.910 
who we are we know how we have to play
we're<00:04:00.200> trying<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.500> do<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.739> more

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
we're trying to do that more

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.039 
we're trying to do that more
consistently<00:04:01.519> and<00:04:01.790> that's<00:04:02.599> how<00:04:02.750> we'll<00:04:02.810> go

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
consistently and that's how we'll go

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.410 
consistently and that's how we'll go
about<00:04:03.230> its<00:04:03.410> no<00:04:03.590> secrets<00:04:03.980> just<00:04:04.519> how<00:04:05.060> much<00:04:05.209> do

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
about its no secrets just how much do

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.539 
about its no secrets just how much do
you<00:04:05.510> think<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.810> guys<00:04:05.989> really<00:04:06.440> feed<00:04:06.799> off<00:04:06.829> of

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
you think the guys really feed off of

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.670 
you think the guys really feed off of
lung<00:04:07.760> Chris<00:04:08.000> when<00:04:08.209> he<00:04:08.299> is<00:04:08.480> battling<00:04:09.199> like<00:04:09.500> the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
lung Chris when he is battling like the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.630 
lung Chris when he is battling like the
way<00:04:09.829> he<00:04:09.979> is<00:04:10.130> and

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
way he is and

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.610 
way he is and
seems<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.540> be<00:04:11.630> kind<00:04:11.780> of<00:04:11.900> locked<00:04:12.080> in<00:04:12.260> like<00:04:12.410> that

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
seems to be kind of locked in like that

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.860 
seems to be kind of locked in like that
well<00:04:12.950> it's<00:04:13.069> a<00:04:13.130> bit<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.490> personality<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.390> think

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
well it's a bit of a personality I think

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.789 
well it's a bit of a personality I think
Henrik<00:04:15.400> I've<00:04:16.400> always<00:04:16.640> said<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:16.940> about<00:04:17.120> him

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
Henrik I've always said that about him

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.819 
Henrik I've always said that about him
that's<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.920> bit<00:04:19.130> of<00:04:19.280> who<00:04:19.549> we<00:04:19.700> are<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.660> think

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
that's a bit of who we are and I think

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.890 
that's a bit of who we are and I think
Henrik<00:04:21.829> displays<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:22.610> how<00:04:23.000> how<00:04:23.390> he<00:04:23.450> does

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
Henrik displays that how how he does

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.790 
Henrik displays that how how he does

farm and we talked about in between

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.560 
farm and we talked about in between
periods<00:05:07.430> we<00:05:07.669> needed<00:05:08.000> him<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.120> be<00:05:08.240> better

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
periods we needed him to be better

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.409 
periods we needed him to be better
defensively<00:05:09.310> but<00:05:10.310> we<00:05:10.460> felt<00:05:10.700> he<00:05:10.820> had<00:05:10.850> a<00:05:10.970> best

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
defensively but we felt he had a best

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.140 
defensively but we felt he had a best
chance<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.840> score<00:05:12.020> goal<00:05:12.490> we<00:05:13.490> end<00:05:13.669> up<00:05:13.760> scoring<00:05:13.970> a

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
chance to score goal we end up scoring a

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.170 
chance to score goal we end up scoring a
couple<00:05:14.450> of<00:05:14.570> them<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:14.780> him<00:05:15.050> scoring<00:05:15.380> one<00:05:15.970> so<00:05:16.970> as

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
couple of them and him scoring one so as

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.240 
couple of them and him scoring one so as
we<00:05:17.570> continue<00:05:18.080> and<00:05:18.320> especially<00:05:18.830> when<00:05:19.130> the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
we continue and especially when the

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.860 
we continue and especially when the
season<00:05:19.669> starts<00:05:19.970> next<00:05:20.060> year<00:05:20.390> i<00:05:20.419> think<00:05:20.660> that's

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
season starts next year i think that's

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.040 
season starts next year i think that's
when<00:05:21.370> we'll<00:05:22.370> certainly<00:05:22.669> find<00:05:22.850> more<00:05:23.419> about<00:05:23.780> him

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
when we'll certainly find more about him

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.570 
when we'll certainly find more about him
but<00:05:24.200> it's<00:05:24.530> pretty<00:05:24.770> exciting<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.250> see<00:05:25.430> what

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
they responded too slow we were

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.219 
they responded too slow we were
lethargic<00:06:10.970> at<00:06:11.510> the<00:06:11.600> beginning<00:06:11.840> of<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:11.990> period

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
lethargic at the beginning of the period

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.850 
lethargic at the beginning of the period
we<00:06:12.560> were<00:06:12.650> too<00:06:12.919> slow<00:06:13.070> and<00:06:13.789> that<00:06:14.660> seemed<00:06:15.289> to<00:06:15.440> they

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
we were too slow and that seemed to they

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.290 
we were too slow and that seemed to they
seem<00:06:16.039> to<00:06:16.070> respond<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:16.700> it<00:06:16.850> well<00:06:17.060> I<00:06:17.090> don't<00:06:17.180> know

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300

if<00:06:17.390> they<00:06:17.479> respond<00:06:17.870> to<00:06:17.990> that<00:06:18.110> I<00:06:18.169> thought<00:06:18.440> we

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
if they respond to that I thought we

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.839 
if they respond to that I thought we
played<00:06:18.740> better<00:06:18.950> the<00:06:19.130> second<00:06:19.490> half<00:06:19.640> of<00:06:19.760> the

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
played better the second half of the

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.510 
played better the second half of the
period<00:06:20.180> but<00:06:20.919> we<00:06:21.919> were<00:06:22.039> going<00:06:22.160> to<00:06:22.220> get<00:06:22.340> hurt

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
period but we were going to get hurt

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.370 
period but we were going to get hurt
there

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
there

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.020 
there
we<00:06:23.440> were<00:06:23.800> gonna<00:06:23.890> get<00:06:24.070> scored<00:06:24.430> on<00:06:24.520> I<00:06:24.580> felt

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
we were gonna get scored on I felt

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.490 
we were gonna get scored on I felt
because<00:06:25.180> we<00:06:25.420> were<00:06:25.540> just<00:06:25.750> too<00:06:25.990> lackadaisical

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500
