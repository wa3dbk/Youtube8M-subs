00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
stance slightly compared to how I used

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.080 
stance slightly compared to how I used
to<00:00:20.880> squat<00:00:21.150> before<00:00:21.830> my<00:00:22.830> stance<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.760> slightly

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
to squat before my stance is slightly

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.990 
to squat before my stance is slightly
wider<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.930> time<00:00:25.279> giving<00:00:26.279> me<00:00:26.400> more<00:00:26.789> control

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
wider this time giving me more control

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.660 
wider this time giving me more control
on<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.510> knees<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.890> feeling<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.640> my

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
on my knees and really feeling it in my

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.479 
on my knees and really feeling it in my
posterior<00:00:30.210> chain<00:00:30.630> because<00:00:31.380> last<00:00:31.769> time<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.130> was

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
posterior chain because last time I was

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.420 
posterior chain because last time I was
quoting<00:00:32.759> kind<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.690> hip<00:00:34.140> width<00:00:34.590> apart<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
quoting kind of like hip width apart and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.799 
quoting kind of like hip width apart and
I<00:00:36.210> felt<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.600> more<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.020> my<00:00:37.050> lateral<00:00:37.860> quads

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
I felt it more on my lateral quads

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.569 
I felt it more on my lateral quads
that's<00:00:39.809> why<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> well-developed

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.500 

vastus<00:00:44.579> lateralis<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:46.050> my<00:00:46.320> quads<00:00:46.649> there

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
vastus lateralis on my quads there

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.459 
vastus lateralis on my quads there
because<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.230> way<00:00:49.379> i<00:00:49.410> was<00:00:50.930> standing<00:00:51.930> how<00:00:52.440> I

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
because of the way i was standing how I

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.119 
because of the way i was standing how I
had<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:53.070> stance<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> low<00:00:54.120> bar<00:00:54.360> squat<00:00:55.129> so

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
had my stance for the low bar squat so

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.680 
had my stance for the low bar squat so
really<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.120> slight<00:00:57.449> change<00:00:59.690> really

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
really this slight change really

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.630 
really this slight change really
improved<00:01:01.219> my<00:01:04.369> range<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.549> motion<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:07.640> also

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
improved my range of motion and also

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.490 
improved my range of motion and also
working<00:01:10.010> more<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.040> my<00:01:11.369> posterior<00:01:11.820> chain<00:01:12.500> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
working more on my posterior chain it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
working more on my posterior chain it
made<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> huge<00:01:13.890> difference<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:17.000> also<00:01:18.000> I
