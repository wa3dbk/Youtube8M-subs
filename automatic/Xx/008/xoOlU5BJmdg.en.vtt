am totally blown away by how amazing
this<00:00:31.679> thing<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:32.880> purchased<00:00:33.300> this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
this thing is so we purchased this

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.020 
this thing is so we purchased this
online<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.040> little<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:35.399> expensive<00:00:35.910> than

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
online it's a little more expensive than

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.760 
online it's a little more expensive than
some<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.420> other<00:00:36.600> ones<00:00:36.809> i<00:00:36.960> looked<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.590> i

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
some of the other ones i looked at but i

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
some of the other ones i looked at but i
really<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:39.000> way<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.270> everything<00:00:39.660> goes

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
really like the way that everything goes

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.959 
really like the way that everything goes
together<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.980> has<00:00:41.190> these<00:00:41.340> interlocking

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
together so it has these interlocking

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.430 
together so it has these interlocking
pieces<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.590> take<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.510> top<00:00:45.780> part<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.260> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
pieces so you take the top part of it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.760 
pieces so you take the top part of it
and<00:00:47.090> these<00:00:48.090> pieces<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:49.530> basically

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and these pieces here and they basically

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
and these pieces here and they basically
just<00:00:50.160> fit<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.629> hard<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.960> me<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.110> do

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
just fit in now it's hard for me to do

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.470 
just fit in now it's hard for me to do
this<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> camera<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.120> see

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this with the camera but you can see

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.580 
this with the camera but you can see
that<00:00:55.100> right<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:56.969> actually<00:00:57.590> walks

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
that right here this is actually walks

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.880 
that right here this is actually walks
in<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.370> then<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.940> hammer<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.539> down<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.260> so

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
in and then you hammer it down and so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.170 
in and then you hammer it down and so
what<00:01:02.039> you're<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> end<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.149> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
what you're going to end up with is a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.929 
what you're going to end up with is a
four-by-eight<00:01:03.780> bed<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.760> one

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
four-by-eight bed here you can see one

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
four-by-eight bed here you can see one
of<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> walls<00:01:06.299> i<00:01:06.479> put<00:01:06.659> together<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.650> laid

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
of the walls i put together so I laid

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.800 
of the walls i put together so I laid
this<00:01:08.250> whole<00:01:08.490> thing<00:01:08.790> out<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.689> we're

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
this whole thing out and then we're

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
this whole thing out and then we're
going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> move<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.729> move

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
going to move this I'm going to move

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.420 
going to move this I'm going to move
this<00:01:12.150> into<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.720> garden<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.350> measured<00:01:13.890> over

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this into the garden so I measured over

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
this into the garden so I measured over
there<00:01:14.880> I've<00:01:15.090> got<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> spot<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> then

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
there I've got a spot for this and then

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
there I've got a spot for this and then
we'll<00:01:16.650> fill<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.130> soil<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:18.479> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
we'll fill it with soil and what this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
we'll fill it with soil and what this
will<00:01:18.810> enable<00:01:19.049> me<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> raised

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
will enable me to do is have a raised

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940 
will enable me to do is have a raised
bed<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.600> area<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.409> want<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
bed in that area and if I want to I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.560 
bed in that area and if I want to I
think<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.610> easier<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.090> cover

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
think it's going to be easier to cover

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.289 
think it's going to be easier to cover
during<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.590> winter<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.970> I'm<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
during the winter so what I'm going to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.240 
during the winter so what I'm going to
try<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.960> use<00:01:28.259> some<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.650> row<00:01:28.950> cover

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
try to do is use some of this row cover

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.789 
try to do is use some of this row cover
here<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> row<00:01:31.350> cover<00:01:31.619> I've

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
here so you can see the row cover I've

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.520 
here so you can see the row cover I've
got<00:01:32.009> right<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.220> we'll<00:01:33.210> use<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.509> will<00:01:34.409> be

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
got right here we'll use that will be

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.960 
got right here we'll use that will be
able<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.770> cover<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> I'll<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> able<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
able to cover this and I'll be able to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.670 
able to cover this and I'll be able to
grow<00:01:36.119> my<00:01:36.299> vegetables<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:36.930> bit<00:01:37.350> later
