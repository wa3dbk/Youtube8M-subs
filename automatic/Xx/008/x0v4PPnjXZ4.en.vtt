00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.780

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.190
 after when it's done you do 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.490
 next online mode 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.310
 if you click disable you 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.959

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.030
 can go on your server so 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.940
 after the record of the facilities of the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.060

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.430
 put on the desktop for example 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.420
 which returns here 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.160
 after 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.250
 you click on create a new 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.790
 folder you but notice servers and 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.980
 after you get inside hockey crest 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.650
 after you done so so me like 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.860
 I already have the server I will not 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:29.360
 do it so afterwards you're going to have 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:35.459
 that you click it 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.819
 sorry you click on run so there he 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.819
 starts 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.070
 here 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.900
 in the meantime you go on minecraft 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:58.939
 you go into multiplayer you have to 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.870
 have version 1.4.1 that of forgetting 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.920
 of the aude is so if you have not 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.780
 so as it is the latest version 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.000
 this is the latest version of minecraft 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.519
 logically so if you do not have it you 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.140
 download minecraft challenger version 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.739
 so I'm going to put the link in the 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.870
 description 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:26.720
 to download it so here is 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.840
 after you go in multiplayer jets 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.110
 private 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.620
 so here after so when you are 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.650
 sure multiplayer normally there is nothing 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.690
 you're going to add a server you 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.790
 marquiez the server name any 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:51.920
 what server address you put 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:57.400
 lippé you entered on logmein 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:05:01.210
 Amaechi equity and you validate 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.380
 so there it is good the server is active 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.930
 so here you are you click on it 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.930
 makes you join two servers 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.770
 it is 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.250
 so that's when this weak is very 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.130
 well you can play minecraft in 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.560
 multiplayer and I must admit that it takes 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.449
 that your friends playing on your 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.900
 server and the same version as you 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:37.130
 otherwise it did not work 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:41.120
 so here speaking of servers I 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:46.720
 created a forum called the 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:50.180
 minecraft hours so that's it for 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.849
 for you to play on a 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.430
 server other than the other and that's it 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:06:02.780
 I created a forum like you 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:07.159
 have me you simply have you 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:11.330
 save I like to be the link in them 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:17.569
 descriptions here 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:21.289
 nothing more simple and after yes play 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:24.219

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.219
 presentation of the forum 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:30.129
 after a day 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:41.620
 here you go in the ip and and the word 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:45.700
 server password and that's it 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:50.320
 will be marked here so I think I have 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:55.570
 everything says and I still hope this 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.790
 video you liked and we find ourselves very 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:03.340

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:08.860

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:10.330
 first time the ad to ask my 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:15.060
