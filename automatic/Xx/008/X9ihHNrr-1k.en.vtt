website at least at the time I haven't

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.610 
website at least at the time I haven't
checked<00:00:56.089> it<00:00:56.179> now<00:00:56.359> stays<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.230> it's<00:00:57.350> gentle

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
checked it now stays that it's gentle

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.049

enough<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:58.129> be<00:00:58.249> used<00:00:58.489> for<00:00:58.730> use<00:00:59.510> twice<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.899> day<00:01:00.199> so

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
enough to be used for use twice a day so

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.489 
enough to be used for use twice a day so
it<00:01:02.059> says<00:01:02.359> that<00:01:02.390> right<00:01:02.569> there<00:01:02.929> something<00:01:03.379> that

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.499

it says that right there something that
I<00:01:03.530> think<00:01:03.769> is<00:01:03.890> very<00:01:04.070> very<00:01:04.370> important<00:01:04.970> to

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
I think is very very important to

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.030 
I think is very very important to
mention<00:01:05.840> about<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.320> Clarisonic<00:01:06.800> because

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
mention about the Clarisonic because

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.590 
mention about the Clarisonic because
berry<00:01:07.310> might<00:01:07.490> have<00:01:07.610> had<00:01:07.760> amazing<00:01:07.880> results<00:01:08.540> for

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
berry might have had amazing results for

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.240 
berry might have had amazing results for
two<00:01:08.870> years<00:01:09.170> with<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.530> sensitive<00:01:09.890> hair<00:01:10.040> brush

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
so to me there was no doubt that it was

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.870 
so to me there was no doubt that it was
the<00:01:12.650> brush<00:01:12.890> that<00:01:13.130> irritated<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.940> skin

conversation back and forth briefly with

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.620 
conversation back and forth briefly with
Clarisonic<00:01:30.950> on<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:31.219> subject<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.789> they<00:01:32.360> say

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
Clarisonic on this subject and they say

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.039 
Clarisonic on this subject and they say
that<00:01:32.979> there<00:01:33.979> is<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.159> sort<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:35.119> byproduct<00:01:35.570> of

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
that there is a sort of a byproduct of

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.929 
that there is a sort of a byproduct of
exfoliation<00:01:36.590> but<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.009> only<00:01:37.189> a<00:01:37.399> very<00:01:37.640> small

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
exfoliation but it's only a very small

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.740 
exfoliation but it's only a very small
bit<00:01:38.149> so<00:01:38.719> still<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:41.270> brush<00:01:41.450> itself

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
bit so still the the the brush itself

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.810 
bit so still the the the brush itself
does<00:01:41.990> not<00:01:42.229> really<00:01:42.560> exfoliate<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.520> least

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
does not really exfoliate and least

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.609 
does not really exfoliate and least
according<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.450> Clarisonic<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:45.200> what<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.469> does

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
according to Clarisonic and what it does

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.920 
according to Clarisonic and what it does
exfoliate<00:01:46.159> is<00:01:46.340> secondary<00:01:47.149> to<00:01:47.299> cleansing<00:01:47.810> and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
exfoliate is secondary to cleansing and

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.990 
exfoliate is secondary to cleansing and
it<00:01:48.109> isn't<00:01:48.439> that<00:01:48.619> great<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.369> in<00:01:49.520> terms<00:01:49.759> of<00:01:49.909> it

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
it isn't that great is it in terms of it

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.819 
it isn't that great is it in terms of it
doesn't<00:01:50.210> exploit<00:01:50.659> that<00:01:50.689> much<00:01:51.079> now<00:01:51.649> when<00:01:51.770> I

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
doesn't exploit that much now when I

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.410 
doesn't exploit that much now when I
first<00:01:52.100> started<00:01:52.399> using<00:01:52.520> Clarisonic<00:01:53.060> hose<00:01:53.149> wise

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.310 
reverted back to how it was when I was a
bit<00:05:27.220> younger<00:05:27.460> which<00:05:27.820> was<00:05:28.000> very<00:05:28.180> very<00:05:28.300> oily<00:05:28.690> so

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
bit younger which was very very oily so

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.350 
bit younger which was very very oily so
I've<00:05:29.380> always<00:05:29.530> had<00:05:29.620> very<00:05:29.740> oily<00:05:30.070> skin<00:05:30.490> but<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.210> me

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
I've always had very oily skin but to me

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.060 
I've always had very oily skin but to me
I<00:05:31.389> think<00:05:31.599> dealing<00:05:32.380> with<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.650> breakers

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
I think dealing with the breakers

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.350 
I think dealing with the breakers
because<00:05:33.159> they<00:05:33.340> were<00:05:33.460> so<00:05:33.699> bothersome<00:05:34.180> I've

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
because they were so bothersome I've

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.820 
because they were so bothersome I've
gone<00:05:34.659> through<00:05:34.930> this<00:05:35.080> happen<00:05:35.409> phase<00:05:35.590> before

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
gone through this happen phase before

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.469 
gone through this happen phase before
when<00:05:36.070> I<00:05:36.099> hated<00:05:36.400> it<00:05:36.669> didn't<00:05:37.180> want<00:05:37.330> to<00:05:37.389> go

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
when I hated it didn't want to go

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:38.879 
when I hated it didn't want to go
through<00:05:37.690> it<00:05:37.780> again<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:38.139> fact<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.440> my<00:05:38.650> the
