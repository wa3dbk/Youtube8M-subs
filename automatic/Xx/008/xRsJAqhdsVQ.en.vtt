a cactus made by Marc these are three
different<00:03:59.430> cactus<00:04:00.120> textures<00:04:00.629> they<00:04:01.139> may<00:04:01.409> be

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
different cactus textures they may be

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.500 
different cactus textures they may be
the<00:04:01.769> same<00:04:02.010> but<00:04:02.549> from<00:04:02.699> what<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:02.849> was<00:04:03.030> told<00:04:03.090> and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the same but from what I was told and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.180 
the same but from what I was told and
formed<00:04:03.870> they<00:04:03.959> are<00:04:04.079> slightly<00:04:04.440> different<00:04:04.769> and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
formed they are slightly different and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.069 
formed they are slightly different and
you<00:04:05.849> know<00:04:05.940> they're<00:04:06.359> all<00:04:06.449> similar<00:04:06.659> though<00:04:06.870> they

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
you know they're all similar though they

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.990 
you know they're all similar though they
work<00:04:07.229> basically<00:04:07.379> the<00:04:07.680> same<00:04:07.769> way<00:04:07.979> over<00:04:08.370> here

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
work basically the same way over here

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.430 
work basically the same way over here
we've<00:04:09.120> got<00:04:09.209> different<00:04:09.329> bookshelf's<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.199> each

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
we've got different bookshelf's and each

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.430 
we've got different bookshelf's and each
bookshelf<00:04:11.069> side<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.959> textured<00:04:12.959> differently

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
bookshelf side is textured differently

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.319 
bookshelf side is textured differently
so<00:04:13.620> be<00:04:13.739> able<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:13.949> place<00:04:14.129> those<00:04:14.400> as<00:04:14.579> normal<00:04:14.940> you

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
so be able to place those as normal you

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.210 
so be able to place those as normal you
may<00:04:15.479> have<00:04:15.569> seen<00:04:15.750> these<00:04:15.930> on<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.199> few<00:04:16.500> servers<00:04:16.799> and

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
may have seen these on a few servers and

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.460 
may have seen these on a few servers and
these<00:04:17.729> are<00:04:17.880> also<00:04:18.030> made<00:04:18.239> by<00:04:18.419> mark<00:04:18.840> IRL<00:04:19.320> of

and down arrows now you'll be able to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.600 
and down arrows now you'll be able to
use<00:04:26.610> those<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.909> direct

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
use those to direct

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.339 
use those to direct
perhaps<00:04:27.819> when<00:04:28.389> making<00:04:28.569> an<00:04:28.750> adventure<00:04:29.020> map<00:04:29.199> now

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
right here and a little question box

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.510 
right here and a little question box
maybe<00:04:47.080> for<00:04:47.439> a<00:04:47.469> Mario<00:04:47.860> adventure<00:04:48.219> map<00:04:48.400> or

something

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.149 
something
now<00:04:49.629> finally<00:04:50.169> some<00:04:50.409> of<00:04:50.439> these<00:04:50.560> ones<00:04:50.800> right

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
now finally some of these ones right

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.679 
now finally some of these ones right
over<00:04:51.310> here<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:51.759> I<00:04:51.819> thought<00:04:51.969> these<00:04:52.150> were<00:04:52.330> super

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 
over here and I thought these were super

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.360 
over here and I thought these were super
cool<00:04:52.840> as<00:04:52.990> well<00:04:53.169> as<00:04:53.229> little<00:04:53.469> tnt's<00:04:53.949> and<00:04:54.250> there's

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
cool as well as little tnt's and there's

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.760 
cool as well as little tnt's and there's
two<00:04:54.550> different<00:04:54.580> textures<00:04:55.180> for<00:04:55.449> TNT<00:04:55.719> one<00:04:56.650> is

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
two different textures for TNT one is

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.520 
two different textures for TNT one is
just<00:04:56.949> a<00:04:57.039> smaller<00:04:57.460> version<00:04:57.789> of<00:04:58.090> TNT<00:04:58.509> and<00:04:58.810> one

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
just a smaller version of TNT and one

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.499 
just a smaller version of TNT and one
actually<00:04:59.889> just<00:05:00.069> says<00:05:00.279> TNT<00:05:00.819> going<00:05:01.150> around<00:05:01.360> both

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
actually just says TNT going around both

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.170 
actually just says TNT going around both
