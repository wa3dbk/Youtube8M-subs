it in here the reader will put it in and

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.660 
it in here the reader will put it in and
then<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.349> you're<00:02:23.709> able<00:02:23.859> to<00:02:24.040> see<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.459> words

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
go um you have this little um thing and

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.880 
go um you have this little um thing and
you<00:02:33.760> put<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.090> right<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.959> flip<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.409> over<00:02:35.560> and

you put it right you flip it over and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.890 
you put it right you flip it over and
then<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:37.030> start<00:02:37.209> scanning<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.810> you'll

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
then you just start scanning and you'll

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.750 
then you just start scanning and you'll
be<00:02:38.049> like<00:02:38.200> place<00:02:38.560> setting<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.430> it'll<00:02:39.700> just

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
be like place setting and it'll just

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.300 
be like place setting and it'll just
randomly<00:02:40.269> start<00:02:40.599> like<00:02:40.900> out<00:02:41.230> bursting<00:02:41.980> words

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
randomly start like out bursting words

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.610 
randomly start like out bursting words
and<00:02:42.730> if<00:02:42.909> they<00:02:43.180> get<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.629> word<00:02:43.900> that's<00:02:44.139> on<00:02:44.349> here

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
and if they get a word that's on here

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.160 
and if they get a word that's on here
that<00:02:44.799> has<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.189> do<00:02:45.310> with<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.639> topic<00:02:45.970> let's<00:02:46.900> say

then if if they get all the words and
the<00:03:03.250> amount<00:03:03.579> of<00:03:03.700> time<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.299> it<00:03:04.560> runs<00:03:05.560> out<00:03:05.859> then

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
the amount of time that it runs out then

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.849 
the amount of time that it runs out then
they<00:03:06.730> win<00:03:06.939> the<00:03:07.090> game<00:03:07.120> um<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.349> if<00:03:08.409> they<00:03:08.590> don't

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859
