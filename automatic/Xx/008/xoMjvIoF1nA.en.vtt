so there's no way of making this system

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.180 
so there's no way of making this system
just<00:01:01.120> we<00:01:01.600> have<00:01:01.720> to<00:01:01.839> make<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.019> system<00:01:02.589> that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
just we have to make a system that

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.369 
just we have to make a system that
assures<00:01:03.519> human<00:01:04.479> rights<00:01:04.720> you<00:01:04.960> know<00:01:04.989> when
