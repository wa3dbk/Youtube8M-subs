00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.160
 hello youtube are welcome in this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.910
 brand new video that the latest video of the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.070
 2013 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.359
 sadly hypercube emin will come back in 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.910
 2014 or simply Wednesday e 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.070
 among other things, the Wednesday video will be 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.740
 the video of January 1st will therefore be 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.679
 a video in special but from fucka edition 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.809
 New Year's Eve of January 1st 2014 e 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.140
 we'll see what it turns out maybe 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.329
 something a little bit special in each 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.489
 chance this is how where when this 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.590
 means that I analyze the weapon that you 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.719
 you voted more on the first three 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.730
 comments of the post that I insert on the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.680
 facebook fan page and party gaming that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.620
 however, I invite you to follow 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.480
 go and talk about it because it's a good one 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.149
 way to interact action to decide 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.359
 the fate of these videos then in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.670
 this like where when we talk about ace 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.129
 52c cubes and a rifle and it is one 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.830
 very special carbine because she reads 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.290
 to one of the three strongest three weapons 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.939
 of the game is a weapon that is used in each 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.010
 situation 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.750
 First we classify a moment 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.430
 carbines because maybe not all of you 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.720
 you are passionate about weapons sincerely 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.820
 I don't even know if not in 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.400
 video games the rifles are if vision 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.860
 assault rifles to which a sympathetic 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.530
 wanker blacksmith takes with a handsome 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.579
 flexible and shortens the cane in fact 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.979
 they are gods in assault rifles 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.110
 substantially modified come 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.540
 shortened to be more effective in 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.030
 more effective not pertini in the cross 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.020
 quarter combat then in situations of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.240
 close range but in fact the 52 yes cubes e 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.979
 a bit out of the normal, in fact, it is equipped 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.470
 of a bigger caliber I think is a 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.770
 born 7.62 or something similar 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.450
 because it does more harm is this here 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.040
 we finally enter the field of 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.600
 videogames that surely interests us 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.280
 more indeed it does an initial damage of 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.030
 34 that I remind you with the multiplier 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.740
 head on he could become well 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.300
 68 so it means that in the cross range 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.980
 a burst called head kills the enemy 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.740
 yes you have understood with two strokes you can 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.080
 kill an enemy bastard in 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.580
 battlefield 4 clearly being one 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.980
 carbine within popstar rather you 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.080
 in fact, we are talking about 8 meters 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.700
 and from 8 meters onwards you will start a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.560
 descend with a fairly gentle curve 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.620
 up to 20 that minimum damage than this 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.260
 weapon does therefore also with a distance 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.790
 sidereal or iron and steel that I would like 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.170
 prefer because it goes to that kind of 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.110
 precision to shoot at those distances 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.820
 let's say around 50 meters with 5 shots 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.950
 however you will kill an enemy 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.400
 a weapon that has a little radius 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.550
 rather low that it is placed in the two 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.340
 lower than the carbine weapons that it is of 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.290
 650 rounds per minute bullet of 400 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.600
 meters per second as speed that is not 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.730
 exactly a supersonic speed 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.110
 but it allows us to do what 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.630
 we have to come across where it was 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.120
 roll out the glasses shit and in each 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.340
 case the only defect of this weapon is that 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.520
 has 26 shots inside the charger 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.520
 but also a recharge time rather 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.280
 honest than 2.2 seconds with charger 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.010
 half-empty and with 31 seconds for how much 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.780
 regards the complete animation this 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.940
 it means that this weapon is competing 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.860
 directly with the ska racca that 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.090
 it simply becomes a little more effective 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.980
 over long distances because it has a 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.350
 tropop start slightly more displaced 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.090
 therefore the damage of the bullet begins to 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.070
 descend a little further as far as 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.950
 it's about skal h but in fact 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.560
 that weapon has recharge times 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.480
 slightly different to a charger 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.310
 slightly different and in any case can 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.610
 be used to guess in situations 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.500
 different than the 52 cqb are 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.360
 both excellent weapons with the class a 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.590
 hi I would go on the download and with 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.440
 all other memory classes that 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.420
 you can use the 52 as and in the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.810
 carbine class that is open to all e 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.850
 that own class that has no restraint 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.160
 and so it gets used by everyone 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.040
 free in any case apart from 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.950
 bullshit this weapon is fantastic and 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.350
 I take this opportunity to point out to you that 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.310
 I'm playing in golmud railway that one 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.470
 fantastic map regarding the 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.299
 promiscuity of the gaming activity 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.639
 in fact you can find people at a 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.200
 centimeter as to 100 meters 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.960
 if for example you are for a moment on 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.910
 roof of a building and this weapon is 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.130
 perfect if you were to use a rifle 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.300
 in these situations there is no carbine 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.720
 to keep up with the 52 cqb you say 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.190
 cubes knows little in the sense that it is a weapon 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.900
 that works great even on 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.190
 long distances low rate of fire 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.660
 therefore checking a little ridiculous 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.210
 you will be able to send without problems 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.250
 almost all clear target shots a 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.530
 26 shots then dosed a little bit 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.770
 because there will be 5 10 less 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.669
 compared to the other rifles and therefore 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.760
 not too bad 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.310
 as for the recoil we are 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.930
 10.45 vertical and 10 point 20 5 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.090
 horizontal all this is yes 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.400
 simply translates into a big one 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.200
 vertical recoil this gold care with 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.510
 a mouth brake or else do as you do 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.700
 just keep it from me 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.270
 all because you have neither bonus nor malus 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.190
 in using this but in regards to 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.930
 the viewfinders being a rifle 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.820
 I advise you to stay anyway 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.220
 inside the kroos range sights 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.680
 so i have a king doctor reflex who then is 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.169
 the same house or a cobra or a coyote 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.850
 in short those sights that practically 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.070
 you see in my videos it's not a case that 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.770
 you use them but it's because on assault rifles 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.110
 lmg to these things in four for it 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.000
 I see sincerely wasted because there 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.800
 takes away the lot of visibility when 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.490
 you are nick fire so you are not using 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.919
 the viewfinder with regard to accessory 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.900
 and grip a laser sight would not fit 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.760
 bad even if I sometimes avoid it 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.850
 simply to be identified a 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.620
 little less you can use for how much 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.360
 concerns a grip an angle grip for 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.400
 remove the recoil as usual 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.250
 first strike or in this case, being a matter of course 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.630
 of a rifle also a potato grip that 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.169
 it makes you get the rome up faster or 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.419
 otherwise a vertical grip or 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.430
 ergonomic or all those that help you 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.710
 surely they are to shoot in motion 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.600
 appreciated also because with a weapon a 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.370
 beating fire in the files you will have to 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.690
 to be really lightning for how long 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.160
 it's about reflexes so you don't 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.729
 fooling around with everyone they use 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.910
 and ke the 23 or otherwise the fa but su 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.800
 other similar weapons and I tell you already turn to 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.180
 that when you're not purely aiming 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.880
 with a viewfinder then right clicking 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.090
 and mouse or with the controller with the button 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.090
 which should be something like ltd 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.190
 done I advise you to shoot already with the 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.720
 crossair then the cross that you have at 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.780
 center of the screen at the height of the 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.610
 heads because this way you will be ready to 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.020
 let's fight all those knasters 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.700
 gifts that will go around with the famous 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.620
 and with her that they could therefore 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.510
 potentially skipping but if followed on 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.520
 my advice you will be to shock 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.200
 them maybe with a very stylish but ed 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.520
 shop which, among other things, finally not 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.280
 the feed is not even marked 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.740
 that sucks then closing on the 52 cqb 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.990
 I guarantee you that I use a weapon 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.380
 a lot on the genre for example has 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:14.230
 replaced any other type of pdv 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.810
 indeed I use almost only 52 c vb e 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.210
 maybe weapons with a little rat 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.250
 slightly higher like a 91 when 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.720
 I play a little more closely each case 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.910
 this is a formidable weapon also for 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.530
 the sap when you have to play in spaces a 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.750
 slightly narrower and you have no room for 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.940
 take you around a mass of ancient Lmg 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.400
 or in the sniper if you want to do a little more 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.980
 the aggressive tactics they give 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.510
 assistances dit ax and stuff similar to 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.400
 your faction we see ourselves in 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.330
 next video commented and voted if 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.330
 you want to sign up
