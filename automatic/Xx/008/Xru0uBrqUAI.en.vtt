00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
this case is actually a little bit

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.939 
this case is actually a little bit
different<00:00:15.120> from<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> others<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.650> class

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
different from the others in this class

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.320 
different from the others in this class
with<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> ones<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.240> are<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:18.600> but<00:00:20.150> for<00:00:21.150> some

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
with the ones that are here but for some

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.519 
with the ones that are here but for some
people<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.750> prove<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.260> little<00:00:22.439> bit

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
people that can prove to be a little bit

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.590 
people that can prove to be a little bit
better<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.430> top<00:00:23.670> here<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.269> kind<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
better see this top here it's kind of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.679 
better see this top here it's kind of
like<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.279> matte<00:00:26.279> finish<00:00:26.550> rubberized<00:00:27.449> plastic

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
like a matte finish rubberized plastic

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.230 
like a matte finish rubberized plastic
for<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.320> most<00:00:28.529> part<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:29.970> kind<00:00:30.179> of

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
for the most part in here it's kind of

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.319 
for the most part in here it's kind of
like<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.750> hard<00:00:31.260> plastic<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.910> me<00:00:33.059> there's

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
like a hard plastic so to me there's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.770 
like a hard plastic so to me there's
kind<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> different<00:00:34.110> contrast<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.780> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
kind of a different contrast but it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.500 
kind of a different contrast but it
works<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.309> thing<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.640> also<00:00:38.820> notice<00:00:39.329> when

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
works so one thing you also notice when

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.180 
works so one thing you also notice when
you<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:40.020> first<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.590> case<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.010> some

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you actually first get this case is some

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.459 
you actually first get this case is some
of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> other<00:00:41.430> ones<00:00:41.899> well<00:00:42.899> those<00:00:43.050> other<00:00:43.200> two

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
of the other ones well those other two

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.889 
of the other ones well those other two
cases<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.950> locks<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.360> one<00:00:45.600> pretty<00:00:45.780> much

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
cases have locks on this one pretty much

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.959 
cases have locks on this one pretty much
doesn't<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.829> at<00:00:46.980> any<00:00:47.129> time<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.550> fly<00:00:47.789> open

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
doesn't so at any time it can fly open

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.459 
doesn't so at any time it can fly open
but<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.500> hinge<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.039> pretty<00:00:50.340> hard<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.840> would

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
but the hinge is pretty hard so it would

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.270 
but the hinge is pretty hard so it would
be<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> little<00:00:52.800> bit<00:00:52.890> harder<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.480> and

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
be a little bit harder to do that and

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.619 
be a little bit harder to do that and
when<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.370> actually<00:00:56.520> first<00:00:56.940> open<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.480> up

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
when you actually first open it up

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.540 
when you actually first open it up
you'll<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.020> there's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> lift<00:00:58.620> tab<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you'll see that there's a lift tab that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.740 
you'll see that there's a lift tab that
that's<00:00:59.910> inside<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.870> my<00:01:01.620> Vita<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:02.420> if<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> put

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that's inside so my Vita end if you put

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509 
that's inside so my Vita end if you put
it<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> didn't<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it in and if you didn't have like a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520 
it in and if you didn't have like a
wrist<00:01:06.119> strap<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.409> actually

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
wrist strap like I do you can actually

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.679 
wrist strap like I do you can actually
pull<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.250> pull<00:01:08.520> tab<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.270> lift<00:01:09.540> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
pull this pull tab and you can lift it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.490 
pull this pull tab and you can lift it
up<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.439> that's<00:01:10.619> definitely<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.220> plus<00:01:12.350> one<00:01:13.350> thing

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
up so that's definitely a plus one thing

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.770 
up so that's definitely a plus one thing
I<00:01:13.590> didn't<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.330> could<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
I didn't like about it but could be a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
I didn't like about it but could be a
good<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.770> bad<00:01:16.799> foursome<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.240> this

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
good and a bad foursome is that this

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.990 
good and a bad foursome is that this
case<00:01:18.780> doesn't<00:01:19.560> go<00:01:19.650> up<00:01:19.799> past<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:22.850> for<00:01:23.850> some

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
case doesn't go up past here for some

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
case doesn't go up past here for some
people<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> could<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> minor<00:01:24.840> setback<00:01:25.200> but

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
people that could be a minor setback but

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.480 
people that could be a minor setback but
also<00:01:26.299> it<00:01:27.299> could<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.720> bonus<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
also it could be a bonus because the the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.719 
also it could be a bonus because the the
Vita<00:01:29.700> actually<00:01:30.270> kind<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.630> sits<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.729> sort

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
Vita actually kind of sits in here sort

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.210 
Vita actually kind of sits in here sort
of<00:01:32.850> angled<00:01:33.329> upwards<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.829> can't<00:01:35.040> see

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
of angled upwards you really can't see

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.399 
of angled upwards you really can't see
it<00:01:35.250> from<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> video<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it from the video but it's it's kind of

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.590 
it from the video but it's it's kind of
in<00:01:37.740> an<00:01:37.979> angle<00:01:38.340> upwards<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.090> let's<00:01:39.270> say<00:01:39.420> you're

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
in an angle upwards so let's say you're

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
in an angle upwards so let's say you're
playing<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> Sun<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.369> know<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> Sun

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
playing in the Sun and you know the Sun

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.420 
playing in the Sun and you know the Sun
is<00:01:41.909> facing<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.799> way<00:01:44.009> towards<00:01:44.340> your

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
is facing down this way towards your

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.940 
is facing down this way towards your
Vita<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:45.299> could<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.290> blocker<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
Vita this could actually be a blocker to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.770 
Vita this could actually be a blocker to
help<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.399> know<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:48.420> see

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
help you know so you can actually see

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.179 
help you know so you can actually see
because<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.500> when<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.710> Sun<00:01:49.979> hits

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
because we all know when the Sun hits

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.429 
because we all know when the Sun hits
these<00:01:50.369> screens<00:01:50.780> it's<00:01:51.780> pretty<00:01:52.049> hard<00:01:52.290> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
these screens it's pretty hard to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.319 
these screens it's pretty hard to
actually<00:01:52.619> see<00:01:52.890> anything<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.119> yeah<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.770> uh

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
actually see anything and yeah but uh

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.030 
actually see anything and yeah but uh
you<00:01:57.329> close<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.840> fits<00:01:58.200> pretty<00:01:58.409> snug

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you close it up fits pretty snug

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.560
