00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 before you see the video I want you 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.550
 Something to tell why I did not release 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.210
 so long video I want to say one thing 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.370
 I broke the microphone and I fix it 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.359
 still not as it could not because 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.699
 at the microphone with headphones and its not at all 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.980
 repaired and as I understood it can not be repaired 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.859
 all he had broken as it were 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.260
 one-time well and I ordered a new one 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.449
 microphone but before i ordered me 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.850
 I had to wait another two or three days 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.239
 we opened a new mail I could 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.079
 I got a microphone to order by mail 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.570
 that's just today today 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.460
 brought the day before yesterday but I decided to shoot 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.570
 video today perhaps that's all 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.570
 let's watch video 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.870
 and Hello dear friends with you and 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.520
 here are the vines today we will consider a mod for 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.050
 Minecraft version 1 7 10 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.270
 today's mod which we consider 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.100
 called watch dogs mod and this mod 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.950
 adds some things from the game watch 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.830
 dogs i'm sure everyone saw or did 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.190
 played watch dogs and knows aiden 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.740
 Pier and what clothes was he wearing it 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.229
 wore a brown raincoat although there you can 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.990
 it was still to choose what kind of clothes he 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.590
 would wear like i'm not exactly 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.720
 remember there were two kinds of clothes white 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.520
 raincoat and white cap and brown 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.160
 raincoat and brown cap 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.680
 but I always liked brown 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.479
 cap and brown cape and just this 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.119
 brown cloak and cap 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.210
 added this mod but this mod 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.550
 adds maykravt so let's we have this 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.720
 wear a cap and a cap and see how 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.600
 we will look 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.630
 voila this is what eiden looks like 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.350
 pier here is such a texture in this 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.300
 clothes 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.700
 also you can see what's on our 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.130
 physiognomies on not that small mask 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.100
 bandana just that one pier is all 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.770
 the game is about strength and I know why he apparently 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.650
 hid his face from other people to his 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.990
 I do not know this, and we probably finish 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.849
 consider clothes aiden pier and so 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.300
 move on to the following things from this 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.490
 fashion 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.500
 so now we look at the device 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.750
 hacking this here is such a phone using 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.780
 whom we can find out detailed 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.200
 information about the villagers and since 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.650
 do this we approach the resident clamp 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.270
 shift and click semi resident of course 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.300
 phone you need to hold in your hand right 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.720
 click and we can see 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.380
 o residents detailed information luis glen 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.690
 channel samohin to you don't i translate 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.480
 I will not because I have a low so 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.200
 sucks and suddenly i'm still doing something wrong 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.110
 I will translate where he gave I saw that he was 29 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.190
 years and occupation it was written it 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.240
 meant that 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.640
 what he does what he does 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.740
 does he work in the village 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.440
 it was written by a farmer but it stands for 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.560
 what he likes to dig in the farm is also 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.810
 there are people who are in white coats 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.250
 which is also possible using the phone 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.380
 check hack 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.080
 and find out about them detailed information in 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.780
 mostly they are chemists and they are engaged 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.200
 Alchemy I do not know at all what it is 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.070
 because the residents in my work 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.960
 only by building such houses and 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.710
 farming is not their main task 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.470
 how would but make the inhabitants in whites 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.600
 robes doing alchemy delirium honestly 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.040
 saying well anyway cool the same with 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.870
 using this phone we can 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.790
 open the iron door that is and 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.130
 hack come to the door 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.280
 click on it with the right mouse button and 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.290
 it will immediately open before us and this 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.420
 very very cool now we are not 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.190
 have to craft some kind of slab and 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.560
 lever to open the iron door 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.180
 just pick up the phone from the men 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.190
 it opens the iron door 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.350
 also with the help of this phone we can 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.290
 give endless redstone signal 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.570
 just come to redstone click on 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.340
 him right click and he immediately 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.440
 starts serving endless listone 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.810
 signal using this we will be able to do 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.060
 different mechanisms well, it's already on principle 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.090
 your look well and on this we perhaps 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.000
 finish and go to the next thing 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.590
 which adds this mod and perhaps 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.919
 The last thing we look at is 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.870
 this fashion is such a men device then 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.790
 have a tracking device using 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.250
 whom we will be able to follow every 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.040
 we can even find out where he is 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.220
 Now is what he does and in general 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.110
 about him information but this computer i 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.180
 so I will call you need to put 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.760
 it is in the village if we put in 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.460
 the village this computer is about the inhabitants we 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.410
 we can not find out alas and oh as they say 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.930
 and so let's put this computer 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.130
 villages and look at his 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.100
 class performance therefore 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.860
 computer pilaf right click not 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.900
 I like to negotiate and so push sects 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.270
 it is written here 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.310
 All settings Well, in general, what owns this 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.500
 computer what are its functions 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.050
 present but translate I'm not all 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.169
 I will be all the functions that are in it 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.780
 computer I already about them I already you 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.150
 told and so push the sandwich and 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.940
 we have all the inhabitants here 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.130
 are in this village and now class 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.100
 New for any resident for example I want 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.669
 find out detailed information about the resident 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.430
 Bashevis so click twice 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.949
 some kind of left mouse button and opens about 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.380
 detailed information about him his name 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.889
 what are his preferences how much he 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.350
 years than he likes to do it like 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.919
 work occupation farmer 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.199
 he likes working on the farm apparently where he is 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.979
 the last time was his coordinates 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.919
 and also the threat that is and it stands for 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.389
 the fact that you need to kill him honestly 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.449
 saying i don't know what i need 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.610
 The insert is a threat well, probably in the future 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:13.010
 mod will evolve and when the threat 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.590
 will pass for 50 percent 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.349
 the viewer may attack us and will 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.360
 beat us but hardly he can 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:23.479
 beat because in my inventory when 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.310
 there is always an extra sword in stock 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.349
 who i'm his baby 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.580
 Well, on this we will probably 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.050
 finish swami was flash 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.479
 subscribe put likes and 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.590
 comment my videos all good luck everyone 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.590
 until we meet again 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.960
 but
