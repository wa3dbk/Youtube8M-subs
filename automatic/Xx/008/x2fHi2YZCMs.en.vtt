00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.599
 the thermalright true spirit 120 mbw 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.150
 Revision processor cooler is small 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.620
 compact and very powerful what 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.330
 brings the best cooler if you do not 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.920
 knows how to block this one 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 tutorial in which you can see how the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.490
 Installation takes place often 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.180
 more helpful than a complicated one 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.039
 manual 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.170
 Today I show you how to do the true 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.000
 spirit is properly installed in the rest 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.769
 the installation ship of all 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480
 similar in temperature due to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.489
 its that the installation skid 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 is identical for the installation of the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.329
 cooler on an intel platform 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.399
 you need the included m3 l 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 ten screws and the corresponding ones 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 inter washers for an amd 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 platform he also needs the m3 l 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.899
 ten screws and the amd 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.700
 washers which the cooler 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.530
 accompany the remaining steps 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 are identical no matter whether intel or amd 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.940
 The washers are then attached to the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.770
 m3 screws attached and connected 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.320
 from the back through the mainboard holes 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.820
 performed around the cpu pedestal in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.260
 This connection will be connected with help 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.120
 fixed by hand 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.290
 the pension must screw it like that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.180
 be aligned that the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.180
 plastic card shows pcb towards 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.070
 then the mounting frame is like this 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.300
 put on this with 4 m 36 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.300
 can be fixed screw 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.909
 Next, the enclosed 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.560
 thermal compound are applied 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.390
 if you were the complete name 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.159
 or something like a blob 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.689
 in the middle power is up to you 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.689
 Both methods fulfill their purpose 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.410
 depending on the cpu cooler is positioned 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.000
 important here is the fact that 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.950
 the protective film on the contact surface 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.290
 it has to be removed otherwise 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.150
 a heat buildup should also come 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.740
 you align the cooler so that the 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.679
 fan in retrospect sufficient 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.660
 Freedom has been fixed the cooler 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.910
 by a mounting plate which 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.000
 attached with two m3 six screws 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.000
 becomes 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.200
 last but not least, then the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.150
 included fan with frame on 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.460
 cooler attached and the 4 pin connection 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.460
 connected to the cpu ribbon connectors 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.860
 and it's that even so simple 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.640
 and quickly the trip spirit can be 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.440
 to install 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.030
 then that has been for this video 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.980
 if the video is celebrated 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.410
 Leave a positive rating 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.940
 or two in this sense, thank you 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.940
 nice for spectators and pure skin
