certain time limit and there's different

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.669 
certain time limit and there's different
rules<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> game<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.929> course<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.650> of

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
rules in the game and of course one of

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.560 
rules in the game and of course one of
the<00:00:31.830> main<00:00:31.980> ones<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.730> kill<00:00:33.090> your<00:00:33.329> own

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the main ones is you can kill your own

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
the main ones is you can kill your own
teammates<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.680> game<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.550> I'm

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
teammates in the game so what I'm

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310 
teammates in the game so what I'm
thinking<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.480> introduce<00:00:36.960> private

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
thinking is if they do introduce private

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.139 
thinking is if they do introduce private
matches<00:00:37.440> into<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> game<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
have little teams competing against each

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
have little teams competing against each
other<00:00:40.950> maybe<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:41.790> could<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.090> some<00:00:42.300> prizes

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
other maybe they could have some prizes

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
use the agent peashooter because they

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.210

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
well is how they going to balance this

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.320 
well is how they going to balance this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
because it's plants against zombies and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330 
because it's plants against zombies and
each<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:19.080> has<00:01:19.259> their<00:01:19.409> own<00:01:19.470> advantages<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
not really affect you because of course

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.980 
not really affect you because of course
just<00:01:41.850> remember<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.570> something<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
just remember this is something that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
just remember this is something that
would<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.439> private<00:01:43.740> matches<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.549> do

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
would be in private matches so if you do

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.370 
would be in private matches so if you do
not<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.180> play<00:01:45.360> private<00:01:45.780> matches<00:01:46.079> or

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
not really play private matches or

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.510 
not really play private matches or
you're<00:01:46.560> not<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.680> competitive<00:01:47.340> person

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you're not really competitive person

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
you're not really competitive person
anyway<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:48.990> play<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> game

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
anyway then you can just play the game

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.530 
anyway then you can just play the game
just<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.979> normal<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.640> may<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.119> some

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
just as normal that it may be so some

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.120 
just as normal that it may be so some
different<00:01:51.689> rules<00:01:52.170> brought<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> private

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
different rules brought in to private

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.280 
different rules brought in to private
matches<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.729> could<00:01:53.880> maybe<00:01:54.030> change<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
matches that you could maybe change and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.270 
matches that you could maybe change and
then<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.860> make<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.009> more

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
then you can just make it more

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.920 
then you can just make it more
competitive<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.450> definitely<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.869> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
competitive so it's definitely going to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.910 
competitive so it's definitely going to
be<00:01:57.990> something<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.500> would<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.770> very

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
be something that I would be very

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.530 
be something that I would be very
interested<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.060> brought<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
interested in if it was brought to the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.940 
interested in if it was brought to the
game<00:02:00.659> because<00:02:00.930> I'm<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.079> very<00:02:01.320> big<00:02:01.530> competitive

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
need to increase my upload because

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.860 
need to increase my upload because
currently<00:02:21.459> right<00:02:21.640> now<00:02:21.670> my<00:02:22.269> upload<00:02:22.629> speed<00:02:22.840> is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
currently right now my upload speed is

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.750 
currently right now my upload speed is
not<00:02:23.049> very<00:02:23.200> good<00:02:23.470> my<00:02:24.159> download<00:02:24.519> speed<00:02:24.730> is

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
not very good my download speed is

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.280 
not very good my download speed is
perfectly<00:02:25.180> fine<00:02:25.360> but<00:02:25.510> my<00:02:25.629> upload<00:02:25.959> isn't<00:02:26.170> very

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
perfectly fine but my upload isn't very

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.839 
perfectly fine but my upload isn't very
good<00:02:26.379> so<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.830> stream<00:02:27.099> would<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.400> little<00:02:27.790> bit

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
good so the stream would be a little bit

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.369 
good so the stream would be a little bit
laggy<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.450> especially<00:02:28.720> if<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:28.989> am<00:02:29.140> playing

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
laggy and especially if I am playing

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.100 
laggy and especially if I am playing
online<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:30.069> like<00:02:30.849> even<00:02:31.090> more<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.659> I<00:02:31.690> want<00:02:32.019> to

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
online I like even more so I want to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.289 
online I like even more so I want to
upgrade<00:02:32.290> my<00:02:32.500> my<00:02:33.370> internet<00:02:33.730> speed<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.150> get<00:02:34.269> a

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
upgrade my my internet speed so I get a

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.460 
upgrade my my internet speed so I get a
better<00:02:34.450> upload<00:02:34.840> before<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:35.140> do<00:02:35.260> stretch

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
better upload before I do stretch

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.839 
better upload before I do stretch
streaming<00:02:35.829> but<00:02:35.950> I'm<00:02:36.040> hoping<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.670> stretch

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
streaming but I'm hoping to stretch

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.520 
streaming but I'm hoping to stretch
stream<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.239> when<00:02:37.329> garden<00:02:37.629> offer<00:02:37.780> 2<00:02:38.079> does<00:02:38.379> come

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
stream and when garden offer 2 does come

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.440 
stream and when garden offer 2 does come
out<00:02:38.620> because<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.519> right<00:02:39.640> private<00:02:40.030> matches<00:02:40.329> I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
out because the right private matches I

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.690 
out because the right private matches I
can<00:02:40.840> do<00:02:40.900> some<00:02:41.049> game<00:02:41.230> modes<00:02:41.500> with<00:02:41.620> 23<00:02:42.459> other

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
can do some game modes with 23 other
