 servers now how do I earn it what 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.140
 only thing you have to do is that when 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.420
 already say five or three minutes or before 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.890
 that says zero will enter your 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.140
 minecraft good I 'll explain 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.780
 here they will enter the minecraft pocket 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 edition 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.690
 normally and they go home to where 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.790
 says player winds are going to enter the 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.490
 players rings and they will achieve with their 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.990
 Moyano account or wet to enter 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.430
 to the player ruins as they see me and I 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.680
 servers appear to many is going 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.000
 to look like they do not have servers and what 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.220
 The only thing you have to do is wait 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.260
 when I say that one minute or 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.570
 less when good I give them an advice 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.310
 when there are only five minutes left 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.870
 they enter here and they start entering and leaving 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.030
 to enter and exit as I go now 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.950
 I go in and I go out and go out the joke is 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.930
 that when I say that 0 seconds are missing 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.790
 that is, when the time is up, the 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.640
 of mohamed are going to release the riffs that 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.620
 There are 250 in total and the first ones 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.990
 come to create your server are those that 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.730
 are going to stay with that server so 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.960
 well that's all, not all you have 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.820
 to do is wait for the time 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.520
 finish and when the time limit is already 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.250
 fast enter enters salts you enter salts or 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.470
 you wait for it to update here and you 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.750
 player greens list and you have to 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.100
 appear to create or not create this now 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.260
 it only lasts five to ten seconds 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.270
 they listened well they run out in five or 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.980
 ten seconds what server are servers 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.330
 of tests so do not think that they are 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.580
 they will give forever good and what 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.780
 They think to fix forever and 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.760
 they work perfectly 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.010
 right now they saw that I tried it with 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.740
 as survival is the one that I created and 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.130
 here I got the 12pm server left me 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.750
 put me and as you see here states in that 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.310
 I also want server not so good 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.270
 if they did not understand the only thing they have 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.860
 What to do is enter the link of the 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.150
 description of the video and see how much 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.000
 time is lacking for it to rule in the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.040
 next server is and when they are missing 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.440
 five or ten minutes or four minutes 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.239
 enter the player ruiz and begin to 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.569
 enter and exit to enter and leave until 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.770
 that I already leave them or create a server 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:40.380
 now as I tell you this only lasts for d 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.110
 from 5 to 10 seconds or quick they are going 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.820
 I watched him so they have to put 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.020
 defendants I do not expect I have understood what 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.210
 the only thing they have to do is turn it around 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.070
 to repeat is to wait for the 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.330
 Time limit contains the time limit 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.790
 those of mohamed are going to release the 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.470
 servers that are 250 and already you 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.350
 they enter the player wing and fast 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.160
 try to win a server are 3,000 already 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.620
 have raffled 750 servers and then 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.900
 good only from today to today 12 until the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.330
 14 that are going to be connected or going 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.920
 to be doing these these gifts of 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.990
 servers is not only to test your 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.990
 servers just go back to repeat I hope 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.730
 you liked the video I have plans 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.870
 to do something with this server before 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.390
 that they take it from me because I do not know if I 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.400
 They will leave forever or not 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.680
 they are going to remove no but as I say I hope 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.290
 that all servers win or that many 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.460
 of follow the servers since to whom 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.460
 use it for what you want 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.710
 I hope that what they do not understand 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.809
 that as I say, there are only 3,000 as 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.210
 10 million people we use 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:44.789
 minecraft both of them and of 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.159
 Androids the same or ios but good 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.449
 I hope you like it I hope it works for you 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.999
 Nothing else was doing me pendeja one 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.529
 while with two in the king we started 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.839

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.789
 material because I am 5 and well this is 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:59.490
 we'll see everything in the next video 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.220
 I hope ganen server only alone repeat 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.479
 I have plans for this server that 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.169
 I won them because that I did and good 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.639
 there is a series out there not with 25 with no to 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.110
 see what happens, but as I say 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.060
 they have time still do not worry 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.370
 there he killed him good did not leave that they 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.650
 say that I killed him and well that 's all 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.650
