drink and like yeah I'm pretty sure he's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.700 
drink and like yeah I'm pretty sure he's
an<00:01:37.740> R&amp;B<00:01:38.100> singer<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.790> anyway<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.439> sound<00:01:40.650> was

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
an R&amp;B singer so anyway the sound was

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.140 
an R&amp;B singer so anyway the sound was
really<00:01:41.070> good<00:01:41.189> as<00:01:41.280> vocals<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.820> really

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
really good as vocals have really

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.960 
really good as vocals have really
improved<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.869> mean<00:01:43.530> he's<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.189> he<00:01:44.549> used<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
improved I mean he's actually he used I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.760 
improved I mean he's actually he used I
think<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.270> use<00:01:45.390> five<00:01:45.720> bars<00:01:46.049> list<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.409> autotune

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
think he use five bars list of autotune

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.639 
think he use five bars list of autotune
autotune<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.509> previous<00:01:48.899> album<00:01:49.259> right

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
autotune on a the previous album right

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.130 
autotune on a the previous album right
take<00:01:49.950> care<00:01:49.979> was<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> level<00:01:51.119> 10<00:01:51.329> he's<00:01:51.780> probably<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
take care was a level 10 he's probably a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.630 
take care was a level 10 he's probably a
little<00:01:52.229> five<00:01:52.530> now<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.950> Volk<00:01:53.159> was<00:01:53.280> improved<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
little five now with Volk was improved a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.370 
little five now with Volk was improved a
little<00:01:53.759> bit<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.570> he's<00:01:54.720> still<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.140> quite

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
little bit but he's still not quite

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.999 
little bit but he's still not quite
there<00:01:55.500> he<00:01:55.799> still<00:01:56.040> needs<00:01:56.310> auto-tune<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.920> was

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
there he still needs auto-tune so it was

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.859 
there he still needs auto-tune so it was
pretty<00:01:59.159> good<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> was<00:01:59.579> pretty<00:01:59.700> good<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> if

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
