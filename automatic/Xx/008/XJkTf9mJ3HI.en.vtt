00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
able to cancel the new I think so too

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.560 
able to cancel the new I think so too
like<00:06:20.110> if<00:06:20.230> you<00:06:20.350> kill<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.680> guy<00:06:21.180> yeah<00:06:22.180> if<00:06:22.390> you

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
like if you kill the guy yeah if you

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.120 
like if you kill the guy yeah if you
could<00:06:22.690> find<00:06:22.990> the<00:06:23.170> guy<00:06:23.350> who<00:06:23.380> called<00:06:23.800> the<00:06:23.950> nuke

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
could find the guy who called the nuke

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.490 
could find the guy who called the nuke
in<00:06:24.310> 10<00:06:24.550> seconds<00:06:25.030> and<00:06:25.300> kill<00:06:25.870> them<00:06:26.020> I<00:06:26.050> think<00:06:26.230> it

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
in 10 seconds and kill them I think it

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.140 
in 10 seconds and kill them I think it
should<00:06:26.650> cancel<00:06:26.890> with<00:06:27.160> it<00:06:27.340> or<00:06:27.730> if<00:06:27.880> somebody

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
should cancel with it or if somebody

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.959 
should cancel with it or if somebody
kills

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 
kills

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.269 
kills
seconds<00:06:29.299> I<00:06:29.539> don't<00:06:30.139> know<00:06:30.229> or<00:06:30.889> maybe<00:06:31.039> an

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:31.279 
seconds I don't know or maybe an

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.739 
seconds I don't know or maybe an
airplane<00:06:31.639> drops<00:06:31.939> it<00:06:32.119> and<00:06:32.149> you<00:06:32.360> have<00:06:32.479> to<00:06:32.599> take

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:32.749 
airplane drops it and you have to take

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:34.689 
airplane drops it and you have to take
out<00:06:32.899> the<00:06:33.019> airplane<00:06:33.349> yeah<00:06:33.739> like<00:06:34.039> yeah<00:06:34.459> exactly

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699

out the airplane yeah like yeah exactly
I<00:06:35.360> was<00:06:35.869> like<00:06:35.959> checking<00:06:36.349> for<00:06:36.529> that<00:06:37.659> check<00:06:38.659> for

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:38.839 
I was like checking for that check for

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.859 
I was like checking for that check for
what<00:06:38.989> like<00:06:39.259> a<00:06:39.289> a<00:06:39.679> new<00:06:39.949> plane<00:06:40.459> or<00:06:40.699> sadly<00:06:41.149> no<00:06:41.839> I

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:41.869 
what like a a new plane or sadly no I

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.600 
what like a a new plane or sadly no I
don't<00:06:42.169> do<00:06:42.319> far<00:06:42.559> away<00:06:42.739> then<00:06:42.949> it<00:06:43.129> drops<00:06:43.399> per

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
don't do far away then it drops per

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.959 
don't do far away then it drops per
trillion<00:06:43.849> guys<00:06:44.179> yeah<00:06:44.449> I<00:06:44.719> was<00:06:45.439> also<00:06:45.619> thinking

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969 
trillion guys yeah I was also thinking

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.399 
trillion guys yeah I was also thinking
what<00:06:46.969> if<00:06:47.059> you're<00:06:47.239> playing<00:06:47.419> domination<00:06:48.259> and

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:48.409 
what if you're playing domination and

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.549 
what if you're playing domination and
the<00:06:48.549> nuke<00:06:49.549> goes<00:06:49.579> off<00:06:49.939> and<00:06:50.360> you<00:06:50.569> win<00:06:50.839> the<00:06:51.169> high

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:51.559 
the nuke goes off and you win the high

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.129 
the nuke goes off and you win the high
score<00:06:52.069> like<00:06:52.849> well<00:06:53.360> anything<00:06:53.629> really<00:06:53.959> you

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
score like well anything really you

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.329 
score like well anything really you
could<00:06:54.289> be<00:06:54.379> doing<00:06:54.589> that<00:06:54.649> with<00:06:54.799> team<00:06:54.979> deathmatch

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:55.339 
could be doing that with team deathmatch

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.669 
could be doing that with team deathmatch
too<00:06:55.639> yeah<00:06:56.149> can<00:06:56.449> you<00:06:56.479> still<00:06:56.869> win<00:06:57.139> will<00:06:57.559> it

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:57.679 
too yeah can you still win will it

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:59.769 
too yeah can you still win will it
cancel<00:06:58.069> the<00:06:58.189> nuclear<00:06:58.579> will<00:06:58.729> it<00:06:58.849> extend<00:06:59.659> the

00:06:59.769 --> 00:06:59.779 
cancel the nuclear will it extend the

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:02.350 
cancel the nuclear will it extend the
game<00:06:59.959> om<00:07:00.439> think<00:07:00.739> it<00:07:00.919> would<00:07:01.159> cancel<00:07:02.059> the<00:07:02.179> nuke

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
game om think it would cancel the nuke

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.109 
game om think it would cancel the nuke
and<00:07:02.569> you<00:07:02.629> would<00:07:02.749> win<00:07:02.959> but<00:07:03.669> yeah<00:07:04.669> cuz<00:07:04.969> like

00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:05.119 
and you would win but yeah cuz like

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:06.519 
and you would win but yeah cuz like
whatever<00:07:05.449> right<00:07:05.719> what<00:07:05.929> I<00:07:05.959> was<00:07:06.139> thinking<00:07:06.439> is

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:06.529 
whatever right what I was thinking is

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:07.779 
whatever right what I was thinking is
like<00:07:06.649> you<00:07:06.799> know<00:07:06.829> how<00:07:07.039> sometimes<00:07:07.309> when<00:07:07.579> you're

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:07.789 
like you know how sometimes when you're

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.939 
like you know how sometimes when you're
capturing<00:07:08.149> the<00:07:08.299> flag<00:07:08.449> and<00:07:08.809> why<00:07:08.899> not<00:07:09.139> I<00:07:09.379> like

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949 
capturing the flag and why not I like

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:11.679 
capturing the flag and why not I like
right<00:07:10.519> before<00:07:10.669> you<00:07:10.939> get<00:07:11.029> down<00:07:11.209> capture<00:07:11.569> the

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:11.689 
right before you get down capture the

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:15.759 
right before you get down capture the
flag<00:07:11.869> it's<00:07:12.079> like<00:07:12.199> halfway<00:07:12.439> through<00:07:12.919> and<00:07:14.769> like

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:15.769 
flag it's like halfway through and like

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.379 
flag it's like halfway through and like
the<00:07:15.919> time<00:07:16.129> kids<00:07:16.399> up<00:07:16.549> right<00:07:16.789> you<00:07:17.089> know<00:07:17.179> I<00:07:17.239> mean

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
the time kids up right you know I mean

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.359 
the time kids up right you know I mean
yeah<00:07:17.929> but<00:07:18.229> even<00:07:18.559> though<00:07:18.619> there's<00:07:18.799> no<00:07:18.860> time<00:07:19.129> oh

00:07:19.359 --> 00:07:19.369 
yeah but even though there's no time oh

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:22.149 
yeah but even though there's no time oh
yeah<00:07:19.579> there<00:07:19.789> is<00:07:19.879> time<00:07:20.089> limit<00:07:20.389> captain<00:07:21.159> I'll

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:22.159 
yeah there is time limit captain I'll

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:25.149 
yeah there is time limit captain I'll
see<00:07:22.339> about<00:07:22.369> domination<00:07:22.909> there's<00:07:23.269> nothing<00:07:24.159> but

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:25.159 
see about domination there's nothing but
