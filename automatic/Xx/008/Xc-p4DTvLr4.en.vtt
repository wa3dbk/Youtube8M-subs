fuel<00:04:52.460> mission<00:04:52.760> is<00:04:52.850> checked<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.479> forth

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
fuel mission is checked and so forth

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.010

like<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.070> but<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:56.330> plug<00:04:56.510> is<00:04:56.630> coming<00:04:56.870> out

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
like that but the plug is coming out

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.900 
like that but the plug is coming out
sort<00:04:57.919> of<00:04:58.039> somewhere<00:04:58.280> near<00:04:58.490> where<00:04:58.640> it<00:04:58.669> needs<00:04:58.850> to

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
sort of somewhere near where it needs to

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.810 
sort of somewhere near where it needs to
be<00:04:58.970> so<00:04:59.960> I'm<00:05:00.080> pretty<00:05:00.200> happy<00:05:00.520> it's<00:05:01.520> not<00:05:01.550> breaking

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
be so I'm pretty happy it's not breaking

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.200 
be so I'm pretty happy it's not breaking
down<00:05:01.970> now<00:05:02.440> but<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.560> mix<00:05:03.740> is<00:05:03.830> right<00:05:04.039> it's<00:05:05.030> only

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
down now but the mix is right it's only

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.960 
down now but the mix is right it's only
got<00:05:05.390> a<00:05:05.419> 125<00:05:06.080> main<00:05:06.289> jet<00:05:06.530> in<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:06.919> a<00:05:07.070> 45<00:05:07.520> pilot

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
got a 125 main jet in it and a 45 pilot

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:15.100 
got a 125 main jet in it and a 45 pilot
and<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:10.240> 26<00:05:11.240> mil<00:05:11.390> cab

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.320 

but<00:05:16.110> all<00:05:16.290> all<00:05:16.620> all<00:05:16.920> the<00:05:17.130> things<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.940> make<00:05:18.090> work

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
but all all all the things I make work

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.080 
but all all all the things I make work
around<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.900> venturi<00:05:19.610> which<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:20.730> inside<00:05:21.060> that

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
around the venturi which is inside that

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.660 
around the venturi which is inside that
box<00:05:21.800> which<00:05:22.800> ones<00:05:23.010> in<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.220> back<00:05:23.340> of<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.490> car

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
box which ones in the back of the car

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.040 
box which ones in the back of the car
which<00:05:23.940> picked<00:05:24.150> up<00:05:24.270> a<00:05:24.360> pilot<00:05:24.600> chute<00:05:24.900> which

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
which picked up a pilot chute which

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.810 
which picked up a pilot chute which
picks<00:05:25.260> up<00:05:25.350> boots<00:05:25.650> pressure<00:05:25.920> and<00:05:26.190> pressure

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
picks up boots pressure and pressure

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.980 
picks up boots pressure and pressure
rises<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.840> fuel<00:05:28.080> inside<00:05:28.290> the<00:05:28.530> car<00:05:28.740> B<00:05:29.690> so<00:05:30.690> it

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
rises the fuel inside the car B so it

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.370 
rises the fuel inside the car B so it
stays<00:05:31.230> above<00:05:31.410> boost<00:05:31.830> pressure<00:05:32.960> roughly<00:05:33.960> it's

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
stays above boost pressure roughly it's

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.290 
stays above boost pressure roughly it's
putting<00:05:34.740> out<00:05:34.860> an<00:05:35.040> extra<00:05:35.370> pound<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.270> half

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
putting out an extra pound and a half

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:50.530 
putting out an extra pound and a half
more<00:05:39.590> so<00:05:40.760> very<00:05:41.760> very<00:05:41.970> happy<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.390> way<00:05:42.420> train<00:05:46.280> so
