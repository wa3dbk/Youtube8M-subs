00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.750
 work with your security not the 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.090
 relationship the relationship is a way if the 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.610
 which is maybe very sociable 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.250
 very much the fee and then that puts you 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.770
 you in all these rolls today will be 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.720
 enough for this person I'm good or 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.910
 at work where you feel a lot 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.460
 expectation a lot of pressure begin to 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.380
 move all those insecurities but in 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.820
 instead of going in and working 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.000
 with those fears that is the opportunity 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.710
 wonderful when it starts to resurface 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.240
 because it's as if these situations the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.850
 life does not put them precisely for 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.070
 teach us things that we have buried and 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.140
 that otherwise we would not see is what 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.270
 it happens is that you start to feel these 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.600
 fears and then then what do we do 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.670
 we are dealing with children creating one of the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.910
 ways is to create pests 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.370
 is that I feel that way because he is 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.010
 Greek 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 then it 's again outward like 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.660
 those people who are always involved 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.160
 in some kind of drama in stores in 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.160
 some kind of drama can be legal 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.300
 it can be emotional but there's always 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.750
 lamas in your life 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.270
 we all have something and then it 's good 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.340
 see it because sometimes it's as if 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.770
 consciously we were creating 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.420
 these dramas to distract us from what 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.750
 so mind is going on here 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.860
 in and that's the only way I 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 precisely says the only way out is to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.810
 through 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.560
 if we keep thinking about all 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.080
 sides justifying intellectualized 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.820
 rationalizing or distorting 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.850
 separating them from the body looking for 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.130
 situations outside to understand what 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.430
 is happening here there is no way the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.330
 salary 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.280
 and nothing happens inside is a way is 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.890
 when they see that they are causing the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.130
 moment of grace to come back towards 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.130
 in
