it's got a it's like a Goldie pinky tone

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.399 
it's got a it's like a Goldie pinky tone
to<00:04:40.889> it<00:04:40.979> very<00:04:41.099> similar<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.699> NARS<00:04:41.879> orgasm<00:04:42.409> but

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
to it very similar to NARS orgasm but

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.950 
to it very similar to NARS orgasm but
it's<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:44.300> bit<00:04:45.300> more<00:04:45.330> thicker<00:04:45.750> in<00:04:45.930> consistency

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
it's a bit more thicker in consistency

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.499 
it's a bit more thicker in consistency
it<00:04:46.740> doesn't<00:04:47.039> sit<00:04:47.189> on<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.490> skin<00:04:47.729> but<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.300> does

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
it doesn't sit on the skin but it does

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.490 
it doesn't sit on the skin but it does
kind<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:49.610> dry<00:04:50.610> on<00:04:50.969> the<00:04:51.360> skin<00:04:51.479> whereas<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.199> NARS

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
kind of dry on the skin whereas the NARS

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.610 
kind of dry on the skin whereas the NARS
orgasm<00:04:53.490> illuminator<00:04:54.300> kind<00:04:55.050> of<00:04:55.169> blends<00:04:55.379> in

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
orgasm illuminator kind of blends in

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.689 
orgasm illuminator kind of blends in
with<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.830> skin<00:04:56.099> so<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.340> looks<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.550> bit<00:04:56.580> more

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
with the skin so it looks a bit more

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.550 
with the skin so it looks a bit more
natural<00:04:56.849> whereas<00:04:57.389> this<00:04:57.569> I<00:04:57.750> think<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:58.139> a<00:04:58.169> lot

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
natural whereas this I think is a lot

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.499 
natural whereas this I think is a lot
more<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.949> highlighter<00:04:59.370> that<00:04:59.759> you<00:05:00.150> can<00:05:00.300> place

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
more of a highlighter that you can place

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.390 
more of a highlighter that you can place
on<00:05:00.629> the<00:05:00.719> high<00:05:00.870> points<00:05:01.169> of<00:05:01.289> your<00:05:01.349> cheek<00:05:01.830> I've

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
on the high points of your cheek I've

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.010 
on the high points of your cheek I've
also<00:05:02.639> got<00:05:02.969> benefits<00:05:03.210> on<00:05:03.629> being<00:05:03.840> but<00:05:03.960> I've

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
also got benefits on being but I've

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.510 
also got benefits on being but I've
actually<00:05:04.110> lost<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.039> I<00:05:05.069> don't<00:05:05.310> know<00:05:05.370> where

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
actually lost it so I don't know where

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.189 
actually lost it so I don't know where
it<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:05.699> but<00:05:05.879> I<00:05:05.909> have<00:05:05.969> got<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.330> blog<00:05:06.599> post<00:05:06.870> on<00:05:07.050> it

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
it is but I have got a blog post on it

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.260 
it is but I have got a blog post on it
and<00:05:07.379> that<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:07.800> one<00:05:08.310> highlighter<00:05:08.819> that<00:05:08.909> I<00:05:09.030> would

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
and that is one highlighter that I would

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.969 
and that is one highlighter that I would
recommend<00:05:09.750> for<00:05:09.810> warmer<00:05:10.259> skin<00:05:10.469> tones<00:05:10.710> just

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
recommend for warmer skin tones just

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.270 
recommend for warmer skin tones just
because<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.460> gives<00:05:11.639> your<00:05:11.819> skin<00:05:11.969> a<00:05:12.330> really<00:05:12.719> nice

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280
