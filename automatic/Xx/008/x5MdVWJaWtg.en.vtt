00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
fairly thin these horses also wear hooks

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.259 
fairly thin these horses also wear hooks
so<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.190> when<00:00:23.519> they're<00:00:23.640> out<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> Sun

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
so that when they're out in the Sun

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.029 
so that when they're out in the Sun
they're<00:00:24.929> not<00:00:25.109> bleaching<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.800> they're<00:00:25.920> not

rubbing<00:00:26.369> their<00:00:26.519> manes<00:00:26.730> out<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.900> start<00:00:28.169> at

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
rubbing their manes out so we start at

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.140 
rubbing their manes out so we start at
the<00:00:28.380> bottom<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.009> like<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.970> like

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the bottom what I like to do is I like

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.340 
the bottom what I like to do is I like
to<00:00:30.210> divide<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.869> main<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:33.050> depending<00:00:34.050> on

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
to divide the main up and depending on

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.860 
to divide the main up and depending on
what<00:00:34.590> size<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.250> plate<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.730> want<00:00:35.970> will<00:00:36.420> depend

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
what size of plate you want will depend

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.160 
what size of plate you want will depend
on<00:00:37.110> how<00:00:37.410> wide<00:00:37.740> your<00:00:38.250> divides<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.020> your

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
on how wide your divides are so if your

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930 
on how wide your divides are so if your
horse<00:00:40.379> hasn't<00:00:40.649> got<00:00:40.860> much<00:00:41.039> Mane<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:41.670> you'll

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
horse hasn't got much Mane at all you'll

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.450 
horse hasn't got much Mane at all you'll
probably<00:00:42.149> take<00:00:42.480> bigger<00:00:42.780> sections<00:00:43.190> if<00:00:44.190> it's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
probably take bigger sections if it's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.889 
probably take bigger sections if it's
got<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:44.940> thick<00:00:45.090> mane<00:00:45.539> you'll<00:00:45.719> probably

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
got a really thick mane you'll probably

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.279 
got a really thick mane you'll probably
take<00:00:46.199> smaller<00:00:46.590> sections<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.930> use<00:00:49.140> like

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
take smaller sections so I just use like

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.590 
take smaller sections so I just use like
a<00:00:49.350> bends<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:50.430> people<00:00:50.760> start<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> top

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
a bends some people start from the top

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.500 
a bends some people start from the top
and<00:00:51.870> work<00:00:51.989> their<00:00:52.199> way<00:00:52.230> down<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:53.329> personally<00:00:54.329> go

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
and work their way down I personally go
from<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> bottom<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.199> work<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.500> way<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
from the bottom and work my way up I

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
from the bottom and work my way up I
like<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.890> above<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> horse<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.420> that

your horse has got a big thick neck you
can<00:01:25.800> go<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> other<00:01:26.220> way

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
can go the other way

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.400 
can go the other way

I'll spray the plot divide it into three

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.850 
I'll spray the plot divide it into three
sections<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:53.540> then<00:01:54.540> start<00:01:54.870> plating<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.440> play

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
sections and then start plating I play

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.280 
sections and then start plating I play
it<00:01:55.920> fairly<00:01:56.190> tight<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.940> these<00:01:57.930> will<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.260> the

with<00:02:49.930> practice<00:02:50.200> you'll<00:02:50.590> get<00:02:50.739> tighter<00:02:51.040> and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
with practice you'll get tighter and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.339 
with practice you'll get tighter and
tighter<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:52.299> more<00:02:52.480> practice<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:52.959> the

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
tighter the more practice you have the

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:05.160 
tighter the more practice you have the
better<00:02:53.530> your<00:02:53.709> blacks<00:02:53.950> get<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.630> again<00:03:04.930> around

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
better your blacks get and again around

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.970 
better your blacks get and again around
the<00:03:05.470> bottom<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:05.980> only<00:03:06.459> have<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.670> short<00:03:06.730> place<00:03:07.299> I

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the bottom I only have a short place I

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.789 
the bottom I only have a short place I
follow<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.190> end<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:10.920> around<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.220> place<00:03:13.799> so

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
follow the end and around the place so

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.410 
follow the end and around the place so
once<00:03:15.040> you've<00:03:15.220> got<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.610> point<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:16.180> you've

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
once you've got to the point that you've

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.229 
once you've got to the point that you've
done<00:03:16.900> your<00:03:17.079> Platts<00:03:17.319> I<00:03:17.739> trim<00:03:18.700> them<00:03:18.819> off<00:03:18.940> at<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
done your Platts I trim them off at the

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.940 
done your Platts I trim them off at the
end<00:03:19.269> because<00:03:19.630> each<00:03:19.870> week<00:03:20.140> they<00:03:20.380> grow<00:03:20.590> longer

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
end because each week they grow longer

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.789 
end because each week they grow longer
and<00:03:21.220> longer<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:23.200> doesn't<00:03:23.500> actually

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
and longer and it doesn't actually

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.650 
and longer and it doesn't actually
shorten<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.250> main<00:03:24.430> because<00:03:24.880> each<00:03:25.120> week<00:03:25.359> they

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
shorten the main because each week they

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.349 
shorten the main because each week they
have<00:03:26.109> a<00:03:26.139> regrowth<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:27.630> then<00:03:28.630> get<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:30.359> dining

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
needle all the time I usually go

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.340 
needle all the time I usually go
backwards<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:38.970> forwards<00:04:39.030> probably<00:04:39.840> three<00:04:40.229> to

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
backwards and forwards probably three to

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.000 
backwards and forwards probably three to
four<00:04:40.560> times<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:42.510> all<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.660> do<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:43.290> I<00:04:43.470> just<00:04:43.500> cut

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
four times and all I do is I just cut

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.909 
four times and all I do is I just cut
and<00:04:44.310> secure<00:04:44.910> off<00:04:45.090> at<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.510> end<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.020> that's

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
and secure off at the end and that's

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.610 
and secure off at the end and that's
your<00:04:47.370> bubble<00:04:47.669> so<00:04:48.510> we<00:04:48.780> continue<00:04:49.260> this<00:04:49.380> process
