that<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.539> ds5<00:01:52.139> is<00:01:52.350> loaded<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:52.889> how<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that this ds5 is loaded with how it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.550 
that this ds5 is loaded with how it
actually<00:01:53.880> works<00:01:54.329> David<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.109> I<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.350> turn<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
actually works David if I can turn to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.539 
actually works David if I can turn to
you<00:01:55.859> for<00:01:56.069> a<00:01:56.130> moment

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
you for a moment

you for a moment
you<00:01:57.420> you've<00:01:58.200> designed<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.740> training

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
you you've designed the training

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.789 
you you've designed the training
sessions<00:01:59.639> and<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.420> drive<00:02:00.659> sessions<00:02:01.229> how<00:02:01.649> have

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
sessions and the drive sessions how have

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.319 
sessions and the drive sessions how have
they<00:02:01.979> been<00:02:02.009> running<00:02:02.520> from<00:02:02.789> your<00:02:02.969> point<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
they been running from your point of

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.300 
they been running from your point of
view<00:02:03.389> I<00:02:03.719> think<00:02:04.139> we<00:02:04.259> really<00:02:04.530> wanted<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.859> do<00:02:05.039> here

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
view I think we really wanted to do here

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.669 
view I think we really wanted to do here
is<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.329> give<00:02:06.539> our<00:02:06.899> sales<00:02:07.200> force<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
is to to give our sales force the

is to to give our sales force the
opportunity<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.940> drive<00:02:09.240> our<00:02:09.720> car<00:02:10.140> drive<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
opportunity to drive our car drive the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
and watching and learning about the car

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.590 
and watching and learning about the car
and<00:03:37.710> then<00:03:38.280> what<00:03:38.550> we<00:03:38.670> do<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:38.820> we<00:03:39.030> put<00:03:39.390> them<00:03:39.510> on

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
and then what we do is we put them on

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.850 
and then what we do is we put them on
the<00:03:39.720> spot<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.960> little<00:03:40.230> bit<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.620> video

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
the spot a little bit with the video

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.920 
the spot a little bit with the video
camera<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.490> some<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.790> them<00:03:41.880> are<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.450> little<00:03:42.660> bit

camera and some of them are a little bit
unsure<00:03:43.140> about<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.740> but<00:03:44.459> they<00:03:44.580> start<00:03:44.880> to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
unsure about it but they start to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.580 
unsure about it but they start to
realize<00:03:45.150> actually<00:03:45.510> as<00:03:45.780> soon<00:03:45.930> as<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.110> film<00:03:46.380> and

realize actually as soon as you film and
put<00:03:46.860> them<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.100> spot<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.400> say<00:03:47.520> right

really got that real kind of presenting
style<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.870> others<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.380> are<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.530> little<00:03:55.800> bit

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
style the others that are a little bit

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.070 
style the others that are a little bit
more<00:03:56.550> nervous<00:03:56.880> about<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.510> are<00:03:57.630> getting<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
more nervous about it are getting the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.390 
more nervous about it are getting the
message<00:03:58.200> actually<00:03:58.740> I'm<00:03:58.890> gonna<00:03:59.040> need<00:03:59.220> to

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
message actually I'm gonna need to

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.699 
message actually I'm gonna need to
practice<00:03:59.580> this<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.780> seeing<00:04:01.050> them<00:04:01.290> kind<00:04:01.650> of

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
practice this so seeing them kind of

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.710 
practice this so seeing them kind of
gradually<00:04:02.100> get<00:04:02.280> better<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:02.880> thinking<00:04:03.510> about

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
gradually get better and thinking about

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.210 
gradually get better and thinking about
how<00:04:03.930> they're<00:04:04.140> going<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.320> present<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.740> going<00:04:05.040> I

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
how they're going to present it going I

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.620 
how they're going to present it going I
need<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:05.640> key<00:04:05.790> for<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.090> where's<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.480> key

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
need the key for this where's the key

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.780 
need the key for this where's the key
where's<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.050> keys<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.650> really<00:04:08.250> quite<00:04:08.490> a<00:04:08.520> good

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
where's the keys is really quite a good

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.949 
where's the keys is really quite a good
one<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.030> think<00:04:09.330> it's<00:04:09.450> good<00:04:09.570> way<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.840> them

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
one I think it's good way of them

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.810 
one I think it's good way of them
learning<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.680> when<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.070> see<00:04:11.250> them<00:04:11.400> watching

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
learning and when you see them watching

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.250 
learning and when you see them watching
it<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.180> film<00:04:12.420> at<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.690> end<00:04:12.840> as<00:04:13.050> well<00:04:13.080> I

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
it in the film at the end as well I

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.050 
it in the film at the end as well I
think<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.740> that<00:04:14.130> really<00:04:14.340> kind<00:04:14.490> of<00:04:14.760> brings<00:04:14.970> it

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
think that that really kind of brings it

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.370 
think that that really kind of brings it
all<00:04:15.180> together<00:04:15.330> so<00:04:15.540> that's<00:04:15.900> worked<00:04:16.109> really

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
all together so that's worked really

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.140 
all together so that's worked really
well<00:04:16.500> brilliant<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.220> David<00:04:17.670> from<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:17.910> training

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
well brilliant and David from a training

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.849 
well brilliant and David from a training
company's<00:04:18.630> point<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:19.020> view<00:04:19.170> what's<00:04:19.590> been<00:04:19.770> the

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
company's point of view what's been the

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.010 
company's point of view what's been the
most<00:04:20.010> satisfying<00:04:20.730> part<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.540> event<00:04:21.840> for

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
most satisfying part of the event for

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.540 
most satisfying part of the event for
you<00:04:22.140> from<00:04:22.440> yourself<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.040> think<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.400> most

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
you from yourself I think the most

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.370 
you from yourself I think the most
satisfying<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.240> part<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.750> it<00:04:24.900> is<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.229> actually

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
satisfying a part of it is to actually

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.680 
satisfying a part of it is to actually
go<00:04:26.250> from<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.580> concept<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.360> came

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
go from the concept that we came

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.750 
go from the concept that we came
with<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.380> actually<00:04:28.680> see<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:28.980> working<00:04:29.370> we<00:04:29.580> knew

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
with to actually see it working we knew

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.910 
with to actually see it working we knew
it<00:04:29.880> would<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:31.110> know<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:31.290> still<00:04:31.440> want<00:04:31.650> to

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
it would but you know you still want to

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.140 
it would but you know you still want to
actually<00:04:32.070> see<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.610> action

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
actually see it in action

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.200 
actually see it in action
and<00:04:33.240> as<00:04:34.050> part<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.560> day<00:04:34.770> for<00:04:35.130> me<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.970> best

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
and as part of the day for me the best

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.970 
and as part of the day for me the best
part<00:04:36.480> of<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.720> is<00:04:36.780> when<00:04:37.110> everybody<00:04:37.710> sees

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
part of it is when everybody sees

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.850 
part of it is when everybody sees
themselves<00:04:38.190> on<00:04:39.030> video<00:04:39.630> at<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.990> end<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.440> they

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
themselves on video at the end and they

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.710 
themselves on video at the end and they
see<00:04:41.040> what<00:04:41.220> they<00:04:41.430> collectively<00:04:42.060> have<00:04:42.270> produced

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
see what they collectively have produced

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.380 
see what they collectively have produced
so<00:04:43.410> as<00:04:43.800> you<00:04:44.220> say<00:04:44.430> actually<00:04:44.640> in<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.030> show<00:04:45.180> there

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
so as you say actually in the show there

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.210 
so as you say actually in the show there
are<00:04:45.420> two<00:04:45.750> real<00:04:45.990> stars<00:04:46.350> there<00:04:47.010> are<00:04:47.130> the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
are two real stars there are the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.310 
are two real stars there are the
audience<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:48.360> course<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.750> carrots<00:04:49.140> are

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
audience and of course the carrots are

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.440 
audience and of course the carrots are
yourself<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.280> course<00:04:50.310> team<00:04:50.670> but<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.240> tower

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
yourself of course team but the tower

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.770 
yourself of course team but the tower
itself<00:04:51.900> is<00:04:52.140> very<00:04:52.560> much<00:04:52.890> a<00:04:53.190> part<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.090> big<00:04:54.420> part<00:04:54.690> of

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
itself is very much a part a big part of

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.390 
itself is very much a part a big part of
the<00:04:54.900> day<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.260> mean<00:04:55.440> in<00:04:55.590> addition<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:56.070> using

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
the day I mean in addition to using

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.700 
the day I mean in addition to using
technology<00:04:57.120> on<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.300> car<00:04:57.510> you<00:04:57.990> also<00:04:58.410> use

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
technology on the car you also use

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.850 
technology on the car you also use
technology<00:04:59.040> in<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.760> learning<00:05:00.380> example<00:05:01.380> in<00:05:01.740> my

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
technology in the learning example in my

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.460 
technology in the learning example in my
hand<00:05:02.160> here<00:05:02.430> have<00:05:03.090> been<00:05:03.180> useful<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.930> has<00:05:04.110> it's

gives<00:05:10.740> me<00:05:10.920> an<00:05:10.980> idea<00:05:11.280> of<00:05:11.310> what<00:05:11.790> kind<00:05:12.060> of

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
gives me an idea of what kind of

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.060 
gives me an idea of what kind of
technology<00:05:12.720> is<00:05:12.780> out<00:05:12.990> there<00:05:13.230> already<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.650> also

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
technology is out there already and also

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.650 
technology is out there already and also
even<00:05:14.460> thinking<00:05:14.790> about<00:05:14.820> what<00:05:15.000> they<00:05:15.300> could<00:05:15.540> do

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
even thinking about what they could do

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.630 
even thinking about what they could do
themselves<00:05:16.260> in<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.470> dealership<00:05:16.950> you<00:05:17.520> know

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
themselves in the dealership you know

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.720 
themselves in the dealership you know
the<00:05:17.790> tablet<00:05:18.390> PCs<00:05:18.780> are<00:05:19.020> fantastic<00:05:19.740> brilliant<00:05:20.640> I

guess it makes them feel a bit more

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.420 
guess it makes them feel a bit more
coming<00:05:22.260> up<00:05:22.350> today<00:05:22.500> and<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.740> bit<00:05:22.860> more<00:05:22.980> special
