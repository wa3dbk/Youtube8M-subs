with<00:03:36.690> restraints<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.830> just<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:38.700> harmonics

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
with restraints you just like harmonics

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
harmonic threw it away from the front

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.450 
harmonic threw it away from the front
with<00:03:48.810> two<00:03:49.140> or<00:03:49.320> more<00:03:49.470> fingers<00:03:52.010> that's<00:03:53.010> one<00:03:53.310> way

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
with two or more fingers that's one way

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.550 
with two or more fingers that's one way
to<00:03:53.490> get<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.820> or<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.900> other<00:03:54.990> one<00:03:58.790> like<00:03:59.790> that

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
to get it or the other one like that

there<00:04:15.120> who<00:04:15.450> just<00:04:15.630> use<00:04:15.840> windex<00:04:16.320> into<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.710> pot

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
there who just use windex into the pot

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:27.950 
there who just use windex into the pot
that's<00:04:17.190> not<00:04:17.489> good

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.140

alright identified be able to plan

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:45.390 
alright identified be able to plan
things<00:04:31.180> like<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.169> and<00:04:44.099> start<00:04:45.099> getting
