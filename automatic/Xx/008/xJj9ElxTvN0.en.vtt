fire slow it down or give it more air to
help<00:01:52.749> it<00:01:52.960> heat<00:01:53.469> up<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.530> lid<00:01:56.740> helps<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.450> lets

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
help it heat up the lid helps you lets

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.230 
help it heat up the lid helps you lets
you<00:01:58.600> hold<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:59.170> more<00:01:59.920> smoke<00:02:00.310> into<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.820> cooker

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
you hold in more smoke into the cooker

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.330 
you hold in more smoke into the cooker
and<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.229> can<00:02:02.439> actually<00:02:02.770> smoke<00:02:03.130> your

important<00:02:06.460> thing<00:02:06.520> here<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.560> design<00:02:08.920> of

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
important thing here with the design of

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.670 
important thing here with the design of
the<00:02:09.340> cooker<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:10.360> distance<00:02:10.869> between<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
the cooker is the distance between the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.610 
the cooker is the distance between the
fire<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.340> grate<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:13.630> you've<00:02:13.810> got<00:02:13.990> 16

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
fire and the grate so now you've got 16

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.330 
fire and the grate so now you've got 16
plus<00:02:15.010> inches<00:02:15.420> between<00:02:16.420> your<00:02:16.630> your<00:02:17.620> charcoal

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
plus inches between your your charcoal

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.220 
plus inches between your your charcoal
and<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.210> meat

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
and the meat

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.890 
and the meat
instead<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.860> cooking<00:02:21.640> three<00:02:22.300> or<00:02:22.420> four<00:02:22.599> inches

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
instead of cooking three or four inches

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.559 
instead of cooking three or four inches
away<00:02:23.110> from<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:25.209> fire<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:28.150> makes<00:02:28.360> it

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
away from the fire and so it it makes it

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.640 
away from the fire and so it it makes it
very<00:02:28.930> easy<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:29.769> cook<00:02:30.370> perfect<00:02:31.209> chicken<00:02:31.650> every

time even if you've never done this
before<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:36.040> don't<00:02:36.159> need<00:02:36.370> six<00:02:37.239> months
