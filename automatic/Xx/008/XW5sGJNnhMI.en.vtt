now<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:23.070> stand<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.400> front<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.699> sensor<00:00:23.939> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
now you stand in front of the sensor and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.509 
now you stand in front of the sensor and
within<00:00:25.050> about<00:00:25.320> three<00:00:25.560> minutes<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.980> creates<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
within about three minutes it creates a

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.040 
within about three minutes it creates a
version<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.599> works<00:00:27.810> for

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
version of you so that works for

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.109 
version of you so that works for
children<00:00:28.619> adults<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.429> well<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.789> instead<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
children adults as well so instead of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.339 
children adults as well so instead of

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
you having to go through lots of menus

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.920 
you having to go through lots of menus

that<00:02:30.560> was<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> massive<00:02:31.099> technical<00:02:31.430> lead<00:02:31.730> now<00:02:31.940> he

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
that was a massive technical lead now he

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.130 
that was a massive technical lead now he
might<00:02:32.150> not<00:02:32.300> seemed<00:02:32.599> it<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.870> we<00:02:32.930> didn't<00:02:33.080> want

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
might not seemed it and we didn't want

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.449 
might not seemed it and we didn't want
it<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.349> see<00:02:33.590> me<00:02:33.739> we<00:02:33.830> didn't<00:02:33.980> want<00:02:34.099> people<00:02:34.370> to

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459

think<00:02:34.489> this<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.849> technically<00:02:35.300> amazing<00:02:35.720> we

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
think this is technically amazing we

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.150 
think this is technically amazing we
just<00:02:35.959> won't<00:02:36.080> be<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.260> good<00:02:36.440> thing<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:37.010> is

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
just won't be a good thing this is

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.620 
just won't be a good thing this is
brilliant<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.640> know<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.030> how<00:02:38.269> I<00:02:38.300> play

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
brilliant you know this is how I play

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.170 
brilliant you know this is how I play
goal<00:02:39.069> so<00:02:40.069> we've<00:02:40.220> done<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> same<00:02:40.640> again<00:02:40.940> so

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
goal so we've done the same again so

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.000 
goal so we've done the same again so
with<00:02:41.330> something<00:02:41.569> like<00:02:41.660> wait<00:02:41.900> racing<00:02:42.349> in<00:02:42.739> order

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
with something like wait racing in order

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.350 
with something like wait racing in order
to<00:02:43.099> accelerate<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.670> hold<00:02:43.880> out<00:02:44.000> your<00:02:44.030> hand

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
to accelerate you hold out your hand

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.030 
to accelerate you hold out your hand
when<00:02:44.959> your<00:02:45.080> hands<00:02:45.230> completely<00:02:45.470> open<00:02:45.950> you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
when your hands completely open you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.470 
when your hands completely open you
won't<00:02:46.250> move<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:46.760> it's<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.090> fist<00:02:47.299> that's

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
won't move when it's in a fist that's

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.940 
won't move when it's in a fist that's
full<00:02:47.720> speed<00:02:47.959> but<00:02:48.080> anywhere<00:02:48.349> between<00:02:48.560> there

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
full speed but anywhere between there

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.680 
full speed but anywhere between there
it's<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.430> sensitive<00:02:49.880> we<00:02:50.000> can<00:02:50.180> read<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.540> so

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
it's that sensitive we can read it so

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.820 
it's that sensitive we can read it so
you<00:02:50.750> can<00:02:50.930> incrementally<00:02:51.049> chain<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.709> your

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
you can incrementally chain it your

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.190 
you can incrementally chain it your
speed<00:02:52.040> yeah<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:53.180> again<00:02:53.540> with<00:02:53.690> what<00:02:53.840> climbing

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
speed yeah and again with what climbing

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.479 
speed yeah and again with what climbing
it's<00:02:54.319> open<00:02:54.560> closed<00:02:54.769> hands<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.220> it's<00:02:55.370> all<00:02:55.459> about
