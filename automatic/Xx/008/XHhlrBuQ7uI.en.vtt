00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:07.229
 providence and exciting encounter with god my daughters a segment to say it 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:10.729
 in some way that can not be surprising profane 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.729
 but so far the previous month 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.259
 also expressed the intervention of a financial entity included in its 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.099
 lists I also have the same modality without doubts a child 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.159
 the dance as its name indicates 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:30.260
 talk about 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.749
 in that field 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.810
 talk about the movement 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.740
 talk about expressing 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.260
 with the body what it is and what it experiences 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.700
 the emotions 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.130
 i contemplation 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.060
 s 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.140
 get in 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.270
 gently 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.210
 to by understanding and experiencing that hemisphere of God 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.199
 i launch contemplative eees 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.510
 the experience 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.000
 show 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.510
 and show you 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.510
 how you are and what you gave easily 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.140
 one of the main Spanish companies in contemplative dance 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.510
 Gastón Fernández 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.350
 the water system a simple dance easy to learn who demands large 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.540
 displacements sometimes even without seeing chelsea 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.360
 At this moment it provokes a feeling of relaxation 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.140
 efe-cantabria 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.360
 Headquarters 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 the ultimate meaning of s'aranjassa osasuna 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.640
 the winner is intended 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.910
 revilla 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.660
 before people 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.660
 I also participated in them 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.790
 between an experience of encounter with God 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.940
 with yourself 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.910
 still with others 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.580
 the initiation ritual to the contemplative dance is not complicated 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.010
 the first session is ideal to face the shyness and the logical distrust 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.990
 who has never joined the science of liberation 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.189
 when people want to start in the contemplative dance 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.289
 the first thing we do 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.449
 is to explain the meaning of dance 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.129
 this is that sense 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.269
 the encounter is limited to the person there is a contrast with herself 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.769
 with the rest 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.009
 and with God 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.539
 the sense of advancing with others 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.369
 invites 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.189
 to hala fellowship 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.189
 i therefore after all the dances that are done and that are learning 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.849
 They are precisely ficus dancer that are made in circles are made in groups 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.499
 to enhance precisely that sense of communion 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.169
 the first that 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.159
 what do we do that people do 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.159
 percent is the listening exercise we listen 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.260
 we let in this sense they are opening 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.149
 to capture through music through the images 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.989
 through gestures 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.989
 locke in god if he wants to transmit 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.949
 and be able to put it in motion 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.419
 then in a second moment 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:17.999
 we let 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.209
 that our body move 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.539
 to the beat of 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.029
 of that music 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.139
 that our emotions our feeling flow 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.669
 later 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.569
 we generate broad 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.979
 you can not squat 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.489
 a type of movement that has previously been choreography 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.110
 It was recently held in the Cathedral of Seville 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.110
 the meeting of young people around the difficult circumstances 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.879
 one of the workshops of the program of the meeting three years ago in the plaza 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.779
 san marcos 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.709
 it was dedicated contemplative praises 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.359
 the election was not the result of chance because there are many ties 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.059
 that link this type of expression with the prayer model offered to 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.059
 young people in the thesis community 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.190
 between the canons 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.190
 the canon of tc the different tdt channels 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.180
 aa as we move forward because they are one percent in repetitive movements that help the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.499
 internalization 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.969
 and there is the key or the nexus 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.249
 e union 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.569
 between what 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.120
 PC edges 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.680
 and the contemplative dances 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.580
 because both invite 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.039
 a prayer experience 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.009
 both limited 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.669
 it will not go deep 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.360
 before the experience of relationship with God 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.789
 and the fact we should not repeat 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.439
 the movements 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.249
 to the beat 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:00.270
 the or the different rules antiphons that also repeat the descent 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.999
 maiorana 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:07.099
 Like any form of prayer, the contemplative cause does not stick to a 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.960
 enthusiastic public 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.500
 anyone with no age limit and I took a single requirement to show the barriers 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.889
 so special of the body across the country 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.889
 can participate in this informative session 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360
 unfortunately, in the end it does not have the imipe 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.650
 for the genre 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.099
 men and women 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.569
 we can dance 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.150
 the tripod days 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.150
 Personal and community encounters with God 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.550
 without more restrictions than the capacity for a few months announced that the music 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.689
 national in every moment
