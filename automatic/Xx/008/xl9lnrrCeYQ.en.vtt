00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.260 
going to eliminate fog on this guy
you're<00:00:34.739> also<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.850> quick

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you're also going to have the quick

you're also going to have the quick
quick<00:00:36.600> removable<00:00:37.290> washable<00:00:37.530> liner<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
quick removable washable liner as you

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.970 
quick removable washable liner as you
can<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> shell<00:00:40.140> shape<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
can see from the shell shape it's a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
can see from the shell shape it's a
medium<00:00:41.370> oval<00:00:41.700> shell<00:00:41.910> shape<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
medium oval shell shape so it's going to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.040 
medium oval shell shape so it's going to
fit<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.320> wide<00:00:43.379> range<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.399> head<00:00:44.789> shapes<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.899> one

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
fit a wide range of head shapes but one

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
fit a wide range of head shapes but one
of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.559> neat<00:00:46.710> things<00:00:46.739> aside<00:00:47.250> from<00:00:47.550> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
of the really neat things aside from you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.190 
of the really neat things aside from you
know<00:00:47.940> some<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> ventilation<00:00:48.750> options<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
know some of the ventilation options is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.229 
know some of the ventilation options is
that<00:00:49.500> scorpion<00:00:50.160> uses<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> quick<00:00:50.940> shift

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that scorpion uses the quick shift

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
that scorpion uses the quick shift
shield<00:00:51.660> replacement<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.379> she'll<00:00:52.770> change

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
shield replacement or she'll change

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.630 
shield replacement or she'll change
module<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.730> that's<00:00:54.059> done<00:00:54.329> by<00:00:54.510> turning<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
module and that's done by turning that

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.770 
module and that's done by turning that
both<00:00:56.640> sides<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.059> face<00:00:57.210> shield<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:57.570> pop

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
both sides of the face shield would pop

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.510 
both sides of the face shield would pop
off<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.469> becomes<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.890> simple<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.370> change

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
off and it becomes very simple to change

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.790 
off and it becomes very simple to change
that<00:00:59.760> liner<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.539> other<00:01:00.809> piece<00:01:01.320> that's<00:01:01.530> neat

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that liner the other piece that's neat

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.009 
that liner the other piece that's neat
about<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.340> mechanism<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.840> when<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
about this mechanism is that when a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.200 
about this mechanism is that when a
shield<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> open<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.640> notice<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
shield is open you notice that we have a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
shield is open you notice that we have a
multi<00:01:06.540> ratchet<00:01:06.960> system<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.070> down

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
multi ratchet system but as you get down

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.550 
multi ratchet system but as you get down
closer<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.060> last<00:01:09.450> ratchet<00:01:10.200> it's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
closer to that last ratchet it's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.679 
closer to that last ratchet it's
actually<00:01:10.890> spring-loaded<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.119> you'll<00:01:12.479> notice

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
actually spring-loaded and you'll notice

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.330 
actually spring-loaded and you'll notice
that<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.200> happens<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> put<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that what happens is when you put it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.039 
that what happens is when you put it
completely<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.180> pulls<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.840> phase

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
completely down it pulls the phase

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.840 
completely down it pulls the phase
shield<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.439> towards<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> helmet<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.580> takes

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
shield in towards the helmet it takes

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.969 
shield in towards the helmet it takes
this<00:01:18.030> gasket<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.080> creates<00:01:19.350> even<00:01:19.680> pressure

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
this gasket and it creates even pressure

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
this gasket and it creates even pressure
on<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.820> create<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.119> completely<00:01:21.570> waterproof

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
on it to create a completely waterproof

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.320 
on it to create a completely waterproof
and<00:01:22.470> weatherproof<00:01:23.460> seal<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.090> that's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and weatherproof seal and that's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.550 
and weatherproof seal and that's
something<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> lot<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> helmets<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
something with a lot of helmets that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
something with a lot of helmets that
just<00:01:25.770> come<00:01:25.890> flat<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.400> you're<00:01:27.000> only<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.360> good

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
just come flat down you're only as good

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
just come flat down you're only as good
as<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.869> gasket<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.380> till<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.650> starts<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> wear

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
as that gasket is till it starts to wear

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.920 
as that gasket is till it starts to wear
out<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.880> start<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.689> know<00:01:30.720> you'll

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
out and you start to you know you'll

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.270 
out and you start to you know you'll
start<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.650> daylight<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.130> there

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
start to get a little daylight in there

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
start to get a little daylight in there
with<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.060> having<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.659> spring-loaded

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
with this having a spring-loaded

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140 
with this having a spring-loaded
mechanism<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:35.280> gonna<00:01:35.400> keep<00:01:35.610> constant

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
mechanism it's gonna keep constant

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
mechanism it's gonna keep constant
tension<00:01:36.210> constant<00:01:36.990> pressure<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.409> you're

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
tension constant pressure and you're

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.050 
tension constant pressure and you're
going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> get<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> best<00:01:38.280> potential<00:01:38.670> seal

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
going to get the best potential seal
