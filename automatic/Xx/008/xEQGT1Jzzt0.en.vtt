emerald endive that I grew last year and
while<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> grew<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.360> spring<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.320> is

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
while I grew it in in the spring this is

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.800 
while I grew it in in the spring this is
the<00:02:01.619> original<00:02:02.040> plant<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.549> there<00:02:02.850> trying

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the original plant right in there trying

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.399 
the original plant right in there trying
to<00:02:03.869> keep<00:02:04.020> my<00:02:04.200> shadow<00:02:04.469> out<00:02:04.939> that<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
to keep my shadow out that is a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.460 
to keep my shadow out that is a
perennial<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.910> chicory<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.110> endive

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
perennial so this chicory or this endive

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.930 
perennial so this chicory or this endive
will<00:02:10.770> come<00:02:10.950> back<00:02:11.069> year<00:02:11.310> after<00:02:11.340> year<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.819> you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
will come back year after year if you

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.070 
will come back year after year if you
plant<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.300> your<00:02:12.420> garden<00:02:12.540> at<00:02:12.810> least<00:02:12.930> in

plant it in your garden at least in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.030 
plant it in your garden at least in
Maryland<00:02:13.379> zone

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
Maryland zone

going to harvest these greens

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.060 
going to harvest these greens
it<00:02:17.370> also<00:02:17.520> seeded<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.990> seeded<00:02:19.350> itself<00:02:19.770> in

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
it also seeded and it seeded itself in

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.640 
it also seeded and it seeded itself in
the<00:02:20.490> original<00:02:20.910> box<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.080> was<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.410> and

so I'm gonna have some great greens
they're<00:02:33.420> kind<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.810> dandelions<00:02:34.700> sort<00:02:35.700> of

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
they're kind of like dandelions sort of

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.820 
they're kind of like dandelions sort of
on<00:02:35.880> steroids<00:02:36.120> they<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> great<00:02:37.380> sweeter

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
on steroids they have a great sweeter

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.560 
on steroids they have a great sweeter
flavor<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.730> cool<00:02:38.910> weather<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.210> of<00:02:39.330> course

flavor in the cool weather and of course

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.960 
flavor in the cool weather and of course
in<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.290> summer<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.740> lot<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.070> different

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
in the summer like a lot of different

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
greens they get bitter back there or

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.670 
greens they get bitter back there or
French<00:02:45.950> breakfast<00:02:46.950> radishes<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.690> put<00:02:49.530> them

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
French breakfast radishes and I put them

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.830 
French breakfast radishes and I put them
about<00:02:49.950> two<00:02:50.250> inches<00:02:50.520> apart<00:02:50.580> each<00:02:51.150> way<00:02:51.420> they

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
about two inches apart each way they

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.830 
about two inches apart each way they
will<00:02:52.440> grow<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.610> shape<00:02:54.180> sort<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.570> like<00:02:54.660> your

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
will grow to a shape sort of like your

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720 
will grow to a shape sort of like your
thumb<00:02:55.020> like<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:56.070> they<00:02:56.190> don't<00:02:56.220> need<00:02:56.550> as

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
thumb like that so they don't need as

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.040 
thumb like that so they don't need as
much<00:02:56.910> space<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:57.390> some<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.660> round<00:02:57.840> ones

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
much space as some of the round ones

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.960 
much space as some of the round ones
which<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.320> recommend<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.830> do<00:02:59.010> about<00:02:59.670> four

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
which I recommend you do about four

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.230 
which I recommend you do about four
inches<00:03:00.270> but<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.690> put<00:03:01.100> two<00:03:02.100> seeds<00:03:02.490> in<00:03:02.820> each<00:03:02.970> hole

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
inches but I put two seeds in each hole

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.320 
inches but I put two seeds in each hole
and<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:03.870> gonna<00:03:04.080> send<00:03:04.350> those<00:03:04.470> out<00:03:04.710> today<00:03:05.330> I'll

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
and I'm gonna send those out today I'll

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.050 
and I'm gonna send those out today I'll
also<00:03:06.510> actually<00:03:07.470> cut<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.220> video<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.670> second

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
also actually cut the video in a second

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.830 
also actually cut the video in a second
then<00:03:09.450> I'm<00:03:09.570> going<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.750> show<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:09.990> how<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.740> take

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
then I'm going to show you how to take

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.930 
then I'm going to show you how to take
this<00:03:12.840> red<00:03:13.110> lettuce<00:03:13.470> I'm<00:03:13.740> gonna<00:03:13.920> cut<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.220> down

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
this red lettuce I'm gonna cut that down

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.520 
this red lettuce I'm gonna cut that down
and<00:03:15.300> just<00:03:15.600> leave<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.960> roots<00:03:16.170> in<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.440> ground

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
and just leave the roots in the ground

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.060 
and just leave the roots in the ground
and<00:03:16.920> then<00:03:17.209> transplant<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.800> into<00:03:19.800> one<00:03:19.950> of

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
and then transplant that into one of

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.000 
and then transplant that into one of
these<00:03:20.130> boxes<00:03:20.780> because<00:03:21.780> it'll<00:03:21.989> be<00:03:22.050> like<00:03:22.230> cut

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
these boxes because it'll be like cut

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.250 
these boxes because it'll be like cut
and<00:03:23.040> come<00:03:23.340> again<00:03:23.370> lettuces<00:03:24.030> where<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:25.110> think

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
and come again lettuces where I think

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.800 
and come again lettuces where I think
I'll<00:03:25.500> probably<00:03:25.590> stick<00:03:25.950> them<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.160> container

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
I'll probably stick them in a container

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.860 
I'll probably stick them in a container
where<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.080> root<00:03:28.230> system<00:03:28.709> will<00:03:29.400> stay<00:03:30.300> live<00:03:30.540> and

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
where the root system will stay live and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.449 
where the root system will stay live and
it's<00:03:31.230> going<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.470> generate<00:03:31.590> new<00:03:31.980> leaf<00:03:32.190> growth

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
it's going to generate new leaf growth

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.190 
it's going to generate new leaf growth
so<00:03:32.760> I'm<00:03:33.239> going<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.570> save<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> little<00:03:33.930> bit<00:03:34.080> of

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
so I'm going to save a little bit of

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.250 
so I'm going to save a little bit of
time<00:03:34.500> by<00:03:34.830> putting<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:41.130> then<00:03:41.430> finally<00:03:41.970> I

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
time by putting and then finally I
