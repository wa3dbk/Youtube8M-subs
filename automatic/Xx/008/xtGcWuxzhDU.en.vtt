00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
Philippines a stream cooperated group

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.490 
Philippines a stream cooperated group
it's<00:00:33.329> only<00:00:33.450> eight<00:00:33.690> megabytes<00:00:33.930> that's<00:00:34.350> not

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
it's only eight megabytes that's not

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.190 
it's only eight megabytes that's not
that<00:00:34.590> great<00:00:35.600> okay<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.840> reason<00:00:36.960> why<00:00:37.140> this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that great okay so the reason why this

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.780 
that great okay so the reason why this
thing's<00:00:37.469> opened<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
thing's opened up is because I have to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.130 
thing's opened up is because I have to
replace<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> heatsink<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
replace the heatsink as you can see you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.959 
replace the heatsink as you can see you
the<00:00:40.320> original<00:00:40.590> heatsink<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.790> really

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the original heatsink it's not really

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.360 
the original heatsink it's not really
spinning<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> happy<00:00:43.230> heatsink<00:00:43.649> it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
spinning it's not a happy heatsink it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
spinning it's not a happy heatsink it
actually<00:00:44.700> failed<00:00:44.879> last<00:00:45.059> time<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.420> burn<00:00:45.719> my

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
actually failed last time and burn my

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
actually failed last time and burn my
hard<00:00:46.260> drive<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.800> thing's<00:00:47.010> put<00:00:47.610> it's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
hard drive so this thing's put it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.660 
hard drive so this thing's put it's
going<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.710> seven<00:00:49.980> bucks<00:00:50.100> I'll<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.610> able

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
going but for seven bucks I'll be able

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.209 
going but for seven bucks I'll be able
to<00:00:50.789> buy<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.270> brand<00:00:51.989> new<00:00:52.140> heatsink<00:00:52.379> run-chase

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
to buy a brand new heatsink run-chase

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.610 
to buy a brand new heatsink run-chase
use<00:00:53.579> foot<00:00:54.090> good<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.539> new<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.590> see

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
use foot good as new and as you can see

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.479 
use foot good as new and as you can see
here<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> spins<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.309> happy<00:00:56.430> little

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
here it spins like a happy little

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.010 
here it spins like a happy little
pinwheels<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.120> hopefully<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.719> will<00:00:57.840> solve

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
pinwheels so hopefully this will solve

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.860 
pinwheels so hopefully this will solve
all<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> heating<00:00:58.530> problems<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> plan<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
all the heating problems so the plan the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.110 
all the heating problems so the plan the
plan<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.199> I'm<00:01:01.469> gonna<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:02.550> them<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> keep<00:01:02.879> sync

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
plan is I'm gonna get them you keep sync

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.179 
plan is I'm gonna get them you keep sync
mount<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.320> over<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> processor

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
mount it in here over the processor

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
mount it in here over the processor
apply<00:01:05.549> thermal<00:01:05.880> grease<00:01:06.150> okay<00:01:06.720> wait<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.960> how

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
apply thermal grease okay wait know how

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.080 
apply thermal grease okay wait know how
apply<00:01:07.260> thermal<00:01:07.380> grease<00:01:07.590> first<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.640> mount<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
apply thermal grease first then mount it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.080 
apply thermal grease first then mount it
and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:10.260> using<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.890> harder<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.580> day<00:01:11.939> old

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and then using this harder that day old

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.219 
and then using this harder that day old
dad<00:01:12.210> donate<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.600> me<00:01:12.689> i'm<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> try<00:01:13.140> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
dad donate to me i'm going to try and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.690 
dad donate to me i'm going to try and
keyed<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> system<00:01:13.830> hot<00:01:14.070> enough<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> find

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
keyed up the system hot enough to find

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
keyed up the system hot enough to find
the<00:01:15.540> thermal<00:01:15.840> grease<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.290> zinc<00:01:16.470> oxide<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the thermal grease the zinc oxide to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
the thermal grease the zinc oxide to
make<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.299> can't<00:01:18.299> repeat<00:01:18.509> efficiently<00:01:18.900> through

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
make it can't repeat efficiently through

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.469 
make it can't repeat efficiently through
the<00:01:19.110> heatsink<00:01:19.880> hopefully<00:01:20.880> i'll<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> good

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the heatsink hopefully i'll have a good

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.070 
the heatsink hopefully i'll have a good
system<00:01:23.240> yeah<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.420> harder<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.810> actually

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
system yeah this harder is actually

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.899 
system yeah this harder is actually
really<00:01:25.320> thick<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.430> initially<00:01:26.549> worried

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
really thick i was initially worried

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.550 
really thick i was initially worried
that<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.090> wouldn't<00:01:27.210> fit<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.900> judging<00:01:28.530> from

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that it wouldn't fit but judging from

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.240 
that it wouldn't fit but judging from
the<00:01:28.710> brackets<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:30.860> laptop<00:01:31.860> looks

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
the brackets that are in a laptop looks

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.920 
the brackets that are in a laptop looks
like<00:01:32.400> it'll<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> laptop<00:01:33.450> hard<00:01:33.810> drive

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
like it'll for the laptop hard drive

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.420 
like it'll for the laptop hard drive
with<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> flick<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.350> will<00:01:34.439> fit<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.829> i'm<00:01:35.189> gonna

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
with a flick it will fit so i'm gonna

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.850 
with a flick it will fit so i'm gonna
have<00:01:35.640> about<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.530> reason<00:01:37.650> why<00:01:37.799> i'm

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
have about that and the reason why i'm

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.990 
have about that and the reason why i'm
getting<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.250> work<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> through<00:01:38.880> this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
getting this to work is the through this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.999 
getting this to work is the through this
