00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.809
 at the las vegas consumer electronic show 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.900
 toshiba presents its chromebook 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.500
 version of chromebook for toshiba in a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.390
 13 inch display and 3 then the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.970
 choice went on this type of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.790
 display only on the 13 inch display 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.790
 three standard resolutions 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.250
 very linear pc then we see the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.580
 characterization with the logo with the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.700
 chrome logo but finish chrome os 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.940
 in plastic in this aluminum finish 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.850
 metallic aluminum we see typical 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.730
 of operating system chrome os a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.010
 menu icon system where you can 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.600
 start browsing with everything 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.260
 there is pre installed which we recognize 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.050
 the classic sounds of the world of the world 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.350
 google as low as that of the dacron 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.630
 browser and from and to gmail plus all 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.170
 google docs google icons that 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.180
 allow the use of the classics 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.550
 word processing programs or sheets of 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530
 I work because we are here we are used to 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.290
 the menu here and then fans and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.320
 customizable with icons that can 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.479
 be blocked on the bar 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.570
 navigation while on this side 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.030
 then we have the first settings both those 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.700
 the basic ones that give us the classic 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.310
 the classic user that the possibility of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.350
 making signs marks the management out 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.149
 of the bluetooth then over with the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.340
 general wireless connectivity also 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.250
 the one that bluetooth that of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.130
 boxes and then the settings that bring us 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.700
 instead on the page of chrome os that there 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.350
 they then lead to a little more 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.360
 detailed settings here for example 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.830
 if we want to see that one of the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.990
 screen we see that the resolution 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:03.710
 the classic standard 1300 66 xx 768 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.409
 there is still more advanced part then for i 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.690
 various settings that are still very much 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.930
 very user friendly disk also type 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.590
 of product that is meant for a 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.130
 I use mainly web and above all 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.290
 therefore navigation and use of 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.130
 resources and network resources use 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:30.519
 network resources thanks to the processor 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:35.209
 new generation intel celeron 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.190
 so 16GB flash disk memory 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.280
 with the ability to download 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.830
 however, save all the data on the PC 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.650
 more important and then chromebook takes place 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:52.160
 already given with the google drive license 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.840
 with 100 gb of cloud space then with the 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.380
 possibility to save and to have in 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.799
 cloud 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.450
 all our data the main data 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.069
 on toshiba chromebooks we notice one 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.260
 slightly different keyboard in the 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.320
 layout from that typical of the world 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.500
 windows to which we are accustomed indeed 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.690
 we notice above in the first row of 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.489
 keys the lack of classic keys 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.600
 functions that in this case are 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:20.359
 been replaced by new function keys 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.870
 very simple and intuitive with for 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.940
 settings of the user and in addition the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.709
 power on power on button that comes 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.319
 inserted just like a physical key 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.440
 standard size keyboard thanks 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.049
 to the 13 inch format and then three keys 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.370
 island keyboard and size keys 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.280
 normal 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.400
 the touchpad in this case is centered 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.680
 as from the classic toshiba in standard 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.590
 middle of the keyboard allows me it 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.020
 complete scrolling on one side from a 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.390
 at the other end of the cursor a quick one 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.580
 overview instead of doors 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.620
 we see on the right side an HDMI port e 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.650
 two usb ports 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.010
 in this case both used and in 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:14.110
 plus the headphone jack and the microphone 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.230
 on the left side instead we note further 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.270
 the slot for the cable the cable kensington 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.000
 and the slot for the power supply for 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:25.560
 the power supply and the classic the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.380
 classic card reader for 16 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:36.190
 obviously on the screen we have webcams 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:38.440
 and microphone while at the bottom 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.630
 we ask that the format chosen by 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.510
 toshiba is unibody therefore with battery 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.130
 not directly accessible from 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.460
 by the user and with the two speakers 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.200
 stereo positioned here so you can 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.140
 exploit when the case is placed 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.140
 of resonance and have a more or more sound 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.400
 complete and and more powerful for per 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.720
 the user in use 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:07.880
 available in the united states already from 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:10.940

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.639

 the price is not yet defined though 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.720
 as from classic classic story 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.770
 which we have usually seen 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.530
 the indication is provided by dal 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.660
 united states price for italy in 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.250
 this moment Italy will not be among the 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.070
 prime country in europe where it comes from 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.800

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.930
 our users in the short and in the short 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.930
 period
