and I select a preset first the black I
might<00:01:26.439> be<00:01:26.619> set<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.159> then<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.310> select<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:28.920> dress

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
and also the the studio wall it's like

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.419 
and also the the studio wall it's like
okay<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:38.409> I<00:01:38.439> drag<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:39.069> horizontal<00:01:39.369> line<00:01:41.429> and

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
okay then I drag a horizontal line and

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.139 
okay then I drag a horizontal line and
that's<00:01:42.700> basically<00:01:43.179> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that's basically it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.059 
that's basically it
what<00:01:46.149> I<00:01:46.179> also<00:01:46.390> do<00:01:46.689> is<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:47.020> assume<00:01:47.110> in<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.770> little

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
what I also do is I assume in a little

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.980 
what I also do is I assume in a little
closer<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.700> notice<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.509> difference

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
closer and I notice this the difference

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.339 
closer and I notice this the difference
and<00:01:50.860> go<00:01:50.920> back<00:01:51.189> into<00:01:51.369> my<00:01:51.490> image<00:01:51.729> layer<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:53.140> my

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
and go back into my image layer is my

00:01:53.349 --> 00:02:12.550 
and go back into my image layer is my
race<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:56.549> gently<00:01:57.569> clean<00:01:58.569> that<00:01:58.810> area

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.410 

so<00:02:13.560> use<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.739> smaller<00:02:14.129> brush<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.819> clean<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.269> up

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
so use a smaller brush to clean it up

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.020 
so use a smaller brush to clean it up
and<00:02:16.939> it's<00:02:17.939> basically<00:02:18.450> really<00:02:19.049> so<00:02:19.890> simple<00:02:20.069> it

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and it's basically really so simple it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:30.619 
and it's basically really so simple it
only<00:02:21.209> takes<00:02:21.510> two<00:02:21.659> minutes<00:02:29.269> once<00:02:30.269> I'm<00:02:30.450> happy

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
only takes two minutes once I'm happy

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:39.259 
only takes two minutes once I'm happy
with<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.079> I<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:36.150> go<00:02:36.359> in<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:37.939> place<00:02:38.939> my<00:02:39.090> logo

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
with it I just go in and place my logo

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.380 
with it I just go in and place my logo
where<00:02:39.689> I<00:02:39.720> want<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.530> that's<00:02:43.739> basically<00:02:44.390> okay

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
where I want and that's basically okay

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.370 
where I want and that's basically okay
