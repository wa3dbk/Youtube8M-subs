00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
so your first sticking third finger

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.070 
so your first sticking third finger
thumb<00:02:07.990> one<00:02:08.590> two<00:02:09.100> three<00:02:09.610> okay<00:02:10.270> I'm<00:02:10.690> one<00:02:10.899> two

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
thumb one two three okay I'm one two

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.570 
thumb one two three okay I'm one two
three<00:02:11.320> is<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.470> way<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.620> think<00:02:11.860> about<00:02:11.980> that

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
three is the way to think about that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.090 
three is the way to think about that
now<00:02:14.000> if<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.210> can<00:02:14.330> get<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.570> even

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.920 

and<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.220> slowly<00:02:20.700> build<00:02:21.060> up<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> speed<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and to slowly build up on the speed of

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.100 
and to slowly build up on the speed of
that<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:24.060> won't<00:02:24.300> happen<00:02:24.390> innocent<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:24.990> you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
that it won't happen innocent like you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.900 
that it won't happen innocent like you
notice<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.470> last<00:02:25.650> one<00:02:25.890> was<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.070> bit<00:02:26.220> ticket<00:02:26.760> it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
notice that last one was a bit ticket it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.480 
notice that last one was a bit ticket it
wasn't<00:02:27.210> quite<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.570> was<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.860> just<00:02:28.860> bump<00:02:29.130> that

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
wasn't quite it was it just bump that

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.640 
wasn't quite it was it just bump that
down<00:02:29.550> don't<00:02:30.330> at<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:30.720> time<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.350> don't<00:02:31.500> want

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
down don't at that time we don't want

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.620 
down don't at that time we don't want
dumb<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> time<00:02:32.580> we<00:02:32.700> want<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.060> deter<00:02:33.420> them

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
dumb that the time we want to deter them

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.290 
dumb that the time we want to deter them
that<00:02:34.260> they're<00:02:34.380> done<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.730> then<00:02:38.820> what<00:02:38.940> happens

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
that they're done and then what happens

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.520 
that they're done and then what happens
eventually<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.750> end<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:39.960> doing<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.260> sort<00:02:40.470> of

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
eventually we end up doing this sort of

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.120 
eventually we end up doing this sort of
roll<00:02:40.890> with<00:02:40.920> our<00:02:41.280> hand<00:02:41.550> like<00:02:42.530> we<00:02:43.530> were<00:02:43.650> peeling

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
roll with our hand like we were peeling

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.170 
roll with our hand like we were peeling
our<00:02:44.400> fingers<00:02:44.850> off<00:02:45.290> from<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.410> thumb<00:02:46.770> first

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
our fingers off from the thumb first

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.850 
our fingers off from the thumb first
rotating<00:02:48.180> our<00:02:48.300> hand<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.720> way<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.260> that

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
rotating our hand this way and that

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.880 
rotating our hand this way and that
means<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:52.080> was<00:02:52.170> rotating<00:02:52.380> our<00:02:52.800> hand<00:02:53.040> off<00:02:53.250> there

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
means it was rotating our hand off there

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.120 
means it was rotating our hand off there
okay

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
okay

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.840 
okay
pretty<00:02:56.790> simple<00:02:58.160> sounds<00:02:59.160> really<00:02:59.340> effective

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
pretty simple sounds really effective

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.850 
pretty simple sounds really effective
and<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.480> quicker<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.780> get<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.800> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
and in the quicker you get it and the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.140 
and in the quicker you get it and the
more<00:03:02.010> accurate<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.489> get<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.730> sounds<00:03:03.000> really

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
more accurate you get it sounds really

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.000 
more accurate you get it sounds really
awesome<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:04.110> other<00:03:04.230> thing<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.530> think<00:03:04.739> about

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
awesome the other thing to think about
