00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.130

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.870
 welcome to a little hers 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.660
 quotes classic 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.850
 comments that means we now see the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.920
 classes selection classes settings 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 I made myself so together 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.600
 have and of course still the conclusion 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.490
 I was not in the beginning and I was not in the beginning 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.880
 so sure what a game mode 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.369
 I now confirm conclusion then 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.440
 domination that's all this standard 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.469
 things and I thought to myself comes 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.530
 as well as playing team deathmatch has in 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.820
 share the former black ops 1 etc 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.219
 Great fun we have done quite often 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.700
 played and yes that is possible today 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.739
 see 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.789
 to my class, I'll be the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.210
 Everything probably went a bit 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.489
 fast 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.469
 We start with the conclusion series 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.620
 For a team I have the match 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.309
 then picked the hunter killer drone 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.530
 the stocks and the contador without a drone 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.420
 I wanted to take extra with you because yes 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 there are many people with ghost 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.320
 run around track and then I would come 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.420
 that better and now to mine 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.510
 class just seen very briefly 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.680
 I then play with the vector as 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.229
 towers silencer reflex visor 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.960
 Perks blind supervisor and hardliner im 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.740
 first slot then in second action 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.360
 and plunderers and in the third dead silence 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.380
 it looks like this role and I would say 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.619
 tough to save in the gameplay is that 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.810
 are tui green crosshair holla the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.000
 waldfee you can do it you times 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.939
 So as you said friends you have also in 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.119
 title read my best black ops 2 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.770
 play until now 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.020
 Of course, there is one or singing first 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.780
 Of course there are some of those 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.860
 call their best gameplay something with 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.689
 100 plus etc 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.479
 but what friends I really am 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.350
 latte because it is enough to say one 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.170
 times 12 1 or so does not mean that now 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.020
 the game 12 1 starts but the game 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.110
 I enjoyed myself it was one 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.039
 nice round and I would say to 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.769
 is look at 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.599
 also cool that me the most important thing 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.650
 it play or the gameplay nice 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.730
 to be looked at 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.109
 Of course I know some big videos 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.299
 some gameplay say we are for one 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.019
 art that I know myself but this as 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.629
 said friends 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.290
 that was from the beginning to the end of the 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.150
 class selection then what's going on 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.970
 on and circle running and still on 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.019
 knife here so as I said from the beginning 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.810
 until the end 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.209
 just his that is from the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.099
 classes selection of the completion series 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.079
 then of course from the gameplay itself and 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.189
 how should I say that was just times 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.519
 fun made friends 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.489
 It was just fun this game 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.370
 to play and show you so 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.569
 class I had mentioned the map the map 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.680
 we were not there yet we were playing 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.769
 on mirage that came in the first dlc of 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.549
 I still have the cops 2 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.870
 briefly treated 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.359
 I do not have the second one anymore 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.439
 bought and I would say yes we 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.349
 get a 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.639
 inventories already at the start the drone 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.650
 I always hewn out always look 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:24.989
 up front team deathmatch and one 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.060
 Protected is not so good 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.769
 I would say about her 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.349
 domination had now mode but 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.859
 friends i have to say this weapon so 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.650
 In this constellation properly held 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.209
 vector reflex visor silencer zum 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.409
 First time I tried this 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.150
 was really cool 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:47.069
 I believe the map to be the third one 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.109
 played fourth time since the thank you there 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.819
 the dlc maps as I said I believe 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.180
 I have not mentioned it that often 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.579
 Occurrence in the lobby selection of the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.370
 of course I find a bit of cards 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.479
 pity for the new dlc the after 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.310
 Of course, I saw it upstairs then 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.229
 I'll get the one pension in there 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.629
 I'll wait for a while because of course 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.689
 and polished then it is very clear that is 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.819
 tactical approach friends purple weapon 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:15.049
 there are currently to knives joy if 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.459
 a purple weapon but hello friends 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.049
 kindergarten 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.470
 a bit female everything as I said 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.569
 played a bit more tactically by 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.430
 beginning to end a great gameplay and 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:28.039
 I would simply times that her friends 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.259
 not always on my stories and heard 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.139
 but also just this one 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:36.110
 gameplay looks like he thinks 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.240
 did why he did that and 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.849
 I would say yes then we will come too 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.099
 here on a denominator and 3com the scene 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.419
 friends that's pretty tricky 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.900
 you know the place up there right away 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.430
 He sits there because he sits there 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.440
 around it as always and how do I get 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.090
 I do not roll out the war I'm not me 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.669
 do not know if it's one vector now 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.770
 lies at this distance i believe 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.349
 not just spain at 1 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.699
 but that was a tough fight and 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:05.650
 I have to say yes I saw it 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:08.210
 come after countless waterless here 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.409
 next application instead 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.750
 I must also say the friends 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.520
 Completion series are for tdm I have to 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.240
 say I do not know if that's so 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.180
 but the most optimal is this three degree 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.430
 hers went very close to each other 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.440
 should be in a left I have to run 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.280
 but first get 15 then talk 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.470
 we're behind 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.110
 reload sohnemann lying around by 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.509
 According to friends, one has to be one 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.759
 a bit tactical also before money if one 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.080
 one sees someone running in and out somewhere 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.219
 then suddenly suddenly one right 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.800
 the one in the shot position turns up to you 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.719
 without any obstacles was there 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.520
 of course, only to flatten let 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.729
 to a run and then they get you because 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.030
 After that is just so stocks on 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.219
 start the second one that one now yes 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.650
 great friends really horny turn for 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.030
 tdm just like the protected earlier and 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.610
 of course , I was on my way now 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.009
 yes pondering a Wichter which placed the 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.199
 intimate the match in total of arch 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.469
 actually under that we are up there 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.509
 but still the bugg bags could 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:12.169
 Covering that he just like that 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.880
 place 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.590
 because there is such a point here too 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.240
 I have found out from this map how 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.570
 I said I did not play that often 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.110
 but here is quite a lot central 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.760
 Come on 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.120
 yes just 100 things that I bring 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.210
 Of course, that was luck too 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.280
 in this game that time teammates yes 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.790
 I also believe the hello mainly 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.949
 Hello mainly the drone with 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.870
 Of course, I was very happy about that 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.490
 because as I said myself she had 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.729
 not with i just had the control 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.850
 With 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.910
 and of course you're thankful for that 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:50.669
 any help and on the contrary 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.350
 my expectations in the team deathmatch am 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.780
 but not so many people ghost or 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.820
 used ghost 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.260
 I do not know if this is not the case in tdm 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.010
 is common and here you see it again 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.139
 friends because the wall street so close 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.380
 lying together I think hunter 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:10.830
 killer course I believe 500 then stocks 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.560
 Entered into visa 525 and 600 of the counter 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.740
 Brocken urenkel and there you have as 3 and 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.740
 women 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.120
 I can not say anything anymore, he also has that 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.740
 made last kill as said friends 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.870
 that was a round from beginning to end 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.030
 thing that was really a round thing 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.220
 and I really want to ask you 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.289
 yes that was not to rate one 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:35.669
 comments but the video itself 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:37.950
 gameplay 21.1 my best so far and in 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:39.210
 the sense magic of you i wanted you 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.099
 Of course not withheld 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.080
 I hope someday I'll get it 

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:45.000
 something like that and then I'll show you 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.289
 that, of course, in the sense of beautiful 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.289
 greet you soon
