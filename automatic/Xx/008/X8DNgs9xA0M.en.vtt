right<00:05:19.260> there<00:05:19.440> we<00:05:19.530> flip<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.830> out<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:20.220> we<00:05:20.310> have

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
right there we flip it out and we have

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.510 
right there we flip it out and we have
the<00:05:20.960> opening<00:05:21.960> for<00:05:22.229> the<00:05:22.380> SD<00:05:22.830> card<00:05:23.070> which<00:05:23.310> it

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
the opening for the SD card which it

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.930 
the opening for the SD card which it
takes<00:05:23.669> up<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.270> or<00:05:24.600> up<00:05:25.350> to<00:05:25.620> 60<00:05:25.919> or<00:05:26.070> you<00:05:26.250> need<00:05:26.400> a<00:05:26.430> 64

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
takes up to or up to 60 or you need a 64

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.730 
takes up to or up to 60 or you need a 64
gigabyte<00:05:27.180> card<00:05:27.540> if<00:05:27.690> you<00:05:27.870> want<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.229> record<00:05:28.470> 4k

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
gigabyte card if you want to record 4k

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.590 
gigabyte card if you want to record 4k
pretty<00:05:29.130> much<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.550> sadly<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.270> doesn't<00:05:30.419> have

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
pretty much and sadly it doesn't have

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.230 
pretty much and sadly it doesn't have
two<00:05:30.780> slots<00:05:31.520> which<00:05:32.520> would<00:05:32.700> really<00:05:32.910> come<00:05:33.150> in

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
two slots which would really come in

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.880 
two slots which would really come in
handy<00:05:33.540> so<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:33.900> means<00:05:34.080> you're<00:05:34.260> basically

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
handy so that means you're basically

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.040 
handy so that means you're basically
gonna<00:05:35.070> have<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.610> end<00:05:35.790> up<00:05:35.940> getting<00:05:36.300> more<00:05:36.900> than

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
gonna have to end up getting more than

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.110 
gonna have to end up getting more than
one<00:05:37.200> 64<00:05:37.710> gigabyte<00:05:38.070> card<00:05:38.340> if<00:05:38.610> you're<00:05:38.940> going<00:05:39.030> to

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
one 64 gigabyte card if you're going to

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.330 
one 64 gigabyte card if you're going to
be<00:05:39.240> shooting<00:05:39.419> a<00:05:39.660> lot<00:05:39.810> because<00:05:40.740> you<00:05:41.010> don't<00:05:41.190> want

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
be shooting a lot because you don't want

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.370 
be shooting a lot because you don't want
to<00:05:41.520> have<00:05:41.700> to<00:05:41.850> upload<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.510> into<00:05:42.840> a<00:05:42.870> computer<00:05:43.229> or

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
to have to upload it into a computer or

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.740 
to have to upload it into a computer or
a<00:05:43.530> hard<00:05:43.830> drive<00:05:44.070> right<00:05:45.060> in<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.300> middle<00:05:45.539> of

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
a hard drive right in the middle of

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.330 
a hard drive right in the middle of
recording<00:05:45.960> when<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.650> realize<00:05:47.039> that<00:05:47.070> you've

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
recording when you realize that you've

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.310 
recording when you realize that you've
run<00:05:47.520> out<00:05:47.700> of<00:05:47.760> space<00:05:48.150> now<00:05:48.870> this<00:05:48.990> does<00:05:49.140> have<00:05:49.289> a

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
run out of space now this does have a

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.610 
run out of space now this does have a
mic<00:05:49.680> up<00:05:49.830> here<00:05:50.060> 5.1<00:05:51.380> surround<00:05:52.380> sound<00:05:52.740> mic<00:05:53.340> and

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.810 
mic up here 5.1 surround sound mic and
actually<00:05:55.620> just<00:05:55.770> sound<00:05:56.010> pretty<00:05:56.280> good<00:05:56.400> it

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
actually just sound pretty good it

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.460 
actually just sound pretty good it
doesn't<00:05:57.090> sound<00:05:57.210> too<00:05:57.419> bad<00:05:57.600> it's<00:05:57.840> not<00:05:57.930> as<00:05:58.080> bad<00:05:58.260> as

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
doesn't sound too bad it's not as bad as

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.840 
doesn't sound too bad it's not as bad as
the<00:05:58.680> audio<00:05:59.669> on<00:05:59.940> a<00:06:00.000> DSLR<00:06:01.160> although<00:06:02.160> on<00:06:02.370> a<00:06:02.400> DSLR

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
the audio on a DSLR although on a DSLR

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.670 
the audio on a DSLR although on a DSLR
you<00:06:03.030> can<00:06:03.270> kind<00:06:03.840> of<00:06:03.930> like<00:06:04.050> play<00:06:04.229> around<00:06:04.440> with<00:06:04.560> it

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
you can kind of like play around with it

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.950 
you can kind of like play around with it
to<00:06:04.770> make<00:06:04.890> it<00:06:05.039> sound<00:06:05.190> a<00:06:05.280> little<00:06:05.430> bit<00:06:05.729> better<00:06:05.960> but

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
to make it sound a little bit better but

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.110 
to make it sound a little bit better but
it's<00:06:07.110> a<00:06:07.200> pretty<00:06:07.410> good<00:06:07.590> audio<00:06:07.860> it'll<00:06:08.820> record

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
it's a pretty good audio it'll record

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.900 
it's a pretty good audio it'll record
fine<00:06:09.450> if<00:06:10.289> you<00:06:10.860> don't<00:06:11.010> have<00:06:11.130> the<00:06:11.280> budget<00:06:11.640> for<00:06:11.880> a

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
fine if you don't have the budget for a

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.940 
fine if you don't have the budget for a
mic<00:06:12.330> but<00:06:12.810> if<00:06:12.960> you<00:06:13.169> are<00:06:13.410> getting<00:06:13.680> something

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
mic but if you are getting something

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.830 
mic but if you are getting something
that's<00:06:14.220> expensive<00:06:14.550> it's<00:06:15.360> always<00:06:15.660> good<00:06:15.810> to

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
that's expensive it's always good to

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.940 
that's expensive it's always good to
have<00:06:16.050> a<00:06:16.350> an<00:06:16.680> external<00:06:17.640> mic<00:06:18.440> that<00:06:19.440> you<00:06:19.560> can<00:06:19.740> use

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
have a an external mic that you can use

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.040 
have a an external mic that you can use
something<00:06:20.190> like<00:06:20.310> the<00:06:20.520> zoom<00:06:20.729> h1<00:06:20.910> that<00:06:21.270> I<00:06:21.330> use<00:06:21.720> so

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
something like the zoom h1 that I use so

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.240 
something like the zoom h1 that I use so
at<00:06:22.260> the<00:06:22.350> bottom<00:06:22.440> here<00:06:22.770> we<00:06:22.950> have<00:06:23.100> the

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
at the bottom here we have the

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.690 
at the bottom here we have the
connection<00:06:23.789> for<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.030> HDMI<00:06:24.539> and<00:06:24.720> then<00:06:24.960> for<00:06:25.260> the

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
connection for the HDMI and then for the

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.930 
connection for the HDMI and then for the
headphones<00:06:28.370> and<00:06:29.370> yeah<00:06:29.490> that<00:06:29.669> pretty<00:06:29.820> much

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
headphones and yeah that pretty much

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.270 
headphones and yeah that pretty much
sums<00:06:30.090> up<00:06:30.479> the<00:06:30.630> camera<00:06:30.930> here<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.260> panel<00:06:32.190> right

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
sums up the camera here the panel right

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.610 
sums up the camera here the panel right
here<00:06:32.340> it's<00:06:32.700> touch<00:06:33.150> screen<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:34.050> when<00:06:34.530> you

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
here it's touch screen and when you

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.730 
here it's touch screen and when you
first<00:06:34.800> boot<00:06:35.070> it<00:06:35.220> up<00:06:35.370> it<00:06:35.880> will<00:06:36.060> tell<00:06:36.300> you<00:06:36.450> to<00:06:36.740> set

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
first boot it up it will tell you to set

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.650 
first boot it up it will tell you to set
the<00:06:37.860> time<00:06:38.070> and<00:06:38.099> locations<00:06:38.820> that<00:06:39.030> you<00:06:39.150> can

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
the time and locations that you can

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.640 
the time and locations that you can
you<00:06:40.110> know<00:06:40.230> know<00:06:40.500> the<00:06:41.280> you<00:06:41.820> know<00:06:41.850> the<00:06:41.970> time<00:06:42.270> and

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
you know know the you know the time and

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.690 
you know know the you know the time and
that's<00:06:43.650> pretty<00:06:43.860> much<00:06:44.100> it<00:06:44.340> for<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:44.670> setup

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
that's pretty much it for the setup

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.970 
that's pretty much it for the setup
process<00:06:45.240> and<00:06:45.960> you<00:06:46.080> can<00:06:46.230> of<00:06:46.320> course<00:06:46.380> change<00:06:46.770> the

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
process and you can of course change the

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.370 
process and you can of course change the
image<00:06:47.220> quality<00:06:47.370> sizes<00:06:48.060> the<00:06:48.690> playback<00:06:49.170> you<00:06:49.350> can

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
image quality sizes the playback you can

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.080 
image quality sizes the playback you can
do<00:06:49.590> slow<00:06:49.740> motion<00:06:50.100> on<00:06:50.190> this<00:06:50.340> I<00:06:50.550> believe<00:06:50.790> it's<00:06:50.940> up

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
do slow motion on this I believe it's up

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.140 
do slow motion on this I believe it's up
to<00:06:51.210> 120<00:06:52.050> frames<00:06:52.230> but<00:06:53.220> you<00:06:53.370> have<00:06:53.490> to<00:06:53.610> go<00:06:53.760> down<00:06:54.000> in

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
to 120 frames but you have to go down in

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.410 
to 120 frames but you have to go down in
quality<00:06:54.480> to<00:06:54.510> I<00:06:54.630> believe<00:06:54.810> just<00:06:55.170> regular<00:06:55.530> 1080p

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:56.420 
quality to I believe just regular 1080p

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.940 
quality to I believe just regular 1080p
you<00:06:57.420> can<00:06:57.540> change<00:06:57.780> shooting<00:06:58.170> modes<00:06:58.410> here<00:06:58.710> you

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
you can change shooting modes here you

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.230 
you can change shooting modes here you
have<00:06:59.070> a<00:06:59.160> bunch<00:06:59.370> of<00:06:59.460> varieties<00:06:59.940> you<00:07:00.120> have

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
have a bunch of varieties you have

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.560 
have a bunch of varieties you have
effects<00:07:01.760> for<00:07:02.760> when<00:07:02.880> you're<00:07:03.030> recording<00:07:03.270> you
