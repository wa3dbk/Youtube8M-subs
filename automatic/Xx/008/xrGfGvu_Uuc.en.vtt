00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
robots and we just looked at the cyllage

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.029 
robots and we just looked at the cyllage
and<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.750> said<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.170> one's<00:01:34.380> good<00:01:34.469> this<00:01:34.649> one's

and I said this one's good this one's
good<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.280> one's<00:01:35.640> good<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.869> would

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
good this one's good and then we would

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.449 
good this one's good and then we would
grab<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.439> silhouette<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> start

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
grab that silhouette and start

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.699
