00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.430
 one of the most advanced bmp in the world on 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.380
 today is 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.240
 German again helped on the ice we 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.560
 compare 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.960
 the mound itself having a smaller mass of kurganets 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.320
 has better paper mobility 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.180
 for 40 tons our limits are 25 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 like all classic domestic bmp 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 the mound I kept the opportunity 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.960
 overcome water obstacles afloat 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.510
 remind not here here to take the complex 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.780
 protection yes he basically doesn't remember bypassed 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.080
 for some reason, the knife, we were able to protect rpb 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.900
 bomb way they claim that with a kit 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.360
 extra protection it protects well 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.799
 this is far from having 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.159
 dynamic protection 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.890
 one phrase even with a mass of 40 tons well 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.799
 impossible to protect against rpg-7 which 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.799
 change 70 sleepy world then you pick 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.130
 fashion to even the fire 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.760
 modules and both 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.000
 and here again the benefits with 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.430
 manganese 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 because if so take guns 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.750
 automatically which are used there and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.880
 there and there 30 millimeter 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.009
 automatic gun on the Kurgans still 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.909
 there is an excellent managed complex 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.380
 armament 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.970
 and a 4 launchers 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.110
 upgraded guided missiles 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.240
 Cornet is very strong 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.570
 impenetrability is about 1200 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.600
 millimeters for dynamic protection 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.880
 emphasize this practically 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.390
 today tank with such 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.979
 protection in the West simply does not exist in 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.500
 Germans they do not have in the complex 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.899
 guided weapons as an option they 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.069
 offer there puts milan 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:18.140
 it is in general at the level of our weather 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.810
 forty years old there right away yes by 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.750
 cannon principle there that their edge is not 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.260
 beret 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.890
 Kurgan armor that our 30 will not take 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.160
 Puma is understandable, that is, if two 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.620
 tap it right machines one another not 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.170
 will cause harm 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.890
 2 another cannon too, but she still has four 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.850
 the rockets are gone by these rockets it will spread 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:49.140
 yomu 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:52.590
 just kosovo if you take 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.600
 let's say the development of bmp is the problem 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.740
 can definitely be called because 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.220
 went a significant breakthrough and in 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.900
 security and in firepower 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.580
 our designers have been delivered 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.000
 task and given the opportunity 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.890
 and they coped with their task and 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.680
 created today 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.680
 the best infantry fighting vehicle from me
