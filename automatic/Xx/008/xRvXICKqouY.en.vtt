00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.940 
think that early in the careers a major
mistake<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.720> think<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.500> helps<00:03:23.650> bad

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
Americans that playing you and I think

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.120 
Americans that playing you and I think
if<00:03:30.970> it's<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.270> if<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.900> situation<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.530> helps<00:03:33.010> you

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
if it's a if a situation that helps you

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.220 
if it's a if a situation that helps you
and<00:03:33.250> it's<00:03:33.370> an<00:03:33.460> advantage<00:03:33.700> for<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.300> to<00:03:34.330> get<00:03:34.870> to
