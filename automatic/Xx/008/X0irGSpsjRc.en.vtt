00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.040
My name is Bernard Nabucet.
I'm the owner of this place.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.600
I invite you to visit my F89
in all its glory!

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.320
Saturday, a mechanic
was going to prepare it for today,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.360
but he made a mistake.
He screwed up the electrical wiring.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.560
I came here Sunday
to inspect the damages.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.320
I prepared and repaired everything:
the alternator, the starter...right away.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.320
I bought this truck back in 1973.
It was love at first sight.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.240
It was in a deplorable condition.
There was grass growing inside it.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.200
I restored it completely
in four years' time.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.560
All the screws are original ones,
and they work like a charm.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.800
I fell for it, because it reminds me
of a racing monster.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960
It's the original radio!

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.320
I wanted to restore the truck
to its original state.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.640
The nuts and bolts, the screws, the
carpets... Just like the original truck.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.120
A real 89 from that year and that period.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.600
I came here with nothing.
I was a draughtsman.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.480
To be able to pay my rent,
I worked as a truck driver by night,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.880
and as a draughtsman by day.
Truck driving became my passion.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.960
A dream that I'd never had
came true while I was driving.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.720
I'm crazy about this brand!
I've driven the 88, the 89...

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.640
The F10, the F12...
I've had the whole F and H series.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.160
And I have just ordered the latest model,
which will be delivered in March.
