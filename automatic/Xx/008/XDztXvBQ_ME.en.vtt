00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.690
 question and closer to the body so to speak in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.450
 poker you play well I can't call myself 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.320
 serious poker player 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.630
 but 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.360
 highly 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.880
 closely 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.100
 Cooperated earlier speaker 100 times 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.050
 together we did joint projects here 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.700
 video clip with a snoop dog and a lot 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.280
 friends of me who are professionally acquainted 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.350
 I'm playing poker unfortunately not 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.750
 not enough this time and patience 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.150
 not very simple game but what do you think if 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.440
 if you were not an artist you could 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.910
 for yourself choose the path of a professional 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.420
 poker player luck smiles at me very much 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.000
 often 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.680
 how many times have I sat down almost 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.620
 never lost if more time 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.530
 this paid maybe and would do it 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.420
 Well not just sit down and roll that is 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.660
 math is some kind of 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:58.560
 acting is surely this 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:02.540
 Lady luck is favorable to those who are to her 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.409
 facing the face so the set of all these 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.310
 ingredients allows players to go out 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.459
 to professional level 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.349
 It is such a mix that I will start cool what 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.790
 and that's exactly the way poker we represent 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.160
 indeed we are positioning as here 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.420
 such a mix like you said it 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.580
 intellectual sport 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.550
 tell me if you could choose 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.650
 absolutely anyone on earth with whom 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.890
 would you like to fight at the poker table 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:36.360
 and to put at stake if there were 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:40.290
 opportunity i think i'm glad 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:47.819
 would meet at the same table in john 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:49.349
 travolta with Leonardo Dicaprio and possibly 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.880
 with the barrack Obama say that he, too 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.450
 plays 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.400
 Indeed many American 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.250
 the presidents are actually playing poker 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.670
 Do you have a tattoo related to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:06.480
 poker or with cards of course three 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.750
 aces why syntheses 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.500
 I have my own kind of association sadim 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.159
 but in general with cards the card is such a thing 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.580
 it is always risk risk either become 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:22.830
 champion either stay worse than zeros 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.170
 in addition to go into the minus that is 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.519
 risky thing not for wimps so 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.860
 a set of four aces yes it is a symbol 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.390
 some luck for good luck beating such 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.700
 tattoo 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.470
 so these say it was once such 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.930
 the moment you played not for money but 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.060
 let's say on desire and what an interesting 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.319
 you laid down your wishes for life 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.970
 or vice versa 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:52.070
 execute now huge 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.069
 pleasure well when I was younger 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.989
 18 19 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.670
 loved sit down with girls play on 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.959
 undressing it was the most interesting 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.799
 all my life I remember for a couple of times me 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.950
 specifically 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.849
 strife section clever but now after 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.670
 This I strongly on project began more 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.789
 delve into the essence of the game and already more 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.829
 no longer undressing only broke 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.389

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:28.400
