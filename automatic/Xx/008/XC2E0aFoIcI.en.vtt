 lines we are here a motorcycle race 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.220
 with subscribers there are enough motorcycles and 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 enough that they will fly by 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.730
 there you see I just saw one flying around 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.580
 here until later that was not a good option 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.470
 get in there last and for that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.850
 for having gotten myself to go there is one that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.039
 he carries a suitcase that passes that will lower the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.750
 bank robberies care that my mother my 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.859
 mother I have done this for one that by 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.859
 motorcycles climbs climbs climbs no no 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.060
 it costs quite a lot to do this, not because of what 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.750
 I see quite a lot of motorcycles flying and people 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.480
 there suffering enough what there is 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.090
 do here or from what I see there 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.720
 it costs a lot to do there 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.720
 enough beams and a lot of pupa a lot of pupa 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.940

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.280
 come up with easy and exits with 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.199
 patience and saliva you get to the top 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.269
 sculpts occupy and reach 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.129

 at least I have arrived I was fourth more 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.170
 first I think if you go first if you go 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.670
 first it is worth nothing today fifth and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.290
 now you have to make signings here 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.080
 etc around here leave yes you can leave 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.940
 will come perfect perfect perfect now 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.520
 you have to re -start hate restart 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.350
 the points where you get almost to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.810
 hard pain you know 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.810
 well, actually we are going 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.549
 perfect there I go 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.500
 we go quarters 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.140
 cristian I see you I do not see you anymore 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.770
 I just fell damned because there's a 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.319
 Hence my luck hole m 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.259
 I have a difficult career if it's 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.780
 parkour and difficulties more than anything is 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.970
 retro parkour my mother you have to put 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.000
 around here seriously, this is easy, it's 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.270
 a little bit I'm going eye eye I'm going eye 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.880
 came eye that I have been 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.880
 here I will take the next point 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.790
 to start again I do not want I do not like 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.500
 restart but good western called me 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.970
 we are here the point is here in 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.470
 reality I would not have started and the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.069
 positive to go through a part of the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.380
 left but it does not matter 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.690
 we go 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.880
 I do not know how I bounced but 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.390
 I'm going 2nd Cristian and how bad it started 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.770
 eating a pivot out there but 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.709
 I have not seen that I have not eaten it 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.930
 back with me again for points for 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.370
 round by points I think it's because 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.120
 back because I think there are enough 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.030
 mine is inaccessible the area is populated 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.960
 by where to go look 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:03:00.440
 careful let's go here pim pam 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.850
 It's worth it for points and up we go nothing 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.780
 you do not have to go up here you have to go 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.120
 down 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.470
 let's go this is the first one I think 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.450
 that was just stamped with something 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.580
 possibly it is here no no 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.130
 is that I'm seeing it is the first 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.080
 over here the flight I think it's pretty 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.690
 near 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.690
 let's see that the left now 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.430
 over here I see it see the minimap is 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.650
 pretty close to know what I'm going to 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.640
 get enough points and it's close but 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.300
 far it's worth up to here not who you are 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.050
 who are you show yourself 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.910
 of the goal came to the goal reached 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.210
 first I do not say that first came to the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.930
 goal because it is not here kid 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:53.370
 what is this but what is this 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:57.000
 my mind fucking admin when you see it 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.640
 to freak out or be the first one I can no longer 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.970
 reach 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.120
 it goes pretty fast I have not fallen 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:10.260
 my mother, my son, I fall, my mother 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.310
 when you go to prison now the end 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.639
 it's a ramp surrounding a chimney 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.130
 giant and I'm really doing that 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.070
 with patience and saliva with a lot 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.690
 patience still 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.580
 sincerely with great patience that at 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.150
 get up here because otherwise no 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.849
 you're going to fall and you're going to die of 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.910
 courage 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.600
 and then you will not get there 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.240
 or 6 calmly with tranquility 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.070
 without falling quiet because if you do not 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.230
 you are going to fall and if not then nothing is already 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.670
 so close so far is the tube of the 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:50.310
 chimney blanquita if there is 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.610
 to keep going here, we have to continue 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.610
 here 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.189
 because I'm getting you tell me 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.920
 God 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:04.440
 Balearic Islands in the first 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.080
 eye 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.449
 eye that was up here I think it 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.520
 has fallen 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:18.000
 super slow I go with the key state 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.460
 today has arrived and they have arrived second the 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.500
 diego first and second arrives already arrived 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.539
 I also do not know if I'm going third 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.180
 diners who finished second 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:35.419
 you put me that I go second I do not know 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:35.419
 I suppose, come on, let me fall, lad. 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:43.560
 me here since then I go up 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:48.889
 then arriving at the end of the 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.889
 bul bul bul have fallen chimney 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.090
 I'm leaving the game to see what I'm doing 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:00.380
 going up but this when it's going to end 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.129
 It is worth it with care of the goal 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.849
 not if I took the look good 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.679
 the thing is that there are enough ramps there 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.940
 and this I want that I do not google to moto 

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:10.760
 OK OK 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.060
 that the closer I am to the goal 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:19.560
 More fear gives me to stay burdened 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.750
 well here is the goal and here it is and has 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.550
 come joe my mother boy that my 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.980
 ramps are there to see if now from the 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.570
 viewer perspective I can see the 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.680
 of ramps that there is of a guy you can 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.840
 do today's darling I hope you have 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.670
 liked you are skilful runs and the 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.680
 I really like them and I like them 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.810
 difficult what is the most difficult thing what 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.100
 more difficult is that these ramps 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.780
 when you arrive at the top when 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.250
 you reach the milestone before catching 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.320
 the goal you fall down you have to go back to 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.450
 climb that costs more than two or three 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.420
 minutes and then that's what more than 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.700
 There would be more to doing parkour simply 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.010
 and although it is something most difficult of the 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.450
 it costs more to do this than most 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.400
 difficult in the worlds I do not know if I 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.380
 I explain but good guys up here the 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.820
