point<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.880> view<00:00:36.000> I've<00:00:37.340> extended<00:00:39.050> this

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
point of view I've extended this

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.500 
point of view I've extended this
building<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.820> equal<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.300> either

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
building out so it's equal on either

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.709 
building out so it's equal on either
side<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.200> central<00:00:44.160> underpass<00:00:44.879> I've

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
side of this central underpass I've

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
side of this central underpass I've
built<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.110> entire<00:00:46.289> second<00:00:47.129> building<00:00:47.460> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
built this entire second building you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.490 
built this entire second building you
can<00:00:48.149> see<00:00:48.270> I've<00:00:48.390> got<00:00:48.420> holes<00:00:48.960> all<00:00:49.230> over<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
can see I've got holes all over the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.229 
can see I've got holes all over the
place<00:00:49.680> where<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.950> was<00:00:50.039> digging<00:00:50.250> stuff<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.850> so

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
place where I was digging stuff up so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.569 
place where I was digging stuff up so
I'm<00:00:51.510> still<00:00:51.780> replacing<00:00:52.230> some<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
I'm still replacing some of that and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
I'm still replacing some of that and
we've<00:00:54.180> started<00:00:54.360> actually<00:00:54.690> building<00:00:55.289> up<00:00:55.440> into

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
we've started actually building up into

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.860 
we've started actually building up into
the<00:00:55.800> second<00:00:56.129> floor<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:57.030> conveniently

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the second floor and conveniently

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.990 
the second floor and conveniently
running<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> wood<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.850> of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
running out of wood because that of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.549 
running out of wood because that of
course<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.449> need<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.899> most<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.289> right

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
course is what I need the most of right

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.920 
course is what I need the most of right
now<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.949> would<00:01:02.210> we<00:01:03.210> built<00:01:03.449> ourselves<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.840> little

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
now is would we built ourselves a little

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.890 
now is would we built ourselves a little
construction<00:01:04.470> Shack<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:07.159> have

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
construction Shack so that we can have

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.690 
construction Shack so that we can have
everything<00:01:09.900> sort<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> close<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:10.799> hand<00:01:11.010> though

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
everything sort of close at hand though

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
everything sort of close at hand though
the<00:01:11.820> hobbit<00:01:12.060> hole<00:01:12.150> isn't<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.810> far<00:01:13.020> away<00:01:13.049> it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the hobbit hole isn't that far away it's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.859 
the hobbit hole isn't that far away it's
right<00:01:14.189> over<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.520> by<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:14.970> giant<00:01:15.420> mushroom

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
right over there by that giant mushroom

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.859 
right over there by that giant mushroom
so<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> need<00:01:17.970> stuff<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.450> isn't<00:01:18.600> there

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
so if when I need stuff that isn't there

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.280 
so if when I need stuff that isn't there
in<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.560> shack<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.369> run<00:01:20.610> back<00:01:20.790> but

windows on the second floor and then I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.170 
windows on the second floor and then I
have<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> figure<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> third<00:01:32.340> floor<00:01:32.610> I'm

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
have to figure out the third floor I'm

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.490 
have to figure out the third floor I'm
not<00:01:33.360> sure<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:34.610> would<00:01:35.840> nope<00:01:36.840> there's<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.259> all

right<00:01:37.650> good<00:01:38.390> I'm<00:01:39.390> not<00:01:39.600> sure<00:01:40.049> if<00:01:40.200> I'm<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
right good I'm not sure if I'm going to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
right good I'm not sure if I'm going to
step<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.920> again<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.369> coming<00:01:41.610> off<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> first

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
step in again so coming off the first

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.760 
step in again so coming off the first
floor<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.689> had<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.409> step<00:01:43.979> up<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.899> then<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.619> went

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
floor I had to step up and then we went

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.230 
floor I had to step up and then we went
up<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.009> story<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.640> might<00:01:47.790> go<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.030> two

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
up a story I think I might go up two

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
up a story I think I might go up two
stories<00:01:48.689> at<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:49.680> step<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> in

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
stories at this and then step it in

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.080 
stories at this and then step it in
again<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> maybe<00:01:51.450> even<00:01:51.689> remove<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:53.100> couple<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
again and maybe even remove a couple of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.620 
again and maybe even remove a couple of
these<00:01:54.270> frame<00:01:55.229> units<00:01:55.729> as<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:57.000> step<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.390> higher

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
these frame units as we step up higher

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.459 
these frame units as we step up higher
sort<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:59.149> reminiscent<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.420> what<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.229> with

this last piston working apparently it
never<00:03:11.610> really<00:03:12.090> worked<00:03:12.360> because<00:03:12.720> just<00:03:13.320> a

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
never really worked because just a

little work in there but last one was a
hobbit<00:03:20.370> hole<00:03:20.460> storage<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.090> completely<00:03:21.750> forgot

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
hobbit hole storage I completely forgot

back<00:03:25.230> redstone<00:03:27.140> some<00:03:28.140> cobblestone<00:03:28.620> cooking

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
back redstone some cobblestone cooking

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.590 
back redstone some cobblestone cooking
here<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.900> maybe<00:03:31.320> this<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:31.740> good<00:03:32.420> throw<00:03:33.420> some

cobblestone<00:03:33.990> and<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> built<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.130> wall<00:03:35.460> of

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
cobblestone and so I built this wall of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.620 
cobblestone and so I built this wall of
furnaces<00:03:36.300> here<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.690> little<00:03:36.870> shed<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:38.010> our

furnaces here in the little shed in our
construction<00:03:39.630> hut<00:03:40.220> so<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.400> could<00:03:42.380> just

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
construction hut so that I could just

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.400 
construction hut so that I could just
come<00:03:43.620> down<00:03:43.800> here<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.870> hook<00:03:45.870> up<00:03:45.990> whatever<00:03:46.230> I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
needed nice thing is with all of this

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.020 
needed nice thing is with all of this
work<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.470> did<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.280> remember<00:03:50.580> there<00:03:50.940> was

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
work I did and if you remember there was

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.080 
work I did and if you remember there was
a<00:03:51.090> rather<00:03:51.990> large<00:03:52.820> sand<00:03:53.820> hill<00:03:54.030> there<00:03:54.740> that<00:03:55.740> was

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
a rather large sand hill there that was

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.540 
a rather large sand hill there that was
all<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.450> stone<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.320> sand<00:03:58.860> was<00:03:59.040> cooked<00:03:59.310> in

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
all that stone and sand was cooked in

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.380 
all that stone and sand was cooked in
this<00:03:59.700> part<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.720> most<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.110> these<00:04:01.200> buildings<00:04:02.390> so

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
this part of most of these buildings so

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.610 
this part of most of these buildings so
we're<00:04:03.660> just<00:04:03.770> working<00:04:04.770> our<00:04:05.010> way<00:04:05.040> through<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:06.620> i

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
we're just working our way through and i

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.330 
we're just working our way through and i
might<00:04:08.580> do<00:04:08.760> i<00:04:08.940> might<00:04:09.150> try<00:04:09.710> to<00:04:10.710> do<00:04:10.830> some<00:04:11.040> time

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
might do i might try to do some time

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.129 
might do i might try to do some time
lapse<00:04:13.520> perhaps<00:04:14.520> we'll<00:04:15.000> see

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
lapse perhaps we'll see

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.899 
lapse perhaps we'll see
not<00:04:16.799> sure<00:04:17.039> if<00:04:17.159> I<00:04:17.249> can<00:04:17.310> actually<00:04:17.549> figure<00:04:17.819> out

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
not sure if I can actually figure out

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.860 
not sure if I can actually figure out
how<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.120> cut<00:04:18.359> time<00:04:18.599> lapse<00:04:18.840> but<00:04:19.199> we'll<00:04:19.859> try<00:04:20.870> so

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
how to cut time lapse but we'll try so

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.110 
how to cut time lapse but we'll try so
that's<00:04:22.349> where<00:04:22.530> we<00:04:22.650> stand<00:04:22.889> we'll<00:04:23.280> just<00:04:23.460> deal

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
that's where we stand we'll just deal

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.900 
that's where we stand we'll just deal
with<00:04:24.270> video<00:04:24.509> I<00:04:24.569> guess
