 sony and samsung 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.029
 its insertion 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.460
 min 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.859
 now also in the again 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.699
 Today we are going to talk about a topic that most parents like because 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.060
 until she does not like decorating girls' room 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.860
 and is that the key to a child's room we can let ourselves take a little 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.760
 we can be more original 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.609
 and above all, take out that child that we have inside 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.459
 and to talk more about the subject we have invited our expert the work again 

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:46.550
 sample is willing and I feel like a girl 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.570
 have a good question we must make a different approach when 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.860
 we decorate a children's room that when we improve the rest of the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.280
 rooms of the house 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.750
 I think yes I would still say more is not the same decorate a room 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.120
 10 year old child has a child of about and how this can affect them 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.120
 Well, even if I'm older, what I advise you to do is tell them to participate in 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.330
 the decoration of the room because it will always feel much more sober 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.810
 and above all it will feel like relaxed 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.660
 the key is in the color of the walls that will greatly influence the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.580
 aspect of the room for example when it is the girls who choose the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.480
 decoration of your room always leans for pastel colors like pink 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.860
 celestial the band instead when they are children always choose colors 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.970
 much stronger and brighter 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.370
 and if we have to choose ourselves because colors influence quite well 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.280
 moods I tend to make a counterweight if the child that is 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.240
 very active I tend to make a decoration with softer tones for 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.470
 what local min instead if the child is introverted and is very quiet 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.450
 decorate it with much brighter colors so that the penguins with 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.650
 titans paintings we will not have any problems to find the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.510
 ideal color for the education of our children because there is a wide 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.429
 color range 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.739
 I find it specially designed for them 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:06.209
 and it is a one hundred percent ecological product and this works for all 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.340
 ages 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.400
 when they are very small I lean towards lighter shades because thus the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.350
 baby feels more comfortable and safe 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.910
 and from here we will adapt as we grow and a 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.730
 small trick 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.850
 If you want the furniture to be in conjunction with the rest of the room 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.920
 especially with the walls that first you would choose the furniture because they are 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.569
 much more expensive and more difficult to replace and I do adapt the color of 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.720
 the wall so that it is all together have a very original proposal for 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.919
 the children's room as ict 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:38.299
 vitalino has a special painting this blackboard 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.859
 where children can draw and thus enhance their creativity later with 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.510
 a crossbow and water we clean it and ready so they can go back to 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.599
 drawing at the beginning may scare us to paint a still dark green wall 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.250
 olive trees but we have to think that we still have three walls left to 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.730
 balance the colors every time I like the idea is that look at the 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:01.269
 our children's room, it is better to let ourselves be carried at all times 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.129
 for what we like for them because fashions go by quickly but the 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.189
 children grow even faster and surely we will have many 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.579
 possibilities of changing the decoration of your room carlos saura better 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.559
 let us take into account especially to avoid making final decisions 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.270
 exalted 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.620
 for now I am going to propose a challenge to most of us we have clear that 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.250
 we should in a different way the room of a child gravitation of 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.890
 a girl 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.199
 but what happens when you both have to share a room 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.920
 I like you to ask me that question 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.580
 It is a problem that many parents have, I advise them to paint the walls 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.890
 of a neutral color and that take some decorative motifs with which both 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.450
 they feel comfortable as animal passages because it is a good solution 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.169
 we have given one more advice to speak the time only one there are no standards enjoy 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.149
 of the pleasure of decorating your children's room because when you grow up 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:54.989
 they will fill the walls of the poster of favorite actors and singers 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.419
 so take advantage now 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.879
 It was very clear that it is time and we here in removing the points of 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.619
 a kissing bush 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.619
 plus 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.519
 min 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.889
