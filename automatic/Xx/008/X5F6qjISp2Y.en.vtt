00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.130

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.010
 khan to the kitchen of joselo in this we go 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.600
 to prepare taking advantage of what we have and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.540
 Bananas are well priced 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.840
 mature try to go and they say in the 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.050
 jungle of peru the banana male banana 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.300
 green or this shell cheat yes no 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.860
 I will think that it is past nor 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.860
 I have broken in my tray 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.570
 in its cooking then we need 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.800
 cut the banana 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 that we cut the tips 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.470
 we make a cut here 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.469
 and will make it easier for us to open our 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.469
 banana 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.350
 if we want to open well here is the 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.210
 peeled banana here the peel that I've 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.390
 chopped up 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:14.450
 I'm going to cut the banana in half 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.350
 and the banana in the middle 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.360
 like the green banana most wants 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.140
 or whatever you want to call it 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.190
 these different countries is harder 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:33.200
 Well, we are going to use 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.950
 this baking dish for 10 minutes 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.460
 when this minute 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.460
 we remove 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.380
 top and we'll bake it for 5 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.220
 we will put in the oven and be ready now 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.080
 we take it to the oven 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.080
 hence, stay about 10 minutes 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.730
 you have to remove it after 10 minutes 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.730
 a little more 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.060
 and then we will apply the cheese slices 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.359
 about each one 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.920
 the part of the center up 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.940

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.940

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.270

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.150
 Answer by rita x 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.900
 while advanced with cheese is already 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.439
 well as 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.180
 for the little bubbles now we're going to 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.030
 disassemble 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.040
 and that is the final part of the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.750
 presentation 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.930
