00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
an orange they have a bunch of these and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.430 
an orange they have a bunch of these and
this<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.580> orange<00:00:15.260> this<00:00:16.260> has

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
this is the one with the orange this has

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.630 
this is the one with the orange this has
two<00:00:16.770> different<00:00:16.800> steps<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.880> first<00:00:18.180> step<00:00:18.560> is

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
two different steps the first step is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.130 
two different steps the first step is
with<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.850> brush<00:00:21.150> right<00:00:21.359> here<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.779> which<00:00:21.990> is

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
with this brush right here it which is

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.040 
with this brush right here it which is
kind<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.500> flat<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.400> one<00:00:23.460> side<00:00:24.619> um<00:00:26.480> so<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.779> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
kind of flat on one side um so this I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.259 
kind of flat on one side um so this I
believe<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.800> supposed<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.429> build<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.970> length

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
believe is supposed to build the length

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.990 
believe is supposed to build the length
and<00:00:30.630> then<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> other<00:00:31.769> side<00:00:32.130> builds<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and then the other side builds the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.530 
and then the other side builds the
volume<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.899> lashes<00:00:34.790> one<00:00:35.790> problem<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.360> have

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
volume of your lashes one problem I have

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.810 
volume of your lashes one problem I have
with<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
with this if you look it's the the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.030 
with this if you look it's the the
scraper<00:00:39.180> does<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:39.960> enough<00:00:40.170> product<00:00:40.770> off

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
scraper does not get enough product off

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.990 
scraper does not get enough product off
um<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.540> clump<00:00:43.129> it<00:00:44.129> takes<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.820> bit

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
um so it can clump it takes a little bit

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.260 
um so it can clump it takes a little bit
to<00:00:45.210> put<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:47.309> need<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> make<00:00:47.760> sure<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.969> comb

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
clumpy mess but a mascara with two steps

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
clumpy mess but a mascara with two steps
does<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.719> indicate<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.160> mascara<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
does not indicate kind of a mascara that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.810 
does not indicate kind of a mascara that
you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.120> throw<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.489> much<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you can throw on and go so how much of a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.689 
you can throw on and go so how much of a
complaint<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
complaint is that really this is

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.219 
complaint is that really this is
indicative<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> application<00:01:03.809> process

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
indicative in the application process

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.990 
indicative in the application process
that<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.519> high

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that this is going to be a high

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
that this is going to be a high

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
maintenance mascara so to me that is not

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.700 
maintenance mascara so to me that is not

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
think this will last that long because

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.740 
think this will last that long because
it's<00:02:58.769> probably<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.790> seems<00:03:00.209> like<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.569> get<00:03:00.720> a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
it's probably it seems like you get a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.199 
it's probably it seems like you get a
small<00:03:01.200> amount<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.799> each<00:03:02.160> side<00:03:02.459> however<00:03:02.849> if

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
small amount on each side however if

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.140 
small amount on each side however if
you're<00:03:03.329> doing<00:03:03.510> more<00:03:04.410> than<00:03:04.560> one<00:03:04.769> coat<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.610> your

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
you're doing more than one coat of your

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.530 
you're doing more than one coat of your
normal<00:03:06.420> mascara<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.319> don't<00:03:07.560> think<00:03:07.799> it'll<00:03:07.920> last

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
normal mascara I don't think it'll last

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.059 
normal mascara I don't think it'll last
it'll<00:03:09.540> last<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.110> much<00:03:10.140> longer<00:03:10.319> Mike<00:03:10.920> is

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
it'll last that much longer Mike is

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.650 
it'll last that much longer Mike is
