chain may start at the bottom ring and

chain may start at the bottom ring and
run<00:00:19.060> up<00:00:19.300> through<00:00:19.599> either<00:00:19.840> side<00:00:20.349> of<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:20.740> halter

run up through either side of the halter

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:28.210 
run up through either side of the halter
and<00:00:21.130> over<00:00:21.610> the<00:00:21.700> nose

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.450 

the<00:00:28.820> snap<00:00:29.150> should<00:00:29.780> always<00:00:30.020> face<00:00:30.440> outward<00:00:31.010> so

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
the snap should always face outward so

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.180 
the snap should always face outward so
it<00:00:31.640> is<00:00:31.760> not<00:00:32.080> accidentally<00:00:33.080> opened<00:00:33.800> by<00:00:34.130> the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.070 

another<00:00:39.070> possibility<00:00:39.640> is<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.480> chain<00:00:40.750> may

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
another possibility is the chain may

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.400 
another possibility is the chain may
start<00:00:41.410> at<00:00:41.650> either<00:00:41.890> side<00:00:42.310> ring<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.780> nearside

start at either side ring the nearside
ring<00:00:44.740> is<00:00:44.950> really<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.700> only<00:00:45.910> side<00:00:46.270> that<00:00:46.480> makes

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
ring is really the only side that makes

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.930 
ring is really the only side that makes
sense<00:00:47.020> since<00:00:47.470> most<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.250> your<00:00:48.400> work<00:00:48.550> will<00:00:48.790> be
