00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 best viewers and also game reviews I am 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.970
 a 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.240
 and today you do and flush audience 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.240
 your 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 so leave a review about luigi's mansion 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.680
 2 has to go back in time and late 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.349
 see where went luigi's mansion one 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.750
 higher it is a game with the exception of one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.960
 best-known plumber in the world 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.180
 of course the brother of mario luigi 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.250
 it's a game involving luigi mario 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.469
 so running very concept is actually one 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.870
 mario brothers min mario 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.590
 plus a vacuum cleaner is luigi with the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.930
 vacuum cleaner 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.930
 simply watch movies 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.360
 halo 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.550
 Oh 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.250
 Yes 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.310
 Yes 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.800
 a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.960
 should 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.390
 that's a point to really do that 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.390
 I also want simpler 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.239
 single player is actually quite simple 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.069
 as a first mission in search of the legs 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.510
 years of seafight lice 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.739
 that's the luigi's vacuum cleaner 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.770
 mansion one 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:35.650
 and then you go to professor who 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:36.640
 and ladies in the Netherlands such luigis 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.370
 mansion one 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.580
 is different from a letter two because 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.860
 the louise with is 2 break with missions 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.290
 eventually you go far in the people and 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.730
 try to catch more ghost there but how 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.810
 the further you get the harder the ghosts 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.190
 of being 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.340
 And the reason is that they are sunglasses 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.569
 have shields and something to eat again 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.489
 already discussed 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.890
 here of course also a hp web after it 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.799
 playing badajoz with you the basics 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.170
 and then the multiplayer runs 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.720
 want to commit in loop join download 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.420
 play or via internet and I lied 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.220
 play mike and the valleys together 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.200
 prize to their friends 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.900
 this photo ass of i'm from the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.660
 more moths finding against me 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.660
 yes you can see I have a hard time 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.100
 I also played online and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.870
 mainly on dick japanese points 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:42.390
 with name ring can suddenly break out 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:44.400
 ours can read unless of course an hour 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.720
 talk about game in everything you leave 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.990
 see about the game 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.550
 but whoever sweet you better try yourself 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.020
 my opinion about the game 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.450
 I find a nice game for Rode 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.700
 noordplein is a bit about your app 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.940
 buy but you also work against each other 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.550
 super fat supplement 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.370
 the single player I find a little less the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.980
 reason for that is because i am not good 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.560
 in games where 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.880
 walking around because I make sense at five 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.610
 for hours they still have a good idea 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.950
 tower was after an hour ow look there it is 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.460
 anyway game is the business of in 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.170
 to be 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.230
 it immediately ambitious and one you are whole 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.660
 good in this game so no i don't give it 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.200
 in youtube sometimes only some 60 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.920
 something about 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.420
 yes that's just minus 2 plus point 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.460
 nice with cookies in it yelling 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.210
 is really sweet and always a little bit 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.030
 charles taylor 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.470
 so nice service point it's how you beak 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.169
 flourish and state who you are 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.389
 so in its also a downside 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.099
 it's another game dessert so we and 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.389
 the chef avoided that and you spent hours with it 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.370
 are busy putting a set in five 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.270
 minutes are different about sometimes like me 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.340
 and you tell us it will do 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.099
 buy it is busy or else you are in the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.819
 rain but it's where it does me 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.469
 always want 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:01.550
 I have to admit after 10 years such a constant 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:02.870
 popular so this has one i am one 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.229
 and there was a lot of luigis here 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.229
 mansion 2 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.100
 you have to believe me 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.500
 symptoms 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.500
 check the share of game over
