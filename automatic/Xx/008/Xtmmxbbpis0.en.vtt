00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 the muscular puppet region of the head 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.580
 the head will muscle called when 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.839
 frontal pinus frontal pinus 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:22.050
 later on we will have the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:28.019
 muscle belly or the front pinto 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:31.529
 hospital in the face region 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.070
 we will find a muscle that surrounds 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.180
 the eye call the orbicularis muscle 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.620
 eye 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.120
 this musician has three beams a beam 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:50.039
 orbital an eyelid bundle imagine at one 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.980
 lacrimal beam leave it here and against 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.670
 the two in zygomatic simão mate 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:02.550
 with lower up I follow the match.com 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:11.780
 greater is the orbicularis muscle in the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:15.689
 mouth lift muscle upper side 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:22.049
 and here we have a lifting 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:29.729
 upper lip and wing of the muscle nose 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:32.250
 transverse nasal potion in the region 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.460
 Mouth bicola have a muscle 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.979
 depressor of mouth angle 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.890
 more medially with oblique fibers 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.909
 so parallel here we will have the muscles 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:53.479
 depressors of the lower lip 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:58.659
 immediately in the region of the muscle 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:02.340
 mentoni year left the region from the angle 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.969
 never to the posterior we have a muscle 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.840
 solved just below the resort I have 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.599
 a bull muscle in pain and here in the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.620
 region of guarulhos of our technique 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:19.060
 we have a muscle 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.510
 but sure the strongest muscle in the whole 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.280
 body coming out of the face 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:32.730
 Let's go to the neck region in 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:39.940
 neck we will have a musician named 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:43.120
 external playdom to cip tom mastoi gave in 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.319
 region here of the auricular pavilion 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:52.650
 we found three muscles called 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:59.280
 auricle 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.280
 upper and outer ear 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.580
 the arm the arm 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.490
 he has this muscle here a format and 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:19.100
 delta called léo toy 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:23.840
 previously this did brachial 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.790
 later sad and happy brachial 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.370
 between the physical and mis so I believe 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:36.000
 that we found a brachial muscle in the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:42.810
 palm we have the clusters 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.100
 muscle flexors in the bone 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.880
 of hand 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:55.070
 we have a muscular group 2 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:59.150
 Extender is from the car and here is the main 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:04.250
 elbow stabilizer call 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:08.910
 antonio coming out arm 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:12.900
 we will go to hebron first region 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:17.010
 muscles, this is what is called 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:22.070
 pectoralis major just below the 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:26.900
 pectoralis major has a smaller breastplate 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:33.300
 anterior closed muscle 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:35.280
 then external oblique muscle and here I 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.370
 with multiple limbs and muscular 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.780
 separated by intermediate tendons 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:48.360
 we have an abdominal rectus muscle 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.440
 the rest of the abdomen in the posterior 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.500
 trunk 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.770
 we have a single that comes from the region o 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.340
 hospital and extends to work 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:04.750
 not of the thoracic vertebrae called 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:08.889
 trapezius muscle laterally to the 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.240
 Trapezius is a muscle called a great 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:19.419
 of salt 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:20.440
 the southern dairy leg on the face 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.259
 previous 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.830
 we will find a muscular group 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:30.370
 call for femoral quadriceps first 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:35.400
 musician the entity is that I rectus femoris 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:39.870
 the thigh straight out the sock really to him one 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 medial and lateral vast mind him a 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:49.199
 when removing the rectum 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.969
 femoral internment meeting the vast 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.080
 when the game of these four 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:58.210
 muscles 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:01.380
 the formation of the mural frame a musician who 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.430
 leaves the region's own external region 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.539
 more internal 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:12.909
 called sartorius muscles the notary's office 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:14.680
 is the longest monster in the 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:20.409
 posterior region 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:27.190
 We'll find I fought the most. 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:35.880
 the largest gluteus region of the leg 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:41.560
 we will have here the biceps femoris muscle 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:46.240
 semitendinosus semi-membranous muscle 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:55.210
 gastrocnemius and previously 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:07:00.029
 let's have muscle previous muscle firmo 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.029
 in a fibular muscle
