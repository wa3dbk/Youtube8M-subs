we<00:00:01.839> saw<00:00:02.080> earlier<00:00:02.500> how<00:00:02.590> to<00:00:02.800> add<00:00:03.100> modify<00:00:03.520> and

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.120 
we saw earlier how to add modify and

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.510 
we saw earlier how to add modify and

now<00:00:08.170> we'll<00:00:08.440> do<00:00:08.590> the<00:00:08.620> same<00:00:08.920> thing<00:00:08.980> using<00:00:09.610> a

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:09.880 
now we'll do the same thing using a

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.829 
now we'll do the same thing using a
simple<00:00:10.269> interface<00:00:10.630> in<00:00:11.080> PHP<00:00:12.299> I've<00:00:13.299> prepared<00:00:13.690> a

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:13.839 
simple interface in PHP I've prepared a

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.360 
simple interface in PHP I've prepared a
couple<00:00:14.110> of<00:00:14.200> files<00:00:14.440> to<00:00:14.589> get<00:00:14.799> us<00:00:14.950> going

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
couple of files to get us going

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.340 
couple of files to get us going
these<00:00:16.150> are<00:00:16.420> display<00:00:17.080> and<00:00:17.380> insert<00:00:17.890> PHP<00:00:18.850> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
these are display and insert PHP and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.740 
these are display and insert PHP and
insert<00:00:20.350> PHP<00:00:21.190> in<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.580> working<00:00:21.970> files<00:00:22.240> folder

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
insert PHP in the working files folder

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.400 
insert PHP in the working files folder
for<00:00:22.840> this<00:00:22.990> lesson<00:00:23.970> copy<00:00:24.970> them<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.420> PHP<00:00:25.780> demos

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
for this lesson copy them to PHP demos

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.770 
for this lesson copy them to PHP demos
and<00:00:26.710> open<00:00:27.130> them<00:00:27.250> up<00:00:27.370> in<00:00:27.580> Komodo<00:00:27.910> edit<00:00:30.600> first<00:00:31.600> of

and open them up in Komodo edit first of

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.430 
and open them up in Komodo edit first of
all<00:00:31.930> in<00:00:32.230> display<00:00:32.980> in<00:00:33.010> insert<00:00:33.550> PHP<00:00:34.420> you'll<00:00:35.140> see

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
all in display in insert PHP you'll see

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.829 
all in display in insert PHP you'll see
that<00:00:35.589> this<00:00:35.800> contains<00:00:36.339> much<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:36.969> same<00:00:37.179> code<00:00:37.539> as

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
that this contains much the same code as

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.229 
that this contains much the same code as
the<00:00:38.140> script<00:00:38.440> display<00:00:38.980> dot<00:00:39.249> PHP<00:00:39.850> from<00:00:40.120> the

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
the script display dot PHP from the

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.930 
the script display dot PHP from the
lesson<00:00:40.570> before<00:00:40.719> last<00:00:41.429> we<00:00:42.429> connect<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:42.910> the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
lesson before last we connect to the

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.209 
lesson before last we connect to the
database<00:00:43.179> and<00:00:43.870> then<00:00:44.019> we<00:00:44.140> use<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.469> same<00:00:44.769> method

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
database and then we use the same method

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.639 
database and then we use the same method
as<00:00:45.339> we<00:00:45.460> used<00:00:45.640> in<00:00:45.820> display<00:00:46.210> dot<00:00:46.420> PHP<00:00:47.019> to<00:00:47.230> display

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
as we used in display dot PHP to display

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.369 
as we used in display dot PHP to display
all<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:47.980> data<00:00:48.249> in<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:48.699> database<00:00:48.989> there's<00:00:49.989> no

all the data in the database there's no

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.290 
all the data in the database there's no
need<00:00:50.649> to<00:00:50.679> use<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:50.980> prepared<00:00:51.460> statement<00:00:51.609> here

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
need to use a prepared statement here

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.209 
need to use a prepared statement here
because<00:00:52.870> there's<00:00:53.050> no<00:00:53.199> user<00:00:53.469> input<00:00:54.069> to

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
because there's no user input to

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.309 
because there's no user input to
sanitize<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.699> as<00:00:57.969> before<00:00:58.629> we<00:00:58.780> have<00:00:58.899> a<00:00:58.929> table

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
sanitize then as before we have a table

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.619 
sanitize then as before we have a table
header<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.829> then<00:01:00.519> a<00:01:00.550> loop<00:01:00.909> using<00:01:01.269> fetch
