00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.879
 good evening to all from roberto shop 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.750
 in this video I will show you how 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:23.000
 best applied dangers in vitro 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.000
 in this case for apple iphone 6 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.380
 but let's see the package immediately 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:01:00.600
 I was invited to protect the sticker 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:01:07.230
 rear camera is a sachet on 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.090
 cloth the various sticker make here the cloth 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:15.000
 slightly damp it will be clean to the fullest 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:19.290
 the screen in fact the number one and then 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.470
 let's go to cloth number two to clean it 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.470
 immediately 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:33.439
 I recommend you clean it to the fullest 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:42.679
 to ensure that they do not settle 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:42.679
 dust granules or other things 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.640
 in the next videos I will also show the 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.090
 obviously the resistance of these 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:01.969
 glass films so she would be 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:04.969
 connected except we play number two 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.969
 let's try 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:27.880
 I did it now while you bruised 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.440
 let's see if we can succeed 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.830
 no obviously a little crooked month 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.830
 perfect 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.610
 simply raise it yes 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.610
 quietly position 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.830
 here 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:53.800
 remained in a hurry we go to the scene we see 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.800
 as you can see 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.370
 here 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:30.220
 adhered perfectly to the screen been 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:30.220
 also very well put together 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.710
 this for example for night three the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.949
 takes all the screen is not tense 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.020
 unfortunately the iPhone 6 as known 4 takes 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:46.100
 display only due to the panel 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.650
 stay slightly curved front 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.789
 connected because resistance rate 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.789
 thanks for all good day
