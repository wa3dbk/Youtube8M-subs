where when you try to break it it goes

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.100

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
many items but to craft for I know that

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.500 
many items but to craft for I know that
you<00:03:40.810> create<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.230> like<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:43.329> get<00:03:43.450> a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
you create it like that and you get a

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.319 
you create it like that and you get a
four<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.950> craft<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.430> six<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:45.970> go<00:03:46.120> like<00:03:46.299> this

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
four and to craft a six you go like this

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:52.580 
four and to craft a six you go like this
and<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.820> craft<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.840> five<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.799> believe<00:03:51.310> it's

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
and to craft a five I believe it's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.229 
and to craft a five I believe it's
something<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.709> hate<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.400> get<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:54.940> idea

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
you'll have to just spawn them in

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.550 
you'll have to just spawn them in
normally<00:04:16.070> through<00:04:16.519> too<00:04:17.359> many<00:04:17.450> items<00:04:17.660> now<00:04:18.470> of

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
course the crafting recipes are also the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.050 
course the crafting recipes are also the
same<00:04:20.329> for<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:21.049> gold<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.620> one<00:04:22.610> thing<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.850> did

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
same for the gold and one thing I did

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.420 
same for the gold and one thing I did
notice<00:04:23.330> was<00:04:24.050> when<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.350> try<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.590> get<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.010> six

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
notice was when you try to get the six

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.659 
notice was when you try to get the six
iron<00:04:26.210> ingot<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.960> is<00:04:27.169> actually<00:04:27.530> under<00:04:27.830> gold<00:04:28.250> in

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
iron ingot it is actually under gold in

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.280 
iron ingot it is actually under gold in
it<00:04:28.850> which<00:04:29.690> is<00:04:29.720> mislabeled<00:04:30.790> so<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:32.840> mod<00:04:33.020> crater

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
it which is mislabeled so the mod crater

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.170 
it which is mislabeled so the mod crater
obviously<00:04:33.800> has<00:04:34.010> a<00:04:34.040> lot<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.400> work<00:04:34.640> yet<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.880> do

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
obviously has a lot of work yet to do

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.230 
obviously has a lot of work yet to do
which<00:04:35.510> is<00:04:35.919> going<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:37.010> be<00:04:37.130> fine<00:04:37.430> eventually<00:04:38.000> but

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
which is going to be fine eventually but

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.670 
which is going to be fine eventually but
he<00:04:38.480> needs<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.780> get<00:04:38.900> that<00:04:39.080> fixed<00:04:39.500> because

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
he needs to get that fixed because

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.909 
he needs to get that fixed because
that's<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.950> pretty<00:04:40.280> big<00:04:40.700> issue<00:04:41.290> so<00:04:42.290> let's<00:04:42.470> place

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
that's a pretty big issue so let's place

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.409 
that's a pretty big issue so let's place
these<00:04:43.160> things<00:04:43.400> down<00:04:43.640> starting<00:04:44.060> with<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.210> two

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
these things down starting with the two

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.400 
these things down starting with the two
so<00:04:44.630> you<00:04:44.690> guys<00:04:44.810> can<00:04:44.960> see<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.200> two<00:04:45.380> three<00:04:46.210> four

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
so you guys can see the two three four

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.870 
so you guys can see the two three four
and<00:04:48.410> then<00:04:48.440> five<00:04:49.180> six<00:04:50.200> that<00:04:51.200> and<00:04:51.560> then<00:04:52.520> for<00:04:52.790> the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
and then five six that and then for the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.560 
and then five six that and then for the
gold<00:04:53.120> we<00:04:53.990> can<00:04:54.230> place<00:04:54.440> these<00:04:54.620> down<00:04:54.890> with

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
gold we can place these down with

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.790 
gold we can place these down with
starting<00:04:56.570> two<00:04:56.870> three<00:04:57.680> four<00:04:58.570> five<00:04:59.570> six<00:05:00.440> and

starting two three four five six and
then<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.460> same<00:05:01.820> crafting<00:05:02.480> recipes<00:05:02.930> for<00:05:03.410> the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
then the same crafting recipes for the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.159 
then the same crafting recipes for the
brick<00:05:03.860> now<00:05:04.850> last<00:05:05.090> thing<00:05:05.150> this<00:05:05.360> mod<00:05:05.540> adds<00:05:05.780> here

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
brick now last thing this mod adds here

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.620 
brick now last thing this mod adds here
are<00:05:06.320> these<00:05:06.500> saplings<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.580> this<00:05:08.360> here<00:05:08.510> of

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
are these saplings so this here of

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.909 
are these saplings so this here of
course<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:08.990> bush<00:05:09.230> that<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.530> would<00:05:09.620> find

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
course is a bush that you would find

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.719 
course is a bush that you would find
from<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:11.480> desert<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.169> this<00:05:12.890> is<00:05:13.130> an<00:05:13.460> oak

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
from the desert and this is an oak

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.719 
from the desert and this is an oak
sapling<00:05:14.330> so<00:05:14.960> I<00:05:14.990> believe<00:05:15.410> me<00:05:15.650> if<00:05:15.860> we<00:05:16.100> can<00:05:16.370> grab

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
sapling so I believe me if we can grab

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.460 
sapling so I believe me if we can grab
some<00:05:17.360> bone<00:05:17.690> meal<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:18.500> can<00:05:18.740> actually<00:05:19.070> be

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
some bone meal that can actually be

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.610 
some bone meal that can actually be
mated<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.560> a<00:05:21.590> tree<00:05:21.770> maybe<00:05:22.010> maybe<00:05:22.820> not<00:05:23.030> okay<00:05:23.620> so

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
mated to a tree maybe maybe not okay so

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.070 
mated to a tree maybe maybe not okay so
that<00:05:25.280> cannot<00:05:25.550> be<00:05:25.669> made<00:05:25.850> into<00:05:26.060> entry<00:05:26.390> and<00:05:26.630> the

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
that cannot be made into entry and the

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.540 
that cannot be made into entry and the
same<00:05:27.320> if<00:05:27.470> you<00:05:27.560> try<00:05:27.740> to<00:05:27.800> break<00:05:28.040> it<00:05:28.250> you<00:05:28.370> won't

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
same if you try to break it you won't
