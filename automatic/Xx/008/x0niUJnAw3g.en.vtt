mice<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> little<00:02:45.239> big<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.739> why<00:02:46.950> I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
mice are a little big and that's why I

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.199 
mice are a little big and that's why I
use<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.840> other<00:02:49.290> mouse<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:49.980> have<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.850> sabu

on<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.570> other<00:02:54.690> one<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.989> used<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.200> have

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
on and the other one that I used to have

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.160

is<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.830> little<00:02:56.040> bit<00:02:56.160> big<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:56.489> um<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.510> think<00:02:57.660> this

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
is a little bit big but um I think this

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.229 
is a little bit big but um I think this
one<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.650> kind<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.130> like<00:02:59.280> iffy<00:02:59.730> like<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> girl's

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
one is kind of like iffy like a girl's

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.940 
one is kind of like iffy like a girl's
hand<00:03:00.420> can<00:03:00.630> use<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.020> bigger<00:03:01.200> hand<00:03:01.410> can<00:03:01.650> use<00:03:01.770> it

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
hand can use it a bigger hand can use it

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.370 
hand can use it a bigger hand can use it
so<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> would<00:03:02.640> call<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.820> mid-sized<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:04.230> is

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
so I would call it mid-sized this is

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.110 
so I would call it mid-sized this is
what<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> looks<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.459> open<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.850> up<00:03:05.970> I

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
