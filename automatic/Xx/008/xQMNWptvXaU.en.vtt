we work I they have time to get a whole
lot<00:04:30.300> of<00:04:30.540> material<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:30.990> run<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.169> through<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
lot of material and run it through the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.240 
lot of material and run it through the
snail<00:04:31.590> we<00:04:31.770> were<00:04:31.860> doing<00:04:32.040> a<00:04:32.070> lot<00:04:32.190> of

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
snail we were doing a lot of

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.860 
snail we were doing a lot of
experimenting<00:04:32.970> today<00:04:33.240> trying<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.570> figure<00:04:33.630> out

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
experimenting today trying to figure out

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.110 
experimenting today trying to figure out
how<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.110> get<00:04:34.860> some<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.220> lacks<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.790> out<00:04:35.970> of

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
how to get some that lacks and out of

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.020 
how to get some that lacks and out of
there<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:37.070> think<00:04:38.070> catches<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.520> many<00:04:38.669> heavies

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
there I think catches so many heavies

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.340 
there I think catches so many heavies
I'm<00:04:39.180> going<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.360> end<00:04:39.450> up<00:04:39.480> with<00:04:39.540> carpal<00:04:40.080> tunnel

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
I'm going to end up with carpal tunnel

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.909 
I'm going to end up with carpal tunnel
if<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.530> got<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.680> panel<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.540> that's<00:04:42.540> no<00:04:42.690> good

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.500 

this<00:04:46.919> is<00:04:47.070> just<00:04:47.220> a<00:04:47.370> little<00:04:47.669> sample<00:04:50.360> how<00:04:51.360> much

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
this is just a little sample how much

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.020 
this is just a little sample how much
the<00:04:51.600> other<00:04:51.840> road<00:04:52.080> oh<00:04:53.720> maybe<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.900> court

classified<00:04:57.030> material<00:04:57.480> is<00:04:57.570> really<00:04:57.840> rocky<00:04:58.080> I

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
classified material is really rocky I

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.100 
classified material is really rocky I
was<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.490> biggest<00:04:59.640> problem<00:04:59.910> was<00:05:00.750> having<00:05:01.050> to

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
was the biggest problem was having to

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.240 
was the biggest problem was having to
move<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.320> rocks<00:05:01.530> but<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.770> rocks<00:05:01.950> are<00:05:02.070> good

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
move the rocks but the rocks are good

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.500 
move the rocks but the rocks are good
when<00:05:02.400> you're<00:05:02.550> setting<00:05:02.790> up<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:02.970> snail<00:05:03.180> because

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
when you're setting up the snail because

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.200 
when you're setting up the snail because
you<00:05:03.630> can<00:05:03.750> point<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.410> current<00:05:04.850> right<00:05:05.850> down<00:05:06.030> its

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
you can point the current right down its

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.630 
you can point the current right down its
throat<00:05:09.860> flip<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:10.979> around<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.430> get<00:05:11.520> that

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
throat flip that around and get that

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:32.370 
throat flip that around and get that
down<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:11.910> little<00:05:12.060> bit<00:05:12.300> further

hit that Creek when it's a little water
and<00:05:56.450> windy<00:05:57.020> we<00:05:57.770> can<00:05:57.920> run<00:05:58.130> a<00:05:58.160> lot<00:05:58.430> of<00:05:58.580> material

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
and windy we can run a lot of material

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
little line of material there might be

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.180 
little line of material there might be
something<00:06:28.680> in<00:06:28.830> there<00:06:28.980> yet

in Ohio it was easy everybody would be
doing<00:07:06.200> it<00:07:06.610> we<00:07:07.610> need<00:07:07.730> to<00:07:07.850> run<00:07:07.970> more<00:07:08.000> material

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
doing it we need to run more material

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.630 
doing it we need to run more material
there<00:07:08.660> though<00:07:08.810> that<00:07:09.200> area<00:07:09.770> is<00:07:09.800> just<00:07:10.070> too<00:07:10.460> nice

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.640

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
little bit further up the stream that

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.470 
little bit further up the stream that
have<00:07:18.020> real<00:07:18.230> nice<00:07:18.380> looking<00:07:18.820> material<00:07:19.820> but<00:07:20.300> this

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480 
have real nice looking material but this

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.740 
have real nice looking material but this
is<00:07:20.630> what<00:07:20.780> the<00:07:20.900> snail<00:07:21.110> cut<00:07:21.410> huh<00:07:21.650> yeah<00:07:22.570> you<00:07:23.570> been

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
is what the snail cut huh yeah you been

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.580 
is what the snail cut huh yeah you been
yeah<00:07:24.110> a<00:07:24.910> lot<00:07:25.910> of<00:07:26.090> current<00:07:26.360> this<00:07:26.540> time<00:07:26.780> that

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590 
yeah a lot of current this time that
