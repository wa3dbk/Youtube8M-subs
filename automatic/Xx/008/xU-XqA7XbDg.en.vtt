 little before new year the comet more 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.910
 bright of 2015 visit the earth 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.490
 2014 is not over yet when we already have 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.650
 opportunity to observe in the sky one 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.640
 of the best and brightest comets 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.500
 of 2015 the sheep and the space object will 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.450
 is illuminating faster than 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.120
 expected creating an incredible 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.880
 show for the holidays he left and 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.890
 is moving to the north and the 7 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.230
 January to reach its position more 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.230
 close to the earth about 70 million 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.940
 of kilometers will be easily visible 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.999
 without optical help for observers 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.370
 of the northern hemisphere as a benefit 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:48.070
 additional I leave it and it's happening close 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.800
 of the orion constellation making it 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.749
 easier to find in the sky then 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.870
 will slide towards Taurus and the Pleiades 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:58.800
 locked little before new year the comet 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.629
 Brightest of 2015 visit the earth 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.239
 2014 is not over yet when we already have 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.400
 opportunity to observe in the sky one 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.909
 of the best and brightest comets 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.110
 of 2015 the lobe jo and the space object 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.570
 it is in a 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.610
 faster than expected creating a 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.370
 incredible show for the holidays 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.920
 I leave it and it is moving until the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.380
 north and on January 7 when reaching its 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.810
 closest to the ground position about 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.270
 70 million kilometers will be 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.150
 easily visible without optical aid for 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.400
 the observers of the northern hemisphere 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.530
 as an added benefit I leave it and it's 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.690
 happening near the constellation of 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.900
 Orion making it easier to find 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.479
 in the sky then it slides towards taurus 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.030
 and the Pleiades what should produce 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.460
 current photogenic scenes and 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.580
 news and the Pleiades what should 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.810
 produce photogenic scenes today 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.810
 and news of the world
