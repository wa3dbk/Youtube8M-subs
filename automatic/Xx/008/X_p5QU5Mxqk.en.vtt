designers<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.829> future<00:01:02.070> i'll<00:01:02.160> probably

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
designers in the future i'll probably

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.650 
designers in the future i'll probably
get<00:01:02.520> designers<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> make<00:01:03.149> my<00:01:03.270> own<00:01:03.300> workers

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660

get designers to make my own workers
making<00:01:04.500> new<00:01:04.680> graphics<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.460> difficult

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
making new graphics is really difficult

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.980

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and they have to try and make it better

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.929 
and they have to try and make it better
the<00:01:07.229> last<00:01:07.380> time<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> only<00:01:08.369> professional

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the last time and only professional

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.910 
the last time and only professional
designers<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> future

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
designers can do that so in the future

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.530 
designers can do that so in the future
operating<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.430> designers<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.150> now<00:01:12.299> i
