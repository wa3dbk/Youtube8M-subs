00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.540
 we are going to travel in time 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.900
 welcome to don francisco 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.700
 complicated 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.700
 do not 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.590
 we have hope 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.509
 the plan is clear and concise we are going to 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.610
 travel in the murderous time of the Mayans 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:41.350
 and you build the calendar the days for the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.350
 nation as they plan to kill them 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:52.200
 the idea is to kill them using the weapons that 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 we have we continue towards the spacecraft 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:01.520
 with a phallus shape, not in this way 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.520
 make songs we can tell 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.379
 always wonderland a year 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.590
 love is and we put together mixing 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.590
 and that back 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.439
 it does not worry me 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:49.310
 we are 18 years old 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:49.310
 she is among them the father of blood 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:10.700
 the light of the situation 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.170
 was hooked on a person who would be 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:32.370
 cards like what 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:32.370
 I like it but if there is a lot but I do not know if 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:45.120
 I'm in love with 162 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.540
 we have 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.540
 as of 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.360
 i 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.000
 trip 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.680
 and not being 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.420
 takes for the interest once more to 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:20.060
 change me that is transpire 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.060
 the liquid any you want 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.940
 and it's also that he has not stayed 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.920
 for the purpose of the couple use 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.610
 when I go back
