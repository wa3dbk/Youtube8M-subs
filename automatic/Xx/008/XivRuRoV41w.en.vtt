00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:16.460
 and all the pleasures of pleasure I raul 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.240
 more primitive pleasure then how well 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.420
 when we gather around the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.530
 project to share this pleasure with 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.900
 people are threatened and type a baby that 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:36.500
 fall from the mother's arms and hit the head 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:39.280
 right in the middle of a blowjob if it arrived 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.540
 a visit and ask to dine outside 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.540
 Forget suggestion 0 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.950
 the restaurant is a very intimate place is 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.540
 an extension of the house of the people right 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.960
 danger of being robbed in the state one 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.750
 restaurant is very similar to having 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.770
 gone from being robbed were dragging 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.880
 Our house is super fast. 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.740
 simple and entered five armed all 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.440
 and that was my feeling that it is 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.229
 easy to make a trawler in sao paulo 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.390
 today this fear trawlers one 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.930
 little exaggerated we always have some 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.630
 500 and few victims what to give 10 Diego 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.790
 and 0-5 per cent of the population of 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.670
 Paul, we are forming a city. 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.030
 of traumatic people, do not you 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.030
 look at an element that looks suspicious 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.799
 with a load for reasons other 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.140
 we are afraid of things 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.659
 wrong and we are not afraid of things 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.479
 are really dangerous as the suffered 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.030
 an avc or car accident the accident 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.490
 different car because we all have a 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.350
 magical thinking we do thinking 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.290
 that the things that are under our 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.850
 control did not happen because we 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.850
 we'll never make turtles 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.090
 we have seen that the violence is 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.180
 our side we try to avoid 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.069
 Very open places and less jewelry 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.350
 park nearer to the place where the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.000
 People take precaution who also takes 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.540
 is not walking with all the cards 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.480
 the issue of restaurants for 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.819
 paulistanos in particular is almost as 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.580
 sensitive to trawlers in buildings 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.670
 It's pretty much what you could call 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.519
 a type of fad the modality of 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.230
 recent assault the same group of 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.690
 young criminals who are practically 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.610
 there are many with many 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.720
 coincidences that I seriously believe 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.000
 who will be arrested within the brief 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.560
 of time as they were in the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.110
 waves of past crimes 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.660
 the restaurant is the great social place in 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.230
 paulistanos is one thing to have so much 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.959
 visibility because it hit the bottom in the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.720
 elite heart are saying that 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.610
 this is a campaign produced by the fact 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.209
 which is in class a and b in 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.500
 truth is to divert from the real problem 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.670
 person in rabbids of guaianazes 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.220
 He's hardly that worried like that. 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.989
 with trawlers as a middle class 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.010
 alta de sao paulo 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.190
 no I think for example or I do not know 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.799
 of the counter that has been dragged 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.120
 it is not in the car angle in a place with a 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.870
 lots of class people 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.640
 yes we are thinking of some 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.519
 measure we do not know exactly what 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.500
 still but we also believe that it has to 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.510
 have a counterpart of the state 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.380
 public security is the duty of the state 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.480
 but it is everyone's obligation 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.290
 the police reaction was the complement 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.060
 perfect of this feeling that it is simple 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.370
 and it's easy the police arrived with a 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.500
 so conformist speech there we see the 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.540
 secretary speaking governor speaking ah 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.140
 we will not make a bigger effective 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:10.989
 but only on festive dates a reinforcement 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:14.420
 Just for today, it's too much Valentine's Day. 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.729
 390 military police 20 indy has 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.729
 festive date no one is going to miss the street 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.799
 it is no use to increase this 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.070
 law was harder certainly not 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.400
 think twice and know in china the guy 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.070
 stole the ball die will cut the hand 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.600
 go here we do nothing during 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.880
 long time we b fame with the idea 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.000
 that there is insecurity in Brazil 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.930
 mother of mica because of the difference 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.840
 society and we accepted a high 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.470
 of crimes as a kind of 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.120
 pay for the guilt of social difference 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.040
 had no idea who I am and was a 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.960
 consequence of the permanent crisis 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.120
 economic now normal that feel 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.290
 that I had is that this is part of the 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.360
 package the same way you have it 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.940
 culture professional opportunities you 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.220
 You have pollution and you have 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.190
 we can not intimidate ourselves either 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.410
 It's as an example let's say until new 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.620
 In the past we have had great 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.780
 problems there and today is a very 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.060
 Calm down, this is what we have to do. 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.140
 also from sÃ£o paulo so we have to go 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.330
 For the street we have to continue our life and 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.160
 really ask for reinforcement and this 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.180
 that we are asking the 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.180
 public safety
