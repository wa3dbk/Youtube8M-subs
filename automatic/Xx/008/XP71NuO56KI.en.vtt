00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.210
 welcome to my channel revolutionize your 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.240
 beauty 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.170
 Today I bring you a super simple hairstyle 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.050
 who can use it for girls like 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.870
 also for 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.770
 then bigger to go to school or 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.490
 a very nice safe paschal outlet and 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.220
 well, let's start 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.939
 we are going to hold a match here for the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.520
 center then here we are going to divide what 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.710
 it's been a side 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.129
 up to the ear 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.649
 If you get complicated here, they can 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.110
 put a clamp to hold the hair 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.970
 and that they are not going to combine with me 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.269
 this time I will be doing the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.030
 party here and I take it here that takes 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.579
 decision of you good in this 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.409
 section that we already have here we are going to 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.409
 perform a normal braid 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.820
 backwards we are going to direct it towards 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.190
 back more or less the braid must 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.340
 reach here to the center of our 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.030
 head already when it reaches it is already there 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.640
 can hold with a rubber list 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.010
 the same as we did in this partition 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.350
 we're going to do it in three more 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:33.150
 partitions or two as you want 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.150
 this is going to your decision 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.430
 good guys already having here our 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.880
 four braids on the left side 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 now on the right side we are going to take 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.200
 just a lock of hair not several 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.539
 as on the other side 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.149
 I can take this from here from 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.090
 up or down or like you 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.260
 want me in this case I'm going to take 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.930
 from here 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.490
 and in this month we will do the same 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.130
 a braid 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.470
 good already having all our braids 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.500
 four braids on the left side and one 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.920
 braid on the right side then we're going to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.780
 take our braid on the right side and 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.290
 we're going to unite with our four 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.409
 braids on the left side 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.819
 and here it is on the right side we put it 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:32.050
 above the others we give a 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.830
 return 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.110
 and we had it here in the center 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.230
 in this way 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.680
 and here we are going to hold them all together 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.500
 with a rubber band then what 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.300
 remains to be done is to remove all 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.060
 rubber lists of braids 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.630
 then we just undo all 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.590
 these braids we can put an adornment 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.660
 as well as this from the left side 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.600
 it would be this way as you can see 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.180
 in front looks like this from this similar side 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.370
 and so here your flower or the detail that 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.670
 you want to put it and from the other side 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.860
 similar and so if you liked the video do not you
