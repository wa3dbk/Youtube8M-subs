iphone<00:02:58.450> 5<00:02:59.850> higher<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:01.390> think<00:03:01.780> looming<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.530> and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
iphone 5 higher I think looming in and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.220 
iphone 5 higher I think looming in and
out<00:03:02.799> is<00:03:03.100> looking<00:03:03.459> better<00:03:03.670> on<00:03:04.090> an<00:03:04.299> iphone<00:03:04.660> 5<00:03:04.930> as

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
out is looking better on an iphone 5 as

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.390 
out is looking better on an iphone 5 as
compared<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.829> google<00:03:06.400> nexus<00:03:06.579> 4<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:09.010> compare

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
compared to google nexus 4 so compare

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.319 
compared to google nexus 4 so compare
them<00:03:09.670> together<00:03:10.120> now<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.700> schooling<00:03:13.209> is

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
them together now so schooling is

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.420 
them together now so schooling is
looking<00:03:13.660> better<00:03:13.840> on<00:03:14.109> nexus<00:03:14.560> 4<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.890> zooming<00:03:18.310> in

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
looking better on nexus 4 but zooming in

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
and out is looking better on an iphone 5

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.270 
and out is looking better on an iphone 5
I<00:03:22.630> think<00:03:23.550> yeah<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:26.380> looking<00:03:26.590> more<00:03:26.920> smoother
