00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.480
 well let's go to the interview with 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.340
 aquivaldo mosquera that talks about soccer 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.809
 of its passage through europe 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.809
 of America of all 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:17.360
 what was the most complicated thing that you had 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.820
 what to face in spain 'well then 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.490
 and thank God I had to hear the truth 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.000
 but but I had very very moments 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:30.820
 difficult because I did not really play in 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.820
 the position that I know 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.470
 I had many problems with the press 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.430
 had problems with the two technicians 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.010
 that we had then I did not feel comfortable 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.710
 the truth a city ​​the city 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.960
 awesome impressive people the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.530
 support that gives me awesome people 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.540
 but I really did not feel good about 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.640
 I soon felt that they were false 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.340
 with me 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.410
 in many aspects then 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.559
 I endured two years the truth were 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.160
 pretty hard because I let go of the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.560
 selection and I had many injuries I had 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.979
 there were many those two years went by 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.460
 many things that thanks to it I lived them 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.490
 because you learn a lot of that you decide 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.500
 return t because to america because to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.920
 mexico once more 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.920
 Well, look, since I was in 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 pachuca always wanted to play in america 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.400
 I said good if it's an opportunity I 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.530
 I want to be able to play in america but the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.040
 president said that if he left was 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.010
 only for europe that 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.230
 I was not going to play here in Mexico if it was not 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.260
 for europe and well I understood it well 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.810
 because it was also a dream to go to 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.119
 europe to play 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.310
 when the america came out 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.409
 immediately we speak with union and that 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.930
 went to seville was with us there in 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.600
 We were talking and I told him that 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.420
 yes that immediately that yes that 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.610
 we are very happy that 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.360
 They obviously knew that they had fixed 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.239
 in us and at the beginning the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.370
 negotiation and I went on vacation from 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.989
 the team and I was already 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.049
 prepared again as it is 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.900
 mentalizing to stay another year in 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:30.739
 in Seville and well I said good I'm going 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.410
 to enjoy already since if it is not it will no longer be 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.780
 He gave me America, I make him stay and he 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.000
 I went to quiet occasions that we are in 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.730
 well here we call you in a 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.580
 farm we are in a farm we are one 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.799
 pool and call me my representative says 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.960
 not that you have to go to 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.390
 Sevilla because we gave it the Latin 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.060
 already negotiated with can continue sevilla 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.670
 and America is all set how was your 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.340
 adaptation to America to such a team 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.240
 good media the truth welcome 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.140
 it was excellent I saw my name in a 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.310
 very nice banner I had to load up 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.400
 even the eagle was very beautiful the truth 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.780
 I felt very comfortable since I arrived 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.930
 the technician had obviously called me 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.860
 I had already talked with him and the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.080
 companions that I found then all very 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.040
 good people and they welcomed me very well 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.710
 then in that very calm sense 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.440
 what is the criticism that has most 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.560
 bothered in your football career not 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.570
 was the one that at the time gave or you 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.900
 he made angel reyna with that statement 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.870
 so talked about the media 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.570
 and the truth, I really was not even 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.450
 the captain at that time I was captain 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:59.040
 in that match but not really 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.849
 neither rancor nor the speaker what 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.550
 you want 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.709
 and everyone has their feelings every 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.590
 who thinks what is then in that 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.440
 I do not get involved and if he felt that in 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.560
 That moment is because something was 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.049
 happening and what is happening in that 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.959
 At that time, it was not because you could not 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.030
 to cover the sun with a finger 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.860
 a finger because everyone knew what 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.470
 what was happening at this time in 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.020
 america first we are not well neither in the 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.530
 table nor are we any of the 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.860
 players and good are things that happen from 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.750
 category 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.530
 well 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.530
 it hurts me that people who do not 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.190
 they know what what actually happened and 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:51.210
 speak because actually 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:54.900
 I am not nobody neither to nor to remove or 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.540
 because I am a foreigner because I know 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.690
 that everyone in america is what 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.750
 better to be in the america and actually 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.790
 I do not care what they said they talk about 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.580
 they speak or do not speak or whatever in 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.470
 actually I talked a lot with him 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.509
 that's the truth I was wearing 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.490
 lots of advice because it's a great 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.280
 player for me is a great player and 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.340
 always he will do just that has 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.710
 attitudes of what they should not be and 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.960
 you should know, but in this topic 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.160
 I get in the current america is the best 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.569
 tournament team 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.589
 look what 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:37.409
 for us the truth is the best 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:39.419
 team that we have for three years 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.879
 that three and a half years that I'm here in 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.300
 the america for me is the best team 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:47.129
 that we have at this moment speaking 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.860
 for us it is the best team that 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.559
 we have already there we have to prove it 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.080
 on the pitch and keep gaining pace 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:06:01.169
 step by step go accommodating accommodating the 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.389
 places that came new but talk 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.580
 if we are the best we are not the best 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.009
 demonstrating what this America is for 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.279
 quarry yes of course it is 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.830
 we are to make champions and how 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.389
 I said a moment ago you have to go there 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.209
 demonstrate it on the pitch and 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:21.349
 we are showing it but there 

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:21.349
 that you have to give a little more
