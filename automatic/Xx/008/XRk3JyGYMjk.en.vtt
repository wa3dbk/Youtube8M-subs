00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.840 

alright<00:00:18.850> cool<00:00:19.120> so<00:00:19.180> for<00:00:19.690> the<00:00:19.780> hard<00:00:19.960> flip<00:00:20.230> and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
alright cool so for the hard flip and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.650 
alright cool so for the hard flip and
obviously<00:00:21.850> need<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.150> have<00:00:22.240> your<00:00:22.360> Ollie's

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
obviously need to have your Ollie's

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.870 
obviously need to have your Ollie's
still<00:00:22.900> there<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.440> then<00:00:24.070> it's<00:00:24.220> a<00:00:24.310> front<00:00:24.580> shuv

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
still there and then it's a front shuv

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.120 
still there and then it's a front shuv
so<00:00:25.270> it's<00:00:25.420> spinning<00:00:25.780> behind<00:00:26.110> you<00:00:26.410> and<00:00:26.980> you're

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
so it's spinning behind you and you're

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.380 
so it's spinning behind you and you're
just<00:00:27.220> giving<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.640> little<00:00:27.760> flick<00:00:28.120> on<00:00:28.270> the

toes set spins like front shoving and

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.560 
toes set spins like front shoving and
flipping<00:00:32.920> at<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.100> same<00:00:33.280> time<00:00:33.520> so<00:00:34.360> you're
