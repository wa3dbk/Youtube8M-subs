00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
son Hamza behind the camera we're gonna

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.990 
son Hamza behind the camera we're gonna
show<00:00:06.270> you<00:00:06.330> guys<00:00:06.660> how<00:00:06.870> can<00:00:07.189> use<00:00:08.189> some<00:00:08.429> recycled

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
show you guys how can use some recycled

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.290 
show you guys how can use some recycled
but<00:00:09.150> from<00:00:09.510> all<00:00:09.900> desktop<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.969> we're<00:00:11.969> gonna<00:00:12.090> use

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
but from all desktop and we're gonna use

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.779 
but from all desktop and we're gonna use
those<00:00:12.570> parts<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.259> for<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> Hopi<00:00:15.289> so<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
those parts for for the Hopi so I

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:26.570 
those parts for for the Hopi so I
actually<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:24.230> let's<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.650> which

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
actually have this let's see what which

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.620 
actually have this let's see what which
component<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.449> use<00:00:27.630> from<00:00:28.070> that<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:30.269> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
component we can use from that so I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.470 
component we can use from that so I
figured<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.250> desktop<00:00:32.669> has<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.149> really

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
figured out the desktop has a really

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.160 
figured out the desktop has a really
good<00:00:33.690> power<00:00:33.840> supply<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.660> does<00:00:36.870> supply

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
good power supply and it does supply

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:52.700 
good power supply and it does supply
about<00:00:37.890> 12<00:00:38.399> volt<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.289> that's<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.680> be

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
about 12 volt and it's so that's can be

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
about 12 volt and it's so that's can be
good<00:00:53.190> parts<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> life<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.120> your<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
good parts of life for your like a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.799 
good parts of life for your like a
battery<00:00:55.379> charger<00:00:55.949> normally<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> libel

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
battery charger normally the libel

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.549 
battery charger normally the libel
charger<00:00:58.320> require<00:00:59.250> high<00:01:00.180> amperes

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
charger require high amperes

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
charger require high amperes
if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.280> want<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> charge<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:03.030> battery<00:01:03.570> in

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
if you want to charge your battery in

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.170 
if you want to charge your battery in
there<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:04.140> fast<00:01:04.680> rate<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.820> charged

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
there at fast rate and get them charged

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.950 
there at fast rate and get them charged
quicker<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.790> time<00:01:09.030> bear<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.510> actually

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
quicker so a time bear that's actually

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.410 
quicker so a time bear that's actually
more<00:01:10.110> than<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.619> need<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.880> that's<00:01:12.090> good

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
more than what you need but that's good

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.120 
more than what you need but that's good
so<00:01:13.960> what<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:14.470> need<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.860> do<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:17.860> open

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
so what you need to do when you open

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.190 
so what you need to do when you open
your<00:01:18.220> desktop<00:01:18.760> you<00:01:19.479> will<00:01:19.630> see<00:01:19.810> this<00:01:19.990> power

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
your desktop you will see this power

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.359 
your desktop you will see this power
supply<00:01:20.610> came<00:01:21.610> with<00:01:21.850> big<00:01:22.690> punch<00:01:23.220> amount<00:01:24.220> of

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
supply came with big punch amount of

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.649 
supply came with big punch amount of
cables<00:01:24.790> this<00:01:25.630> main<00:01:26.700> aim<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.880> cable<00:01:28.330> actually

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
cables this main aim of cable actually

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.560 
cables this main aim of cable actually
goes<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.320> motherboard<00:01:29.500> which<00:01:30.490> I<00:01:30.670> take<00:01:31.450> it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
goes to the motherboard which I take it

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.140 
goes to the motherboard which I take it
off<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.050> I<00:01:32.200> took<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.680> all<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.190> parts<00:01:33.520> however

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
off and I took of all the parts however

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.840 
off and I took of all the parts however
that<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.780> trick<00:01:35.050> here<00:01:35.440> that<00:01:36.190> when<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.490> take<00:01:36.790> a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
that the trick here that when you take a

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.170 
that the trick here that when you take a
look<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.780> bundle<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.380> cables<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.970> most

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
look to this bundle of cables the most

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.760 
look to this bundle of cables the most
important<00:01:43.690> thing<00:01:43.900> is<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:45.869> cut<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.110> green

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
important thing is to cut the green

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.810 
important thing is to cut the green
green<00:01:48.520> cable<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.720> black<00:01:49.960> cable<00:01:50.820> so

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
green cable and the black cable so

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.800 
green cable and the black cable so
normally<00:01:52.630> it's<00:01:52.750> at<00:01:53.020> one<00:01:53.590> two<00:01:53.950> three<00:01:54.310> four<00:01:55.149> four

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
normally it's at one two three four four

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.200 
normally it's at one two three four four
and<00:01:56.110> five<00:01:56.410> why<00:01:57.190> are<00:01:57.250> number<00:01:57.610> four<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.030> five

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
and five why are number four and five

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.880 
and five why are number four and five
once<00:01:59.080> you<00:01:59.229> cut<00:01:59.470> them

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
once you cut them

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.730 
once you cut them
you're<00:02:00.369> gonna<00:02:00.520> connect<00:02:00.910> them<00:02:01.119> together

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
you're gonna connect them together

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.380 
you're gonna connect them together
solder<00:02:02.740> them<00:02:03.009> or<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:03.820> connect<00:02:04.119> them<00:02:04.360> and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
solder them or just connect them and

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.880 
solder them or just connect them and
insulate<00:02:05.050> them<00:02:05.259> like<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.820> by<00:02:06.820> doing<00:02:06.880> that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
insulate them like this by doing that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.259 
insulate them like this by doing that
when<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.009> plug<00:02:09.250> in<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.759> Year<00:02:10.080> desktop<00:02:11.080> the

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
when you plug in the Year desktop the

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.100 
when you plug in the Year desktop the
cable<00:02:13.269> it<00:02:13.900> will<00:02:13.959> turn<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> power<00:02:15.760> supply

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
cable it will turn on the power supply

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.140 
cable it will turn on the power supply
automatically<00:02:17.110> then<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.760> need<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.150> take<00:02:21.150> from

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
automatically then you need to take from

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.009 
automatically then you need to take from
this<00:02:22.480> plug<00:02:22.829> you're<00:02:23.829> gonna<00:02:24.100> cut<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:25.209> yellow

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
this plug you're gonna cut the yellow

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.670 
this plug you're gonna cut the yellow
and<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.890> black<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.810> yellows<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.079> the<00:02:29.350> black

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
and the black the yellows and the black

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.060 
and the black the yellows and the black
will<00:02:30.250> supply<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.730> 12<00:02:31.660> volt<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.260> that's<00:02:32.799> what

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
will supply you 12 volt and that's what

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.699 
will supply you 12 volt and that's what
normally<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.239> liable<00:02:34.810> battery<00:02:35.170> charger

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
normally the liable battery charger

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.710 
normally the liable battery charger
gonna<00:02:36.489> ask<00:02:36.760> for<00:02:37.209> Ghost<00:02:37.870> Charter<00:02:38.640> requirement

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
gonna ask for Ghost Charter requirement

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.500 
gonna ask for Ghost Charter requirement
varies<00:02:40.720> from<00:02:40.959> 12<00:02:41.350> up<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.709> 18<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.329> that

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
varies from 12 up to 18 so this is that

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.110 
varies from 12 up to 18 so this is that
will<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.470> connected<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:46.660> red<00:02:46.989> this<00:02:47.890> red

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
will if you connected the red this red

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.020 
will if you connected the red this red
wire<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:50.170> black<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.769> will<00:02:51.130> get<00:02:51.310> 5<00:02:51.549> volts

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
wire and the black you will get 5 volts

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.000 
wire and the black you will get 5 volts
so<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.870> might<00:02:53.079> be<00:02:53.260> useful<00:02:53.470> for<00:02:53.829> other

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
so that might be useful for other

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.100 
so that might be useful for other
application<00:02:54.640> but<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:54.910> my<00:02:55.090> case<00:02:55.150> that's<00:02:55.959> what

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
application but in my case that's what

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.370 
application but in my case that's what
I'm<00:02:56.230> looking<00:02:56.500> for<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:58.690> neat<00:02:59.049> thing<00:02:59.290> about

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
I'm looking for so the neat thing about

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.150 
I'm looking for so the neat thing about
this<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.630> not<00:03:01.780> just<00:03:01.840> supply<00:03:02.440> power<00:03:02.769> supply

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
this it is not just supply power supply

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.600 
this it is not just supply power supply
I<00:03:03.400> use<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.970> whole<00:03:04.150> case<00:03:04.420> -<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:06.070> gonna<00:03:06.400> put

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
I use the whole case - so I'm gonna put

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.220 
I use the whole case - so I'm gonna put
all<00:03:06.820> my<00:03:06.970> battery<00:03:07.390> here<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.980> turn<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:10.230> let

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
all my battery here and turn on and let

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.949 
all my battery here and turn on and let
it<00:03:11.380> charge

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.050 

the<00:03:16.590> case<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.650> need<00:03:19.799> for<00:03:20.010> that

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
the case and the need for that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.550 
the case and the need for that
because<00:03:21.719> as<00:03:21.930> we<00:03:22.109> know<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.319> liable<00:03:23.299> batteries

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
because as we know the liable batteries

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.759 
because as we know the liable batteries
it<00:03:25.560> might<00:03:26.040> burn<00:03:26.549> or<00:03:26.969> the<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.170> might<00:03:28.349> caught<00:03:28.620> on

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
it might burn or the it might caught on

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.270 
it might burn or the it might caught on
fire<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.609> never<00:03:29.909> know<00:03:30.120> but<00:03:30.469> having<00:03:31.469> them<00:03:31.680> in

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
fire you never know but having them in

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.970 
fire you never know but having them in
the<00:03:32.370> metal<00:03:32.670> case<00:03:32.939> like<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.450> that's<00:03:34.349> very

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
the metal case like this that's very

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.860 
the metal case like this that's very
good<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.459> very<00:03:35.670> safe<00:03:36.030> because<00:03:36.239> you're<00:03:36.659> gonna

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
good and very safe because you're gonna

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.309 
good and very safe because you're gonna
contain<00:03:37.829> any<00:03:38.459> fire<00:03:38.819> inside<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.719> metal<00:03:39.959> box

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
contain any fire inside this metal box

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.759 
contain any fire inside this metal box
this<00:03:40.829> metal<00:03:41.159> box<00:03:41.310> can<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.569> really<00:03:42.599> hold<00:03:43.469> fire

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
this metal box can can really hold fire

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.099 
this metal box can can really hold fire
for<00:03:44.129> very<00:03:44.639> long<00:03:44.879> time<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> don't<00:03:45.480> know<00:03:45.629> how<00:03:45.810> but

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
for very long time I don't know how but

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.759 
for very long time I don't know how but
I<00:03:46.349> think<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.459> very<00:03:47.790> good<00:03:47.939> idea<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.959> have

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
I think this is very good idea to have

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.909 
I think this is very good idea to have
your<00:03:50.220> light<00:03:50.939> batteries<00:03:51.510> inside<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:52.590> metal

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
your light batteries inside the metal

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.080 
your light batteries inside the metal
box<00:03:53.159> and<00:03:54.139> charge<00:03:55.139> them<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.859> other<00:03:56.639> thing<00:03:56.730> is

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
box and charge them the other thing is

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.420 
box and charge them the other thing is
that<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:57.870> power<00:03:58.139> supply<00:03:58.439> actually<00:03:59.159> has<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
that this power supply actually has a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.170 
that this power supply actually has a
fan<00:03:59.879> and<00:04:00.239> that's<00:04:01.169> keep<00:04:01.530> cooling<00:04:02.189> what<00:04:03.030> is

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
fan and that's keep cooling what is

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.140 
fan and that's keep cooling what is
inside<00:04:03.599> here<00:04:03.659> so<00:04:04.620> it's<00:04:04.799> it's<00:04:05.280> very<00:04:05.430> good

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
inside here so it's it's very good

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.569 
inside here so it's it's very good
container<00:04:07.609> for<00:04:09.379> battery<00:04:10.379> which<00:04:11.159> you<00:04:11.310> want<00:04:11.519> to

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
container for battery which you want to

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.709 
container for battery which you want to
charge<00:04:11.939> and<00:04:12.980> I'm<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.250> impressed<00:04:14.370> like<00:04:14.849> with

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:15.719 
charge and I'm so impressed like with

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.110 
charge and I'm so impressed like with
this<00:04:15.959> because<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:17.130> leave<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.849> go

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
this because I can leave it and go

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.899 
this because I can leave it and go
anywhere<00:04:18.660> without<00:04:19.410> being<00:04:19.590> worried<00:04:20.190> on<00:04:20.549> my

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
anywhere without being worried on my

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:26.990 
anywhere without being worried on my
batteries<00:04:23.720> other<00:04:24.720> things<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.260> can<00:04:25.500> use<00:04:26.000> like

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
batteries other things you can use like

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.870 
batteries other things you can use like
this<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.300> all<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.659> component<00:04:28.169> I<00:04:28.260> take<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.620> off

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
this is all the component I take it off

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.629 
this is all the component I take it off
the<00:04:29.880> desktop<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.659> course<00:04:31.409> you<00:04:31.620> will<00:04:31.800> find<00:04:31.830> like

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
the desktop of course you will find like

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.629 
the desktop of course you will find like
a<00:04:32.909> lot<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.330> electric<00:04:33.930> ships<00:04:34.639> motherboards

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
a lot of electric ships motherboards

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.390 
a lot of electric ships motherboards
with<00:04:35.849> a<00:04:36.330> lot<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.690> electric<00:04:37.080> components<00:04:37.620> so<00:04:37.740> in

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
with a lot of electric components so in

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.920 
with a lot of electric components so in
fact<00:04:38.669> there<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.000> electric<00:04:39.389> component<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.900> can

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
fact there is electric component you can

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.050 
fact there is electric component you can
use<00:04:40.349> for<00:04:41.159> the<00:04:41.280> Hobby<00:04:41.580> so<00:04:42.680> for<00:04:43.680> example<00:04:44.099> this<00:04:44.880> is

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
use for the Hobby so for example this is

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.249 
use for the Hobby so for example this is
a<00:04:45.090> heat<00:04:45.330> sink<00:04:46.130> they<00:04:47.130> think<00:04:47.490> is<00:04:47.610> very<00:04:47.820> useful

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
a heat sink they think is very useful

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.980 
a heat sink they think is very useful
I<00:04:49.289> normally<00:04:49.680> bought<00:04:50.250> it<00:04:50.370> on<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:51.120> East<00:04:51.449> Sea<00:04:51.750> and

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
I normally bought it on the East Sea and

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.950 
I normally bought it on the East Sea and
it<00:04:52.590> helped<00:04:52.919> cooling<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.400> AC<00:04:53.789> in<00:04:54.240> a<00:04:54.449> very<00:04:54.630> fast

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
it helped cooling the AC in a very fast

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.920 
it helped cooling the AC in a very fast
rate<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.979> it<00:04:56.220> does<00:04:56.520> very<00:04:56.940> good<00:04:57.030> job<00:04:57.360> those

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
rate and it does very good job those

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.680 
rate and it does very good job those
heat<00:04:58.169> sinks<00:04:58.560> is<00:04:58.710> better<00:04:59.039> than<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.669> the<00:05:00.389> hobby

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
heat sinks is better than the the hobby

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.839 
heat sinks is better than the the hobby
heat<00:05:00.870> sinks<00:05:01.259> available<00:05:01.770> in<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.949> market<00:05:02.310> those

actually<00:05:26.599> you<00:05:27.080> can<00:05:27.819> unsold<00:05:28.819> er<00:05:28.969> them<00:05:29.180> from<00:05:29.479> the

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
actually you can unsold er them from the

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.059 
actually you can unsold er them from the
motherboard<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.349> use<00:05:30.830> them<00:05:31.129> later<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:33.080> to

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
motherboard and use them later to to

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.570 
motherboard and use them later to to
build<00:05:34.249> your<00:05:34.610> own<00:05:34.990> electric<00:05:35.990> filter<00:05:36.529> if<00:05:37.279> you're

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
build your own electric filter if you're

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.209 
build your own electric filter if you're
gonna<00:05:37.789> use<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.509> power<00:05:39.349> battery<00:05:39.919> on<00:05:40.099> the

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219 
gonna use the power battery on the

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.809 
gonna use the power battery on the
airplane<00:05:40.639> and<00:05:41.409> have<00:05:42.409> it<00:05:42.559> as<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:42.770> source<00:05:43.610> of

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
airplane and have it as a source of

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.170 
airplane and have it as a source of
power<00:05:44.150> supply<00:05:44.599> to<00:05:44.659> your<00:05:45.080> camera<00:05:45.620> as<00:05:45.800> well<00:05:46.069> so<00:05:46.789> a

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
power supply to your camera as well so a

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.279 
power supply to your camera as well so a
lot<00:05:47.240> of<00:05:47.749> people<00:05:48.080> they<00:05:48.259> they<00:05:48.860> take<00:05:49.759> the<00:05:50.289> output

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
lot of people they they take the output

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.300 
lot of people they they take the output
from<00:05:51.319> the<00:05:52.009> EC<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:53.300> which<00:05:53.900> supply<00:05:54.289> six<00:05:54.680> volt<00:05:55.039> or

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
from the EC the which supply six volt or

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.329 
from the EC the which supply six volt or
sometimes<00:05:55.729> five<00:05:55.969> volts<00:05:56.419> to<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.020> receiver<00:05:57.469> but

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:58.339 
sometimes five volts to the receiver but

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.629 
sometimes five volts to the receiver but
the<00:05:59.409> disadvantage<00:06:00.409> of<00:06:00.499> that<00:06:00.560> power<00:06:01.370> supply

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
the disadvantage of that power supply

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.110 
the disadvantage of that power supply
which<00:06:02.150> came<00:06:02.449> from<00:06:02.659> the<00:06:02.900> EC<00:06:03.289> that<00:06:03.669> the<00:06:04.669> vault

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
which came from the EC that the vault

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.889 
which came from the EC that the vault
always<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:06.439> vibrating<00:06:07.189> so<00:06:08.029> by<00:06:08.330> adding<00:06:08.569> this

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:08.899 
always is vibrating so by adding this

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:12.869 
always is vibrating so by adding this
filter<00:06:09.699> you<00:06:10.699> actually<00:06:11.240> minimize<00:06:11.779> or<00:06:12.139> keep<00:06:12.469> the

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
filter you actually minimize or keep the

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.809 
filter you actually minimize or keep the
default<00:06:13.879> goes<00:06:14.620> steady<00:06:15.620> and<00:06:15.860> it's<00:06:16.460> gonna<00:06:16.669> be

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
default goes steady and it's gonna be

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.420 
default goes steady and it's gonna be
fixed<00:06:17.120> it<00:06:17.330> was<00:06:17.479> always<00:06:17.779> going<00:06:18.080> to<00:06:18.139> be<00:06:18.199> 5<00:06:18.949> volts

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
fixed it was always going to be 5 volts

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.329 
fixed it was always going to be 5 volts
and<00:06:19.550> you<00:06:20.149> filter<00:06:20.749> a<00:06:20.899> lot<00:06:21.139> the<00:06:21.649> walls<00:06:21.949> coming

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:22.339 
and you filter a lot the walls coming

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:27.489 
and you filter a lot the walls coming
out<00:06:22.550> from<00:06:22.849> the<00:06:23.029> AC<00:06:23.830> so<00:06:25.779> again<00:06:26.779> you<00:06:27.110> can<00:06:27.319> get

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:27.499 
out from the AC so again you can get

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:30.879 
out from the AC so again you can get
this<00:06:27.649> component<00:06:28.219> for<00:06:28.399> free<00:06:29.229> other<00:06:30.229> components

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
this component for free other components

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.749 
this component for free other components
can<00:06:31.099> be<00:06:31.550> useful<00:06:31.969> like<00:06:32.120> those<00:06:32.779> fans<00:06:33.729> they<00:06:34.729> are

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
can be useful like those fans they are

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.480 
can be useful like those fans they are
very<00:06:35.089> helpful<00:06:35.360> I<00:06:35.719> use<00:06:36.199> them<00:06:36.499> to<00:06:36.529> cool<00:06:36.979> like

useful<00:07:05.760> and<00:07:06.000> also<00:07:06.870> wires<00:07:07.140> and<00:07:07.590> those<00:07:07.950> wires

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
useful and also wires and those wires

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.800 
useful and also wires and those wires
amazingly<00:07:09.480> they<00:07:09.750> they<00:07:10.560> came<00:07:10.860> with<00:07:11.570> plug<00:07:12.570> which

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
amazingly they they came with plug which

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.280 
amazingly they they came with plug which
like<00:07:13.200> the<00:07:13.230> several<00:07:14.010> plug<00:07:14.220> so<00:07:15.180> I'm<00:07:15.660> gonna<00:07:15.930> take

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.290 
like the several plug so I'm gonna take

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.190 
like the several plug so I'm gonna take
these<00:07:16.470> wires<00:07:16.740> and<00:07:17.190> useful<00:07:17.580> use<00:07:17.820> it<00:07:18.030> for<00:07:18.240> other

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
these wires and useful use it for other

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.600 
these wires and useful use it for other
of<00:07:19.500> applications<00:07:22.490> and<00:07:23.490> that's<00:07:23.790> pretty<00:07:24.150> yet<00:07:25.610> so

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
of applications and that's pretty yet so

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:39.850 
of applications and that's pretty yet so
I<00:07:26.970> just<00:07:27.480> wanted<00:07:27.840> to<00:07:29.030> demonstrate<00:07:30.030> this<00:07:30.660> idea

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:39.860 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.550 

but<00:07:40.860> the<00:07:41.160> most<00:07:41.580> important<00:07:42.030> thing<00:07:42.180> for<00:07:42.480> me<00:07:42.560> is

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 
but the most important thing for me is

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.990 
but the most important thing for me is
to<00:07:43.860> have<00:07:44.400> a<00:07:44.870> battery<00:07:45.870> charger<00:07:46.380> power<00:07:46.590> supply

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 
to have a battery charger power supply

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.990 
to have a battery charger power supply
along<00:07:48.000> with<00:07:48.270> a<00:07:48.450> case<00:07:48.750> which<00:07:49.380> can<00:07:50.280> contain<00:07:50.669> any

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 
along with a case which can contain any

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.840 
along with a case which can contain any
fire<00:07:51.300> might<00:07:51.720> happen<00:07:52.100> thank<00:07:53.100> you<00:07:53.220> for<00:07:53.430> watching

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:53.850 
fire might happen thank you for watching

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.500 
fire might happen thank you for watching
and<00:07:54.229> enjoy<00:07:55.229> the
