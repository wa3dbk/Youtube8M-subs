00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
they're the M 75 65 watt speakers

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.870 
they're the M 75 65 watt speakers
they're<00:00:34.649> basically<00:00:35.010> patterned<00:00:35.520> after<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
they're basically patterned after the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.780 
they're basically patterned after the
old<00:00:36.210> 60s<00:00:36.750> pre-roll<00:00:37.350> ad<00:00:37.500> g12<00:00:37.980> M<00:00:38.100> greenbacks

only with a higher temperature voice

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
only with a higher temperature voice
coil<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.100> run<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> hundred<00:00:41.670> watt<00:00:41.969> amp

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
coil so you can run a hundred watt amp

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
basically set it up so that it has the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.380 
basically set it up so that it has the
same<00:00:46.620> breakup<00:00:47.129> characteristics<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.000> tone<00:00:48.180> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
as a G 12 H 30 so we worked on three or

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.450 
as a G 12 H 30 so we worked on three or
four<00:01:13.260> different<00:01:13.560> models<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.010> finally<00:01:14.130> came

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
four different models and finally came

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.520 
four different models and finally came
up<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> J<00:01:14.970> 75<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.930> got<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> little<00:01:16.380> bit

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
up with the J 75 it's got a little bit

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
up with the J 75 it's got a little bit
bigger<00:01:16.650> magnet<00:01:17.220> than<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> G<00:01:17.640> 12<00:01:17.850> M<00:01:18.030> greenback

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
bigger magnet than the G 12 M greenback

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.020 
bigger magnet than the G 12 M greenback
or<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.320> M<00:01:19.470> 75<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.610> holds<00:01:20.729> together

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
or the M 75 so that it holds together

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.179 
or the M 75 so that it holds together
better<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.720> detuned<00:01:22.170> tones<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:22.950> having

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
better for detuned tones and for having

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.649 
better for detuned tones and for having
a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:23.640> more<00:01:23.850> in-your-face<00:01:24.000> tone

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
a little bit more in-your-face tone

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.740 
a little bit more in-your-face tone
basically<00:01:25.650> winds<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.070> being<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.460> mix<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
basically winds up being a mix of the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.200 
basically winds up being a mix of the
tone<00:01:27.990> halfway<00:01:28.470> between<00:01:28.680> an<00:01:28.950> M<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.400> an<00:01:29.460> H<00:01:29.640> 75

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
tone halfway between an M and an H 75
