editing features so a lot of things that
we're<00:00:23.910> used<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> seeing<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.570> traditional

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
we're used to seeing in traditional

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.170 
we're used to seeing in traditional

features transition features being able
to<00:00:30.689> actually<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.320> keyframing<00:00:31.890> within<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
to actually do keyframing within the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.610 
to actually do keyframing within the
timeline<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.239> keyframe<00:00:33.690> transitions

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
timeline so I can keyframe transitions

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.010 
timeline so I can keyframe transitions
speed<00:00:35.130> effects<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.390> actually<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.780> able<00:00:36.809> do

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
speed effects and actually be able do

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.350 
speed effects and actually be able do
that<00:00:37.140> right<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> timeline<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.610> remember

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that right on the timeline I remember

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760 
that right on the timeline I remember
always<00:00:39.510> having<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:39.960> into<00:00:40.110> another<00:00:40.350> window

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
always having to go into another window

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.530 
always having to go into another window
to<00:00:40.829> add<00:00:41.040> keyframes<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.850> really<00:00:42.210> had<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> hard

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
to add keyframes I really had a hard

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150 
to add keyframes I really had a hard
time<00:00:42.660> figuring<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.829> actually

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
time figuring out what that actually

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.250 
time figuring out what that actually
means<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.670> timeline<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.870> being<00:00:46.050> able<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
means on the timeline so being able to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.600 
means on the timeline so being able to
do<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> timeline<00:00:46.950> makes<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> really

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
do that on the timeline makes it really

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
do that on the timeline makes it really
effective<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.210> able<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.420> quickly<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:49.140> these

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
effective to be able to quickly do these

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.330 
effective to be able to quickly do these
edits<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:49.980> these<00:00:50.160> trims<00:00:50.489> cuts<00:00:50.879> slips<00:00:51.270> lies<00:00:51.480> jkl

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
edits do these trims cuts slips lies jkl

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
edits do these trims cuts slips lies jkl
keyframing<00:00:53.340> all<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> timeline<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.449> really

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
keyframing all to the timeline so really

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.229 
keyframing all to the timeline so really
this<00:00:55.079> edit<00:00:55.440> page<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.890> use<00:00:56.070> has<00:00:56.309> been<00:00:56.489> really

really<00:01:14.189> cool<00:01:14.400> feature<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.880> put<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
really cool feature we put in here is to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
really cool feature we put in here is to
be<00:01:15.570> able<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.900> collaborative<00:01:16.439> editing<00:01:16.740> so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
be able to have collaborative editing so

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
be able to have collaborative editing so
we<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.549> actually<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.880> two<00:01:18.030> colors<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.689> one

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we can actually have two colors and one

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.320 
we can actually have two colors and one
editor<00:01:19.619> working<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> same<00:01:20.549> project<00:01:21.180> on

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
editor working on the same project on

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.429 
editor working on the same project on
three<00:01:21.509> different<00:01:21.689> machines<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> same

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
three different machines at the same

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.020 
three different machines at the same
time<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.670> three<00:01:23.880> different

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
time so not you have three different

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.270 
time so not you have three different
timelines<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.229> we're<00:01:25.590> different<00:01:25.860> versions

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
timelines but we're different versions

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.249 
timelines but we're different versions
of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> product<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.090> same<00:01:27.330> project<00:01:27.900> so

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
of the product it's the same project so

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.140 
of the product it's the same project so
it<00:01:28.350> turns<00:01:28.560> red<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.220> see<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.790> editor

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
it turns red when you see the editor

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
it turns red when you see the editor
make<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> trip<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.990> then<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.619> ahead

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
make the trip and then you can go ahead

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.230 
make the trip and then you can go ahead

obviously you guys have resolved light
what<00:02:49.180> kind<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.390> features<00:02:49.540> are<00:02:49.900> going<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.080> be

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
what kind of features are going to be

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.650 
what kind of features are going to be
coming<00:02:50.680> too<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.670> almost<00:02:51.970> everything<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.510> we

light<00:02:54.459> as<00:02:54.610> well<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.030> collaborative<00:02:55.510> editing

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
light as well the collaborative editing

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.789 
light as well the collaborative editing
i<00:02:55.959> think<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.290> one<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.560> things<00:02:56.739> that

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
i think is the one of the things that

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.620 
i think is the one of the things that
won't<00:02:57.069> we<00:02:57.340> do<00:02:57.459> need<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.670> database<00:02:58.150> for<00:02:58.450> that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
won't we do need the database for that

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.690 
won't we do need the database for that
but<00:02:58.930> all<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.410> these<00:02:59.560> editing<00:02:59.920> functionalities

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
but all of these editing functionalities

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.400 
but all of these editing functionalities
the<00:03:00.940> dual<00:03:01.090> screen<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.690> should<00:03:01.870> all<00:03:01.989> be<00:03:02.200> part
