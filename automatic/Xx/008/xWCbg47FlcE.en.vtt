00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.760
 Here I will make a short dress such a length 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:17.180
 me under these here for my idea further 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.580
 what is the idea this is your cat and I 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.460
 produced two more large beads 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.340
 beaded how to sheathe and beads i 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:31.040
 Already showed pus video link I 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:34.100
 leave under this video means this 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.620
 there will be a total length of the flagellum here it will be 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.579
 connect one such strip which 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.499
 I 'll do it now 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.929
 and below there will be these large beads 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:47.569
 where the beads tails will hang 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.530
 how will I do tails now show 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:55.219
 for this I need a needle and thread 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:01:04.540
 that is, in my case, the fishing line I take one 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:08.740
 blue bead sight of her at the very end, and 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.740
 I tie three knots here 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.290
 and then I dial 4 centimeters of beads 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.810
 if I have a dark blue bead at the end 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.810
 then I now collect blue beads 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.210
 then I take the blue beads are already gaining 4 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.210
 centimeters 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.479
 and the last bead will be silly 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.759
 now i run a needle through those 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:56.990
 beads except the first blue of some and those 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.990
 silly 4 centimeters 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.060
 here I got two such brushes 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.700
 2 pendants then I add as much 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.430
 how much do I want them to have me 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.310
 I think it goes somewhere 10 stuff just 5 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.819
 some 5 blue exactly the same 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.909
 principle i made earrings 1 sheathed 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.480
 bead and to it I added 8 such and 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.480
 silik 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.500
 that's all I got here 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.990
 I have 11 of all these stripes now 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.940
 need to do so between them here 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.600
 so they are not so close to each other 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.720
 were sitting 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.780
 and a little between them happened 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.760
 that means i start with the last one 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.820
 a little delay, and so I do not need 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.860
 next so that between them was 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.240
 a small place is necessary to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.910
 then when they knitted 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.230
 they were not in a tense state 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.230
 freely written off 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.750
 pendant it's ready now everything is left 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.060
 only attach and let me not 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.580
 do it like this 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.180
 so she sat beautifully and bottom like this 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.180
 mixed up 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.520
 Now these nodules is now quite possible 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.250
 make the last knot and do something 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.379
 the same with the second beads so it means with 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.289
 suspension we figured out these need 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.599
 do two things and one more thing 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.780
 which I made it like this 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:08.090
 would be a little ring on the basics i'm here 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.960
 scored 25 beads if there was 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.180
 nine then 25 here I did it in order 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.020
 so that you can pass through both ends 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:22.039
 and how would analog serve as a clasp 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:27.849
 then I will have to tie only here 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:30.770
 these suspension and mouse cat will be ready 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.550
 I also tie up the suspension because 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.930
 it turns out I have no 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.879
 no system, so to speak 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.099
 specifically how to tie it up I just 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:45.099
 try to make it go out 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.099
 as if straight from the middle of stock photography 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:19.120
 Well, now I signed two pendants in 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:24.720
 short dress 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:28.780
 This can adjust the length of the tongue. 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.569
 so to this flagellum is still such 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:38.229
 bracelet is also a little flagellum 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:43.470
 and then two circles with minutes with glasses but also 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:43.470
 earrings that I already showed here they are 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:49.960
 about the same way I did 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:54.449
 yet another naborchik and now I have it 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.449
 I'll show you the next video see you soon
