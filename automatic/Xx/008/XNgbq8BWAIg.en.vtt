in<00:00:00.269> this<00:00:00.539> video<00:00:00.870> I'm<00:00:01.110> gonna<00:00:01.290> be<00:00:01.469> looking<00:00:01.770> at

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
in this video I'm gonna be looking at

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.490 
in this video I'm gonna be looking at
the<00:00:02.070> trend<00:00:02.520> in<00:00:02.820> reactivity<00:00:03.360> as<00:00:03.870> you<00:00:04.110> go<00:00:04.230> down

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
the trend in reactivity as you go down

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.369 
the trend in reactivity as you go down
group<00:00:04.920> 2<00:00:05.270> on<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.600> periodic<00:00:06.990> table<00:00:07.140> so

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
group 2 on the periodic table so

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.680 
group 2 on the periodic table so
beryllium<00:00:08.099> magnesium<00:00:08.550> calcium<00:00:09.179> strontium

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
beryllium magnesium calcium strontium

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.560 
beryllium magnesium calcium strontium
barium<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.559> radium<00:00:10.910> so<00:00:11.910> why'd<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.120> go<00:00:12.330> down

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
barium and radium so why'd you go down

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.060 
barium and radium so why'd you go down
I'm<00:00:12.900> gonna<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:13.320> looking<00:00:13.559> at<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> trend<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
I'm gonna be looking at the trend of

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.870 
I'm gonna be looking at the trend of
reactivity<00:00:15.049> now<00:00:16.049> if<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.160> actually<00:00:17.340> take<00:00:17.820> a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
reactivity now if you actually take a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.150 
reactivity now if you actually take a
took<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.480> look<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> trend<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.289> reactivity<00:00:19.650> you

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
took a look at a trend in reactivity you

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.570 
took a look at a trend in reactivity you
would<00:00:20.279> find<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.910> as<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.779> go<00:00:21.900> down<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.920> up

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
would find that as you go down the up

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.890 
would find that as you go down the up
you<00:00:23.699> go<00:00:23.850> down<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.269> group<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> down<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> group

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.979 

reactivity<00:00:30.900> increases<00:00:35.989> reactivity

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
reactivity increases reactivity

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:48.979 
reactivity increases reactivity
increases<00:00:45.469> now<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.399> reason<00:00:47.820> why<00:00:48.059> reactivity

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
increases now the reason why reactivity

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.189 
increases now the reason why reactivity
increases<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.690> actually

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
increases is because if you actually

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
increases is because if you actually
took<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.590> look<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.059> ionization<00:00:54.059> energies

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
took a look at the ionization energies

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.139 
took a look at the ionization energies
of<00:00:54.690> these<00:00:54.840> elements<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.250> when<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
of these elements as you when the as you

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.639 
of these elements as you when the as you
go<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> period<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.109> might<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.350> react<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
go down a period they might not react to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.410 
go down a period they might not react to
the<00:00:58.829> proper<00:00:59.129> ionization<00:00:59.730> anything<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.300> if

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the proper ionization anything but if

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.819 
the proper ionization anything but if
you<00:01:00.449> take<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> look<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> ionization<00:01:01.469> energy

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you take a look at the ionization energy

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.270 
you take a look at the ionization energy
or<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.690> down<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> period<00:01:04.470> you'd<00:01:04.979> find

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
or as you go down a period you'd find

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.510 
or as you go down a period you'd find
that<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> ionization<00:01:05.729> energy<00:01:06.630> decreases

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
that the ionization energy decreases

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.410 
that the ionization energy decreases
especially<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> first<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.090> second

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
especially the first and second

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.070 
especially the first and second
ionization<00:01:09.570> energy<00:01:10.670> now<00:01:11.720> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> very

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
ionization energy now this is very

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.859 
ionization energy now this is very
significant<00:01:13.799> because<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:15.210> group<00:01:15.509> two

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
significant because the group two

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.440 
significant because the group two
elements<00:01:16.590> when<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:17.400> react<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> tend<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
elements when they react what I tend to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.620 
elements when they react what I tend to
do<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:19.020> tend<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.500> oxidized<00:01:20.930> oxidized

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
do is they tend to be oxidized oxidized

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.010 
do is they tend to be oxidized oxidized
and<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.960> remember<00:01:25.200> oil<00:01:25.619> rig<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:27.140> rig

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
and if you remember oil rig or you rig

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
and if you remember oil rig or you rig
oxidation<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> loss<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.710> reduction<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.340> gain

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
oxidation is loss and reduction is gain

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.539 
oxidation is loss and reduction is gain
and<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.329> oxidation<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.079> loss<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.740> electrons<00:01:35.579> so

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
and so oxidation is loss of electrons so

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.770 
and so oxidation is loss of electrons so
what<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:38.640> tend<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.060> when<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.329> react<00:01:39.630> is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
what they tend to do when they react is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.260 
what they tend to do when they react is
they<00:01:39.900> tend<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.140> lose<00:01:40.320> electrons<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
they tend to lose electrons and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.580 
they tend to lose electrons and
ionization<00:01:42.270> energies<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> energy<00:01:43.200> required

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
ionization energies the energy required

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.240 
ionization energies the energy required
to<00:01:43.710> remove<00:01:44.220> some<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.030> those<00:01:45.149> electrons<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.250> so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to remove some of those electrons and so

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.460 
to remove some of those electrons and so
you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.060> imagine<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.689> less<00:01:48.960> energy<00:01:49.409> is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
you can imagine if less energy is

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
you can imagine if less energy is
required<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.100> remove<00:01:50.250> some<00:01:50.729> electrons<00:01:51.299> it's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
required to remove some electrons it's

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.719 
required to remove some electrons it's
going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.380> much<00:01:52.649> more<00:01:52.920> reactive<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.549> this

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
going to be much more reactive and this

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.749 
going to be much more reactive and this
is<00:01:53.880> what<00:01:54.060> happens<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.430> in

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
is what happens and so as you go down in

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.030 
is what happens and so as you go down in
a<00:01:56.820> period<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.990> ionization<00:01:58.649> energy

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
a period as the ionization energy

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.389 
a period as the ionization energy
decreases<00:02:00.020> its<00:02:01.020> tendency<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.829> oxidized

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
decreases its tendency to be oxidized

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.399 
decreases its tendency to be oxidized
this<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.850> willingness<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.659> oxidized<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this is willingness to be oxidized so to

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.370 
this is willingness to be oxidized so to
speak<00:02:04.939> increases<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.719> reactivity

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
speak increases and so it's reactivity

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.740 
speak increases and so it's reactivity
as<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.710> consequence<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.489> increases<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
as a consequence of that increases and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.809 
as a consequence of that increases and
so<00:02:10.140> over<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.560> next<00:02:10.649> few<00:02:10.950> videos<00:02:11.160> I'm<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
so over the next few videos I'm going to

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.800 
so over the next few videos I'm going to
be<00:02:11.910> talking<00:02:12.060> about<00:02:12.390> some<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
be talking about some of the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.550 
be talking about some of the
consequences

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
consequences

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.010 
consequences
of<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.860> increased<00:02:14.400> reactivity<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.510> I'm

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
of this increased reactivity and I'm

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.059 
of this increased reactivity and I'm
gonna<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.290> talking<00:02:16.560> about<00:02:16.590> some<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
gonna be talking about some of the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.500 
gonna be talking about some of the
reactions<00:02:17.580> which<00:02:17.819> group<00:02:18.209> two<00:02:19.819> elements<00:02:20.819> take

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
reactions which group two elements take
