00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that's when it all started

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.270 
that's when it all started
when<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> really<00:00:41.180> see<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> difference<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
when I really see a difference and the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520 
when I really see a difference and the
students<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:44.879> working<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.350> like<00:00:46.350> when

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
students that I'm working with like when

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.810 
students that I'm working with like when
I<00:00:46.559> actually<00:00:46.800> couldn't<00:00:47.280> measure<00:00:47.520> their

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
I actually couldn't measure their

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.049 
I actually couldn't measure their
progress<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.950> see<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.370> feel<00:00:50.850> better

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
progress and see that they feel better

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
progress and see that they feel better
about<00:00:51.210> their<00:00:51.480> learning<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:52.860> favorite

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
about their learning so my favorite

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.770 
about their learning so my favorite
parts<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.879> sometimes<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.360> takes<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.750> long

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
parts because sometimes it takes so long

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.479 
parts because sometimes it takes so long
to<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.309> leave

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
to get there but then it's like leave

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
to get there but then it's like leave
and<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.360> light<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:58.320> all<00:00:58.469> sudden

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and they see the light like all sudden

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.319 
and they see the light like all sudden
oh<00:00:58.980> well<00:00:59.340> then<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> feel<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.000> I've<00:01:00.120> made<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
oh well then I feel like I've made a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
oh well then I feel like I've made a
difference<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.949> felt<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.250> about

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
difference and they felt that about

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.549 
difference and they felt that about
their<00:01:02.760> learning<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> early<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:04.290> moved

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
their learning in the early have moved

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.170 
their learning in the early have moved
from<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.100> place<00:01:05.250> where<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.850> weren't<00:01:06.150> very

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
from a place where they weren't very

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.940 
from a place where they weren't very
comfortable<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> place<00:01:07.320> where<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.619> really

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
comfortable to a place where they really

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
comfortable to a place where they really
played<00:01:08.159> along<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.820> that's<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:09.630> favorite

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
played along so that's all my favorite

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.620 
played along so that's all my favorite
parts<00:01:10.049> another<00:01:10.770> part<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.939> challenge<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
parts another part is the challenge of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.789 
parts another part is the challenge of
the<00:01:13.549> small<00:01:14.549> progress<00:01:15.170> there's<00:01:16.170> days<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.500> go

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the small progress there's days that go

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.040 
the small progress there's days that go
by<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.270> seems<00:01:18.750> like

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
by and it seems like

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.840 
by and it seems like
difference<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:20.650> that's<00:01:20.800> kind<00:01:21.370> of<00:01:21.430> opposite

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
difference and that's kind of opposite

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.510 
difference and that's kind of opposite
what<00:01:21.970> makes<00:01:22.150> me<00:01:22.270> happy<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:22.990> so<00:01:23.860> I<00:01:23.890> guess<00:01:24.070> the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
what makes me happy so so I guess the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.460 
what makes me happy so so I guess the
most<00:01:24.730> challenging<00:01:25.150> is<00:01:25.300> is<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.840> move<00:01:26.020> them<00:01:26.230> in<00:01:26.380> a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
most challenging is is to move them in a

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.520 
most challenging is is to move them in a
way<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.740> they<00:01:26.920> are<00:01:27.330> progressing<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:28.540> me

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
way that they are progressing and me

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.110 
way that they are progressing and me
seeing<00:01:29.830> that<00:01:29.950> because<00:01:30.580> sometimes<00:01:30.790> it's<00:01:31.090> hard

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
seeing that because sometimes it's hard

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.840 
seeing that because sometimes it's hard
to<00:01:31.360> see

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
to see

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.910 
to see
trying<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> incorporate<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.350> smart<00:01:34.680> board<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
trying to incorporate the smart board a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.680 
trying to incorporate the smart board a
lot<00:01:35.130> because<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> kids<00:01:35.550> love<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.300> it<00:01:36.450> just

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
lot because the kids love it and it just

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.510 
lot because the kids love it and it just
is<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.020> full<00:01:37.230> way<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.440> engage<00:01:37.710> them<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.160> learning

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
is a full way to engage them in learning

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.940 
is a full way to engage them in learning
so<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.730> been<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.910> really<00:01:39.120> positive<00:01:39.360> thing<00:01:39.950> the
