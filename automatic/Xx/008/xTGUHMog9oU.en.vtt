 docile and affectionate we agree there 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.619

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.040

 break your house we are in the process of 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.159
 destroy your house except sometimes 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.159
 he puts it down during moments of emotion 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.370
 I chose to remake a great 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.100
 room for the little brighton who has 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.090
 lost both arms 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:02.470
 I was so sad when I 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:03.070
 pushes them and its swing in the middle 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.200
 from his room 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.440
 we decided to put a pretty baby 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.440
 football 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.640
 for his little sister carrie who is 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.760
 blind we put pictures of his father 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.800
 almost everywhere his father who died 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.800
 before having met his mother 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.290
 who she undergoes an operation of the apple 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.570
 of adam yes so it's always a little 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.740
 exaggerated the masons of the heart and in the end 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.600
 the poor actually are taking a 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.130
 week in disney to remind him 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.490
 that they are poor and both they 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.990
 return 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.210
 except that a big bus hide their city 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.620
 so smiled jedir rapper move for 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.850
 see what's behind the bus which 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.200
 who creates a new album 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.930
 except when there is a deaf and dumb in 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:50.910
 the family is how it manages 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:52.540
 I must feel that I may have a 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.459
 little shocked 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.360
 if a wish better who was shocked by 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.810
 what he heard right away 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.810
 they tell me 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.340
 youri it does not interfere so you say move 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.239
 that garnet boss and the reaction 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.049
 typical american oprah god oh my 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.049
 god or your trouble 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.780
 in France we have the equivalent of 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.240
 this show called everyone 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.120
 together except that all together it's 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.120
 a TF1 program with the budget of 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.440
 france 3 which makes that for example to 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.450
 masons of the heart is about 450 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.260
 volunteers who are mobilized to all 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.790
 together they are eleven cameraman included 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.810
 so the result is not the same 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.740
 as heart masons you know the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.350
 result is a bit like in 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.520
 the deco show or elsewhere in this 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.540
 emission place of a bus you have hands 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.770
 from valérie damidot something else almost 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.230
 like bat valérie damidot a building site 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.220
 in a building site the bazaar 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.810
 I personally would prefer 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.980
 slam an infant against plaster 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.069
 than typing my apartment 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.230
 it's a point of view point of view 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.160
 staff 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.600
 so I was doing people do not have the 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:12.560
 same reaction it's a little bit done 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:14.920
 rather it ah yeah it changes a slaughter I 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.889
 would not have put that 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.810
 how did you have you retype the 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.829
 mob I wanted to buy 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.829
 yes or no I will throw it anyway 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.430
 and that's a hit on the TV there who told me 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.430
 seen from elsewhere on tv ah I see that 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.850
 my popularity exceeded me I had done 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.550
 only to laugh at five passages in 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.450
 two seasons stopped at five passengers 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.600
 of applause 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.560
 I am a little half boarders and 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.940
 you know at the end of his five 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.990
 passengers to a lady who wanted me 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.150
 actually support send a small 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.470
 mail made me you know it's not because 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.090
 we can not do it on TV 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.180
 not come later look at chimene 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.180
 badi 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.760
 when we compare you to chimène badi 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.020
 between us for those who have the album where 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.000
 lived what is called a lift 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.190
 emotional ie you leave very 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.840
 high and you fell very low but in two 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.080
 seconds it's like kissing a cannon 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.280
 who stinks of the mouth same effect it is 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.750
 as if I told you tonight the 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.730
 girls i'm single and homosexual 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.880
 to see this feeling of injustice that 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.720
 you feel and I experienced something 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.950
 like that the day I got my 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.750
 first car and here I can tell you 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.600
 that the emotional lift he was from 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.910
 kind of crossed a pretty girl who has 13 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.320
 years old and who is pregnant 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.320
 from your father yes
