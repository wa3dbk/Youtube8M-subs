able<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.560> stop<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.980> earlier<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.699> better

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
able to stop this earlier it's better

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.370 
able to stop this earlier it's better
than<00:00:30.089> we<00:00:30.240> looked<00:00:30.419> at<00:00:30.509> one<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.839> you<00:00:30.990> handed

than we looked at one that you handed

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.260 
than we looked at one that you handed
one<00:00:31.610> another<00:00:33.410> option<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:35.090> exactly<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> same

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
one another option for exactly the same

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.350 
one another option for exactly the same
scenario<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.289> the<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.739> hand<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.640> this

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
scenario is the one hand one this

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.540 
scenario is the one hand one this
laughing<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.989> altered<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.620> goes<00:00:40.770> back<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.309> like

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
laughing is altered it goes back to like

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.700 
laughing is altered it goes back to like
I<00:00:41.579> say<00:00:41.879> classical<00:00:42.449> jujitsu<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.140> probably

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I say classical jujitsu it probably

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.950 
I say classical jujitsu it probably
evolved<00:00:44.129> from<00:00:44.460> sword<00:00:45.000> work<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.390> learned<00:00:45.780> very

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
evolved from sword work I learned very

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.869 
evolved from sword work I learned very
similar<00:00:46.590> counter<00:00:46.890> deployment<00:00:47.340> techniques<00:00:47.670> in

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
similar counter deployment techniques in

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.080 
similar counter deployment techniques in
in<00:00:48.260> filipino<00:00:49.260> store<00:00:50.190> works<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.699> very<00:00:50.820> old

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
in filipino store works and very old

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
in filipino store works and very old
systems<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.050> actually<00:00:52.410> dealt<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.859> when

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
systems that actually dealt with when

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.170 
systems that actually dealt with when
the<00:00:53.190> person's<00:00:53.550> trying<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> draw<00:00:53.969> his<00:00:54.149> weapon

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the person's trying to draw his weapon

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.840 
the person's trying to draw his weapon
now<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.469> reason<00:00:55.679> I'm<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> use<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.340> hand

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
now the reason I'm going to use one hand

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.819 
now the reason I'm going to use one hand
is<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.780> could<00:00:57.929> use<00:00:58.079> my<00:00:58.230> second<00:00:58.620> hand

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
is because I could use my second hand

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.590 
is because I could use my second hand
for<00:00:59.070> something<00:00:59.399> else<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.940> here's<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.420> mean

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
for something else so here's what I mean

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.540 
for something else so here's what I mean
as<00:01:00.960> he<00:01:01.140> draws<00:01:01.379> i'm<00:01:01.769> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> put<00:01:02.190> weight<00:01:02.489> on

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
as he draws i'm going to put weight on

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.119 
as he draws i'm going to put weight on
this<00:01:03.000> way<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.449> one<00:01:03.660> hand<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.739> you're<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
this way with one hand so if you're a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.860 
this way with one hand so if you're a
peace<00:01:05.550> officer<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.300> example<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:06.780> you're

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
peace officer for example and you're

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.870 
peace officer for example and you're
carrying<00:01:07.290> your<00:01:07.410> own<00:01:07.470> side<00:01:08.100> mark<00:01:08.370> this<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
carrying your own side mark this is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
carrying your own side mark this is
ideal<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> situation<00:01:10.080> because<00:01:10.860> you're

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
ideal for that situation because you're

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280 
ideal for that situation because you're
able<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.400> counter<00:01:11.850> deploy<00:01:12.210> well<00:01:12.810> deploying

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
able to counter deploy well deploying

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.980 
able to counter deploy well deploying
your<00:01:13.830> own<00:01:14.040> sidearm<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.540> good<00:01:15.780> because

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
your own sidearm and it's good because

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.530 
your own sidearm and it's good because
you're<00:01:16.380> using<00:01:16.620> your<00:01:17.010> weak<00:01:17.430> side<00:01:17.730> arm<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.300> step

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you're using your weak side arm to step

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
you're using your weak side arm to step
forward<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:18.960> he<00:01:18.990> draws<00:01:19.380> from<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> front<00:01:20.010> there

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
forward as he draws from the front there

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.880 
forward as he draws from the front there
this<00:01:21.240> hand<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.780> doing<00:01:21.960> exactly<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.830> same

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
this hand is doing exactly the same

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.310 
this hand is doing exactly the same
thing<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.240> hand<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.810> doing<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.230> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
thing that this hand was doing in the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830 
thing that this hand was doing in the
first<00:01:25.620> technique<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.820> difference<00:01:27.480> is<00:01:27.660> it's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
first technique the difference is it's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.190 
first technique the difference is it's
my<00:01:27.960> other<00:01:28.110> hand<00:01:28.440> so<00:01:28.650> I'm<00:01:28.710> getting<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.040> close<00:01:30.200> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
my other hand so I'm getting as close to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.690 
my other hand so I'm getting as close to
his<00:01:31.380> thumb<00:01:32.510> here<00:01:33.510> as<00:01:34.320> possible<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:35.220> gripping

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
his thumb here as possible I'm gripping

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.690 
his thumb here as possible I'm gripping
like<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.470> see<00:01:37.740> many<00:01:38.220> handguns

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
like this as you can see many handguns

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.660 
like this as you can see many handguns
have<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> spur<00:01:39.690> here<00:01:40.050> my<00:01:40.440> hand<00:01:40.740> fits<00:01:41.070> under<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
have a spur here my hand fits under that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.640 
have a spur here my hand fits under that
spur<00:01:43.250> it's<00:01:44.250> pretty<00:01:44.580> difficult<00:01:44.880> for<00:01:45.390> him<00:01:45.480> to

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
spur it's pretty difficult for him to

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.960 
spur it's pretty difficult for him to
pull<00:01:46.650> that<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.830> and<00:01:47.070> he<00:01:47.130> said<00:01:47.310> keep<00:01:47.550> my<00:01:47.760> weight

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
pull that up and he said keep my weight

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.620 
pull that up and he said keep my weight
on<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.440> lot<00:01:49.620> of<00:01:49.650> modern<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.250> really

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
on now in a lot of modern is really

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.850 
on now in a lot of modern is really

probably where the second area approach
evolved<00:02:23.070> from<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.880> allow<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.750> stop

now<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.480> question<00:02:36.690> becomes<00:02:37.020> okay<00:02:37.620> what<00:02:37.890> if<00:02:38.010> I

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100

classic wristlock armpit locks in the
area<00:02:47.910> that's<00:02:48.240> one<00:02:48.630> way<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.830> assuming

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
area that's one way to do it assuming

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.000

that you know those techniques well

that you know those techniques well
alright<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.670> i<00:02:53.700> get<00:02:53.940> if<00:02:54.030> I'm<00:02:54.180> here<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:55.460> can<00:02:56.460> get

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.200 
two hands on the Energy's really
fighting<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.950> get<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.370> up<00:02:59.580> which<00:02:59.820> can<00:03:00.000> happen

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
fighting to get it up which can happen

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.820 
fighting to get it up which can happen
because<00:03:00.540> i<00:03:00.690> don't<00:03:00.930> have<00:03:00.990> an<00:03:01.170> elbow<00:03:01.440> control

better<00:03:51.330> better<00:03:52.080> trouble<00:03:52.620> okay<00:03:52.800> so<00:03:53.340> at<00:03:53.430> some

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
better better trouble okay so at some

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.050 
better better trouble okay so at some
point<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:54.030> pulling<00:03:54.510> out<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:56.220> next<00:03:56.610> phase<00:03:56.820> is

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
point is pulling out the next phase is

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.090 
point is pulling out the next phase is
instead<00:03:57.330> of<00:03:57.450> working<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.170> wrist<00:03:58.380> lock<00:03:58.620> here<00:03:58.980> I

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
instead of working the wrist lock here I

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.400 
instead of working the wrist lock here I
go<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.580> gun<00:03:59.790> itself<00:04:00.140> alright<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.290> we're

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
go to the gun itself alright so we're

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.320 
go to the gun itself alright so we're
kind<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.650> mixing<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.489> old-school<00:04:03.150> and

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
kind of mixing the old-school and

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.270 
kind of mixing the old-school and
new-school<00:04:03.360> which<00:04:03.900> was<00:04:04.080> fairly<00:04:04.530> common<00:04:05.040> in

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
new-school which was fairly common in

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.030 
new-school which was fairly common in
later<00:04:05.640> old<00:04:06.360> school<00:04:06.720> training<00:04:06.930> from<00:04:07.470> here<00:04:07.890> i

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
later old school training from here i

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.590 
later old school training from here i
have<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.400> same<00:04:08.580> options<00:04:09.090> this<00:04:09.180> is

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
have the same options this is

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.140 
have the same options this is
good<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.230> can<00:04:10.980> continue<00:04:11.550> their<00:04:11.670> wrist<00:04:11.910> lock

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
good I can continue their wrist lock

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.060 
good I can continue their wrist lock
which<00:04:12.840> actually<00:04:13.140> may<00:04:13.410> work<00:04:13.590> better<00:04:13.860> because

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
which actually may work better because

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.570 
which actually may work better because
the<00:04:14.370> gun<00:04:14.580> acts<00:04:15.030> as<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.480> lever<00:04:15.810> or<00:04:16.770> you<00:04:17.400> can

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
the gun acts as a lever or you can

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.280 
the gun acts as a lever or you can
simply<00:04:17.790> work<00:04:18.060> against<00:04:18.450> his<00:04:18.570> thumb<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.050> take

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
simply work against his thumb and take

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.250 
simply work against his thumb and take
it<00:04:19.440> out<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.680> now<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.910> shouldn't<00:04:21.239> be<00:04:21.989> with<00:04:22.140> the

option metal back to here in take it out
ok<00:05:34.380> so<00:05:35.310> there's<00:05:35.490> counter<00:05:35.940> deployment<00:05:36.510> looking

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
ok so there's counter deployment looking

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.220 
ok so there's counter deployment looking
with<00:05:38.280> one<00:05:39.060> hand<00:05:39.330> now<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.810> good<00:05:39.990> thing<00:05:40.050> about

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
you have to just fabulous into your

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.280 
you have to just fabulous into your
training<00:05:53.910> because<00:05:54.180> it's<00:05:54.420> close<00:05:54.660> to<00:05:54.690> a<00:05:54.870> second

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
training because it's close to a second

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.660 
training because it's close to a second
half<00:05:55.440> so<00:05:55.620> if<00:05:55.680> I<00:05:55.770> do<00:05:55.830> this<00:05:56.160> just<00:05:56.400> remember<00:05:56.640> to

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
half so if I do this just remember to

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.490 
half so if I do this just remember to
get<00:05:56.820> there<00:05:57.000> before<00:05:57.120> he<00:05:57.390> does<00:05:57.420> he's<00:05:58.290> got<00:05:58.470> a

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
get there before he does he's got a

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.290 
get there before he does he's got a
second<00:05:58.890> hand<00:05:59.040> it's<00:05:59.220> a<00:05:59.280> more<00:05:59.460> awkward<00:05:59.640> draw<00:06:00.090> for

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
second hand it's a more awkward draw for

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.180 
second hand it's a more awkward draw for
him<00:06:00.450> at<00:06:00.540> the<00:06:00.630> same<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:01.230> then<00:06:01.740> again<00:06:02.010> you've

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
him at the same and then again you've

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.980 
him at the same and then again you've
got<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.520> weapon<00:06:02.910> if<00:06:03.120> you<00:06:03.630> know<00:06:03.750> how<00:06:03.930> to

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
got the weapon if you know how to

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.560 
got the weapon if you know how to
operate<00:06:04.640> maybe<00:06:05.640> they'll<00:06:05.820> be<00:06:05.910> intimidated<00:06:06.450> but

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
operate maybe they'll be intimidated but

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.600 
operate maybe they'll be intimidated but
you<00:06:07.320> know<00:06:07.440> maybe<00:06:07.680> he<00:06:07.890> knows<00:06:08.040> that<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.370> slide

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
you know maybe he knows that the slide

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.940 
you know maybe he knows that the slide
it<00:06:08.760> hasn't<00:06:09.000> been<00:06:09.060> rack<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.540> you<00:06:09.630> don't<00:06:09.870> so<00:06:10.860> you

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
it hasn't been rack and you don't so you

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.140 
it hasn't been rack and you don't so you
don't<00:06:11.130> even<00:06:11.220> know<00:06:11.400> if<00:06:11.490> this<00:06:11.640> would<00:06:11.820> fire<00:06:12.120> you

off and they're they're very rugged and
it's<00:06:41.100> difficult<00:06:41.310> when<00:06:41.790> the<00:06:41.910> accidentally<00:06:42.540> go

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
it's difficult when the accidentally go

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.470 
it's difficult when the accidentally go
up<00:06:42.780> particular<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:43.650> hammers<00:06:44.100> down<00:06:44.360> you<00:06:45.360> know

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
up particular the hammers down you know

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.610 
up particular the hammers down you know
the<00:06:45.600> impact<00:06:45.870> would<00:06:46.020> have<00:06:46.140> to<00:06:46.230> force<00:06:46.470> the

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
the impact would have to force the

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.200 
the impact would have to force the
hammer<00:06:46.800> up<00:06:47.010> and<00:06:47.250> all<00:06:47.340> the<00:06:47.400> way<00:06:47.430> down<00:06:47.550> or

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
hammer up and all the way down or

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.300 
hammer up and all the way down or
depends<00:06:49.170> moving<00:06:49.500> around<00:06:49.650> there<00:06:49.890> so<00:06:50.010> not<00:06:50.160> just

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
depends moving around there so not just

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.920 
depends moving around there so not just
be<00:06:50.760> assured<00:06:51.060> it's<00:06:51.240> difficult<00:06:51.630> in<00:06:51.840> an

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
be assured it's difficult in an

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.770 
be assured it's difficult in an
accidental<00:06:52.380> discharge<00:06:52.470> to<00:06:53.460> be<00:06:53.610> impact<00:06:54.030> ok<00:06:54.720> so

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
accidental discharge to be impact ok so

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.910 
accidental discharge to be impact ok so
again<00:06:55.130> be<00:06:56.130> aware<00:06:56.400> that<00:06:56.610> sometimes<00:06:56.850> if<00:06:57.690> you<00:06:58.680> see

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920 
again be aware that sometimes if you see

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.770 
again be aware that sometimes if you see

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
his hand coming to get there first it

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.780 
his hand coming to get there first it
may<00:07:01.080> appeal<00:07:01.500> up<00:07:01.770> make<00:07:02.040> sure<00:07:02.070> to<00:07:02.370> get<00:07:02.490> a<00:07:02.550> hold
