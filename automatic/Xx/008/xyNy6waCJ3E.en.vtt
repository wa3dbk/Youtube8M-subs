facebook especially if you're in high
school<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.530> don't<00:01:28.710> want<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.130> awkward

school and you don't want to be awkward

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.249

should go do it at lunch or something no

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.819 
I think you should do it on Facebook one
because<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.990> pressuring<00:01:37.439> her<00:01:37.650> in

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
because it's not pressuring her in

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.859 
because it's not pressuring her in
person<00:01:38.100> maybe<00:01:38.549> she's<00:01:38.820> around<00:01:39.060> her<00:01:39.270> friends

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
person maybe she's around her friends

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
person maybe she's around her friends
