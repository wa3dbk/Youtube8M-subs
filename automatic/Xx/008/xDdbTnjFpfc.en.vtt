00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.570
 moin moin hello and welcome 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.480
 at a new let's play tips too 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.330
 Disney and this time it's about the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.340
 strange coins like strangers on the 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.590
 fastest I show you or 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.130
 I'll tell you the best known 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.970
 away and the fastest known way 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.160
 and if you like this video 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.809
 should leave a comment and comment 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.149
 a clear upward and we 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.070
 start right now what right 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.179
 This way you have to be two 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.820
 satisfy conditions 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:45.670
 the first way is that you have a minimum 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.989
 level of 28 should have reached 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.499
 However, by the 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.149
 accordingly good types and 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:54.010
 The crucible marks at the 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.620
 corresponding faction no problem 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.170
 you should be there because you equipment 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.659
 what could you buy with 36 light? 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.629
 if you do this completely and no exotic 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.610
 object as equipment still have 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.450
 I believe at least 30 bring 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.820
 the second one is not hers 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.640
 By leveling you can reach 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.060
 namely the second currently 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.400
 dsi published the house of wolves 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.770
 as this tip and this trick as well 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.200
 getting the shapes of coins in the arena 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.350
 this takes place without the second one 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.580
 dlc unfortunately not available 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.380
 should you have the second diaz you 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.610
 but not yet the arena is here 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.490
 Of course they have to be recommended 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.230
 story of ds from the house of throw that 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.240
 play through the second dsi 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.830
 after graduation you get here too 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.160
 Like a key for the big one 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.540
 chest in the arena 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.310
 should you have done that now and 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.340
 meet these two conditions 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.410
 First of all, congratulations and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.600
 then it starts already then you can 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.110
 you go to the arena and plays the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 arena 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.720
 the 28 he is the easiest places 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.640
 and depending on the team you have 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.100
 Of course you can complete it with two euros 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.780
 play or even with dice 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.929
 play because it is in the 28 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.530
 arena still the player search gives depending on 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.109
 team is there since the duration of about 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.420
 15 to an average of 25 minutes 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.760
 depending on what kind of animal half time and 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.989
 like one 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.650
 play side by side etc why is it 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.140
 the fastest way is easy if 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.510
 Considering I'll take me as 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.280
 For example, I had that before I did that 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.090
 have done on average under the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.640
 week was a maximum of 20 coins fall to fall 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.590
 if I have a lot gelautet much feathers 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.200
 Kramny took off and had a lot of blood out 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.150
 Of course that happens from time to time 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.209
 Let's face it for example 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.190
 a weird coin gets a gram and 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.220
 20 coins it was quite nice but at 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.530
 far from being so strong now 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.120
 I can make the arena form yes 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.680
 short as an example call so I have 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.889
 Now, last three days, a bit 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.250
 Shaped in the arena I have in the day 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:11.120
 about six seven runs made in 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.579
 arena and have now I believe 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.129
 almost 68 strange coins together what 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.750
 of course a huge difference 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.370
 fit advantage of that is yes 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.760
 not only you can not get it either 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.949
 particle what brings you such a man 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.540
 a passage so if you are not the 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.160
 big gate opens but only the two 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.220
 little you are so average pro 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.829
 Train between 2 to 5 strange coins 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.349
 and the same number of non-particles 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.660
 if you are still open the big tour 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.949
 her about new coins 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.569
 maybe even more times 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.030
 a little less it all depends 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.799
 is a matter of luck 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.690
 As for the conclusions you get 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.040
 of course as I said when the first time 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.260
 have played through the story yours 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.150
 first key and once a week 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.370
 war the two queens foray 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.109
 Also a key if you have more 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.970
 Hahnwald is also recommended here again 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.650
 the 28er arena here you get 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.120
 an average of every second to 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.840
 third only to a key from the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.459
 small boxes dropped yes that should be so 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.650
 have been far on this type 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.730
 and as I said I hope it has you 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.329
 like 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.159
 this little info video if yes me 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.959
 I always look forward to a little tree 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.760
 above and about comments from you and 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.709
 otherwise we'll just see each other in one 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.709
