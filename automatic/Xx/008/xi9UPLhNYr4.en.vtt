stops<00:00:24.200> are<00:00:24.470> on<00:00:24.620> so<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.130> wheels<00:00:25.370> are<00:00:25.550> locked

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
stops are on so the wheels are locked

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.460 
stops are on so the wheels are locked
and<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:26.360> doesn't<00:00:26.630> move<00:00:26.720> away<00:00:27.020> while<00:00:27.260> you're

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
and it doesn't move away while you're

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.490 
and it doesn't move away while you're
doing<00:00:28.160> your<00:00:28.190> muffling<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:29.750> should<00:00:29.990> tilt<00:00:30.260> it

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
doing your muffling you should tilt it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.440 
doing your muffling you should tilt it
at<00:00:30.650> a<00:00:30.740> slight<00:00:31.040> angle<00:00:31.310> so<00:00:31.550> you're<00:00:31.850> able<00:00:32.149> to<00:00:32.180> use

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
at a slight angle so you're able to use

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.989 
at a slight angle so you're able to use
your<00:00:32.660> left<00:00:32.899> hand<00:00:33.280> muffle<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.370> drum<00:00:34.610> while<00:00:34.879> you

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:34.999 
your left hand muffle the drum while you

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:37.450 
your left hand muffle the drum while you
play<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.780> I<00:00:36.260> have<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.469> bench<00:00:36.739> here<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.160> put<00:00:37.339> my

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
play and I have a bench here to put my

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.880 
play and I have a bench here to put my
foot<00:00:37.760> on<00:00:37.789> when<00:00:38.480> I<00:00:38.510> need<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:38.809> use<00:00:38.929> my<00:00:39.079> knee<00:00:39.350> also

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
foot on when I need to use my knee also

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.239 
foot on when I need to use my knee also
to<00:00:40.129> dampen<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.579> drum<00:00:41.469> we<00:00:42.469> use<00:00:42.589> a<00:00:42.620> variety<00:00:42.859> of

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:43.249 
to dampen the drum we use a variety of

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.069 
to dampen the drum we use a variety of
beaters<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.999> get<00:00:44.149> different<00:00:44.390> articulations

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
beaters to get different articulations

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.989 
beaters to get different articulations
and<00:00:45.530> then<00:00:45.829> you<00:00:45.949> can<00:00:46.100> also<00:00:46.309> control<00:00:46.789> the

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:46.999 
and then you can also control the

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:48.910 
and then you can also control the
articulation<00:00:47.690> with<00:00:47.870> your<00:00:48.019> fingers<00:00:48.440> or<00:00:48.739> your

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
articulation with your fingers or your

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.720 
articulation with your fingers or your
hand<00:00:49.249> I<00:00:49.600> have<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.629> pair<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.460> medium<00:00:52.460> hard

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
hand I have a pair of medium hard

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.969 
hand I have a pair of medium hard
mallets<00:00:53.210> here<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:53.749> they<00:00:54.379> can<00:00:54.530> be<00:00:54.649> used<00:00:54.859> for

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
mallets here and they can be used for

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.340 
mallets here and they can be used for
rolling<00:00:55.550> or<00:00:55.789> a<00:00:55.819> single<00:00:56.300> one<00:00:56.600> can<00:00:56.780> be<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:57.079> rather

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
rolling or a single one can be a rather

rolling or a single one can be a rather
articulate<00:00:58.069> mallet<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:58.699> have<00:00:59.629> a<00:00:59.659> softer<00:01:00.229> mallet

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
articulate mallet I have a softer mallet

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.829 
articulate mallet I have a softer mallet
that<00:01:00.859> is<00:01:01.069> used<00:01:01.370> for<00:01:01.609> longer<00:01:01.879> note<00:01:02.179> values<00:01:02.629> with

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
that is used for longer note values with

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.680 
that is used for longer note values with
less<00:01:03.079> attack<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.889> then<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.640> pair<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.030> ultra

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
less attack and then a pair of ultra

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.510 
less attack and then a pair of ultra
staccato<00:01:06.050> mallets<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.979> I<00:01:07.009> would<00:01:07.280> use<00:01:07.490> for

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
staccato mallets that I would use for

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.789 
staccato mallets that I would use for
very<00:01:08.060> articulate<00:01:08.689> passages<00:01:09.229> which<00:01:09.409> I'll<00:01:09.590> show

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
very articulate passages which I'll show

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.200 
very articulate passages which I'll show
you<00:01:09.829> in<00:01:10.009> a<00:01:10.130> while<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:13.250> main<00:01:13.430> stroke<00:01:13.790> comes

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
you in a while the the main stroke comes

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.539 
you in a while the the main stroke comes
from<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.540> arm<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.259> wrist<00:01:15.409> because<00:01:16.219> it's

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
from the arm and the wrist because it's

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.069 
from the arm and the wrist because it's
a<00:01:16.640> large<00:01:16.880> surface<00:01:17.210> you're<00:01:17.600> going<00:01:17.719> to<00:01:17.780> be<00:01:17.869> using

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
a large surface you're going to be using

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.499 
a large surface you're going to be using
your<00:01:18.350> larger<00:01:18.829> muscle<00:01:19.159> groups<00:01:19.189> for<00:01:20.119> most<00:01:20.390> of

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
your larger muscle groups for most of

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.020 
your larger muscle groups for most of
the<00:01:20.600> sounds<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.280> stroke<00:01:22.520> may<00:01:22.700> look<00:01:22.850> like

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
the sounds so the stroke may look like

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.859 
the sounds so the stroke may look like
this<00:01:23.270> without<00:01:23.539> any<00:01:23.719> muffling<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:29.570> would<00:01:29.719> be

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
this without any muffling that would be

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.200 
this without any muffling that would be
for<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.079> longer<00:01:30.409> note<00:01:30.770> value<00:01:31.250> if<00:01:31.759> I<00:01:31.880> want<00:01:32.090> to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
for a longer note value if I want to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.389 
for a longer note value if I want to
shorten<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.659> note<00:01:32.840> value<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:33.530> may<00:01:34.070> come<00:01:34.369> a

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
shorten the note value I may come a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.039 
shorten the note value I may come a
little<00:01:34.549> bit<00:01:34.759> closer<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.390> drum<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.659> snap

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
little bit closer to the drum and snap

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.170 
little bit closer to the drum and snap
my<00:01:36.109> wrist<00:01:36.469> a<00:01:36.619> little<00:01:36.740> more<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.280> also<00:01:37.700> keep<00:01:38.030> my

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
my wrist a little more and also keep my

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.510 
my wrist a little more and also keep my
fingers<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.840> head

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.780 

for<00:01:43.240> legato<00:01:43.600> playing<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:44.409> would<00:01:45.100> probably<00:01:45.310> also

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
for legato playing I would probably also

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.060 
for legato playing I would probably also
go<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.479> softer<00:01:47.170> mallet<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.630> use<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.649> legato

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
go to a softer mallet and use a legato

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.730 
go to a softer mallet and use a legato
stroke<00:01:52.649> which<00:01:53.649> would<00:01:53.830> have<00:01:53.979> less<00:01:54.280> wrists<00:01:55.740> now

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
stroke which would have less wrists now

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.399 
stroke which would have less wrists now
where<00:01:57.009> should<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.399> hit<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:58.390> driest<00:01:58.899> sound<00:01:59.170> on

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
where should you hit the driest sound on

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.469 
where should you hit the driest sound on
any<00:01:59.649> membrane<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.280> phone<00:02:00.460> or<00:02:00.729> drum<00:02:00.970> will<00:02:01.270> be<00:02:01.390> in

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
any membrane of phone or drum will be in

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.139 
any membrane of phone or drum will be in
the<00:02:01.600> center<00:02:01.990> this<00:02:02.320> is<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.590> nodal<00:02:02.950> point<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.880> if

the center this is the nodal point so if

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.380 
the center this is the nodal point so if
you<00:02:04.270> need<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.539> sharp<00:02:04.899> dry<00:02:05.229> sound<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.939> easiest

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
you need a sharp dry sound it's easiest

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.509 
you need a sharp dry sound it's easiest
to<00:02:07.600> get<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.899> there<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.349> then<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.340> would<00:02:09.489> also

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
to get it there and then you would also

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.300 
to get it there and then you would also
probably<00:02:10.239> use<00:02:10.479> medium<00:02:11.200> hard<00:02:11.440> mallet<00:02:11.890> as<00:02:12.069> well

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
probably use medium hard mallet as well

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.120 
probably use medium hard mallet as well
the<00:02:13.209> general<00:02:13.630> beating<00:02:13.959> spot<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.709> going<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.010> be

halfway between the center and the edge

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.710 
halfway between the center and the edge
where<00:02:17.380> you're<00:02:17.799> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> hear<00:02:18.220> more<00:02:18.580> most<00:02:19.480> of

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
that would be here and then for rolling

hand on the opposite or resonating head
like<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:43.200> make<00:03:44.200> sure<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.530> you're<00:03:44.709> prepared

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
like this make sure that you're prepared

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.440 
like this make sure that you're prepared
to<00:03:45.220> do<00:03:45.340> both<00:03:45.579> of<00:03:45.609> those<00:03:45.880> so<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.269> can

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
to do both of those so you can

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.319 
to do both of those so you can
completely<00:03:46.840> stop<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.380> sound<00:03:47.790> if<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.970> piece<00:03:49.180> of

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
completely stop the sound if a piece of

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.449 
completely stop the sound if a piece of
music<00:03:49.420> calls<00:03:49.930> for<00:03:50.230> very<00:03:50.530> articulate<00:03:51.130> playing

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
music calls for very articulate playing

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.970 
music calls for very articulate playing
throughout<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.180> piece<00:03:52.389> or<00:03:52.690> mo

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
throughout the piece or mo

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.220 
throughout the piece or mo
of<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.190> piece<00:03:53.400> at<00:03:53.580> any<00:03:53.700> rate<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.870> might<00:03:55.080> be<00:03:55.200> a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
of the piece at any rate it might be a

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.140 
of the piece at any rate it might be a
good<00:03:55.319> idea<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.830> tilt<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.280> bass<00:03:56.430> drum<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.970> little

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
good idea to tilt the bass drum a little

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.170 
good idea to tilt the bass drum a little
bit<00:03:57.450> more<00:03:58.080> flat<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:58.799> you're<00:03:59.459> able<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.730> use<00:03:59.849> your

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
bit more flat so you're able to use your

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.449 
bit more flat so you're able to use your
wrists<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.690> this<00:04:00.989> motion<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.860> much<00:04:02.099> easier

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
wrists in this motion it's much easier

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.460 
wrists in this motion it's much easier
to<00:04:02.489> do<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.940> than<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.420> spend<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.930> lot<00:04:04.110> of<00:04:04.260> time

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
to do that than to spend a lot of time

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.559 
to do that than to spend a lot of time
playing<00:04:05.159> articulately<00:04:05.760> like<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.269> on<00:04:06.480> the

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
playing articulately like this on the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.330 
playing articulately like this on the
side<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.319> tend<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.590> get<00:04:07.709> circles<00:04:08.159> with<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
side you tend to get circles with the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.490 
side you tend to get circles with the
angle<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.909> mallets<00:04:09.299> so<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.319> very

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
angle of the mallets so if it's very

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.020 
angle of the mallets so if it's very
articulate<00:04:11.069> I'll<00:04:11.220> do<00:04:11.370> two<00:04:11.549> things

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
articulate I'll do two things

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.550 
articulate I'll do two things
I'll<00:04:12.150> play<00:04:12.360> in<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.629> center<00:04:12.870> which<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
I'll play in the center which is the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.340 
I'll play in the center which is the
driest<00:04:13.830> place<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.670> I'll<00:04:15.209> also<00:04:15.420> use<00:04:15.569> very<00:04:16.019> hard

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
driest place and I'll also use very hard

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.469 
driest place and I'll also use very hard
felt<00:04:16.680> mallets<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.370> use<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.790> little<00:04:18.120> bit<00:04:18.209> more

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
felt mallets and use a little bit more

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.019 
felt mallets and use a little bit more
of<00:04:18.570> my<00:04:18.720> wrist
