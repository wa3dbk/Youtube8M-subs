hello there folks user we introduction
and<00:00:05.370> quick<00:00:05.970> unboxing<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.810> my<00:00:07.140> power<00:00:07.500> bank<00:00:07.859> that

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
and quick unboxing of my power bank that

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.940 
and quick unboxing of my power bank that
I<00:00:08.189> recently<00:00:08.400> bought<00:00:08.820> from<00:00:09.030> EB<00:00:09.650> so<00:00:10.650> you'll<00:00:10.800> see

I recently bought from EB so you'll see

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.379 
I recently bought from EB so you'll see
the<00:00:11.040> box<00:00:11.280> there<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.849> says<00:00:12.120> power<00:00:12.450> bank<00:00:14.389> nicely

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the box there it says power bank nicely

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.410 
the box there it says power bank nicely
packaged<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.990> suppose<00:00:16.850> everything<00:00:17.850> written<00:00:18.210> on

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
packaged I suppose everything written on

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.529 
packaged I suppose everything written on
the<00:00:18.539> back<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.140> Chinese<00:00:19.789> so<00:00:20.789> there's<00:00:21.270> some

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the back is in Chinese so there's some

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.740 
the back is in Chinese so there's some
English<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.109> there<00:00:22.460> describes<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:24.180> roughly

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
English on there describes very roughly

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.150 
English on there describes very roughly
how<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:24.960> works<00:00:26.990> not<00:00:27.990> particularly<00:00:28.439> useful<00:00:28.650> at

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
how it works not particularly useful at

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.099 
how it works not particularly useful at
all<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.789> writing<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.420> manual<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
all the writing on the manual and the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.709 
all the writing on the manual and the
documentation<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.730> poor<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.690> we

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
documentation it's very poor so we

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.660 
documentation it's very poor so we
needed<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> work<00:00:34.380> out<00:00:34.649> how<00:00:34.920> they<00:00:35.399> actually

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
needed to work out how they actually

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.030 
needed to work out how they actually
operated<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.660> opening<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> device<00:00:40.620> we'll

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
operated so on opening the device we'll

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.260 
operated so on opening the device we'll
see<00:00:41.489> there's<00:00:42.059> our<00:00:42.300> plastic<00:00:42.809> insert<00:00:43.200> tree<00:00:44.270> the

the other so talking of adapters here's

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730 
the other so talking of adapters here's
the<00:01:57.180> bag<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.540> adapters<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.050> are<00:01:58.260> eight<00:01:58.530> of

the bag of adapters that are eight of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.060 
the bag of adapters that are eight of
them<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:01.760> these<00:02:02.760> adapters<00:02:03.330> are<00:02:04.010> there's<00:02:05.010> a

them so these adapters are there's a

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.830 
them so these adapters are there's a
variety<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> don't<00:02:05.940> know<00:02:06.090> what<00:02:06.210> all<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> them

variety I don't know what all of them

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.469 
variety I don't know what all of them
are<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.020> believe<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.210> Samsung<00:02:09.210> charger

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
are I believe that the Samsung charger

so<00:05:06.590> at<00:05:06.680> this<00:05:06.770> stage<00:05:07.010> there<00:05:07.430> we<00:05:07.580> go<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:08.030> is

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
so at this stage there we go it is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.140 
so at this stage there we go it is
charging<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:09.530> Nexus<00:05:10.220> 4's<00:05:10.460> got<00:05:10.639> the<00:05:10.760> charging

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
charging the Nexus 4's got the charging

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.610 
charging the Nexus 4's got the charging
indicator<00:05:11.270> it's<00:05:11.960> happy<00:05:13.870> so<00:05:14.870> I'm<00:05:15.200> just<00:05:15.440> going

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
indicator it's happy so I'm just going

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.870 
indicator it's happy so I'm just going
to<00:05:15.680> grab<00:05:15.919> one<00:05:15.950> of<00:05:16.280> my<00:05:16.400> other<00:05:16.700> USB<00:05:17.360> cables<00:05:17.810> and

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
to grab one of my other USB cables and

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.030 
to grab one of my other USB cables and
start<00:05:19.880> trying<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.210> charge<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:20.870> device<00:05:20.900> at<00:05:21.710> the

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
start trying to charge the device at the

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.550 
start trying to charge the device at the
same<00:05:22.070> time<00:05:22.600> so<00:05:23.600> we'll<00:05:23.750> plug<00:05:23.930> that<00:05:24.110> into<00:05:24.320> the

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
same time so we'll plug that into the

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.589 
same time so we'll plug that into the
charger<00:05:25.040> cable

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.919 

the<00:05:29.110> end<00:05:29.379> of<00:05:29.860> that<00:05:30.069> will<00:05:30.369> be<00:05:30.520> plugged<00:05:30.909> into<00:05:31.210> the

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:31.929 
the end of that will be plugged into the

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:37.409 
the end of that will be plugged into the
charging<00:05:32.499> port<00:05:32.979> and<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:35.050> stage<00:05:35.409> it<00:05:36.149> goes<00:05:37.149> back

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
charging port and the stage it goes back

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.159 
charging port and the stage it goes back
into<00:05:37.629> charging<00:05:38.259> mode<00:05:38.709> and<00:05:39.569> the<00:05:40.569> output<00:05:41.050> is

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
into charging mode and the output is

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:41.969 
into charging mode and the output is
switched<00:05:41.469> off

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
switched off

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.489 
switched off
there<00:05:42.339> is<00:05:42.429> no<00:05:42.669> loop<00:05:43.119> from<00:05:43.569> the<00:05:43.719> device<00:05:43.990> when<00:05:44.349> it

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:44.499 
there is no loop from the device when it

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.149 
there is no loop from the device when it
is<00:05:44.589> charging<00:05:45.330> so<00:05:46.330> makes<00:05:47.289> it<00:05:47.589> a<00:05:47.649> little<00:05:47.860> bit

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
is charging so makes it a little bit

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.829 
is charging so makes it a little bit
less<00:05:48.369> friendly<00:05:48.849> for<00:05:49.119> use<00:05:49.360> it<00:05:49.509> would<00:05:49.569> be<00:05:49.659> nice

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839 
less friendly for use it would be nice

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.949 
less friendly for use it would be nice
if<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.110> without<00:05:50.349> boot<00:05:50.649> at<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.979> same<00:05:51.189> time<00:05:51.959> so

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:52.959 
if it without boot at the same time so

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:56.040 
if it without boot at the same time so
when<00:05:53.439> I<00:05:53.469> plug<00:05:53.830> the<00:05:53.949> charger<00:05:54.099> again<00:05:54.869> it<00:05:55.869> goes

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
when I plug the charger again it goes

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.219 
when I plug the charger again it goes
into<00:05:56.409> standby<00:05:56.679> I<00:05:57.449> need<00:05:58.449> to<00:05:58.599> tap<00:05:58.839> the<00:05:59.050> power

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
into standby I need to tap the power

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.079 
into standby I need to tap the power
button<00:05:59.259> again<00:05:59.979> to<00:06:00.249> weak<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.699> Machine<00:06:00.969> up

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:01.089 
button again to weak the Machine up

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:04.019 
button again to weak the Machine up
before<00:06:01.539> charging<00:06:02.050> restarts<00:06:02.680> so<00:06:03.610> that<00:06:03.819> could

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
before charging restarts so that could

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.609 
before charging restarts so that could
be<00:06:04.059> a<00:06:04.180> little<00:06:04.479> frustrating<00:06:05.110> that<00:06:05.139> you<00:06:05.439> can't

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:05.619 
be a little frustrating that you can't

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:09.389 
be a little frustrating that you can't
have<00:06:06.159> the<00:06:06.339> device<00:06:06.610> on<00:06:06.879> charge<00:06:07.599> and<00:06:08.439> have<00:06:09.369> a

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:09.399 
have the device on charge and have a

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:11.339 
have the device on charge and have a
notebook<00:06:09.699> going<00:06:10.240> that<00:06:10.749> would<00:06:10.839> be<00:06:10.930> nice<00:06:11.110> as<00:06:11.319> a

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
notebook going that would be nice as a

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.309 
notebook going that would be nice as a
backup<00:06:11.649> battery<00:06:12.099> rather<00:06:12.610> than<00:06:12.819> anything<00:06:12.999> else

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
backup battery rather than anything else

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.510 
backup battery rather than anything else
but<00:06:14.319> that<00:06:14.379> is<00:06:14.649> not<00:06:14.949> an<00:06:15.129> option<00:06:15.279> so<00:06:17.099> you<00:06:18.099> can<00:06:18.219> see

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
but that is not an option so you can see

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.029 
but that is not an option so you can see
there<00:06:18.699> on<00:06:18.849> the<00:06:18.999> phone<00:06:19.180> there<00:06:19.629> who<00:06:19.899> is<00:06:20.080> showing

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
there on the phone there who is showing

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.759 
there on the phone there who is showing
it<00:06:21.189> is<00:06:21.309> charging<00:06:22.029> and<00:06:22.379> the<00:06:23.379> phone<00:06:23.589> is

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:23.769 
it is charging and the phone is

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:26.129 
it is charging and the phone is
absolutely<00:06:24.399> happy<00:06:24.759> they're<00:06:24.969> just<00:06:25.569> getting

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
absolutely happy they're just getting

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.709 
absolutely happy they're just getting
its<00:06:26.469> power

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:33.259 

so<00:06:31.319> here's<00:06:31.679> a<00:06:31.739> close-up<00:06:32.189> of<00:06:32.489> connectors<00:06:33.059> as<00:06:33.239> a

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:33.269 
so here's a close-up of connectors as a

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:37.159 
so here's a close-up of connectors as a
5<00:06:33.569> volt<00:06:33.989> 2.1<00:06:34.919> and<00:06:35.129> 5<00:06:35.399> volt<00:06:35.639> 1<00:06:35.909> amp<00:06:35.939> oh<00:06:36.269> there's

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
5 volt 2.1 and 5 volt 1 amp oh there's

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.379 
5 volt 2.1 and 5 volt 1 amp oh there's
the<00:06:37.349> LEDs<00:06:37.889> and<00:06:38.249> the<00:06:38.369> power<00:06:38.639> button<00:06:38.999> and<00:06:39.119> a

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
the LEDs and the power button and a

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.529 
the LEDs and the power button and a
camera<00:06:39.809> in<00:06:39.929> the<00:06:40.019> background<00:06:41.209> so<00:06:42.209> there's<00:06:42.419> the

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
camera in the background so there's the

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:43.309 
camera in the background so there's the
power<00:06:42.719> button

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 
power button

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.679 
power button
there's<00:06:43.799> the<00:06:43.949> charging<00:06:44.429> inputs<00:06:44.939> that's<00:06:45.269> DC

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:45.689 
there's the charging inputs that's DC

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:49.669 
there's the charging inputs that's DC
and<00:06:45.899> um<00:06:46.529> I<00:06:47.719> don't<00:06:48.719> know<00:06:48.959> what<00:06:49.079> the<00:06:49.169> charge<00:06:49.409> card

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:49.679 
and um I don't know what the charge card

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:51.199 
and um I don't know what the charge card
is<00:06:49.829> probably<00:06:50.189> 1<00:06:50.369> amp<00:06:50.579> or<00:06:50.699> something<00:06:51.029> would<00:06:51.119> be

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:51.209 
is probably 1 amp or something would be

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:53.539 
is probably 1 amp or something would be
reasonable<00:06:51.719> so<00:06:52.199> there's<00:06:52.379> the<00:06:52.589> description<00:06:52.889> 50

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:53.549 
reasonable so there's the description 50

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:57.289 
reasonable so there's the description 50
thousand<00:06:54.149> milliamp<00:06:54.539> 5<00:06:54.989> or<00:06:55.169> 1<00:06:55.439> ampere<00:06:55.969> in<00:06:56.969> this

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:00.269 
guest that is and the one under 2 amp

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:03.049 
guest that is and the one under 2 amp
output<00:07:00.979> close<00:07:01.979> up<00:07:02.159> of<00:07:02.279> all<00:07:02.459> the<00:07:02.669> connectors

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:03.059 
output close up of all the connectors

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:06.549 
output close up of all the connectors
there's<00:07:03.360> obviously<00:07:03.809> the<00:07:03.959> USB<00:07:04.499> connector

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:06.559 
there's obviously the USB connector

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.229 
there's obviously the USB connector
standard<00:07:07.559> USB<00:07:07.800> there's<00:07:08.219> the<00:07:08.369> adapter<00:07:08.939> the

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:09.239 
standard USB there's the adapter the

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:13.639 
standard USB there's the adapter the
micro<00:07:09.599> USB<00:07:09.629> plugged<00:07:10.499> in<00:07:10.709> and<00:07:12.259> that's<00:07:13.259> into<00:07:13.619> the

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:13.649 
micro USB plugged in and that's into the

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:15.649 
micro USB plugged in and that's into the
little<00:07:13.979> extension<00:07:14.489> leak<00:07:14.669> so<00:07:14.909> obviously<00:07:15.479> when

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:15.659 
little extension leak so obviously when

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:17.209 
little extension leak so obviously when
you<00:07:15.749> unplug<00:07:16.050> that<00:07:16.349> you<00:07:16.559> end<00:07:16.709> up<00:07:16.860> with<00:07:17.009> that

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:17.219 
you unplug that you end up with that

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:21.529 
you unplug that you end up with that
meal<00:07:17.519> connector<00:07:18.029> there<00:07:18.829> which<00:07:19.829> you<00:07:20.459> then<00:07:21.149> use

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 
meal connector there which you then use
