00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.469
 expensive special warrants put and 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.360
 today for this new youtube news 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.160
 I will tell you about monetization 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.200
 video games on youtube 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.570
 so since the new policy 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.130
 youtube many of you are asking 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.079
 questions about monetization 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.000
 on youtube video games and 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.340
 unfortunately a lot of clichÃ©s 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.079
 circulate on the internet 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.149
 first of all I want to clarify 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.950
 that it is strongly advised 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.230
 to belong to a network in English 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.990
 network to avoid getting banned at 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.920
 dance life and so monetization on 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.240
 youtube and other services next 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.610
 however you will see that it is possible 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.170
 to post videos of video games and 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.540
 to monetize them without necessarily doing 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.730
 part of a network and therefore avoid 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.590
 intermediaries for inevitably you have 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.870
 asked two questions the first being 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.950
 do I have the right to monetize 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.770
 any video 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.439
 of course not either it is necessary that the game 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.899
 either open source or the publisher 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.810
 give their agreement on the rights to 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.270
 video commercialization of this game to 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.880
 know a proof that would prove to 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.999
 youtube you have the right to monetize 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.280
 the content of third parties and to such 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.659
 questions it's but she's hiding her 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.819
 publisher who give their agreement 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.189
 and know that she is a certain 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.420
 number and for that and invite you to read 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.729
 in the description of the video 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.189
 and precisely the different links that 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.100
 I suggested who tell you and who 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.259
 you live rightly use the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.240
 different justifications compared to 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.149
 such publisher 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.719
 attention attention and third time 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.179
 be careful that some 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.450
 publishers are born from his nas is not 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.490
 everything and yes fm publishers who are 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.770
 okay to introduce you and that you 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.529
 but monetize their gameplay of the game 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.499
 however he refuses category 

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:05.990
 categorically that you present the 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:08.300
 cinematics are to say that you -6 and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.150
 cinematics or that you monetize 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.319
 the fana I see you even present 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.140
 the end of the games 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.819
 that and some and some editors who 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.989
 refuse this categorically 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.510
 so you have to read precisely what 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.099
 which is allowed and not allowed because 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.689
 this is quite laborious and src ambiguous 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:35.000
 so you have to know that when you 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:37.299
 when you have a strike on the part 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.769
 of youtube compared to a container 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.590
 look for it in the links 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:46.159
 that it is proposing the list which 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.980
 editors and be careful to read well what 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.980
 is indicated in the ski is allowed read 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.419
 well because as I will clarify 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.760
 that all publishers do not accept 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:58.250
 that you can use all of 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.430
 their contents are very careful 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.650
 so that's it so I hope it's okay 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.560
 help you feel more 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.760
 comfortable to present video games and 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.939
 so monetize them 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.519
 1 do not hesitate to comment to like and 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.439
 of course to share this video has for 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.989
 maximum number of people can 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.759
 know more for my part I notice 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.720
 of course years and I wish you a 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.639
 excellent day

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.769
