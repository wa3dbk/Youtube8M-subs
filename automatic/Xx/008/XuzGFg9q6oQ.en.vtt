laminated activity cards and this is
something<00:00:13.110> you're<00:00:13.230> going<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.469> have<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.740> setup

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
something you're going to have to setup

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.860 
something you're going to have to setup
pry<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.670> will<00:00:14.790> take<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> bit<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.330> organizing

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
pry so it will take a bit of organizing

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.500 
pry so it will take a bit of organizing
now<00:00:16.619> as<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:16.980> can<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.130> what<00:00:18.000> you'll<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
now as you can see what you'll have is

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.970 
now as you can see what you'll have is
applying<00:00:18.810> few<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> ballpark<00:00:19.529> figure

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
applying few of the ballpark figure

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.650 
applying few of the ballpark figure
around<00:00:20.039> about<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.400> basketball<00:00:20.880> court<00:00:21.060> size<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
around about a basketball court size and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.150 
around about a basketball court size and
you<00:00:21.869> will<00:00:21.990> place<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.560> cones<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.010> you'll

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
you will place the cones and you'll

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.890 
you will place the cones and you'll
scatter<00:00:23.490> them<00:00:23.699> amongst<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.390> court<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
scatter them amongst that court and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.170 
scatter them amongst that court and
you'll<00:00:25.830> need<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.220> obviously<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.699> time<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
you'll need to obviously have time to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.609 
you'll need to obviously have time to
set<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.660> prior<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> students

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
set this up prior to the students

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.960 
set this up prior to the students
getting<00:00:28.920> there<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.400> you'll<00:00:29.699> need<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
getting there because you'll need to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.310 
getting there because you'll need to
have<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.179> set<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:30.689> can't<00:00:30.929> see<00:00:31.170> where

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
have them set up so they can't see where

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.749 
have them set up so they can't see where
the<00:00:31.439> activity<00:00:31.830> cards<00:00:31.980> are<00:00:32.189> placed<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.610> where

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the activity cards are placed and where

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150 
the activity cards are placed and where
they're<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.860> way<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
they're not and so on now the way the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.380 
they're not and so on now the way the
game<00:00:35.280> works<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.700> divide<00:00:36.000> your<00:00:36.180> class

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
game works you will divide your class

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.840 
game works you will divide your class
into<00:00:36.870> four<00:00:37.590> even<00:00:38.010> teams<00:00:38.250> tends<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> work

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
into four even teams tends to work

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.340 
into four even teams tends to work
pretty<00:00:38.910> well<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.570> you'll<00:00:39.750> place<00:00:40.050> them

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
pretty well and you'll place them

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
pretty well and you'll place them
generally<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.550> side<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
generally down one side of the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
generally down one side of the
basketball<00:00:42.420> court<00:00:42.719> tends<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.140> work<00:00:43.260> best<00:00:43.559> now

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
basketball court tends to work best now

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560 
basketball court tends to work best now
the<00:00:43.860> way<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> game<00:00:44.399> works<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> aim<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the way the game works is or the aim of

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.040 
the way the game works is or the aim of
the<00:00:45.629> game<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.500> basically<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.670> most

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
the game is to basically have the most

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.690 
the game is to basically have the most
activity<00:00:49.050> cards<00:00:49.289> by<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> completion<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> the

picks<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.560> another<00:01:22.830> cone<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
picks up another cone now as you see the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.520 
picks up another cone now as you see the
player<00:01:24.420> actually<00:01:24.570> placed<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> cone<00:01:25.320> back

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
player actually placed the cone back

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.859 
player actually placed the cone back
down<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.580> won't<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.150> exactly<00:01:27.659> which

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
down so you won't know exactly which

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.999 
down so you won't know exactly which
cones<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.290> already<00:01:28.530> been<00:01:28.650> looked<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
cones have already been looked at in

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.859 
cones have already been looked at in
which<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.180> comes<00:01:30.329> down<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.720> bit<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
which one so it comes down to a bit of

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.569 
which one so it comes down to a bit of
communication<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.799> bit<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.979> cooperation<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
communication in bit of cooperation the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.429 
communication in bit of cooperation the
students<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> work<00:01:33.390> together<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.200> make

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
students have to work together and make

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
students have to work together and make
sure<00:01:34.470> they're<00:01:34.799> taking<00:01:35.189> notice<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.729> what<00:01:35.909> other

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
sure they're taking notice of what other

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.399 
sure they're taking notice of what other
cones<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.479> been<00:01:36.659> collected<00:01:37.140> by<00:01:37.229> other

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
cones have been collected by other

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
cones have been collected by other
players<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:37.950> other<00:01:38.070> teams<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
players at other teams and so on and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.520 
players at other teams and so on and
hopefully<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.960> way<00:01:40.079> they'll<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.320> able<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
hopefully that way they'll be able to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.410 
hopefully that way they'll be able to
pick<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.070> cone<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> target<00:01:42.180> or<00:01:42.329> an

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
pick up a cone with a target or an

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.630 
pick up a cone with a target or an
activity<00:01:42.630> still<00:01:43.079> underneath<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.680> okay<00:01:44.579> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
activity still underneath there okay so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.920 
activity still underneath there okay so
if<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.000> make<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> mistake<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.750> go<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
if they make the mistake and they go to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.630 
if they make the mistake and they go to
a<00:01:46.020> cone<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.350> sort<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.590> been<00:01:46.680> lifted<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.220> they

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
a cone that sort of been lifted and they

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.920 
a cone that sort of been lifted and they
lift<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.000> again<00:01:48.240> there's<00:01:48.450> nothing<00:01:48.750> under

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
lift it up again there's nothing under

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.389 
lift it up again there's nothing under
there<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.470> would<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.130> set

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
there you would then have this set

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.520 
there you would then have this set
cardio<00:01:50.909> activity<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> might<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.990> okay<00:01:52.290> if

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
cardio activity so it might be okay if

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.690 
cardio activity so it might be okay if
you<00:01:52.680> pick<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> cone<00:01:53.189> there's<00:01:53.430> nothing

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you pick up a cone there's nothing

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.190 
you pick up a cone there's nothing
underneath<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.149> they<00:01:54.390> might<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> rule

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
underneath it they might have the rule

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.420 
underneath it they might have the rule
that<00:01:55.229> they<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.649> run<00:01:55.770> across<00:01:55.890> touch<00:01:56.280> the

level of your students you do want some
where<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.850> might<00:02:26.970> simply<00:02:27.330> be<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.660> one<00:02:27.810> pushup

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
where it might simply be just one pushup

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.690 
where it might simply be just one pushup
so<00:02:28.410> when<00:02:28.530> they<00:02:28.620> pick<00:02:28.800> up<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.100> activity<00:02:29.520> car

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
so when they pick up that activity car

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.100 
so when they pick up that activity car
they<00:02:29.850> go<00:02:29.970> oh<00:02:30.000> great<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:30.600> only<00:02:30.750> one<00:02:30.870> push-up

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
they go oh great it's only one push-up

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.600 
they go oh great it's only one push-up
they<00:02:31.350> get<00:02:31.470> down<00:02:31.620> Thea<00:02:31.830> they<00:02:31.920> push<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.490> they

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
they get down Thea they push up and they

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.550 
they get down Thea they push up and they
can<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:32.880> again<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.810> they've<00:02:33.960> got<00:02:34.110> an<00:02:34.230> activity

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
can go again so they've got an activity

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.190 
can go again so they've got an activity

that<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.320> tended<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.710> do<00:02:37.860> was<00:02:38.010> actually<00:02:38.160> use<00:02:38.460> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
that I tended to do was actually use the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.310 
that I tended to do was actually use the
optional<00:02:39.060> activity<00:02:39.510> cards<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:39.930> these<00:02:40.110> ones

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
optional activity cards like these ones

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.630 
optional activity cards like these ones
so<00:02:40.380> here's<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> couple<00:02:41.040> examples<00:02:41.220> it's

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
so here's just a couple examples it's

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.130 
so here's just a couple examples it's
kind<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:41.850> like<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.120> know<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.330> suppose<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.930> card

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
kind of like you know I suppose the card

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.230 
kind of like you know I suppose the card
game<00:02:43.350> where<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.130> actually<00:02:44.250> take<00:02:44.670> from<00:02:44.970> or

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
game where you can actually take from or

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.450 
game where you can actually take from or
penalize<00:02:45.750> your<00:02:45.990> opponent<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.530> one<00:02:47.100> might<00:02:47.280> be

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
penalize your opponent so one might be

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.980 
penalize your opponent so one might be
taking<00:02:47.820> activity<00:02:48.180> card<00:02:48.390> for<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.630> team<00:02:48.840> on

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
taking activity card for the team on

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.420 
taking activity card for the team on
your<00:02:49.110> right<00:02:49.260> they<00:02:49.530> actually<00:02:49.770> go<00:02:49.920> over<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.280> get

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
your right they actually go over you get

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.760 
your right they actually go over you get
to<00:02:50.520> collect<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.030> come<00:02:51.870> back<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.590> don't

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
to collect it come back and you don't

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.200 
to collect it come back and you don't
actually<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.610> any<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.850> cardio

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
actually have to do any the cardio

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.610 
actually have to do any the cardio
activity<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.870> might<00:02:55.110> be<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> other<00:02:55.440> way

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
activity that might be the other way

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.170 
activity that might be the other way
where<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.890> pick<00:02:56.070> up<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.250> bad<00:02:56.430> card<00:02:56.760> we<00:02:56.940> have<00:02:57.090> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
where you pick up a bad card we have to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.550 
where you pick up a bad card we have to
actually<00:02:57.390> go<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.630> give<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.230> team<00:02:58.410> on

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
actually go and give it to the team on

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.350 
actually go and give it to the team on
your<00:02:58.590> right<00:02:58.800> or<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.550> might<00:02:59.760> have<00:02:59.940> ones<00:03:00.150> away

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
your right or you might have ones away

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.460 
your right or you might have ones away
actually<00:03:00.600> they<00:03:00.900> rock-scissors-paper

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
actually they rock-scissors-paper

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.160 
actually they rock-scissors-paper
against<00:03:02.010> an<00:03:02.130> opposing<00:03:02.400> player<00:03:02.970> if<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.750> win

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
against an opposing player if you win

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.750 
against an opposing player if you win
take<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> card<00:03:04.800> if<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.100> lose<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.490> give<00:03:05.640> them

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
take a card if you lose you give them

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.100 
take a card if you lose you give them
the<00:03:05.820> cut<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:06.570> that's<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:06.840> another

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the cut and so on so that's just another

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.660 
the cut and so on so that's just another
way<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.320> actually<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:08.280> that's<00:03:08.430> just<00:03:08.550> another

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
way to actually so that's just another

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.040 
way to actually so that's just another
way<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> sort<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.240> spice<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.510> game<00:03:09.780> up<00:03:09.930> I

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
way to sort of spice that game up I

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.720 
way to sort of spice that game up I
suppose<00:03:10.200> now<00:03:10.620> one<00:03:10.950> thing<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.250> will<00:03:11.430> have<00:03:11.610> to

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
suppose now one thing you will have to

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.820 
suppose now one thing you will have to
be<00:03:11.820> aware<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.840> do<00:03:12.960> have<00:03:13.170> some<00:03:13.350> students

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
be aware of if you do have some students

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.620 
be aware of if you do have some students
who<00:03:13.950> are<00:03:14.070> quite<00:03:14.310> unfit<00:03:14.700> they're<00:03:15.090> not<00:03:15.270> going<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
who are quite unfit they're not going to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.420 
who are quite unfit they're not going to
enjoy<00:03:15.750> doing<00:03:15.900> something<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.470> this<00:03:16.710> so<00:03:17.400> you

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
enjoy doing something like this so you

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.800 
enjoy doing something like this so you
have<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.670> see<00:03:17.820> if<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.090> actually<00:03:18.390> make<00:03:18.780> it

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
have to see if you can actually make it

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.600 
have to see if you can actually make it
a<00:03:18.959> bit<00:03:19.050> more<00:03:19.110> enjoyable<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:19.860> that's<00:03:20.400> where

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
a bit more enjoyable so that's where

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.430 
a bit more enjoyable so that's where
you'd<00:03:20.730> really<00:03:21.030> encourage<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.959> bit<00:03:22.320> of

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
you'd really encourage a bit of

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.080 
you'd really encourage a bit of
comradery<00:03:22.950> between<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.490> teammates<00:03:23.910> I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
comradery between the teammates I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.550 
comradery between the teammates I
suppose<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.660> might<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.930> able<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.140> say<00:03:25.260> okay

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
suppose so you might be able to say okay

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.290 
suppose so you might be able to say okay
if<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.250> find<00:03:26.430> one<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.730> your<00:03:26.850> teammates<00:03:27.209> is

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
if you find one of your teammates is

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.540 
if you find one of your teammates is
struggling<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:27.780> say<00:03:28.620> Jimmy<00:03:28.950> he<00:03:29.070> can't<00:03:29.310> quite

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
struggling so say Jimmy he can't quite

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.699 
struggling so say Jimmy he can't quite
do<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.820> ten<00:03:30.180> push-ups<00:03:30.420> he<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:31.290> only<00:03:31.410> get<00:03:31.590> to

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
do the ten push-ups he can only get to

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.680 
do the ten push-ups he can only get to
about<00:03:31.890> five<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.910> get<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.180> inside<00:03:33.450> his

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
about five you get the inside his

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.060 
about five you get the inside his
teammates<00:03:34.170> he<00:03:34.320> could<00:03:34.470> say<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.740> stronger

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
teammates he could say that the stronger

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.830 
teammates he could say that the stronger
players<00:03:35.310> okay<00:03:35.580> guys<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.120> all<00:03:36.300> do<00:03:36.450> an<00:03:36.540> extra

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
players okay guys if you all do an extra

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.810 
players okay guys if you all do an extra
push-up<00:03:37.170> each<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.980> means<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.550> you've

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
push-up each that means that you've

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.370 
push-up each that means that you've
still<00:03:39.150> got<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.510> same<00:03:39.690> amount<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.990> push-ups

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
still got the same amount of push-ups

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.720 
still got the same amount of push-ups
and<00:03:40.560> then<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.800> can<00:03:40.950> move<00:03:41.130> on<00:03:41.280> again<00:03:41.400> so
