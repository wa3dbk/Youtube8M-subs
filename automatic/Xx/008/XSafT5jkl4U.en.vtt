00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hence the number 10 where he 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.170
 go what he eats who is the number zero 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.529
 and why it is so important for the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.529
 humanity 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.130
 good greetings from curious are all 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.230
 Welcome to the first video that you 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.960
 of the channel the curious is nephew of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.119
 olive tree the curious pleasure and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.519
 You're curious, too, you leave your 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.619
 joycinha and sign up for the channel that is the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.359
 our program number zero then nothing 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.690
 better than paying homage and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.880
 find out everything about the 010 looks like 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.530
 useless but it does have its importance 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.030
 for mankind and for diabetics 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.770
 also zero sugar understood the fact is that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 10 is present in almost everything that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.110
 there is around us he is present 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.090
 from the simplest counting to the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.129
 programming of computers by the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.140
 simple fact that almost everything 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.379
 around us is based on the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.980
 mathematics and I said that not 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.619
 I know why numbers draws a matrix because it's 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.770
 More or less like this then. 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.869
 considering that almost everything is mathematics 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 good open a parenthesis leave almost 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.880
 everything is math so there are some 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.439
 mathematical 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.350
 The point is that math is one of the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.689
 the greatest inventions of mankind I go 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.430
 open a parenthesis here because you have a 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.009
 people who said that math did not 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 was invented by the head of humans 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.810
 she was discovered and if you want 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.150
 get into this controversy in this discussion 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.369
 to know if mathematics was invented 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.170
 or discovery make your comment here 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.409
 underneath defense of his thesis 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 Ok I'll close the relatives I closed being 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.630
 invention or discovery is the fact that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.979
 numbers are very important for us. 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.920
 human beings 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.909
 and who is pulling this train io zero 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.340
 exactly 10 coming from Italian 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.030
 set or something like that because I 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.310
 I do not know Palau Italian Isaf Uterus 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.229
 Arab origin meaning nothing empty 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.860
 analogy color arabia lived a number 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.770
 very important called 0 all 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.380
 liked him he recognized the value 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.080
 the other numbers teaching pampering and 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.930
 constantly called him 100 00 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.390
 come to me if you put the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.650
 My right, I get bigger and more 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.340
 powerful 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.010
 sometimes the 2 who was very envious resolved 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.180
 send you an anonymous letter with the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.610
 goal of shame in this letter the 2 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.350
 I called them a bad friend and told me that 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.019
 a leading zero 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.000
 nothing was worth I think that was when it came 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.220
 the zero left bid that all 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.380
 the world listens to the discussions 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.090
 sad story 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.250
 taking this story I have not even finished 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.290
 read that is a bit sad or zero I 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.220
 I think it's important to note that in the beginning 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:04.140
 from the beginning 10 it only existed that the galley 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:08.250
 I did not know it was still a little empty. 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.850
 still no identity without cpf without it was 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.519
 a zero to the left in fact but then came 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.170
 the Indians and changed the history of everything 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.510
 I got carried away 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.870
 they invented a symbol from scratch and a 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.530
 system based on the 10 Indians they 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.190
 created system there around the years 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.250
 200 to 1 since you think you have a 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.010
 The idea that 10 is so renegade he does not 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.769
 existed in Europe until the 13th century 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.790
 I'm crying because 13 is the number 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.769
 pt 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.590
 no, let's not talk about politics that one 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.410
 channel I think because until the 13th century the 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.010
 europe does not exist yet 10 more use the 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.980
 law will take this system that was well 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.140
 better than the pomegranate system that was 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.440
 used in Europe at the time and that is why 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.820
 that the figures are called going to the 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.090
 the beak 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.400
 look look there 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.849
 not learning things here on the channel 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.879
 curious people and with the entry from scratch in 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.360
 market allowed icca galera to use the 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:19.100
 cyclically numbers without allowing 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.470
 an ambiguity there without getting boring thing 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.919
 for you to have a sense of how much you want 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.750
 to figure out to calculate old 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.449
 show you this number is 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.460
 appearing here that number here you 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.500
 can write that number here with 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.050
 right facility now experiences 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.169
 write here in Roman numerals there 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:45.160
 long time 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:47.870
 and it 's complicated, right? 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.540
 after seeing with a galley formerly 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.910
 I figured it was complicated for bed in 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.350
 Roman numerals go back to read the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.020
 history there for you do these 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.889
 elements have a happy ending, because the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.710
 poor to hear these insults cried 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.200
 bitterly and resolved to disappear from the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.470
 country of numbers and so this is what 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.380
 happened the cars that were supposed to 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.650
 70 kilometers per hour spent walking the 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.950
 7 the banks where large 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.780
 fortunes began to have poor and 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.110
 small numbers 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.610
 Okay, great misery, the owners of the 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.349
 fat bank accounts and hidden o2 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.020
 ashamed or out of your corner all 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.539
 the complaints but never say a 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.870
 The word was so noble 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:42.020
 It was then that the 9 and if it was then that the 9 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.349
 realized the importance of zero and climbed 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.840
 steep hills of its sloping valleys 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:51.050
 thinking that it was the last of the series 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.050
 should solve this problem found 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.169
 10 in a forgotten hole covered with 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.900
 tears forgive and my friend to whom the 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.330
 insulted shows that his goodness is 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.849
 equal to its great value and comes from 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.820
 new to our country 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:10.340
 the zero regression looks good and by the 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.219
 big party that made him realize 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:17.450
 which had made it ill to listen to the two 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.680
 after all, many loved him and 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.390
 your importance 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.390
 Look how beautiful. 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.760
 did not see numerically zero 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.770
 represents nothing empty but almost everything that 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.719
 is around us only works for 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.940
 cause a little then this is our way 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:41.090
 to present the curiosities of the world 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.940
 Good for you, if you 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.640
 liked this video of this format click 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.480
 here downstairs I liked your jewelry is 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.430
 share with your friends too 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.780
 It's very important to share 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.190
 people who still do not know the importance 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.660
 from scratch 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.490
 It's worth the hint of sharing that 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.950
 person who says you're a zero to 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.870
 and add this video to your 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.700
 favorites that will help a lot too 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.230
 a channel so this is very curious 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.330
 Thank you so much for watching us until 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.330
 here and until the next video bye
