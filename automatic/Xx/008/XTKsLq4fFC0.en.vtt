Reina wanted to go he's the perfect

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.599 
Reina wanted to go he's the perfect
replacement<00:00:59.609> to<00:01:00.149> replace<00:01:00.449> him<00:01:01.250> right<00:01:02.250> back<00:01:02.430> we

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
replacement to replace him right back we

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.130 
replacement to replace him right back we
have<00:01:02.789> Glen<00:01:03.059> Johnson<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:04.199> Glen<00:01:04.409> Johnson<00:01:04.559> oh

have Glen Johnson now Glen Johnson oh

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
have Glen Johnson now Glen Johnson oh
I'd<00:01:07.140> say<00:01:07.200> most<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> time<00:01:08.220> he's<00:01:08.580> solid<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
I'd say most of the time he's solid the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.179 
I'd say most of the time he's solid the
only<00:01:09.600> thing<00:01:09.720> when<00:01:09.990> Johnson<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.590> defending

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
only thing when Johnson is is defending

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.910 
only thing when Johnson is is defending
his<00:01:11.340> tracking<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> greatest<00:01:13.409> I

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
his tracking back is not the greatest I

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.850 
his tracking back is not the greatest I
think<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.810> thing<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.110> we've<00:01:16.439> got<00:01:16.590> Martin

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
think we the thing is we've got Martin

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.600 
think we the thing is we've got Martin
Kelly<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.060> bench<00:01:18.799> ready<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.009> step<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
Kelly on the bench ready to step in and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
Kelly on the bench ready to step in and
I<00:01:21.450> think<00:01:21.720> Martin<00:01:21.930> Kelly's<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> perfect

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
I think Martin Kelly's a perfect

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.810 
I think Martin Kelly's a perfect
replacement<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.430> he's<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.790> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
replacement I think he's more of a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.480 
replacement I think he's more of a
centre<00:01:24.060> back<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:24.330> were<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.540> back

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
centre back when they were right back

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.770 
centre back when they were right back
but<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.850> he's<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> step<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.630> right

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
but I think he's going to step in right

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.170 
but I think he's going to step in right
back<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.110> Johnson<00:01:28.560> two<00:01:29.490> centre-backs<00:01:29.820> I've

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
