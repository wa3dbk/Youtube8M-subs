you're just going to do this with the
entire<00:01:59.790> fabric<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.770> Here<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.280> am<00:02:02.370> doing<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
entire fabric and Here I am doing the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.440 
entire fabric and Here I am doing the
kind<00:02:04.650> of<00:02:04.740> towards<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.250> crotch<00:02:05.550> area<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:06.180> then

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
kind of towards the crotch area and then

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.219 
kind of towards the crotch area and then
cutting<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.760> folding<00:02:08.760> it<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.119> order<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.750> go

cutting it folding it in order to go

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.390 
cutting it folding it in order to go
with<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.890> curve<00:02:11.190> again<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.920> think<00:02:17.010> I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
with the curve again but I think I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.670 
with the curve again but I think I
should<00:02:17.580> mention<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:19.470> get
