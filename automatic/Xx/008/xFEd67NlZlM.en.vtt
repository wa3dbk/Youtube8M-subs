out of Boulder County this morning a

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.679 
out of Boulder County this morning a
very<00:00:01.709> strange<00:00:02.190> sighting<00:00:02.939> in<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.090> sky<00:00:03.419> has

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
very strange sighting in the sky has

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.200 
very strange sighting in the sky has
many<00:00:03.990> people<00:00:04.440> talking<00:00:04.890> some<00:00:05.490> residents<00:00:05.670> even

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
many people talking some residents even

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.830 
many people talking some residents even
caught<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.930> lights<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.379> camera<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.360> aliens<00:00:09.360> or

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
caught the lights on camera so aliens or

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.600 
caught the lights on camera so aliens or
some<00:00:10.050> kind<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.380> flame<00:00:10.650> formation<00:00:11.400> there's

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
some kind of flame formation there's

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.610 
some kind of flame formation there's
always<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.389> theories<00:00:12.870> shot<00:00:13.200> you've<00:00:13.380> always

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
always the theories shot you've always

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.919 
always the theories shot you've always
done<00:00:13.799> these<00:00:13.980> theories<00:00:14.340> but<00:00:15.210> something<00:00:15.839> you

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
done these theories but something you

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.019 
done these theories but something you
don't<00:00:16.080> really<00:00:16.289> see<00:00:16.770> every<00:00:17.100> day<00:00:17.279> right<00:00:17.640> yeah

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
don't really see every day right yeah

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.849 
don't really see every day right yeah
but<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.300> wonder<00:00:18.539> are<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:18.900> alone<00:00:19.140> what<00:00:19.800> do

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
but we wonder are we here alone what do

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.700 
but we wonder are we here alone what do
you<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.510> don't<00:00:21.510> think<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.320> don't

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
you think I don't think we are I don't

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.900 
you think I don't think we are I don't
think<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.100> don't<00:00:23.310> think<00:00:23.519> these<00:00:23.640> are<00:00:23.760> you

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
think that I don't think these are you

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.240 
think that I don't think these are you
have<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> big<00:00:24.449> huge<00:00:24.660> universe<00:00:24.960> well<00:00:25.710> hey<00:00:26.189> you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
have a big huge universe well hey you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.650 
have a big huge universe well hey you
got<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.000> yourself<00:00:27.420> these

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660

got to see it for yourself these
residents<00:00:28.199> saw<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.619> lights<00:00:28.890> hovering<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
residents saw the lights hovering in the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
old Nick Vander vet saw the lights on

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.310 
old Nick Vander vet saw the lights on
his<00:00:35.430> way<00:00:35.579> home<00:00:35.820> from<00:00:36.000> work<00:00:36.090> called<00:00:36.809> his<00:00:37.050> dad

his way home from work called his dad

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.040 
his way home from work called his dad
Leroy<00:00:37.980> dad<00:00:38.489> ran<00:00:38.790> out<00:00:39.000> shot<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.510> pictures

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
Leroy dad ran out shot these pictures

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.020 
Leroy dad ran out shot these pictures
and<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.430> guys<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and this is what they got guys and you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.119 
and this is what they got guys and you
see<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> big<00:00:42.540> three<00:00:42.809> lights<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.980> they

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
see the big three lights out there they

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.010 
see the big three lights out there they
weren't<00:00:44.160> blinking<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.360> say<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.660> made<00:00:45.840> no

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
weren't blinking they say they made no

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.959 
weren't blinking they say they made no
sound<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:46.980> were<00:00:47.070> moving<00:00:47.250> southwest<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
sound but they were moving southwest to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.600 
sound but they were moving southwest to
Southeast<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:49.050> shape<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.710> triangle

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
Southeast the shape of the triangle

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.360 
Southeast the shape of the triangle
seemed<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.600> change<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.770> thing<00:00:53.039> moved

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
seemed to change as this thing moved

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.540 
seemed to change as this thing moved
then<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.390> moved<00:00:54.570> northeast<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:56.070> light<00:00:56.280> went

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
then it moved northeast one light went

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
then it moved northeast one light went
out<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.210> remaining<00:00:57.510> two<00:00:57.899> lights<00:00:58.170> disappeared

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
out the remaining two lights disappeared

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.770 
out the remaining two lights disappeared
and<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.340> bad<00:00:59.520> interesting<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.629> it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and that was bad interesting you know it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.150 
and that was bad interesting you know it
can<00:01:00.960> had<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> theory<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.649> earlier<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.039> think

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
can had a theory on this earlier I think

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.860 
can had a theory on this earlier I think
he<00:01:02.460> might<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.670> right<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.449> was<00:01:03.570> saying<00:01:03.780> he

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
he might be right I'm he was saying he

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.420 
he might be right I'm he was saying he
thinks<00:01:04.019> they<00:01:04.589> were<00:01:04.650> probably<00:01:04.920> stealth

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
thinks they were probably stealth

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.250 
thinks they were probably stealth
bombers<00:01:05.880> right<00:01:06.420> again<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.170> you're

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
bombers right again is that what you're

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.630 
bombers right again is that what you're
saying<00:01:07.290> start<00:01:07.680> honestly<00:01:07.890> now<00:01:08.460> you're

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
saying start honestly now you're

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760 
saying start honestly now you're
dragging<00:01:08.790> me<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.600> well<00:01:09.990> well<00:01:10.409> because

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
dragging me in here well well because

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
dragging me in here well well because
it's<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.189> triangular<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.270> shape<00:01:12.299> because<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it's just triangular in shape because of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.570 
it's just triangular in shape because of
the<00:01:12.990> triangle<00:01:13.409> shape<00:01:13.650> which<00:01:13.920> makes<00:01:14.130> sense<00:01:14.340> i

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the triangle shape which makes sense i

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.039 
the triangle shape which makes sense i
mean<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.909> theory<00:01:15.180> look<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:16.020> all

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
mean it's a theory look we're all

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.510 
mean it's a theory look we're all
guessing<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.710> thing<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.369> don't

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
guessing at this thing you know I don't

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.120 
guessing at this thing you know I don't
know<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.080> gosh<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.740> don't<00:01:19.830> know

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
know I gosh you know you just don't know

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160 
know I gosh you know you just don't know
the<00:01:20.549> way<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.820> flew<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> formation

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the way it flew you know the formation

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.660 
the way it flew you know the formation
would<00:01:22.320> make<00:01:22.470> sense<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:23.130> were<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.640> know

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
would make sense if they were you know

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.899 
would make sense if they were you know
trained<00:01:24.030> pilots<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.810> fly<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.909> however

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
trained pilots can fly like that however

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.609 
trained pilots can fly like that however
you<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.810> don't<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.290> their<00:01:28.409> stealth

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you just I don't know if their stealth

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.929 
you just I don't know if their stealth
bombers<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.640> him<00:01:29.729> why<00:01:29.909> would

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
bombers why can you see him why would

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
bombers why can you see him why would
there<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.270> light<00:01:30.540> skin<00:01:30.810> yeah<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.530> stealthy

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
there be light skin yeah not so stealthy

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
there be light skin yeah not so stealthy
a<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.369> stealth<00:01:32.670> ish<00:01:32.880> well<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.570> still<00:01:33.750> have

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
a very stealth ish well they still have
