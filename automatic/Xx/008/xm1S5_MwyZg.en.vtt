00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.509
 well I'm going to present one of the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.360
 first fans that I made it seems to me that 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:26.090
 I did this when I was around two or 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.520
 three months doing bobbin lace and 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.710
 good as you can see the drawing is not no 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.050
 It is very complicated although it has many 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.239
 combinations of points for example 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.820
 we have the spiders we have the point of 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.089
 Slavic diamond point the point of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.040
 the virgin point torque also 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.530
 we found the watermark and the point 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.839
 whole and as you can see in the part 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.760
 inferior that now then we will approach a 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.440
 little to the camera has pictures of 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.930
 half point interspersed with dot 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.180
 whole and a succession of crosses 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.180
 braids that really seem to me 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.129
 very elegant, good all those that I 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.920
 you know you know too much that I 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.110
 love the lace fans of 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.650
 bolillo think in total I done 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.360
 about 10 or 12 fans and well this 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.580
 I have a special affection because it was the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.260
 first thing I did in black thread is 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.650
 made in cotton 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.260
 and nothing like it was for my mother I bought her 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.800
 some ebony rods that as you can 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:30.010
 see they are very worked and very carved 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.010
 and nothing is a fan with is great 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.549
 and nothing very happy with the result 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.280
 I will always have that for him, dear 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.520
 special to start a big fan 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.950
 and then I've done well over this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 size I even have a pericon fan 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.740
 but then I will show you and I do not expect anything 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.740
 you like it and a kiss for all 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.670
 yes 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.670
 to
