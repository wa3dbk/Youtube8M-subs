00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
then if you can read this but it says

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
then if you can read this but it says

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the palm of your hands introducing the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.069 
the palm of your hands introducing the
super<00:00:31.140> UFO<00:00:31.560> pro<00:00:31.890> 8<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.329> unique<00:00:33.719> device

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
super UFO pro 8 with this unique device

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.319 
super UFO pro 8 with this unique device
you<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:34.620> able<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.100> save<00:00:35.430> your<00:00:35.670> snares<00:00:36.090> or

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
you are now able to save your snares or

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.830 
you are now able to save your snares or
16-bit<00:00:37.290> games<00:00:37.940> don't<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.270> know<00:00:39.420> what<00:00:39.660> that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
16-bit games don't really know what that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.280 
16-bit games don't really know what that
means<00:00:40.110> since<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.980> only<00:00:41.100> works<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> snares

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
means since it only works on the snares

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.299 
means since it only works on the snares
when<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.410> feel<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:43.860> taking<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.430> break<00:00:44.670> now

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
when you feel like taking a break now

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.740 
when you feel like taking a break now
supposedly<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.700> does<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.180> let<00:00:48.420> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
supposedly what this does is let you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.729 
supposedly what this does is let you
save<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.980> contents<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.520> memory<00:00:51.410> during<00:00:52.410> play

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
save the contents of memory during play

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.430 
save the contents of memory during play
so<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.420> old<00:00:54.570> school<00:00:54.840> games<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.320> there

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
so on the old school games if there

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.959 
so on the old school games if there
isn't<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> save<00:00:55.890> point<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.460> another<00:00:56.670> three

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
isn't a save point for another three

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.740 
isn't a save point for another three
hours<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.870> hit<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> button<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.750> save

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
hours you can just hit a button and save

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.460 
hours you can just hit a button and save
where<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.809> used<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.229> couch

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
where you are so I used to have a couch

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.870 
where you are so I used to have a couch
that<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> old<00:01:05.880> c64<00:01:06.659> so

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
that could do this on the old c64 so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880 
that could do this on the old c64 so
it's<00:01:08.880> possible<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.900> does<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> work

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it's possible and what does it work

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.580 
it's possible and what does it work
anyway<00:01:11.490> let's<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.330> guy<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> box

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:28.110 

so<00:01:16.590> look<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:24.200> see<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.530> get

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.890 

looks<00:01:29.120> like<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.360> USB<00:01:30.350> transfer<00:01:31.150> cable<00:01:34.600> that's<00:01:35.600> a

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
looks like a USB transfer cable that's a

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.340 
looks like a USB transfer cable that's a
microsd<00:01:36.620> adapter<00:01:37.840> sure<00:01:38.840> why<00:01:39.140> they've

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
microsd adapter sure why they've

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.110 
microsd adapter sure why they've
included<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:40.160> I<00:01:42.580> suppose<00:01:43.580> it's<00:01:43.760> a<00:01:43.880> nice

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
included that I suppose it's a nice

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.270 
included that I suppose it's a nice
freebie<00:01:45.700> look<00:01:46.700> at<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.030> cartridge<00:01:47.900> itself<00:01:48.760> and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
freebie look at the cartridge itself and

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.370 
freebie look at the cartridge itself and
see<00:01:52.280> there<00:01:52.520> there's<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.880> slot<00:01:53.479> for<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.780> standard

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
see there there's a slot for a standard

save games with that or if say you've

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.060 
save games with that or if say you've
got<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> super<00:02:02.270> FX<00:02:02.540> game<00:02:02.869> like<00:02:03.140> star<00:02:03.770> weighing

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
got a super FX game like star weighing

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.969 
got a super FX game like star weighing
starfox<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:05.780> put<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.290> on<00:02:06.380> there<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.920> then

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
starfox you put that on there and then

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.940 
starfox you put that on there and then
you<00:02:07.790> can<00:02:08.030> run<00:02:08.239> other<00:02:08.540> super<00:02:08.929> FX<00:02:09.200> games<00:02:09.560> from

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
you can run other super FX games from

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.410 
you can run other super FX games from
the<00:02:10.220> memory<00:02:10.700> card<00:02:10.910> slots<00:02:13.060> that's<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.209> theory

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
the memory card slots that's the theory

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:23.290 
the memory card slots that's the theory
anyway<00:02:14.570> that's<00:02:14.989> pretty<00:02:15.200> cool<00:02:19.870> software<00:02:22.300> and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
anyway that's pretty cool software and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.530 
anyway that's pretty cool software and
user<00:02:23.900> guide<00:02:24.550> which<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.910> guess<00:02:26.209> I'll<00:02:26.360> have<00:02:26.510> to

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
user guide which I guess I'll have to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.510 
user guide which I guess I'll have to
read<00:02:26.840> now<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:29.530> i'll<00:02:30.530> go<00:02:30.680> away<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.010> do<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.340> and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
read now so i'll go away and do that and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.890 
read now so i'll go away and do that and
figure<00:02:31.880> out<00:02:32.000> how<00:02:32.090> everything<00:02:32.630> works<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:35.450> then

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
figure out how everything works and then

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.960 
figure out how everything works and then
get<00:02:36.620> back<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.040> in<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.190> next<00:02:37.430> part<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.850> the

get back to you in the next part of the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.100 
get back to you in the next part of the
video<00:02:38.320> ok<00:02:39.320> then<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:39.890> I've<00:02:40.459> got<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.760> super<00:02:41.630> UFO
