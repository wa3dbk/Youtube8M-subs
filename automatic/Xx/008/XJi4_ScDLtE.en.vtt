surface on bed feature provides a quick
way<00:00:15.250> to<00:00:15.279> properly<00:00:15.910> orient<00:00:16.449> your<00:00:16.570> model<00:00:16.840> for

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
way to properly orient your model for

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.439 
way to properly orient your model for
printing<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:18.369> is<00:00:18.550> really<00:00:18.850> useful<00:00:19.240> when<00:00:19.270> you

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
printing this is really useful when you

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.939 
printing this is really useful when you
import<00:00:19.750> a<00:00:19.869> model<00:00:20.140> that<00:00:20.170> may<00:00:20.410> be<00:00:20.470> in<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.740> wrong

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
import a model that may be in the wrong

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.849 
import a model that may be in the wrong
orientation<00:00:21.929> for<00:00:22.929> example<00:00:23.380> you<00:00:23.710> probably

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
orientation for example you probably

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.800 
orientation for example you probably
want<00:00:24.249> a<00:00:24.310> flat<00:00:24.640> surface<00:00:24.939> to<00:00:25.300> be<00:00:25.390> touching<00:00:25.599> the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
want a flat surface to be touching the

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.589 
want a flat surface to be touching the
build<00:00:26.050> plate<00:00:26.320> for<00:00:26.679> better<00:00:26.859> adhesion<00:00:27.599> I'm

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
build plate for better adhesion I'm

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.509 
build plate for better adhesion I'm
going<00:00:28.900> to<00:00:28.990> use<00:00:29.109> this<00:00:29.289> clamp<00:00:29.769> model<00:00:30.189> as<00:00:30.339> an

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
going to use this clamp model as an

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.490 
going to use this clamp model as an
example<00:00:30.849> which<00:00:31.239> I'll<00:00:31.390> drag<00:00:31.659> and<00:00:31.839> drop<00:00:32.050> on<00:00:32.290> to

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
example which I'll drag and drop on to

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.620 
example which I'll drag and drop on to
the<00:00:32.590> bed<00:00:32.770> as<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:34.000> can<00:00:34.150> see<00:00:34.360> there<00:00:34.540> are<00:00:34.600> a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
the bed as you can see there are a

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.180 
the bed as you can see there are a
couple<00:00:34.810> different<00:00:35.320> ways<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:35.800> could<00:00:35.920> choose

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
couple different ways you could choose

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.849 
couple different ways you could choose
to<00:00:36.220> orient<00:00:36.820> this<00:00:37.030> part<00:00:37.449> let's<00:00:38.320> say<00:00:38.500> we<00:00:38.649> want

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
to orient this part let's say we want

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.650 
to orient this part let's say we want
the<00:00:39.010> side<00:00:39.309> here<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.789> be<00:00:39.969> touching<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.449> build

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
the side here to be touching the build

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.160 
the side here to be touching the build
plate<00:00:40.899> so<00:00:41.739> we'll<00:00:41.890> just<00:00:42.070> go<00:00:42.219> to<00:00:42.250> edit<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:43.170> click

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
plate so we'll just go to edit and click

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.799 
plate so we'll just go to edit and click
place<00:00:44.469> surface<00:00:44.859> on<00:00:45.039> bed<00:00:45.250> or<00:00:46.149> you<00:00:46.359> can<00:00:46.539> use<00:00:46.660> the

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
place surface on bed or you can use the

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.270 
place surface on bed or you can use the
shortcut<00:00:46.989> ctrl<00:00:47.379> L<00:00:47.920> or<00:00:48.219> command<00:00:49.090> L<00:00:49.329> on<00:00:49.629> a<00:00:49.660> Mac<00:00:49.960> if

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.799 
shortcut ctrl L or command L on a Mac if
you<00:00:51.280> move<00:00:51.489> your<00:00:51.640> mouse<00:00:51.670> over<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.300> area<00:00:52.510> you'd

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
you move your mouse over the area you'd

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.419 
you move your mouse over the area you'd
like<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.109> place<00:00:53.289> on<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.590> bed<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:54.280> will

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
like to place on the bed it will

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.829 
like to place on the bed it will
highlight<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:55.030> surface<00:00:55.390> you're<00:00:55.480> about<00:00:55.660> to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
highlight the surface you're about to

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.740 
highlight the surface you're about to
click<00:00:56.079> so<00:00:56.829> we<00:00:57.039> click<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:58.089> part<00:00:58.329> is<00:00:58.449> re

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
click so we click and the part is re

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.040 
click so we click and the part is re
oriented<00:00:59.579> we<00:01:00.579> can<00:01:00.789> also<00:01:00.940> change<00:01:01.300> our<00:01:01.510> minds

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
oriented we can also change our minds

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.840 
oriented we can also change our minds
and<00:01:02.140> decide<00:01:02.469> that<00:01:02.649> we<00:01:02.800> want<00:01:02.980> this<00:01:03.309> surface<00:01:03.699> to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
and decide that we want this surface to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.090 
and decide that we want this surface to
be<00:01:03.969> touching<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.360> build<00:01:04.540> plate<00:01:04.780> instead<00:01:05.260> so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
be touching the build plate instead so

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.480 
be touching the build plate instead so
we<00:01:06.250> just<00:01:06.430> control<00:01:06.880> L<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.360> click<00:01:08.290> if<00:01:08.680> you'd

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
we just control L and click if you'd

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.830 
we just control L and click if you'd
like<00:01:09.640> your<00:01:09.790> part<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.119> be<00:01:10.150> in<00:01:10.329> the<00:01:10.420> center<00:01:10.720> of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
like your part to be in the center of

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.810 
like your part to be in the center of
the<00:01:10.930> build<00:01:11.110> plate<00:01:11.320> just<00:01:11.829> click<00:01:12.009> Center<00:01:12.610> and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
the build plate just click Center and

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.359 
the build plate just click Center and
arrange<00:01:13.200> keep<00:01:14.200> in<00:01:14.350> mind<00:01:14.590> that<00:01:14.799> if<00:01:15.009> you<00:01:15.130> click<00:01:15.340> a

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
arrange keep in mind that if you click a

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.460 
arrange keep in mind that if you click a
surface<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:15.909> isn't<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.780> lowest<00:01:17.110> point<00:01:17.350> in

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
surface that isn't the lowest point in

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.260 
surface that isn't the lowest point in
your<00:01:17.530> model<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.250> software<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:18.820> smart<00:01:19.180> enough

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
your model the software is smart enough

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.240 
your model the software is smart enough
to<00:01:19.450> know<00:01:19.720> not<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.290> drop<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.649> model<00:01:20.890> below<00:01:21.100> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
to know not to drop the model below the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.179 
to know not to drop the model below the
build<00:01:21.430> plate<00:01:21.700> for<00:01:22.360> example<00:01:22.390> if<00:01:23.229> I<00:01:23.500> select<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
build plate for example if I select the

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.310 
build plate for example if I select the
middle<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.610> this<00:01:24.759> cylinder<00:01:25.180> here<00:01:25.600> it<00:01:26.110> will

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
middle of this cylinder here it will

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.109 
middle of this cylinder here it will
change<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.740> orientation<00:01:27.399> so<00:01:27.579> that<00:01:27.610> surface

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
change the orientation so that surface

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.120 
change the orientation so that surface
is<00:01:28.270> facing<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.750> build<00:01:28.960> plate<00:01:29.229> but<00:01:29.799> it<00:01:29.890> won't

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
is facing the build plate but it won't

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.980 
is facing the build plate but it won't
drop<00:01:30.460> part<00:01:30.759> of<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.909> model<00:01:31.240> below<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.810> bed

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
drop part of the model below the bed

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.660 
drop part of the model below the bed
which<00:01:32.470> would<00:01:32.619> cause<00:01:32.770> it<00:01:32.950> not<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.189> be<00:01:33.310> printed

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
which would cause it not to be printed

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.700 
which would cause it not to be printed
so<00:01:34.540> anytime<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:35.140> want<00:01:35.290> to<00:01:35.350> change<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
so anytime you want to change the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.230 
so anytime you want to change the
orientation<00:01:35.860> of<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.520> model<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.090> a

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
orientation of a model so that a

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.730 
orientation of a model so that a
different<00:01:37.630> surface<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:38.110> touching<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.530> build

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
different surface is touching the build

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.649 
different surface is touching the build
plate<00:01:38.979> this<00:01:39.490> is<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.790> quickest<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:40.329> easiest

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
plate this is the quickest and easiest

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:49.480 
plate this is the quickest and easiest
way<00:01:41.079> to<00:01:41.110> do<00:01:41.409> it

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490
