thing<00:01:33.159> you<00:01:33.250> can<00:01:33.400> notice<00:01:33.549> as<00:01:33.760> well<00:01:33.880> they've

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
thing you can notice as well they've

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.460 
thing you can notice as well they've
gone<00:01:34.119> less<00:01:34.360> heavy<00:01:34.630> with<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:34.960> liquid<00:01:35.110> taping

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
gone less heavy with the liquid taping

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.649 
gone less heavy with the liquid taping
this<00:01:35.740> year<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.220> having<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.729> big<00:01:36.850> old<00:01:37.000> splurge<00:01:37.450> of

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
this year so having a big old splurge of

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.120 
this year so having a big old splurge of
liquid<00:01:37.990> taping<00:01:38.229> they've<00:01:38.860> sort<00:01:39.100> of

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
liquid taping they've sort of

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.640 
liquid taping they've sort of
streamlined<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.909> so<00:01:40.150> it's<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.690> more<00:01:41.170> flexible

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
streamlined it so it's a more flexible

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.649 
streamlined it so it's a more flexible
and<00:01:41.950> there's<00:01:42.430> more<00:01:42.610> sort<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.880> pull<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.360> it's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
and there's more sort of pull and it's

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.270 
and there's more sort of pull and it's
less<00:01:43.840> soft<00:01:44.110> you<00:01:44.440> can't<00:01:44.680> fit<00:01:44.860> against<00:01:45.190> your

it's going to be sealed okay and it's
glued<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.270> blind<00:02:04.479> stitched<00:02:04.720> obviously<00:02:05.170> so

glued and blind stitched obviously so

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.770 
glued and blind stitched obviously so

underneath the liquid taping is glued
and<00:02:07.930> sealed<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:08.439> it<00:02:08.890> shouldn't<00:02:09.220> really<00:02:09.250> be<00:02:09.459> any

you the mechanism how it works get in
you've<00:02:36.220> got<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> little<00:02:36.460> toggle<00:02:36.760> there<00:02:37.060> which

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
you've got a little toggle there which

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.830 
movement on the back panel at all what's
in<00:03:50.470> those<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.890> means<00:03:51.160> its<00:03:51.370> lesser<00:03:51.550> less<00:03:52.420> area

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
in those it means its lesser less area

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.180

for<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.260> water<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.530> actually<00:03:53.860> get<00:03:53.950> into<00:03:54.100> the

the<00:03:58.750> tricky<00:03:58.990> thing<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.290> actually<00:03:59.410> getting

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
the tricky thing is actually getting

the tricky thing is actually getting

year soon dishes so so between 2010 and
into<00:05:27.210> fall<00:05:27.450> 2011<00:05:28.230> and<00:05:28.740> last<00:05:29.610> year<00:05:29.760> they<00:05:30.030> were

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
into fall 2011 and last year they were

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.880 
into fall 2011 and last year they were
just<00:05:30.750> kind<00:05:31.020> of<00:05:31.050> like<00:05:31.230> an<00:05:31.320> evolution<00:05:31.710> of<00:05:31.770> the

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
just kind of like an evolution of the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.470 
just kind of like an evolution of the
psycho<00:05:32.280> wine<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:32.970> they<00:05:33.090> didn't<00:05:33.270> have<00:05:33.360> any

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
psycho wine and so they didn't have any

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.450 
psycho wine and so they didn't have any

basically all to do with the RGA air
fire<00:06:47.189> fire<00:06:47.550> wall<00:06:47.759> basically<00:06:47.939> and<00:06:48.509> the<00:06:49.469> name<00:06:49.649> of

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
fire fire wall basically and the name of

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.829 
fire fire wall basically and the name of
it<00:06:49.949> and<00:06:50.129> that<00:06:50.339> is<00:06:50.789> a<00:06:50.849> made<00:06:51.389> from<00:06:51.569> recyclable

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:51.839 
it and that is a made from recyclable

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.499 
it and that is a made from recyclable
materials<00:06:52.559> as<00:06:52.679> well<00:06:52.709> so<00:06:52.949> it's<00:06:53.069> nice<00:06:53.279> and

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:53.509 
materials as well so it's nice and

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.149 
materials as well so it's nice and
eco-friendly<00:06:54.509> to<00:06:54.689> the<00:06:55.439> other<00:06:55.589> key<00:06:55.740> difference

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
eco-friendly to the other key difference

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:00.409 
eco-friendly to the other key difference
is<00:06:56.429> the<00:06:56.869> seams<00:06:58.580> the<00:06:59.580> liquid<00:06:59.909> taping<00:07:00.089> is

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
is the seams the liquid taping is

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.730 
is the seams the liquid taping is
thinner<00:07:00.659> more<00:07:01.019> lightweight<00:07:01.259> and<00:07:01.589> more

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
thinner more lightweight and more

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.619 
thinner more lightweight and more
flexible<00:07:01.919> so<00:07:02.699> the<00:07:02.789> search<00:07:02.969> suit<00:07:03.269> should<00:07:03.389> feel

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:03.629 
flexible so the search suit should feel

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:04.790 
flexible so the search suit should feel
more<00:07:03.779> comfortable<00:07:04.050> light<00:07:04.469> and<00:07:04.649> less

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
more comfortable light and less

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.040 
more comfortable light and less
restricted<00:07:05.369> this<00:07:05.580> year<00:07:05.789> around<00:07:06.599> the<00:07:06.749> collars

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
restricted this year around the collars

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.809 
restricted this year around the collars
and<00:07:07.169> wrap<00:07:07.289> the<00:07:07.379> cuff<00:07:07.589> you<00:07:07.979> come<00:07:08.519> a<00:07:08.550> little<00:07:08.669> bit

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 
and wrap the cuff you come a little bit

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.749 
and wrap the cuff you come a little bit
closer<00:07:08.999> what<00:07:09.539> they've<00:07:09.659> started<00:07:09.779> to<00:07:10.379> do<00:07:10.759> just

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 
closer what they've started to do just

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.279 
closer what they've started to do just
use<00:07:11.999> the<00:07:12.149> soft<00:07:12.330> pinched<00:07:12.719> in<00:07:12.839> techniques

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289 
use the soft pinched in techniques

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:14.959 
use the soft pinched in techniques
basically<00:07:13.709> which<00:07:13.800> creates<00:07:14.099> a<00:07:14.159> nice<00:07:14.309> flat<00:07:14.669> seam

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:14.969 
basically which creates a nice flat seam

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.419 
basically which creates a nice flat seam
around<00:07:15.179> your<00:07:15.449> wrist<00:07:15.740> the<00:07:16.740> idea<00:07:17.129> being<00:07:17.309> that

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:17.429 
around your wrist the idea being that

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:18.799 
around your wrist the idea being that
underneath<00:07:17.819> your<00:07:18.089> gloves<00:07:18.360> or<00:07:18.599> whatever

underneath your gloves or whatever

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:20.629 
underneath your gloves or whatever
you're<00:07:18.930> wearing<00:07:19.219> it's<00:07:20.219> going<00:07:20.339> to<00:07:20.369> carry<00:07:20.519> a

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 
you're wearing it's going to carry a

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.179 
you're wearing it's going to carry a
better<00:07:20.939> seemed<00:07:21.269> about<00:07:21.959> a<00:07:22.019> seal<00:07:22.349> basically<00:07:23.039> so

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:23.189 
better seemed about a seal basically so

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:24.499 
better seemed about a seal basically so
it's<00:07:23.279> less<00:07:23.430> chance<00:07:23.639> of<00:07:23.759> water<00:07:23.939> flushing<00:07:24.419> up

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509 
it's less chance of water flushing up

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:26.209 
it's less chance of water flushing up
your<00:07:24.659> arm<00:07:24.809> and<00:07:25.289> getting<00:07:25.559> into<00:07:25.649> the<00:07:25.829> suit<00:07:25.979> you
