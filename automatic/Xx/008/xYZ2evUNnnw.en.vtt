well<00:00:01.319> today<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.650> decided<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.310> pull<00:00:02.610> one<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.909> the

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
well today I decided to pull one of the

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.970 
well today I decided to pull one of the
grave<00:00:03.270> leaves<00:00:03.600> out<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:03.810> storage<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.380> try<00:00:04.920> to

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
grave leaves out of storage and try to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.360 
grave leaves out of storage and try to
get<00:00:05.190> it<00:00:05.310> running<00:00:06.109> so<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.680> model<00:00:08.010> Li

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
get it running so this is the model Li

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.779 
get it running so this is the model Li
that<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.210> have<00:00:11.360> see<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:14.990> yep

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
that I have see here yep

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.390 
that I have see here yep
Li<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:19.230> other<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.560> over<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.010> think<00:00:20.279> it's

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
Li the other one over here I think it's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.370 
Li the other one over here I think it's
an<00:00:20.520> L<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.300> already<00:00:21.480> runs<00:00:21.779> had<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.230> run

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
an L that one already runs had that run

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
an L that one already runs had that run
in<00:00:22.470> about<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.740> year<00:00:23.130> year<00:00:23.359> or<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.539> ago

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
in about a year year or so ago

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.099 
in about a year year or so ago
this<00:00:25.949> one<00:00:26.099> doesn't<00:00:26.279> run<00:00:26.550> yet<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:27.750> electric

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
this one doesn't run yet see electric

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.140 
this one doesn't run yet see electric
start<00:00:28.439> model<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> electric<00:00:29.789> starter

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
start model I have the electric starter

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.910 
start model I have the electric starter
for<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.289> really<00:00:31.500> gonna<00:00:31.650> need<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
for it but it's really gonna need a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.680 
for it but it's really gonna need a
rebuild<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> could<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.059> both<00:00:33.239> start<00:00:33.570> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
rebuild so I could just both start it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.080 
rebuild so I could just both start it
for<00:00:33.840> now

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.330 

so<00:00:37.630> I'm<00:00:37.870> gonna<00:00:38.020> pull<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.470> head<00:00:38.620> off<00:00:38.650> get<00:00:39.190> one

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
so I'm gonna pull the head off get one

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.300 
so I'm gonna pull the head off get one
of<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.520> valves<00:00:39.730> unstuck<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.980> pull<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.070> cover

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
of the valves unstuck and pull the cover

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.430 
of the valves unstuck and pull the cover
of<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.610> magneto<00:00:43.060> off<00:00:43.330> and<00:00:43.720> clean<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.080> points

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
of the magneto off and clean the points

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.830 
of the magneto off and clean the points
so<00:00:44.530> I<00:00:44.560> can<00:00:44.590> get<00:00:44.800> some<00:00:45.010> spark<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:45.760> put<00:00:46.570> a<00:00:46.600> little

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
so I can get some spark and put a little

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.620 
so I can get some spark and put a little
more<00:00:46.990> oil<00:00:47.020> in<00:00:47.410> it<00:00:47.560> and<00:00:47.740> then<00:00:48.450> hopefully<00:00:49.450> it'll

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
more oil in it and then hopefully it'll

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.920 
more oil in it and then hopefully it'll
be<00:00:49.780> all<00:00:49.870> set<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.380> run<00:00:51.150> so<00:00:52.150> I'm<00:00:52.360> gonna<00:00:52.480> try<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:52.780> do

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
be all set to run so I'm gonna try to do

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.890 
be all set to run so I'm gonna try to do
a<00:00:52.960> repair<00:00:53.320> video<00:00:53.680> on<00:00:53.890> this<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.480> we'll<00:00:55.630> see<00:00:55.780> how

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
a repair video on this and we'll see how

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.380 
a repair video on this and we'll see how
it<00:00:56.050> goes<00:00:56.080> the<00:00:57.070> gear<00:00:57.370> reduction<00:00:57.820> wheels<00:00:58.060> on<00:00:58.360> it

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
it goes the gear reduction wheels on it

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.830 
it goes the gear reduction wheels on it
and<00:00:59.310> I'm<00:01:00.310> probably<00:01:00.940> gonna<00:01:01.150> put<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.510> rotary

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
and I'm probably gonna put the rotary

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.380 
and I'm probably gonna put the rotary
plow<00:01:02.110> on<00:01:02.350> this<00:01:02.530> thing<00:01:02.800> when<00:01:02.950> it's<00:01:03.100> done<00:01:03.330> try<00:01:04.330> it

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
plow on this thing when it's done try it

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.080 
plow on this thing when it's done try it
out<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:04.690> see<00:01:04.780> how<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.050> works<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:06.700> right<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:06.910> get

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
out and see how it works all right I get

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.600 
out and see how it works all right I get
the<00:01:07.210> points<00:01:07.600> all<00:01:07.750> cleaned<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.369> pulled

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
the points all cleaned and that pulled

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.980 
the points all cleaned and that pulled
it<00:01:09.760> over<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.119> this<00:01:10.210> thing's<00:01:10.479> actually<00:01:10.869> got

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
it over and this thing's actually got

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.210 
it over and this thing's actually got
very<00:01:11.410> good<00:01:11.530> spark<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:13.830> show<00:01:14.830> you<00:01:14.890> what<00:01:15.100> it's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
very good spark so show you what it's

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.990 
very good spark so show you what it's
like<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.979> they<00:01:18.130> were<00:01:18.190> pretty<00:01:18.400> dirty<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:18.970> I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
like and they were pretty dirty so I

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.219 
like and they were pretty dirty so I
just<00:01:19.150> took<00:01:19.300> some<00:01:19.920> 400<00:01:20.920> grit<00:01:21.100> sandpaper<00:01:21.490> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
just took some 400 grit sandpaper and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.170 
just took some 400 grit sandpaper and
ran<00:01:23.229> them<00:01:23.380> over<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.740> for<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.950> while<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.460> pulled

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
ran them over it for a while and pulled

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.969 
ran them over it for a while and pulled
some<00:01:25.390> paper<00:01:25.600> between<00:01:25.900> them<00:01:26.229> and<00:01:26.410> seemed<00:01:26.800> like

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
some paper between them and seemed like

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.060 
some paper between them and seemed like
they<00:01:27.130> cleaned<00:01:27.790> up<00:01:27.910> pretty<00:01:28.090> nice<00:01:28.860> alright

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
they cleaned up pretty nice alright

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.570 
they cleaned up pretty nice alright
see<00:01:30.580> if<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:30.820> can<00:01:31.000> do<00:01:31.119> this<00:01:31.330> cameras<00:01:32.050> all<00:01:32.170> set<00:01:32.580> all

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
see if I can do this cameras all set all

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.279 
see if I can do this cameras all set all
right<00:01:33.640> here<00:01:33.970> we<00:01:34.060> go<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:40.180> that's<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.509> spark<00:01:40.840> now

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
right here we go so that's the spark now

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.719 
right here we go so that's the spark now
I<00:01:41.320> just<00:01:41.560> got<00:01:41.679> to<00:01:41.770> pull<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:41.979> off<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.520> get<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
I just got to pull that off and get the

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.779 
I just got to pull that off and get the
valve<00:01:42.910> unstuck<00:01:44.310> alright<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.340> get<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.640> head

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
valve unstuck alright I get the head

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.450 
valve unstuck alright I get the head
pulled<00:01:46.060> off<00:01:46.270> all<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.740> bolts<00:01:48.009> came<00:01:48.220> out

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
pulled off all the bolts came out

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.480 
pulled off all the bolts came out
nothing<00:01:48.700> broke<00:01:49.090> which<00:01:49.300> was<00:01:49.479> good<00:01:50.490> gaskets

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
nothing broke which was good gaskets

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.249 
nothing broke which was good gaskets
still<00:01:51.700> in<00:01:51.820> good<00:01:52.000> shape<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.539> can<00:01:52.720> just<00:01:53.020> clean

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
still in good shape I can just clean

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:01.830 
still in good shape I can just clean
that<00:01:53.289> up<00:01:55.740> heads<00:01:56.740> not<00:01:56.979> bad<00:01:58.170> underneath<00:02:00.840> solid

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
that up heads not bad underneath solid

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.999 
that up heads not bad underneath solid
cast<00:02:02.050> iron<00:02:02.289> head<00:02:02.649> it's<00:02:03.100> awfully<00:02:03.460> heavy<00:02:03.610> but

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
cast iron head it's awfully heavy but

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.320 
cast iron head it's awfully heavy but
the<00:02:06.009> valve<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.429> was<00:02:06.550> stuck<00:02:06.789> open<00:02:07.000> was<00:02:07.300> the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
the valve that was stuck open was the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.360 
the valve that was stuck open was the
exhaust<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:10.569> one<00:02:10.780> right<00:02:10.929> here<00:02:11.370> actually

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
exhaust the this one right here actually

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.760 
exhaust the this one right here actually
the<00:02:13.000> exhaust<00:02:13.390> valve<00:02:13.720> was<00:02:13.930> stuck<00:02:13.960> open<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.620> this

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
the exhaust valve was stuck open on this

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.450 
the exhaust valve was stuck open on this
one<00:02:15.010> too<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:17.350> when<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.680> rolled<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.100> over

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
one too so when I rolled this over

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:26.140 
one too so when I rolled this over
you'll<00:02:18.610> see

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.140 

the<00:02:27.150> intake<00:02:27.540> valve<00:02:27.810> goes<00:02:28.110> up<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.790> exhaust

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the intake valve goes up the exhaust

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.610 
the intake valve goes up the exhaust
valve<00:02:30.480> doesn't<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:30.990> down<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:34.500> can

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
valve doesn't go down and so you can

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.920 
valve doesn't go down and so you can
just<00:02:34.800> knock<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.250> loose<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:39.510> I'll<00:02:39.780> just

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
just knock that loose and I'll just

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.520 
just knock that loose and I'll just
scrape<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.410> head<00:02:40.560> off<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:42.090> razor<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.140> then

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
scrape the head off the razor and then

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.770 
scrape the head off the razor and then
run<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> wire<00:02:44.340> brush<00:02:44.610> over<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.090> clean<00:02:45.450> under<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
run a wire brush over it clean under the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.530 
run a wire brush over it clean under the
valves<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.260> stuff<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.150> get<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.180> all<00:02:48.360> back

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
valves and stuff and get it all back

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.630 
valves and stuff and get it all back
together<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.020> then<00:02:49.290> get<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.950> fuel<00:02:50.160> tank<00:02:50.430> on

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
together and then get the fuel tank on

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.140 
together and then get the fuel tank on
and<00:02:50.820> we'll<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.450> see<00:02:51.600> how<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.720> runs<00:02:53.150> all

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
and we'll have to see how it runs all

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.990 
and we'll have to see how it runs all
right<00:02:54.360> well<00:02:54.570> after<00:02:55.050> about<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.650> good<00:02:56.190> hour<00:02:56.370> hour

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
right well after about a good hour hour

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.390 
right well after about a good hour hour
and<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.330> half<00:02:57.510> or<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:57.960> I<00:02:58.230> finally<00:02:59.160> got<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
and a half or so I finally got the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.640 
and a half or so I finally got the
exhaust<00:02:59.760> valve<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.330> move<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.750> was<00:03:00.930> really

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
exhaust valve to move it was really

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.550 
exhaust valve to move it was really
stuck<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.160> there<00:03:02.370> pretty<00:03:02.400> good<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:03.380> spent<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.440> lot

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
stuck in there pretty good I spent a lot

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.060 
stuck in there pretty good I spent a lot
of<00:03:04.620> time<00:03:04.890> tapping<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.520> used<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.770> plastic<00:03:07.770> drift

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
of time tapping it used to plastic drift

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.390 
of time tapping it used to plastic drift
for<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.730> stuff<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.530> used<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.830> whole<00:03:11.040> lot

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
for it and stuff and used a whole lot

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.780 
for it and stuff and used a whole lot
less<00:03:12.390> your<00:03:12.660> PB<00:03:13.020> Blaster<00:03:13.820> good<00:03:14.820> stuff<00:03:15.680> but

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
less your PB Blaster good stuff but

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.760 
less your PB Blaster good stuff but
after<00:03:17.790> all<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.090> work<00:03:18.350> finally<00:03:19.350> did<00:03:19.500> break

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
after all that work finally did break

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:28.160 
after all that work finally did break
free<00:03:23.660> now<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.840> moves<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.900> I'm<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.050> gonna

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
free now it moves so I'm just gonna

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.530 
free now it moves so I'm just gonna
stick<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.160> head<00:03:29.310> back<00:03:29.550> on<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:30.000> never<00:03:30.180> sees<00:03:30.510> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
stick the head back on I never sees the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.170 
stick the head back on I never sees the
bolts<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.100> can<00:03:32.250> get<00:03:32.340> him<00:03:32.460> off<00:03:32.580> again<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
bolts so I can get him off again and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.940 
bolts so I can get him off again and
clean<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> head<00:03:33.660> gasket<00:03:34.170> off<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.770> head<00:03:34.920> of

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
clean the head gasket off the head of

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.450 
clean the head gasket off the head of
the<00:03:35.220> engines<00:03:35.760> cleaned<00:03:36.120> off<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:37.770> head<00:03:37.980> is

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
the engines cleaned off and the head is

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.560 
the engines cleaned off and the head is
cleaned<00:03:38.790> off<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:41.280> wiped<00:03:41.790> out<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.150> piston

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
cleaned off so wiped out the piston

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.290 
cleaned off so wiped out the piston
scraped<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.320> lot<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.800> carbon<00:03:44.580> buildup<00:03:45.090> on

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
scraped a lot of the carbon buildup on

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.140 
scraped a lot of the carbon buildup on
the<00:03:45.480> sides<00:03:45.750> there<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.350> stuff<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.910> guess

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
the sides there and stuff so I guess

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.870 
the sides there and stuff so I guess
I'll<00:03:48.300> put<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.540> together<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.520> then<00:03:50.520> I<00:03:50.610> have<00:03:50.730> to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
I'll put it together and then I have to

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.870 
I'll put it together and then I have to
fit<00:03:51.030> up<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.240> gas<00:03:51.420> tank<00:03:51.450> next<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.640> see<00:03:53.640> if<00:03:53.730> she

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
fit up the gas tank next and see if she

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.380 
fit up the gas tank next and see if she
fires<00:03:55.370> all<00:03:56.370> right<00:03:56.490> the<00:03:56.610> grave<00:03:56.820> legs<00:03:57.030> all<00:03:57.150> back

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
fires all right the grave legs all back

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.170 
fires all right the grave legs all back
together<00:03:57.570> so<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.350> got<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.160> makeshift<00:03:59.520> gas<00:03:59.820> tank

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
together so I got a makeshift gas tank

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.930 
together so I got a makeshift gas tank
hooked<00:04:00.390> up<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.920> guess<00:04:02.130> we<00:04:02.250> can<00:04:02.400> try<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.580> start

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
hooked up so I guess we can try to start

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:49.710 
hooked up so I guess we can try to start
it<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.210> see<00:04:04.020> if<00:04:04.110> it'll<00:04:04.260> run

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.450 

it's<00:04:50.720> gonna<00:04:50.870> be<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.140> smoky<00:04:51.680> startup<00:04:52.190> with<00:04:52.340> all

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
it's gonna be a smoky startup with all

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:28.290 
it's gonna be a smoky startup with all
that<00:04:52.580> oil<00:04:52.730> in<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.090> muffler

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:07:11.369 

you

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:11.379 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:14.499 

after<00:07:12.379> not<00:07:12.560> running<00:07:12.949> and<00:07:13.129> we<00:07:13.939> notice<00:07:14.150> how<00:07:14.300> many

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:14.509 
after not running and we notice how many

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:20.469 
after not running and we notice how many
ears<00:07:15.340> start<00:07:16.340> it<00:07:16.460> up<00:07:16.580> for<00:07:16.759> denuded<00:07:17.120> I<00:07:19.240> don't<00:07:20.240> see

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 
ears start it up for denuded I don't see

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.550 
ears start it up for denuded I don't see
too<00:07:21.139> many<00:07:21.259> leaks<00:07:21.560> anywhere<00:07:22.210> actually<00:07:23.409> none<00:07:24.409> at

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
too many leaks anywhere actually none at

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:32.589 
too many leaks anywhere actually none at
all<00:07:24.650> from<00:07:24.860> what<00:07:25.009> I<00:07:25.039> can<00:07:25.159> see<00:07:29.800> good<00:07:30.800> stuff<00:07:31.599> well

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 
all from what I can see good stuff well

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.689 
all from what I can see good stuff well
that's<00:07:32.750> one<00:07:32.930> more<00:07:33.110> running<00:07:33.469> that<00:07:34.279> I<00:07:34.340> know<00:07:34.400> of

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:34.699 
that's one more running that I know of

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:37.420 
that's one more running that I know of
so<00:07:35.259> what<00:07:36.259> I'm<00:07:36.349> gonna<00:07:36.439> do<00:07:36.680> now<00:07:36.889> is<00:07:36.919> I'm<00:07:37.189> gonna<00:07:37.279> go

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.430 
so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.149 
so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go
get<00:07:37.520> my<00:07:37.669> rotary<00:07:37.969> plow<00:07:38.240> and<00:07:38.740> attach<00:07:39.740> it<00:07:39.949> to<00:07:40.039> the

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:40.159 
get my rotary plow and attach it to the

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:43.600 
get my rotary plow and attach it to the
front<00:07:40.400> and<00:07:40.610> maybe<00:07:41.150> do<00:07:41.360> some<00:07:41.389> clown<00:07:41.719> with<00:07:41.960> it<00:07:42.610> so

front and maybe do some clown with it so

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.519 
front and maybe do some clown with it so
that's<00:07:44.060> the<00:07:44.270> first<00:07:44.300> startup<00:07:44.900> of<00:07:44.990> the<00:07:45.050> gravely
