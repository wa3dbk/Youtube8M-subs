00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 or I'll get to make a candy bar like 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.470
 this is minimal but today I 'm going to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.630
 teach how to make mickey mouse 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.880
 materials that we are going to use are rubber 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.190
 eva red and eva color rubber 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.280
 black and a little bit of silicone for 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.680
 hit start 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.500
 so the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.210
 the ears in black eva rubber that I 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.040
 I have made them by eye and I have also done 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.840
 a strip that this is going to be what it is 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.290
 around that is like it's a 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.290
 basket this is going to be the grip for the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.629
 basket and this will be the circles 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.360
 I'm going to stick around here as you see 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.120
 It's super easy and takes almost nothing like that 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.949
 that what we are going to do in the first place 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.770
 is to put silicone in here and we're going to 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.380
 hit that is round us a 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.170
 circle 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.120
 A) Yes 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.089
 once we 've stuck it what we're going 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.159
 to do is put it on the rubber eva 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.920
 and with the help of a toothpick we're going to 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.250
 mark and so let's do the circle of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.250
 down 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.840
 and what we are going to do is throw him 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.840
 silicone and we 're going to stick it 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.030
 already stuck look if you still see 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.890
 a lot of silicone what to uncover you do 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.580
 a thin strip and you lose it in everything 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.400
 the around and here you take a 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.400
 little piece and you stick it and so it's disguised 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.689
 Well now what we 're going to do is catch 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.280
 the handle and let's stick 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.530
 we put a little bit of silicone in a 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.530
 side and another bit in the other 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.630
 once you have already hit it look 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.670
 I have also stuck the edge 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.920
 and what we 're going to do from behind is 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.740
 hit the ears the ears are the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.990
 let's put one here on one side of the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.390
 handle and another in the other and we're also going 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.280
 to paste the black circles here 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.250
 around like this 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.260
 and that's how Mickey's candy is 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.940
 mouse finished as you have seen is 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.940
 super easy is very simple does not take 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.540
 nothing and in less than two minutes we have 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.580
 fact 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.880
 Well, I hope it gave you an idea and 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.490
 what do you do 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.740
 that is very original to give away some 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.130
 sweets to the kids or for a birthday 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.820
 to do it for all the guys 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.310
 and as you have seen it is very easy if you 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.370
 liked not forget, will like to comment 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.290
 and share and nothing we see in the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.290
