I'm<00:04:34.560> going<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.710> show<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:35.430> combination<00:04:36.270> on

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
I'm going to show you a combination on

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.250 
I'm going to show you a combination on
the<00:04:36.780> pads<00:04:37.020> which<00:04:37.530> allows<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:38.010> to<00:04:38.190> what<00:04:38.790> that

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
the pads which allows you to what that

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.530 
the pads which allows you to what that
forwards<00:04:40.260> backwards<00:04:40.500> movement<00:04:41.450> so<00:04:42.450> what

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
forwards backwards movement so what

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.600 
forwards backwards movement so what
we're<00:04:42.660> going<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.840> do<00:04:42.960> now<00:04:43.110> is<00:04:43.460> pick<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
we're going to do now is pick the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.100 
we're going to do now is pick the
movement<00:04:45.090> for<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.420> straight<00:04:45.660> punch<00:04:45.840> ease

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
movement for the straight punch ease

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.070 
movement for the straight punch ease
into<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:47.190> partner<00:04:47.760> drill<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:48.390> again<00:04:48.750> this<00:04:48.900> can

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
into a partner drill so again this can

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.990 
into a partner drill so again this can
be<00:04:49.200> watched<00:04:49.380> as<00:04:49.620> part<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:49.890> your<00:04:50.040> class<00:04:50.250> or<00:04:50.670> if

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
be watched as part of your class or if

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.340 
be watched as part of your class or if
you're<00:04:51.150> working<00:04:51.330> with<00:04:51.480> one-on-one<00:04:52.080> clients

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
you're working with one-on-one clients

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.690 
you're working with one-on-one clients
you<00:04:53.190> can<00:04:53.400> get<00:04:54.360> them<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.690> what<00:04:54.870> les<00:04:55.050> seemed<00:04:55.410> real

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
you can get them to what les seemed real

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.550 
you can get them to what les seemed real
so<00:04:56.700> all<00:04:56.880> I'm<00:04:57.000> going<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.180> do<00:04:57.330> start<00:04:58.080> off<00:04:58.230> in<00:04:58.410> that

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
so all I'm going to do start off in that

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.370 
so all I'm going to do start off in that
position<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:59.160> should<00:04:59.370> be<00:04:59.850> just<00:05:00.180> out<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:00.990> range

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
position I should be just out of range

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.190 
position I should be just out of range
of<00:05:01.920> my<00:05:02.400> pads<00:05:02.640> to<00:05:02.880> start<00:05:03.120> off<00:05:03.270> with<00:05:03.480> as<00:05:03.810> you

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
of my pads to start off with as you

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.120 
of my pads to start off with as you
stand<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.740> course<00:05:05.390> they<00:05:06.390> don't<00:05:06.600> need<00:05:06.720> to<00:05:06.900> move

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
stand to course they don't need to move

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.500 
stand to course they don't need to move
it's<00:05:08.130> important<00:05:08.640> that<00:05:08.730> they<00:05:08.940> start<00:05:09.210> really

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
it's important that they start really

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.720 
it's important that they start really
cannot<00:05:09.900> touch<00:05:10.110> surprised<00:05:10.530> less<00:05:11.070> force<00:05:11.430> as<00:05:11.610> a

person his punching to have to create
that<00:05:14.340> movement<00:05:14.630> starts<00:05:15.630> off<00:05:15.810> just<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.230> single

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
that movement starts off just a single
