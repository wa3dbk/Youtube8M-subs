it helps me raise this heavy sail

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.010 
it helps me raise this heavy sail
without<00:01:27.280> having<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.760> climb<00:01:28.000> way<00:01:28.480> up<00:01:28.510> high<00:01:28.990> to

without having to climb way up high to

do it a pulley is a special wheel with

do it a pulley is a special wheel with

cord wrapped around it when the Rope is

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.310 
cord wrapped around it when the Rope is
pulled<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:37.180> wheel<00:01:37.450> can<00:01:37.720> turn<00:01:37.990> in<00:01:38.170> either

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
pulled the wheel can turn in either

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.280 
pulled the wheel can turn in either
direction<00:01:39.000> by<00:01:40.000> pulling<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.510> one<00:01:40.570> end<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
direction by pulling on one end of the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.560 
direction by pulling on one end of the
rope<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:42.130> can<00:01:42.340> lift<00:01:42.580> an<00:01:42.760> object<00:01:42.940> on<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.420> other

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
rope you can lift an object on the other

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.360 
rope you can lift an object on the other
end<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:46.480> neat<00:01:46.750> thing<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.050> that<00:01:47.290> each<00:01:47.830> wheel<00:01:48.190> of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
end the neat thing is that each wheel of

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.250 
end the neat thing is that each wheel of
a<00:01:48.460> pulley<00:01:48.730> makes<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.270> work<00:01:49.480> easier

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
a pulley makes the work easier

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.219 
a pulley makes the work easier
so<00:01:50.740> with<00:01:51.160> several<00:01:51.820> wheels<00:01:52.150> people<00:01:52.840> can<00:01:53.020> lift

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
so with several wheels people can lift

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.080 
so with several wheels people can lift
things<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.770> they<00:01:53.890> could<00:01:54.100> never<00:01:54.370> lift<00:01:54.790> with

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
things that they could never lift with

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.750 
things that they could never lift with
just<00:01:55.479> their<00:01:55.660> hands<00:01:58.979> pulleys<00:01:59.979> are<00:02:00.130> even<00:02:00.520> used

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
just their hands pulleys are even used

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.630 
just their hands pulleys are even used
in<00:02:01.000> giant<00:02:01.510> cranes<00:02:01.870> to<00:02:02.200> lift<00:02:02.229> very<00:02:02.890> heavy<00:02:03.310> loads

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
in giant cranes to lift very heavy loads

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.469 
in giant cranes to lift very heavy loads
high<00:02:03.910> in<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.210> air<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:06.610> think<00:02:06.850> how<00:02:06.970> hard<00:02:07.270> it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
high in the air just think how hard it

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.300 
high in the air just think how hard it
would<00:02:07.600> be<00:02:07.660> to<00:02:07.810> lift<00:02:08.110> these<00:02:08.260> huge<00:02:08.679> containers

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
would be to lift these huge containers

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.890 
would be to lift these huge containers
by<00:02:09.520> hand<00:02:11.520> pulleys<00:02:12.520> can<00:02:12.760> definitely<00:02:13.450> make<00:02:13.660> work

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
by hand pulleys can definitely make work
