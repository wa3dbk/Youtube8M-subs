00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.200
 i 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.610
 i 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.119
 hi people I am that I believed you but also 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.950
 known as the man who bit the 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.110
 diamond and own wood and I'm here 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.060
 to show you the tutorial of the great 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.320
 mystery of the sheet the video that I made 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.080
 of a moving block of diamond 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.790
 alone and at the end he shoots me good 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.980
 Many of you have asked me about this 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.010
 video and the truth is that it 's something 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.140
 quite simple and because the truth is very 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.980
 curious so I 'm going to teach you by 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.890
 what 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.829
 try to rain try to rain try 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.320
 I need good guys, so there's the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 block and here are the commands worth 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.040
 every command of this is that there is over here 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.400
 it's a movement of the block is worth 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.890
 then this starts so that with 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.620
 what I am here is a test for worth 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.870
 is a test for the coordinates then 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.809
 near the block that is a g of 5 a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.320
 Once the block approaches me it starts 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.840
 the succession of animation of what they are worth 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.220
 makes a circle in a circle and the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.869
 final is when you throw arrows 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.369
 but well let's see it 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.899
 well let's get closer to the block that 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.410
 rekindled and a pig next door does not know what 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.119
 what awaits you 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.530
 well we hit here and the test by 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.960
 this situation and this zone is therefore 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.690
 when we get closer there it starts to 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.970
 walk the block is worth and then they are like 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.600
 Animations is worth it does not work 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.080
 I have to put exactly the block 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.400
 to see if you do not see today because you have to 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.020
 be block on top so that the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.470
 animation is valid if it's not working 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.950
 now it was like that and now go up here 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.170
 now he's going to throw arrows to jump 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.930
 jumps jumps and now throws arrows 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.390
 you see there are the arrows well 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.190
 now it is what happens that this I have not 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.970
 cut the circuit is now expensive 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.550
 a clock 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.010
 I guess I put a clock on here 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.720
 because the clock with the arrows there is so 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.850
 common 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.670
 with arrows the coordinates and now 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.860
 I put motion and this is where they are going 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.840
 directed the arrows are good guys 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.580
 Well here I am my other world 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.500
 that's the first one I did worth and here 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.750
 As you can see, there is the for test and here 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.390
 is an example of what I wanted to do 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.490
 then I did it well but this 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.530
 basically it's to show you these 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.180
 guys that are the points where I made 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.670
 to move what it 's worth 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.500
 there you see everything marked and each command 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.420
 This blog is because it makes it move 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.010
 the block is worth so let's go to 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.840
 principle so that you teach them how 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.629
 I did 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.700
 this button as you can see there is a block 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.379
 but it does not move because it has to 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.410
 be a block on top so that it moves 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.640
 okay now it moves then with once 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.230
 happens for here I have to aim the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.709
 coordinates open this block puts of 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.420
 this and continuous is valid and this has to 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.940
 to be a succession has to see a repeat 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.440
 that everything works perfect there goes to 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.090
 keep moving better move me 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.340
 up to here it's worth 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.989
 now what is this worth as you see what 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.180
 only that changes is the motive worth the 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.800
 motion puts the address where I want 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.500
 to move the block is worth enough 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.960
 simple 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.230
 over here is a jump step of the creme and 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.120
 there in this suitcase and a set now goes up 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.080
 for here to this sure a little 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.020
 good and now makes another jump another jump 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:30.240
 another jump and now this works 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:32.100
 so it's worth nothing then then once 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.380
 comes to the end there is a kind of 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.000
 watch what it does is that it activates this 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.580
 when constantly and be friend I put 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.310
 another here with the same and I put this 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.980
 A) Yes 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.520
 Well, as you see, it launches a lot and now 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.650
 like another one here like this 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.930
 they will be much better because I am 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.450
 getting more like in blocks and stop it 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.040
 because it is less all crazy because as 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.380
 you see is quite simple now that what 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.610
 you see so these guys just 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.260
 It is to show you that on a map 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.510
 adventures or the same in a video game 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.880
 Well, this is very useful for 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.590
 to make blocks that move and 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.170
 all this would be like a block here of 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.430
 dirt as you see it does not work worth only 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.200
 contains the block that I put to be the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.459
 same that I put where it puts this I put a 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.680
 112 is worth the dirt block 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.419
 it moves, but as you can see, a 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.170
 little bit there on the tip that some 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:29.830
 blocks that look worth this 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:34.350
 soul sam is worth and change here I put 88 that 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:37.060
 it is the solution because as you can see it works 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.460
 clear light clear normal because the 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.030
 things like have a little security 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.480
 let's see again that makes grace 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.880
 that you can not but you can hope that 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.009
 be clear how all this works and 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.110
 now it 's your thing that I investigated jce 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.529
 this is little things I'm in the snapshot the 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.039
 last one that came out okay and nothing I 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.039
 dismissal here 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.500
 the mystery of the sheet good guys not 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.590
 just say it cinema and peace 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.590
 i 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.650
 but like if you like the video 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.690
 thanks for seeing it 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.050
 and I'm flying because I'm a first 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.050
 free
