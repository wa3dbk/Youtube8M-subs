00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.590
 f from friends of the log 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:17.240
 And to say that tell the size of the tire 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:21.740
 I have a request to raise the engine sound , so I will take a video 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.860
 There is not only the horizontal width of 5 meters a little house in the garage 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.920
 So it's finally a line of two 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.410
 By say 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.730
 The third generation is 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.730
 I put it like this 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 The front is 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.070
 23 5 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:47.329
 4 maroon- 18 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:50.410
 Rear tire is 275-35-18 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:56.070
 In terms of exercise performance 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.070
 The film is better on the 17th if it is said that it fits the foot well 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 It may have been 19 inches in front of it just by looking good 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:11.290
 I 'm now in the middle of the 18th, so I'm calm and I 'm amg 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.160
 It is a genuine wheel 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:19.540
 The rear is 275 - 35, so even than some front 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.180
 To the outside diameter is large and purposely enlarged 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.650
 Well this 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.220
 Because it spins the wheel even from about 140 km from evacuation by rain 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.970
 It is still a bit short 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.970
 It is such a mon 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.470
 Although you up the engine sound and the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:46.460
 In fact, just before the change in pr to work area of Erufe rally 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:52.270
 I also own the opportunity for Testarossa 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:58.240
 8 it is very close sound to 12-cylinder engine of the horizontally-opposed 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.969
 This is not a genuine Aim g muffler but some other type of amg writes on 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.230
 It sounds like a very vulgar sound 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:07.500
 Not mercenary for Mercedes 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:14.710
 Island work that flies like slowly 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:17.490
 Actually, I fell in love at first sight with the fact that it is very similar to the Ferrari 12-cylinder note. 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.490
 I bought it 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:27.459
 Not a fashionable sound of heavy bass of a little show-containing Well 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.620
 It's a bit vulgar, but it's a bit like Ferrari. 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.620
 Please listen to the 12 cylinder note 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.020
 I want to 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.020
 I am west 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.730
 Haa 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.520
 tan 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.520
 yeah yeah 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.040
 me 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.020
 ben 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.519
 It was Magurusu N point spree
