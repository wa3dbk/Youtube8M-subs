00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 I'm very busy! You look. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Lazy bastard. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.300
 Oh my God! 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.700
 I think I've lost my hat. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.000
 I won't let them get you. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.500
 Without it, you feel very s-si ... EXTREMELY. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
 Stop. So you can't swear without a hat? 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.600
 Kindly! Help me find him. In return, a treasure awaits you. 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.200
 Did you say treasure ?! 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.500

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.700
 Maybe I dropped it during my harp recital. 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.000
 I'm gonna be like a ninja in there, the same. Like Jesus would do. 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.800
 No, no hats in here. 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.400
 AND DEEP DEAD. 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.000
 Hey, maybe those street artists have seen them. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 No, what are you doing in our place, man? 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.500
 Exactly, my leaf. Don't you know that street artists are ”peligro Sokak? This is dangerous. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.200
 Oh, my God. Your picture is very GORGEOUS! 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.000
 What did you say, little green thing? 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.700
 Your mother should be very proud of you! 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.000
 Really, man? Nobody told me this before. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Same man. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Gracias. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 You have a huge potential 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.500
 No. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Yoooo. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 NEIN! 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 Not here, either. 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.500
 Well, I guess you have to be good. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.000
 Ho! Ho! Ho! 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.000
 My hat! 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.700
 You're a whore! You're a whore! 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.000
 What do you want for Christmas LAN, SHADOW ?! 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.600
 I just want old Santa. 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.000
 Santa is dead, AMCIK! 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.700
 What do you want, BOK BREATHING ?! 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.000
 You stole my SHAPE! 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
