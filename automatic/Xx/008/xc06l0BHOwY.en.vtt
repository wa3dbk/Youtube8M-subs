00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.570
 But other things, how does it move me ? 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.190

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.550

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.080

 now have the project and that's one 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.030
 Almost right 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.240

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.819

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.569

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:13.069

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.860

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.600
 it's pattern for easter is worse 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.220
 as the guests what is correct for pattern 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.840
 the first time is huge shit 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.290
 be we even if only because the thing 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.060
 was full of dust and then no 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.830
 dusty on exactly we have too 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.830
 long looking is these cards have 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.959
 By the way , I have the papa on the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.540
 At first glance it looks like 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:48.910
 stink normal 1967 eyed copy that way 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.019
 go took the whole company 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.050
 everything was dusty 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:59.420
 He had it even if you look 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:04.100
 Happy as a child if we still have her 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.530
 look, we see that the whole part 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.420
 Actually, what do we have in here? 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.900
 and you can do a lot 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.200
 is more important here and that is that the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.620
 engine the engine the engine 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.700
 gearbox from the 2004 mustang cobra 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.340
 terminator 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.990
 the thing is very brutal compressor 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:39.620
 built just as hand 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:42.470
 on the compressor v8 decor 6 4 7 liters so 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.970
 the company ps3 on 85 company ps of course 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.760
 not so and what must be 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.690
 I ask again knows a box 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.790
 Police base if it can then recognize 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.729
 I tell you now we will briefly hide it 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.860
 One and all sang pay attention to old shit 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.860
 such a thing is now one 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.500
 and orgasm I get in any case 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.710
 look and it is the same box 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.260
 same base of the ken block monster 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.050
 Energy had to be there again 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.110
 exactly 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.600
 we will ventilate the box 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.820
 not full program tomorrow 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.980
 the day after tomorrow, three months, the thing 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:39.850
 completely new to me from scratch 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.850
 completely new cage bodykit so 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.310
 Steam to judge means the whole 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.290
 whole quasi be made that, in any case, 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.150
 case, the weather effects would fit the 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.730
 drift car and they can be curious 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.370
 there is much more to come from that will be so 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.710
 a little bit the piece of mine 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.770
 eyeing others 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:25.930
 that's 67 of the otherwise very 2015 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.930
 different but dogs and the same 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.710
