00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
years old but you would never know it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.880 
years old but you would never know it
because<00:00:38.270> I<00:00:38.480> always<00:00:38.660> searched<00:00:39.110> them<00:00:39.380> and<00:00:39.590> then

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
because I always searched them and then

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.170 
because I always searched them and then
when<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.070> food<00:00:40.220> scenes<00:00:40.460> get<00:00:40.670> on<00:00:40.820> them<00:00:41.030> the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
when the food scenes get on them the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.639 
when the food scenes get on them the
starch<00:00:41.390> actually<00:00:41.720> acts<00:00:41.870> as<00:00:42.050> a<00:00:42.110> barrier<00:00:42.170> to

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
starch actually acts as a barrier to

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.020 
starch actually acts as a barrier to
keep<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.130> stains<00:00:43.370> from<00:00:43.550> getting<00:00:43.880> on<00:00:44.000> the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
keep the stains from getting on the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.389 
keep the stains from getting on the
fabric<00:00:44.480> itself<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:45.410> washes<00:00:45.620> out<00:00:46.040> really

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
fabric itself so it washes out really

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.400 
fabric itself so it washes out really
easily<00:00:46.640> now<00:00:47.360> there's<00:00:47.540> two<00:00:47.810> ways<00:00:47.840> you<00:00:48.079> can<00:00:48.350> make

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
easily now there's two ways you can make

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.260 
easily now there's two ways you can make
your<00:00:48.560> own<00:00:48.710> starch<00:00:49.160> one<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.790> benefits<00:00:50.149> of

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
your own starch one of the benefits of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.250 
your own starch one of the benefits of
making<00:00:50.390> your<00:00:50.570> own<00:00:50.630> starch<00:00:50.899> is<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:51.140> can

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
making your own starch is you can

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.930 
making your own starch is you can
control<00:00:51.620> how<00:00:51.800> much<00:00:51.860> starch<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:52.430> put<00:00:52.640> on<00:00:52.820> your

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
to dispose of this big aerosol can which

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.709 
to dispose of this big aerosol can which
is<00:00:57.170> how<00:00:57.260> most<00:00:57.469> starch<00:00:57.860> is<00:00:58.100> sold<00:00:58.540> so<00:00:59.540> there's

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
is how most starch is sold so there's

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.900 
is how most starch is sold so there's
two<00:00:59.870> ways<00:01:00.020> you<00:01:00.050> can<00:01:00.290> apply<00:01:00.469> starch<00:01:00.860> first<00:01:01.610> is

and<00:01:28.189> then<00:01:28.520> just<00:01:28.700> run<00:01:28.880> your<00:01:29.029> iron<00:01:29.209> over<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.719> now

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
and then just run your iron over it now

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.330 
and then just run your iron over it now
one<00:01:30.319> thing<00:01:30.469> you'll<00:01:30.619> have<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:30.950> do<00:01:31.069> is<00:01:31.219> you'll

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
one thing you'll have to do is you'll

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.590 
one thing you'll have to do is you'll
have<00:01:31.369> to<00:01:31.520> clean<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:31.909> bottom<00:01:32.179> of<00:01:32.299> your<00:01:32.420> iron

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
have to clean the bottom of your iron

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.660 
have to clean the bottom of your iron
after<00:01:33.049> use<00:01:33.409> because<00:01:33.740> starch<00:01:34.039> will<00:01:34.249> build<00:01:34.490> up

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
after use because starch will build up

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.209 
after use because starch will build up
and<00:01:34.880> secondly<00:01:35.630> only<00:01:35.990> make<00:01:36.499> your<00:01:36.649> starch<00:01:36.920> right

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
and secondly only make your starch right

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.289 
and secondly only make your starch right
before<00:01:37.520> you're<00:01:37.639> going<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.819> use<00:01:37.999> it<00:01:38.179> because

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
before you're going to use it because

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.389 
before you're going to use it because
starch<00:01:38.630> will<00:01:38.899> go<00:01:39.049> bad<00:01:39.259> sitting<00:01:39.889> in<00:01:40.039> a<00:01:40.099> spray

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
starch will go bad sitting in a spray

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.819 
starch will go bad sitting in a spray
bottle<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.450> easier<00:01:41.990> way<00:01:42.139> to<00:01:42.170> use<00:01:42.380> starch<00:01:42.679> in

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
bottle the easier way to use starch in

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.469 
bottle the easier way to use starch in
the<00:01:42.889> way<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.009> like<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.459> use<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.700> most<00:01:43.909> often<00:01:44.119> is

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
the way I like to use it most often is

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.899 
the way I like to use it most often is
actually<00:01:44.929> to<00:01:45.049> add<00:01:45.229> it<00:01:45.469> to<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.649> rinse<00:01:46.009> cycle<00:01:46.099> so

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
actually to add it to a rinse cycle so

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.519 
actually to add it to a rinse cycle so
for<00:01:47.060> instance<00:01:47.359> if<00:01:47.479> I'm<00:01:47.599> washing<00:01:47.869> my<00:01:48.079> linen

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:48.529 
for instance if I'm washing my linen

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:50.019 
for instance if I'm washing my linen
napkins<00:01:48.889> or<00:01:49.039> my<00:01:49.130> husband's<00:01:49.549> dress<00:01:49.789> shirts

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:50.029 
napkins or my husband's dress shirts

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:52.480 
napkins or my husband's dress shirts
I'll<00:01:50.299> wash<00:01:50.539> them<00:01:50.810> once<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.409> then<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:51.979> will<00:01:52.310> put

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
I'll wash them once and then I will put

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.249 
I'll wash them once and then I will put
them<00:01:52.609> through<00:01:52.909> on<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.119> second<00:01:53.509> rinse<00:01:53.630> cycle<00:01:54.049> and

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
them through on a second rinse cycle and

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.529 
them through on a second rinse cycle and
I<00:01:54.319> will<00:01:54.439> add<00:01:54.649> starch<00:01:55.130> into<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.999> machine<00:01:56.329> at

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
I will add starch into the machine at

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.120 
I will add starch into the machine at
the<00:01:56.659> rinse<00:01:56.840> cycle<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.439> when<00:01:57.740> you're<00:01:57.859> doing<00:01:58.039> it

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
the rinse cycle and when you're doing it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.069 
the rinse cycle and when you're doing it
that<00:01:58.310> way<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.549> want<00:01:58.819> to<00:01:58.880> add<00:01:58.969> two<00:01:59.299> tablespoons

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
that way you want to add two tablespoons

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.859 
that way you want to add two tablespoons
to<00:02:00.770> half<00:02:01.099> a<00:02:01.219> cup<00:02:01.429> of<00:02:01.549> water<00:02:01.759> mix<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.599> up<00:02:02.689> really

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
to half a cup of water mix it up really

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.719 
to half a cup of water mix it up really
good<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.169> then<00:02:03.469> just<00:02:03.499> pour<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.099> in<00:02:04.249> wherever

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
good and then just pour it in wherever

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.779 
good and then just pour it in wherever
your<00:02:05.179> rinse<00:02:05.419> cycle<00:02:05.840> goes<00:02:06.109> in<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:07.520> way

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
your rinse cycle goes in and that way

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.910 
your rinse cycle goes in and that way
you<00:02:07.849> can<00:02:08.090> avoid<00:02:08.179> streaking<00:02:09.080> when<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.619> spray

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
you can avoid streaking when you spray

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.770 
you can avoid streaking when you spray
on<00:02:09.950> starch<00:02:10.520> if<00:02:10.759> you're<00:02:10.880> not<00:02:11.030> careful<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.630> can

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
on starch if you're not careful it can

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.480 
on starch if you're not careful it can
leave<00:02:11.989> starch<00:02:12.380> streaks<00:02:12.830> especially<00:02:13.400> on

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
leave starch streaks especially on

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.910 
leave starch streaks especially on
colored<00:02:13.910> fabric<00:02:14.390> on<00:02:14.540> white<00:02:15.260> fabric<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.770> won't

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
colored fabric on white fabric it won't

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.420 
colored fabric on white fabric it won't
matter<00:02:16.070> because<00:02:16.400> starch<00:02:16.640> turns<00:02:17.120> away

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
matter because starch turns away

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.459

streaks just add it into your rinse

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.780 
streaks just add it into your rinse
cycle<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.319> can<00:02:22.530> wash<00:02:22.980> your<00:02:23.280> clothes

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
in the rinse cycle and iron them up and

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.140 
in the rinse cycle and iron them up and
they'll<00:02:25.829> be<00:02:25.950> nice<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.159> starched<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.819> crisp
