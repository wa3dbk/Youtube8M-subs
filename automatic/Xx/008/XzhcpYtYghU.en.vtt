 satanist party meet something 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.060

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.460
 to a whole new level you have 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.460
 hoped for a demon 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.869
 Excuse me 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.780
 it is time for our heroism 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.990
 refer 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.790

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.070

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.709
 determine the age 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.709
 dollar 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.970
 Well, I have to say that honestly 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.790
 is such a genre movie for all live 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.960
 action role player all runners in 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.880
 to get such movies to face 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.530
 also have the feeling that envy too 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.060
 bergers and that will be in fsk 16 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.190
 therefore his gags tend to come too 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.540
 mainly play in this scene 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.830
 that is film for a certain 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.800
 niche that may be very happy 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.330
 to look at those in the 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.850
 software test that can be pictures 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.620
 expected from 18 august 2014 in 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.120
 the german cinemas will bring 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.740
 the story tells of johanna and 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.480
 eric bana dreise normally 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.170
 huge buddies and live action role 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.940
 player 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.200
 but above all it is the problem of 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.460
 Joe leaving his girlfriend 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.620
 will not feel like it anymore 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.600
 play his character in this 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.980
 world actually dies and that's why 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.150
 his two buddies try him 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.040
 somehow to help the legs again 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 to get away from the alcohol and drive 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.020
 to the biggest live action role play event 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.700
 evermore and that's the big one 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.320
 adventure where it applies with help 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.790
 a magic book is that she buys 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.140
 have this character on the internet 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.670
 to revive than then but 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.590
 suddenly everything goes wrong and this 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.510
 clean possibility a real 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.980
 magic book is at the demons from the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.660
 Hell be summoned then yes 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.940
 at one time people actually only so 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.370
 pretend they're actually in red 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.170
 roses and fight a woman and 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.180
 an icon of the live action role scene 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.530
 which as a figure should be the whole 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.900
 just packed his adventurous 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.280
 fantasy comedy with a peter dinkel 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.510
 yes, many are from game of thrones 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.340
 know because you also ask yourself 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.930
 that's why it turns out in such a way 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.400
 michigan film finds it again 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.170
 the feeling that new software 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.730
 the first strip is already a few 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.110
 years is somewhere on the edge and you 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.760
 now due to the popularity in 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.890
 Just try the release date like that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.540
 to tackle the most and most of it 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.800
 The film should be called me 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.880
 not really convinced by the trailer 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.130
 I do not really find the scenes 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.360
 funny but for genre fans that could be 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.100
 definitely a little discovery 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.930
 saturday 18 august the film starts 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.250
 also outside of the ordinary ones 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.080
 cinema start thursday 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.430
 she is a bit designed around the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.470
 film to bring us so far forward 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.060
 actually not only every movie possible 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.230
 for fans so I 'm not happy 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.060
 Honestly, who are you? 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.120
 because treyarch likes to comment 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.260
 because I am through a trader check to 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.520
 Afford 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.470
 like to leave a thumb there if this 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.600
 video made it stay if not 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.980
 Otherwise, the region is a few left 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.500
 around me and tomorrow at 15 o'clock 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.730
 Of course, at the latest a new video and 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.190
 I hope so here since tomorrow 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.190
