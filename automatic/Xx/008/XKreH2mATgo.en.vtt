like this warm-up live Doppler 5 and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.029 
like this warm-up live Doppler 5 and
sweeping<00:00:21.510> through<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.109> we're<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.680> finding<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
sweeping through and we're not finding a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.710

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
whole lot of activity out there you can

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.630 
whole lot of activity out there you can
see<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> few<00:00:25.170> spots<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.619> green<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:26.039> trying<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
see a few spots of green here trying to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.070 
see a few spots of green here trying to
pick<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.119> some<00:00:27.300> precipitation<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.019> is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
pick up on some precipitation that is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.109 
pick up on some precipitation that is
all<00:00:28.380> aloft<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.070> none<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.880> reaching

all aloft and none of this is reaching
the<00:00:30.810> surface<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.410> will<00:00:31.590> stay<00:00:31.890> dry

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the surface so we will stay dry

which is nice new lenox at about 37 as
well<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.379> take<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.739> Barrington

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.940 
well and will take you up to Barrington
a<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.430> bit<00:00:47.550> temperature<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.570> about<00:00:48.950> 35

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
a little bit temperature of about 35

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.119 
a little bit temperature of about 35
degrees<00:00:50.370> light<00:00:51.180> winds<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.110> some<00:00:52.530> clouds<00:00:52.829> out

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
degrees light winds and some clouds out

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.010 
degrees light winds and some clouds out
there<00:00:53.370> right<00:00:53.550> now<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.000> temperatures<00:00:54.510> will<00:00:54.539> be

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
there right now so temperatures will be

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.350 
there right now so temperatures will be
dropping<00:00:55.199> however<00:00:55.829> will<00:00:56.100> drop<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.460> about<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
dropping however will drop to about the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
dropping however will drop to about the
upper<00:00:57.570> 20s<00:00:57.989> near<00:00:58.109> 30<00:00:58.440> degrees<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.340> get

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
upper 20s near 30 degrees so it will get

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.400 
upper 20s near 30 degrees so it will get
rather<00:00:59.850> chilly<00:01:00.329> stepping<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> door<00:01:01.230> this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
rather chilly stepping out the door this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.560 
rather chilly stepping out the door this
evening<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.160> cool<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.579> there<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.000> bundle<00:01:03.390> up

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
whole lot of moisture to work with so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.410 
whole lot of moisture to work with so
we're<00:01:16.740> too<00:01:16.920> dry<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.400> support<00:01:17.759> any<00:01:17.880> rain<00:01:18.119> or

we're too dry to support any rain or
snow<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.259> will<00:01:19.500> continue<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.890> push<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.280> out
