00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
impressions on it but yeah I haven't

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.830 
impressions on it but yeah I haven't
really<00:02:31.930> played<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.410> my<00:02:32.620> six<00:02:33.010> yet<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.840> that's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
really played and my six yet the that's

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.140 
really played and my six yet the that's
like<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.319> single<00:02:35.680> player<00:02:35.799> mode<00:02:36.069> i<00:02:36.130> believe<00:02:36.580> i

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
like the single player mode i believe i

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.509 
like the single player mode i believe i
think<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.350> also<00:02:38.500> do<00:02:38.739> multiplayer<00:02:39.100> on<00:02:39.400> it

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
think you can also do multiplayer on it

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.430 
think you can also do multiplayer on it
i'm<00:02:39.640> not<00:02:39.670> really<00:02:39.940> sure<00:02:40.060> i<00:02:40.510> haven't<00:02:41.200> really

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
i'm not really sure i haven't really

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.530 
i'm not really sure i haven't really
gone<00:02:41.620> into<00:02:42.100> much<00:02:42.280> details<00:02:42.760> about<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.299> I

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
gone into much details about it I

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.770 
gone into much details about it I
somehow<00:02:44.410> played<00:02:44.890> some<00:02:45.549> of<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.819> missions<00:02:46.360> in

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
somehow played some of the missions in

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.089 
somehow played some of the missions in
that<00:02:46.930> stage<00:02:47.260> it's<00:02:47.980> actually<00:02:48.310> pretty<00:02:48.459> fun<00:02:48.930> the

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
that stage it's actually pretty fun the

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.740 
that stage it's actually pretty fun the
cool<00:02:51.099> thing<00:02:51.130> about<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.910> fastest<00:02:52.360> that

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
cool thing about is the fastest that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.759 
cool thing about is the fastest that
you've<00:02:52.870> done<00:02:53.049> it<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.410> there's<00:02:53.590> like<00:02:53.709> a

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
you've done it that there's like a

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.320 
you've done it that there's like a
certain<00:02:54.160> time<00:02:54.370> limit<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:54.940> have<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.180> do

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
certain time limit that you have to do

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.539 
certain time limit that you have to do
this<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> faster<00:02:56.769> you<00:02:56.860> completed<00:02:57.370> like

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
this like the faster you completed like

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.130 
this like the faster you completed like
you<00:02:58.150> get<00:02:58.329> like<00:02:58.480> some<00:02:58.690> sort<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.230> ranking<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.769> it

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
you get like some sort of ranking on it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.780 
you get like some sort of ranking on it
but<00:03:02.140> as<00:03:02.410> each<00:03:02.739> level<00:03:03.160> goes<00:03:03.370> there's<00:03:03.640> like

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
but as each level goes there's like

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.400 
but as each level goes there's like
certain<00:03:04.000> missions<00:03:04.329> that<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.989> do<00:03:05.140> so

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
certain missions that you have to do so

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.289 
certain missions that you have to do so
that's<00:03:05.620> kind<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:05.950> fun<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.400> might<00:03:06.820> show<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.269> i

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
that's kind of fun I might show that i

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.670 
that's kind of fun I might show that i
might<00:03:07.540> play<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.930> off<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.230> i<00:03:08.290> might<00:03:08.440> show<00:03:08.650> it

an<00:04:24.390> option<00:04:24.720> in<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.110> game<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.820> option<00:04:27.210> for

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
an option in this game the option for

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.850 
an option in this game the option for
that<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.720> think<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.320> would<00:04:28.410> just<00:04:28.560> have<00:04:28.680> to

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
that I think you would just have to

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.220 
that I think you would just have to
unlock<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.310> grenade<00:04:29.640> launcher<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:30.840> that's<00:04:31.020> it

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
unlock the grenade launcher so that's it

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.650 
unlock the grenade launcher so that's it
that's<00:04:31.440> just<00:04:31.620> basically<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.820> quick<00:04:33.360> video<00:04:33.510> for
