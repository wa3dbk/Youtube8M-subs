00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.800
 let's talk today about 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.560
 how to correct with glazes 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.070
 let's say we want to modify this 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.980
 blue color that we have in the background 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.150
 we can of course apply the paint 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.820
 opaquely covering and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.289
 but the problem with this is that it creates 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.730
 an effect like of plasta 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.280
 that is our layer 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.710
 it's too flat or even 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.370
 something we can do to avoid this 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:45.110
 is to apply a glaze that is to dilute 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.260
 a little bit our color to have a 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.230
 more transparent color 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.230
 we can dilute the paint with a medium 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.550
 Quick drying like liquid or with 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.659
 a combination of 50% solvent and 50% 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.659
 linseed oil 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.440
 as you see here this technique is 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.880
 letting see a little the texture and the 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:20.000
 color that is below and you do not create a 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.210
 effect so even or so flat 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.290
 of course we can give this layer with 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.159
 different nuances or different 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.289
 tonalities 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.829
 for example here I can darken a 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.829
 a little more 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.250
 and this is going to do that in our layer 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.760
 also have a little more of 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.290
 qualities and of and of wealth 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.840
 okay 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.600
 now this way of correcting with 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.850
 glazes works for us if we want 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.659
 slightly modify some tone 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.630
 for example darken or 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.649
 or slightly modify the color 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.670
 but if we wanted to correct something of the 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.509
 figure 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.200
 for example to cut the tip of this 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.780
 banana 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.069
 so there we are going to need a 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.200
 Covering color to cover 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.630
 perfectly 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.200
 the shape 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.200
 okay 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.040
 If you have any doubt, you can leave 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.150
 down here in the comments and we 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.150
 we see in the following video
