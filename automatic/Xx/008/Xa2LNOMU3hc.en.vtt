00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.330 
wall above it and the piece on either
side<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.950> now<00:02:59.160> i'm<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.640> moon<00:03:01.070> can<00:03:02.070> jump

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
side so now i'm on the moon can jump

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.740 
side so now i'm on the moon can jump
really<00:03:02.489> high<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.209> can<00:03:06.330> see<00:03:06.480> I'm<00:03:06.540> always

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
really high but you can see I'm always

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.740 
really high but you can see I'm always
losing<00:03:07.290> breath<00:03:07.850> very<00:03:08.850> slowly<00:03:09.269> because<00:03:09.480> I'm

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
losing breath very slowly because I'm

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.949 
losing breath very slowly because I'm
full<00:03:10.019> space<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.620> Don<00:03:10.830> but<00:03:11.870> losing<00:03:12.870> it

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
full space to Don but losing it

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.120 
full space to Don but losing it
nonetheless<00:03:13.910> now<00:03:14.910> I'm<00:03:15.060> going<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.540> turn

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
nonetheless now I'm going to turn

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.500 
nonetheless now I'm going to turn
peaceful<00:03:17.130> off<00:03:17.340> because<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.820> think<00:03:18.180> there's<00:03:18.450> a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
peaceful off because I think there's a

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.220 
peaceful off because I think there's a
moon<00:03:18.720> monsters<00:03:19.320> cannot<00:03:19.980> build<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.370> tent<00:03:20.610> here

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
moon monsters cannot build a tent here

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.449 
moon monsters cannot build a tent here
but<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.260> find<00:03:22.560> some<00:03:22.769> flatter<00:03:23.040> ground<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.610> guess

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
but I find some flatter ground I guess

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:39.680 
but I find some flatter ground I guess
this<00:03:26.459> looks<00:03:26.700> good<00:03:34.340> ok<00:03:38.150> I'm<00:03:39.150> going<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.360> cut<00:03:39.570> it

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
this looks good ok I'm going to cut it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.990 
this looks good ok I'm going to cut it
out<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.079> retentive<00:03:40.410> built<00:03:40.980> but<00:03:41.730> until<00:03:41.970> I

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
out to a retentive built but until I

find<00:03:42.299> out<00:03:42.420> how<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.750> build<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.519> found<00:03:44.519> out

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
find out how I can build it I found out

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.060 
find out how I can build it I found out
what<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.850> problem<00:03:45.000> was<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:46.049> can't<00:03:46.350> build<00:03:46.769> for

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
what the problem was you can't build for

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.870 
what the problem was you can't build for
moon<00:03:47.250> tents<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:48.209> on<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:49.579> surface<00:03:50.579> you

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
moon tents just like on the surface you

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.550 
moon tents just like on the surface you
need<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.299> actually<00:03:51.620> put<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:53.040> ground

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
need to actually put it in the ground

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.289 
need to actually put it in the ground
mining<00:03:55.560> down<00:03:55.860> placing<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.760> then<00:03:56.850> just<00:03:57.060> use

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
mining down placing it and then just use

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.170 
mining down placing it and then just use
the<00:03:57.450> screwdriver<00:03:58.190> places<00:03:59.190> all<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.400> blocks<00:03:59.820> on

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
the screwdriver places all the blocks on

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.000 
the screwdriver places all the blocks on
the<00:04:00.480> ground<00:04:00.720> around<00:04:01.049> with<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.799> got<00:04:01.980> a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
the ground around with that it's got a

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.580 
the ground around with that it's got a
little<00:04:02.970> air<00:04:03.329> bubble<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.959> can<00:04:04.140> breathe<00:04:04.350> in

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
little air bubble so I can breathe in

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
little air bubble so I can breathe in
space<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:06.329> now<00:04:06.480> whenever<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.200> go<00:04:08.070> inside<00:04:08.459> and

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
space so now whenever I go inside and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.330 
space so now whenever I go inside and
get<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:09.060> say<00:04:09.510> don't<00:04:10.260> go<00:04:10.590> back<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.040> normal

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
get it say don't go back to the normal

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.780 
get it say don't go back to the normal
world<00:04:11.549> so<00:04:12.510> I'm<00:04:12.690> going<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.109> put<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:14.430> too<00:04:14.579> hard

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790
