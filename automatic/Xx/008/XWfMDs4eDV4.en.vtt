fix the first and biggest problem in
this<00:00:20.960> camera<00:00:21.289> had<00:00:21.619> is<00:00:21.949> a<00:00:22.369> piece<00:00:22.759> of<00:00:22.789> fabric

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
this camera had is a piece of fabric

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.240 
this camera had is a piece of fabric
that<00:00:23.390> hangs<00:00:23.779> down<00:00:23.929> and<00:00:24.380> protects<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.039> film

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
that hangs down and protects the film

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.189 
that hangs down and protects the film
from<00:00:25.519> light<00:00:25.789> when<00:00:26.419> you're<00:00:26.630> not<00:00:26.810> taking<00:00:27.140> a

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.130 
from light when you're not taking a
picture<00:00:27.439> in<00:00:28.310> normal<00:00:28.789> operation<00:00:29.509> this<00:00:29.779> piece

picture in normal operation this piece
of<00:00:30.320> fabric<00:00:30.529> is<00:00:30.890> grabbed<00:00:31.189> by<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.400> mirror<00:00:31.789> and

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
of fabric is grabbed by the mirror and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.060 
of fabric is grabbed by the mirror and
lifted<00:00:32.270> out<00:00:32.390> of<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.570> way<00:00:32.720> but<00:00:33.620> for<00:00:33.860> some

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
lifted out of the way but for some

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.890 
lifted out of the way but for some
reason<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.580> was<00:00:34.700> only<00:00:34.850> being<00:00:35.090> grounded<00:00:35.570> on<00:00:35.630> one

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
reason it was only being grounded on one

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.050 
reason it was only being grounded on one
side<00:00:36.230> as<00:00:36.560> you<00:00:37.250> can<00:00:37.400> see<00:00:37.580> in<00:00:37.700> these<00:00:37.790> high-speed

but<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.220> noticed<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.060> the<00:00:42.360> camera<00:00:42.720> was

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
but what I noticed is if the camera was

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.530 
but what I noticed is if the camera was
leaning<00:00:43.230> forward<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.220> this<00:00:44.400> shot<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
leaning forward like in this shot the

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.850 
leaning forward like in this shot the
piece<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.020> fabric<00:00:46.200> would<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.620> grabbed

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
piece of fabric would be grabbed

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.900 
piece of fabric would be grabbed
properly<00:00:47.490> and<00:00:47.610> pulled<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.300> way

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.549 

this<00:00:52.910> turned<00:00:53.210> out<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:53.390> be<00:00:53.600> pretty<00:00:53.809> easy<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.290> fix

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
this turned out to be pretty easy to fix

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.819 
this turned out to be pretty easy to fix
I<00:00:54.890> put<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.000> camera<00:00:56.210> forward<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.020> set<00:00:57.649> the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
I put the camera forward and set the

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.610 
I put the camera forward and set the
shutter<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.280> bulb<00:00:58.550> mode<00:00:59.090> so<00:00:59.930> that<00:00:59.960> as<00:01:00.260> long<00:01:00.470> as

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
shutter the bulb mode so that as long as

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.850 
shutter the bulb mode so that as long as
I<00:01:00.739> hold<00:01:01.010> down<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.430> trigger<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.780> could<00:01:03.590> get<00:01:03.739> my

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
I hold down the trigger I could get my

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.039 
I hold down the trigger I could get my
hands<00:01:04.100> inside<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.909> I<00:01:05.119> just<00:01:05.390> added<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.810> little

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
hands inside and I just added a little

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.480 
hands inside and I just added a little
crease<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.740> piece<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.100> fabric<00:01:07.460> right

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
crease in that piece of fabric right

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.120 
crease in that piece of fabric right
there<00:01:07.940> so<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.200> was<00:01:09.320> caught<00:01:09.530> every<00:01:09.890> time

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
there so that it was caught every time

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.430 
there so that it was caught every time
by<00:01:10.550> that<00:01:10.729> rectangular<00:01:11.300> bar<00:01:11.630> on<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.110> back<00:01:12.290> of

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
by that rectangular bar on the back of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.030 
by that rectangular bar on the back of
the<00:01:12.530> mirror<00:01:17.080> now<00:01:18.080> regardless<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.920> the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
the mirror now regardless of the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.920 
the mirror now regardless of the
orientation<00:01:19.610> if<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.060> camera<00:01:20.450> is<00:01:20.479> pointed

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
orientation if the camera is pointed

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.770 
orientation if the camera is pointed
forwards<00:01:21.440> or<00:01:21.619> backwards<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.940> mirror<00:01:23.390> always

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
forwards or backwards the mirror always

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.480 
forwards or backwards the mirror always
pulls<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:24.380> piece<00:01:24.619> of<00:01:24.770> fabric<00:01:24.950> out<00:01:25.310> of<00:01:25.340> the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
pulls that piece of fabric out of the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.029 
pulls that piece of fabric out of the
way<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.600> exposures<00:01:27.140> don't<00:01:27.440> have<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.649> weird

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
way and the exposures don't have a weird

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.350 
way and the exposures don't have a weird
shadow<00:01:28.340> on<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.880> top<00:01:29.090> third<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.880> other<00:01:31.940> prong

this<00:01:32.660> camera<00:01:33.110> had<00:01:33.289> was<00:01:33.649> with<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.009> meter<00:01:34.520> which

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
this camera had was with the meter which

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.029 
this camera had was with the meter which
is<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.720> thin<00:01:35.960> needle<00:01:36.320> on<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.590> right<00:01:36.770> hand

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
is the thin needle on the right hand

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.389 
is the thin needle on the right hand
side<00:01:37.509> when<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.720> operates<00:01:38.960> normally<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
side when it operates normally the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.249 
side when it operates normally the
needle<00:01:40.700> moves<00:01:40.910> up<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:41.330> down<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:41.929> have<00:01:42.110> to

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
needle moves up and down and you have to

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.779 
needle moves up and down and you have to
adjust<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.590> settings<00:01:42.979> of<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.159> camera<00:01:43.190> to

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
adjust the settings of the camera to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.320 
adjust the settings of the camera to
make<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.149> circle<00:01:44.600> line<00:01:44.780> up<00:01:44.960> with<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.259> needle

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
make the circle line up with the needle

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.059 
make the circle line up with the needle
all<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:47.720> happened<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.740> needle

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
all that it happened is that the needle

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.010 
all that it happened is that the needle
got<00:01:49.490> stuck<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.090> little<00:01:50.360> rubber<00:01:50.569> bumper

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
got stuck to the little rubber bumper

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.840 
got stuck to the little rubber bumper
that<00:01:51.170> rests<00:01:51.649> against<00:01:52.039> when<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.460> cameras

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
that rests against when the cameras

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.740 
that rests against when the cameras
turned<00:01:53.119> off<00:01:57.189> this<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.670> normal<00:01:59.090> operation

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
turned off this is the normal operation

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.560 
turned off this is the normal operation
of<00:01:59.869> the<00:01:59.930> meter<00:02:00.229> after<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.890> fix<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.369> needle<00:02:01.700> here

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
of the meter after I fix the needle here

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.480 
of the meter after I fix the needle here
I'm<00:02:02.750> turning<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.290> ring<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.920> controls<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
I'm turning the ring that controls the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.410 
I'm turning the ring that controls the
aperture<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:06.140> moves<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:06.590> little<00:02:06.890> circle

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
aperture and it moves that little circle

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.550 
aperture and it moves that little circle
to<00:02:08.420> know<00:02:08.570> that<00:02:08.780> you're<00:02:08.899> getting<00:02:09.049> a<00:02:09.320> correct

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
to know that you're getting a correct

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.990 
to know that you're getting a correct
exposure<00:02:10.009> you're<00:02:10.369> trying<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.729> get<00:02:10.850> that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
exposure you're trying to get that

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.259 
exposure you're trying to get that
circle<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.570> line<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.989> with<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.320> needle

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
circle to line up with the needle

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.759 
circle to line up with the needle
there's<00:02:14.269> a<00:02:14.390> little<00:02:14.600> prism<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.230> here<00:02:15.500> that

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
there's a little prism in here that

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.620 
there's a little prism in here that
allows<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.340> see<00:02:16.579> the<00:02:16.790> ring<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.269> lens

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
allows you to see the ring on the lens

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.440 
allows you to see the ring on the lens
that<00:02:18.470> tells<00:02:18.829> you<00:02:19.070> what<00:02:19.579> your<00:02:19.730> aperture<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.209> set

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
that tells you what your aperture is set

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.330 
that tells you what your aperture is set
to<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:21.410> along<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.340> bottom<00:02:22.630> there's<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.870> little

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.800 
to and along the bottom there's a little
display<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.579> shows<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.030> what<00:02:26.239> your<00:02:26.450> shutter

speed<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.730> changing<00:02:28.730> both<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.150> these<00:02:29.299> moves

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
speed is changing both of these moves

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.030 
speed is changing both of these moves
moves<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.400> circle<00:02:31.880> up<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.209> down<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:33.040> lets

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
moves that circle up and down and lets

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.060 
moves that circle up and down and lets
you<00:02:34.190> get<00:02:34.340> proper<00:02:35.150> exposure<00:02:38.799> along<00:02:39.799> with<00:02:39.950> the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
you get proper exposure along with the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.120 
you get proper exposure along with the
camera<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.700> also<00:02:40.880> got<00:02:41.209> 100<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.019> 200<00:02:42.590> telephoto

so here's the 100 200 lines with the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.009 
so here's the 100 200 lines with the
multiplier<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.940> focused<00:03:05.420> as<00:03:05.569> close<00:03:05.840> as

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
multiplier and it's focused as close as

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.949 
multiplier and it's focused as close as
it'll<00:03:06.260> go<00:03:06.290> which<00:03:07.129> is<00:03:07.190> about<00:03:07.549> 27<00:03:08.239> inches<00:03:08.510> and

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
it'll go which is about 27 inches and
