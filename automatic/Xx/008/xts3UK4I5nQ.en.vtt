00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.730
 for opening a charger is 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.650
 necessary to use a screwdriver 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.630
 flat with the rather sharp tip that 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.779
 we will introduce in the longitudinal slot 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.320
 that unites both halves and with a blow 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.030
 dry with a hammer giving in the pressure 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.480
 adequate 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 we will be able to separate both halves 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.730
 breaking the inner part 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.989
 doing enough pressure 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.629
 we get the charger to open 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.880
 practically like a coconut from side to 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.940
 side 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.700
 all this is necessary because of the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.640
 closing technology of the housings of 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.080
 the shippers using a process 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.630
 Thermofusion or sealing of both halves 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.570
 making it impossible to open them from 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.690
 another way that is not for breakage is 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.130
 important that the screwdriver has 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.290
 the tip is sharp and the blow is made 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.900
 If we do not open them with one of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.110
 the corners we can repeat the blow in 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.960
 the opposite corner but always with the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.020
 care necessary to not break any 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.909
 internal component or damage the history 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.179
 of the charger 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.039
 once this process is finished 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:40.549
 we proceed to separate both halves with 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.649
 a dry pull and it's already open 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.200
 later we will have to clean 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.259
 carefully burrs left in 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.850
 both halves at the breaking points 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.950
 because if we do not do it like that when 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.729
 let's go to close it will not fit 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.729
 right way 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.630
 the sides of the charger that we 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.909
 prevent opening it correctly 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.280
 we will have to use a blade or a 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.189
 Cutter to be cut before 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.129
 start the openings in certain 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.290
 occasions when we apply pressure to 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.220
 some of the corners with objects of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.260
 open the box 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.470
 it may happen that in some models of 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.390
 charger we have certain difficulties 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.150
 This is because the process 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.480
 Heat sealing of the box is in a form 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.420
 different from normal for example in the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.540
 chargers brand hp there will be 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.300
 need to do more depth and not 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.710
 it's strange that when we finish 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.730
 let's find many more brands of 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.010
 abrasion and breakage of the account can 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.030
 be possible even that we have to 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.280
 open and hit by the four corners 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.890
 therefore, it is always advisable to notify 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.530
 to the client in advance of what is 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.530
 you will find later it is also 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.580
 convenient that if we have chargers 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.040
 damaged never throw the boxes because 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.620
 a box of a charger can be very 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.560
 resistant to its opening can be 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.020
 destroyed and that we have to change it 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.360
 for another box that we have of the world 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.510
 charger that had no chance of 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.330
 repair is always convenient 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.330
 the hand- laid for these cases 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.739
 and remember that from the cleaning of 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.549
 cut will depend after cleaning the 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.549
 closing the box 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.640
 if necessary, they must be replaced 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.130
 the process of closing the box is 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.650
 much simpler as the halves are going to 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.500
 fit correctly only 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.500
 we will have to use a glue with 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.990
 Pilates piano base to be able to paste 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.870
 efficiently we bring the two together 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.930
 halves we dispense a small amount 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.260
 of glue longitudinally to what 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.530
 length of the rupture slot by both 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.530
 sides 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.070
 once the two halves are joined 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.810
 we press uniformly during 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.160
 a few seconds until the glue 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.860
 do your work 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.040
 and in this way for very little money 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.430
 we have repaired a charger soon 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.430
 plus
