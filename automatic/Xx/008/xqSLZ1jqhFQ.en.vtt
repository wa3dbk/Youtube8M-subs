since dubbed antenna gate doesn't seem

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
in a certain way and the bars go way

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.540 
in a certain way and the bars go way
down<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.239> doesn't<00:01:00.570> seem<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> good<00:01:01.199> thing

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
down that doesn't seem like a good thing

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.000 
down that doesn't seem like a good thing
well<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.730> turns<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.350> it's<00:01:04.350> certainly<00:01:04.860> not

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
well it turns out it's certainly not

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.789 
well it turns out it's certainly not
unique<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> iPhone<00:01:05.970> 4<00:01:06.439> that<00:01:07.439> was<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.710> of

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
unique to the iPhone 4 that was one of

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.520 
unique to the iPhone 4 that was one of
the<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.070> things<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.490> learned<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:10.170> could<00:01:10.320> go

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the first things we learned you could go

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.030 
the first things we learned you could go
on<00:01:10.680> YouTube<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.299> see<00:01:12.299> videos<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.320> Nokia

ever<00:01:17.939> looked<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.630> them<00:01:18.810> much<00:01:18.960> before<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.619> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
ever looked at them much before but I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
ever looked at them much before but I
think<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.430> important<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> understand<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
think it's important to understand the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
think it's important to understand the
scope<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.409> problem<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
scope of this problem because what the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.840 
scope of this problem because what the
data<00:01:24.659> says<00:01:25.280> lead<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> conclusion

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
data says lead you to the conclusion

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.899 
data says lead you to the conclusion
that<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:28.110> has<00:01:28.320> been<00:01:28.500> blown<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.670> out<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
that this has been blown so out of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
that this has been blown so out of
proportion<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.570> it's<00:01:33.570> incredible<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
proportion that it's it's incredible so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.160 
proportion that it's it's incredible so

people are updating it it fixes the
wrong<00:01:49.110> formula<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.040> use<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> calculate

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
wrong formula that we use to calculate

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.460 
wrong formula that we use to calculate
how<00:01:51.090> many<00:01:51.149> bars<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.869> up<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> given

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
how many bars to put up for a given

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
how many bars to put up for a given
signal<00:01:52.799> strength<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.939> was<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> nasty

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
signal strength and there was a nasty

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060 
signal strength and there was a nasty
exchange<00:01:55.110> bug<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> lot<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> our

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
exchange bug in there that a lot of our

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.289 
exchange bug in there that a lot of our
corporate<00:01:56.430> customers<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:56.969> hitting<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
corporate customers are hitting and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.080 
corporate customers are hitting and
that's<00:01:57.450> fixed<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.869> well<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> those<00:01:59.670> bugs<00:01:59.939> are

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that's fixed as well so those bugs are

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.190 
that's fixed as well so those bugs are
fixed<00:02:00.270> iOS<00:02:00.780> 4<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.079> out<00:02:02.630> 4.1<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.049> we

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
fixed iOS 4 is out 4.1 is out and we

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.830 
fixed iOS 4 is out 4.1 is out and we
recommend<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.890> every<00:02:05.100> iPhone<00:02:05.280> owner<00:02:05.840> update

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
recommend that every iPhone owner update

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.300 
recommend that every iPhone owner update
to<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:08.569> secondly<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.780> lot<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.770> people<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.129> told
