00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.370

 and here we have the flowers here is 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.730
 one is the other and the one of the paper 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.650
 reversible that we leave here 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.140
 here for example not nothing else we can 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.480
 make the flowers with the reversible paper 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.090
 here we use with the paper that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.209
 we returned the box we also made flowers 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.840
 check is the water is the reversible 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.709
 and there is the bright chevron then the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.799
 flowers are the same paper 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.720
 and apart I love it because it's glam and 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.060
 always goes to the forefront with all the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.890
 novel things that we can use to 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.750

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.120

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.190

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.079
 grabbed that already if they are complete but to 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.030
 I love to take them away that nothing else 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.160

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.620
 what is done 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.230
 this wrap with a detail that I'm 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.480
 speaking but it is that the mind is like that and 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.880
 see or show it so it's done 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.830
 well this way and we take away the 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.170
 excess of feathers we cut 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.680
 if we want it smaller or so 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.480
 So we put the silicone on it and it's 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.600

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.190
