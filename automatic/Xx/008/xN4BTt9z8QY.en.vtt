00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.580
 hello at garden gnome tv show today 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.720
 you need some screed one 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.870
 bucket with a spatula an old one 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.620
 fruit box holding foil a brush 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.420
 and watercolor painter tape pieces in the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
 Forest found a bit 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.440
 baking paper with a bulb socket 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.750
 power cable and cheap seal ok going on 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.750
 First, you're looking for the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.180
 most beautiful euro found mackerel out of me 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.280
 I already prepared then considered 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.470
 you how big the lamp should be 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.330
 Here we have the lamp for us 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.850
 this height decided you could without 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.409
 make shortly lamp and all falter 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.450
 this reason higher saw off but there 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.020
 Of course, there are none of your creativity 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.020
 borders 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.630
 we will become our strength 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:34.260
 madness there will be fast 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.440
 Now I'm drying the pieces 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.840
 lamp wet cloth and the crate first 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.350
 the patient's lamp will sound with 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.229
 in front 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.049
 develops nothing here with water 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.310
 come in next I dress the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.970
 fruit box with the foil out and one 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.970
 small cut gates same through fits 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 everything 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.000
 Now we need the foundation of 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.209
 lamp we need the concrete 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.209
 screed and the bucket fulfill about one 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.959
 last concrete to enter the box and 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:24.069
 the lamps are casting cables through the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.900
 slit through frimmel and the rest of the concrete 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.849
 about three quarters of the box high 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.830
 important tip not more if you 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.220
 immediately the substances are inserted then pushes 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.680
 the concrete good trick is still the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.630
 crate into corner then you can push 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.610
 the sticks to the walls at those 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.430
 If people can hold me you can 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.079
 also connect with tape so that the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.260
 all gets a bit of stability 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.319
 press the fingers on the concrete so that 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.150
 everything evenly distributed 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.160
 now it is only two days to wait 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.940
 until the concrete is properly dressed 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.709
 and another sebastian lampshade 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.160
 that just makes me passport more 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.160
 personnel 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.730
 Now a country could run out of the valley 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.420
 And if you do not like the concrete either 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.420
 with the same color
