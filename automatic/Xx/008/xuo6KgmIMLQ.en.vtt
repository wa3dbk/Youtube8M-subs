00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.830
 delirium the number of stalls depends 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.120
 how often have I been employees now 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.869

 sensor from with you as always driving evil 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.089
 volt and we continue practical needs from 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.249
 nothing in the last issue like you 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:21.939
 remember i suffered from a small crash 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.369
 district planet 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.990
 did not pass km 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.990
 facebook facebook.com 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.300
 thanks for the support 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.330
 but in this issue like me I promised well 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.989
 rose in carcasses in the next tragedy a 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.120
 us and hurried this cat day 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.760
 Now you will see that you have forgotten enter review 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.420
 on the counter so apologize for not having 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.379
 be her review so let's see what 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.379
 Well I run in a hurry to exchange 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.010
 and on the same day I was offered a very 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.180
 good trinity thanks to which i 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.920
 forgot the net is absurd hiring a cube but this 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.340
 it was worth it because this track literally saved 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.290
 me from that briefly from which I have not long 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.880
 could get out this gun loves to play and 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.370
 melee 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.360
 it is already interesting what kind of gun but then 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.360
 look 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.480
 and the next idea is to bring them about 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.290
 got the same but just start 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.929
 rakovsky and the quality is a little worn 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.179
 thanks to this gun I will go out on why and 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.419
 bad weapons but then let's do some 

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:05.270
 worse 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.799
 so take him your precious 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.799
 consider time 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.019
 and then it will be just a phenomenal three in 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.159
 which for once i go out to normal 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.739
 cannon 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.310
 which stable price is not true this 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.469
 over time he is a match Spartak but 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:48.279
 then 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.209
 real right from the factory let's 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 look at it of course sooner than 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.159
 and here's our show since the end but I want you 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.029
 something to say which will pass 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.239
 traditional way 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.200
 so I will be passing Kravchuk 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.609
 new weapon and when the oscars are bullshit something 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.549
 It seems in the price asatryana she managed 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.349
 get away from the nominal more than 100 still cannon 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.049
 if you were supposed to 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.169
 limits put your finger up under 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.359
 awarding showed historians friends 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.909
 all good luck two new commercials
