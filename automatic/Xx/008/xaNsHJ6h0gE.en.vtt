00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 I decided to make this videoblog to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.700
 help all the future clouds that I 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.950
 they continue and they hope that people 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.929
 that attend your wedding do not make mistakes 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.049
 at a time when they have invested 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.570
 time effort and even money or the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.400
 semar jose and that's why I present the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.340
 mistakes of the guests at weddings 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.859
 most common for you to post them in 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.770
 your social networks in a way indirect 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.280
 and everything is super clear 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.280
 Y 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.620
 and the people who are invited to a 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.690
 wedding men and women have to 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.030
 comply with certain rules of etiquette and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.879
 protocol that apply to you both before 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.609
 like during the big day but what are 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.250
 then I present 7 that to me 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.079
 seem to be the most important in 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.239
 as to the label the guests of the 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.549
 wedding have to comply with whatever comes 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.039
 established in limitation if there are doubts 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.170
 I invite you to review the video blog how 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.659
 dress up at a wedding so you do not mess up 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.899
 with the risk that the 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.000
 boyfriends for your event also in this 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:12.170
 point I want to emphasize the importance of 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.690
 that women no no no and can not go 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.750
 of white or any of its derivatives 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.289
 since it is a very bad one that I see bad 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.750
 bad attention to the bride as soon as 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.630
 Men can not be removed 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.610
 bag, let alone the tie during 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.799
 the feast of the voice that the invitation 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.640
 of well-specified fashion the legend 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.430
 no children for any reason you're going to 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.650
 happen to take them to weddings 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.960
 they are events for them and even less 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.270
 when the couple have decided not to take 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.180
 the 50 since there will be neither place nor 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.860
 food for your children and not the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.280
 you can take a luncheon though lessons 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.440
 you will be fatal and uncomfortable you give to the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.600
 boyfriends the tickets of the invitations 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.030
 are included for the purpose of indicating 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.070
 how many people are required by each 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.080
 invitation an error that commonly 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.540
 make the wedding guests is 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.660
 Ask the new ones for an extra or worse 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.550
 even more for your companion or each 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.530
 place at weddings costs so what 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.840
 better is that you save yourself the bad taste of 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.570
 commit such action and you adjust to what 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.670
 that the bride and groom have designated having 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.440
 it was more than clear that the places of 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.230
 each guest cost you will have to 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.970
 confirm your attendance in the way 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.370
 Grooms request that the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.920
 invitation either by phone or via 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.739
 mail in addition to confirm is because it is 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.110
 sure or safe that I can shake is a 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.989
 disrespect to say that you will go and not 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.900
 arrives therefore if you confirmed and at the end 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.460
 for the same reason you will not be able to go 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.920
 correct will be cancel 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.230
 with a minimum of two weeks before the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.210
 voice in relation to the wedding gift there 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.100
 several points to take into account so that 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.370
 the guests do not make mistakes 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.830
 Regarding this theme 1 the gift that 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.440
 buy has to be equivalent or 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.540
 proportional to the covered of the banquet in 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.600
 other words to what your place costs 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.550
 at wedding 2 also always have to 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.890
 take into account the number of people 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.540
 who are inviting the nox for example 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.390
 if they are inviting you with your partner 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.330
 then you must multiply said 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.080
 equivalent by 2 and not by 1 I mean 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.120
 3 yes, if the pump will be able to 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.540
 place where the guests receive 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.580
 then it is allowed not to give a gift anymore 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.950
 who will be spending to go to the wedding or 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.430
 give a small detail in the manner of 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.640
 thanks 4 if the bride and groom put a 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.310
 gift table please choose 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.030
 and give something from there and not what you get 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.180
 happen or what you decide h5 to the wedding 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.280
 it does not come with a gift it has to be 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.220
 sent to the groom's house 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.860
 of the bride according to the relationship you have 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.750
 with each one 6 if for no reason no 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.330
 gives you time to buy a gift before 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.140
 of the wedding, make sure you do it later 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.450
 and not being 7 if you are invited to a wedding and 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.520
 you can not go no matter it will always be 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.980
 gift to thank the invitation 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.530
 Wedding guests should say no to 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.870
 the punctuality if the punctuality is not 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.579
 your strong then organize yourself not to arrive 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.680
 to the wedding when all the guests 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.109
 go in the second time of the banquet 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.120
 I still do not understand why several 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.820
 guests think that jumping from the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.580
 wedding ceremony is as normal 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.050
 let's see if we deepen the reason for the 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.419
 weddings has to do with the couple 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.030
 decide to commit and join as 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.680
 husband and wife then why not be 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.020
 participant from the moment so 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.910
 important of the couple but yes the 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.979
 attitude at the party can not miss 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.530
 true if any of your guests or 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.440
 wedding guests jump before two 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.780
 mistakes answers do not tell me what 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.480
 says Maria Jose, blame me 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.490
