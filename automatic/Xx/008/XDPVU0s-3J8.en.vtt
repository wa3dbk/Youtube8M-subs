00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
on Beethoven's mrs. Salinas this is a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.780 
on Beethoven's mrs. Salinas this is a
piece<00:00:21.350> with<00:00:21.620> terrific<00:00:21.920> challenges<00:00:22.580> for

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
piece with terrific challenges for

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.810 
piece with terrific challenges for
orchestras<00:00:23.360> and<00:00:23.980> choruses<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.040> the<00:00:25.279> soloists

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
orchestras and choruses and the soloists

orchestras and choruses and the soloists
and<00:00:26.000> also<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:26.840> conductor<00:00:27.550> but<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:28.580> think<00:00:29.000> it's

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
and also the conductor but I think it's

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.580 
and also the conductor but I think it's
a<00:00:29.270> piece<00:00:29.450> because<00:00:29.900> of<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:30.050> challenges<00:00:30.410> maybe

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
a piece because of the challenges maybe

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.080 
a piece because of the challenges maybe
it's<00:00:30.860> a<00:00:30.950> piece<00:00:31.130> that<00:00:31.160> really<00:00:31.760> brings<00:00:31.970> a

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
it's a piece that really brings a

00:00:32.090 --> 00:01:02.400 
it's a piece that really brings a
musical<00:00:32.450> community<00:00:32.900> together

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.840 

it's<00:01:03.410> always<00:01:03.680> terrifically<00:01:04.100> exciting<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:04.730> get

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
it's always terrifically exciting to get

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.090 
it's always terrifically exciting to get
to<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.090> stage<00:01:05.360> where<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:06.530> orchestra<00:01:06.950> is

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
to the stage where the orchestra is

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.100 
to the stage where the orchestra is
almost<00:01:07.550> ready<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.390> chorus<00:01:08.690> really<00:01:08.960> knows

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
almost ready and the chorus really knows

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.700 
almost ready and the chorus really knows
what<00:01:09.290> they're<00:01:09.440> doing

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
what they're doing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.280 
what they're doing
and<00:01:10.010> we<00:01:10.550> start<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:10.970> fold<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.480> soloists<00:01:11.960> into

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
and we start to fold the soloists into

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.490 
and we start to fold the soloists into
the<00:01:12.410> whole<00:01:12.530> picture<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:13.970> start<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.500> see

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
the whole picture and you start to see

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.720 
the whole picture and you start to see
that<00:01:15.650> potentially<00:01:16.190> if<00:01:16.280> something<00:01:16.550> really

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
that potentially if something really

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:42.080 
that potentially if something really
terrific<00:01:16.850> is<00:01:17.120> going<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.330> happen

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.550 

one<00:01:43.090> great<00:01:43.390> thing<00:01:43.450> about<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:43.900> piece<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.170> it's

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
one great thing about this piece is it's

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.679 
one great thing about this piece is it's
just<00:01:44.619> not<00:01:44.799> performed<00:01:45.430> very<00:01:45.640> much<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:46.659> I

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
just not performed very much and so I

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.530 
just not performed very much and so I
think<00:01:46.869> listeners<00:01:47.380> walk<00:01:47.590> into<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> hall<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
think listeners walk into a hall and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.200 
think listeners walk into a hall and
don't<00:01:50.409> quite<00:01:50.680> know<00:01:50.860> what<00:01:51.040> to<00:01:51.070> expect<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:52.030> so

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
don't quite know what to expect and so

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.520 
don't quite know what to expect and so
they're<00:01:52.360> able<00:01:52.450> to<00:01:52.570> hear<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.840> with<00:01:52.930> fresh<00:01:53.200> ears

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
they're able to hear it with fresh ears

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.590 
they're able to hear it with fresh ears
unlike<00:01:54.310> perhaps<00:01:54.790> if<00:01:55.090> they<00:01:55.210> were<00:01:55.270> going<00:01:55.509> to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
unlike perhaps if they were going to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.940 
unlike perhaps if they were going to
hear<00:01:55.689> Beethoven's<00:01:56.080> fifth<00:01:56.290> symphony<00:01:56.350> or<00:01:56.830> his

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
hear Beethoven's fifth symphony or his

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.310 
hear Beethoven's fifth symphony or his
ninth<00:01:57.159> symphony<00:01:57.600> which<00:01:58.600> everybody<00:01:59.140> has<00:01:59.289> a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
ninth symphony which everybody has a

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.710 
ninth symphony which everybody has a
conception<00:01:59.950> of<00:02:00.070> but<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.970> missus<00:02:01.210> alumnus<00:02:01.570> is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
conception of but the missus alumnus is

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.480 
conception of but the missus alumnus is
so<00:02:01.869> full<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.140> surprises<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:02.950> I<00:02:03.130> think<00:02:03.399> it

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
so full of surprises that I think it

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.760 
so full of surprises that I think it
really<00:02:03.520> helps<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.149> try<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.140> hear<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.470> as<00:02:05.619> if

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
really helps to try and hear it as if

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.279 
really helps to try and hear it as if
the<00:02:06.369> ink<00:02:06.549> was<00:02:06.729> still<00:02:06.820> wet<00:02:06.970> on<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.360> page<00:02:07.570> as<00:02:07.869> we

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
the ink was still wet on the page as we

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.469 
the ink was still wet on the page as we
say<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:09.610> you're<00:02:09.849> hearing<00:02:10.119> for<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.330> very

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
say and and you're hearing for the very

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:36.750 
say and and you're hearing for the very
first<00:02:10.630> time

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.819
