00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.790
 was the match against hungary 6 3 profit 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.720
 very good first think of a somewhat lesser second team share your opinion or 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.339
 not 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.249
 yes well this will look like you so see the results as you see here yourself 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.790
 run 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.639
 you see goal-created things that you have trained 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.409
 and in maine variant with our goalkeeper 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:24.769
 share comes and that at that moment it indeed leads to the public 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.689
 Amsterdam moment about March 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.179
 and those two dalers, each other than other eu countries with a colleague of course 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.480
 would gain and see could fall 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.469
 next to an 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.170
 International preparation for the World Cup was a very special competition 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.650
 countings 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.990
 and it was the game that the shortage could be brussels and that me 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.019
 also become happy and so I am very happy to and 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.109
 As a result, of course, hey and I am happy that he finally has the confidence of one 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.140
 of the players got a chance to do this and also from technical staff because the 

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:55.729
 the size of the to achieve because I think it is still a big ict 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.630
 how many matches again 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.659
 the federal administration make this storm 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.770
 I mean that 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.810
 what are those for the start of the wk in three weeks 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.640
 Well that of course says nothing at all by a man 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.400
 of course we look after that game it was weather to come from a team 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.570
 know how that works We know there is a heavy word 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.310
 and some about how we are going to approach that 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.880
 I just once saw a colleague also all of course do a lot more to 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.619
 achieve more than just a final result tiles of course will by cows more 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.759
 drop results where they set more goals for personal development 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.310
 of the players it is about the development because that is not on such a wk yes 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.240
 bye 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.680
 just be able to grow in it is still just under three weeks from the eca it 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.160
 work to arrive 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.350
 the worse last year 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.479
 very naturally play the work because it is really rows 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.390
 weekly along the lotto arena so it was really bad if we didn't have that 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.350
 had 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.070
 yes now I am happy both were then the silver cup with the characters 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.210
 not start soon enough 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.340
 what do you have thoughts then 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.610
 yes, of course, I also hope to be able to stunt when nuisance is caused 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.800
 but is orange when the team I see now we just think way too much 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.610
 asked 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.469
 a highlight in my eyes 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.449
 or are we still coming 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.499
 well of course the foundations 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:16.569
 anp it can be worse it can go in all directions there had nice yes highlights 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.459
 has this yet 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.399
 if a long time comes 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:22.690
 maybe with antwerp 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.289
 maybe Antwerp own in Belgium or something 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.069
 it is still a nice people the focal point
