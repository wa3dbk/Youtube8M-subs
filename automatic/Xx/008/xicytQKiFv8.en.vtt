question that I get over the internet it
is<00:00:10.920> dr.<00:00:11.670> Becker<00:00:11.849> what's<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> difference

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
is dr. Becker what's the difference

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.890 
is dr. Becker what's the difference
between<00:00:12.750> an<00:00:13.380> open<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.610> closed<00:00:14.940> rhinoplasty

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
between an open and a closed rhinoplasty

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.429 
between an open and a closed rhinoplasty
and<00:00:16.109> how<00:00:16.410> do<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.650> decide<00:00:16.980> which<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.760> do<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
and how do you decide which one to do a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.279 
and how do you decide which one to do a
closed<00:00:19.439> rhinoplasty<00:00:20.310> refers<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.289> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
closed rhinoplasty refers to a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.710 
closed rhinoplasty refers to a
rhinoplasty<00:00:22.920> where<00:00:23.430> all<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.970> incisions<00:00:24.359> are

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
rhinoplasty where all the incisions are

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870 
rhinoplasty where all the incisions are
hidden<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.800> inside<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> nose<00:00:26.550> so

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
hidden on the inside of the nose so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.349 
hidden on the inside of the nose so
there<00:00:27.449> are<00:00:27.570> no<00:00:27.810> visible<00:00:28.230> incisions<00:00:29.099> an<00:00:29.359> open

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
there are no visible incisions an open

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.870 
there are no visible incisions an open
rhinoplasty<00:00:30.859> is<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.279> which<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
rhinoplasty is one in which all the

rhinoplasty is one in which all the
incisions<00:00:33.390> are<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.840> inside<00:00:34.020> except<00:00:34.800> for

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
incisions are on the inside except for

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.240 
incisions are on the inside except for
one<00:00:35.280> tiny<00:00:36.000> incision<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.590> outside<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
one tiny incision on the outside of the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.549 
one tiny incision on the outside of the
nose<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.059> skin<00:00:39.480> between<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.410> nostrils

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
nose on the skin between your nostrils

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.790 
nose on the skin between your nostrils
on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.430> kaalia<00:00:41.910> Mella<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.420> say<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.500> tiny

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
on the kaalia Mella I say it's tiny

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.610 
on the kaalia Mella I say it's tiny
really<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.059> about<00:00:45.180> four<00:00:45.600> millimeters<00:00:45.930> long

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
really it's about four millimeters long

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
really it's about four millimeters long
it's<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.370> 1/10<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.090> an<00:00:48.210> inch<00:00:48.329> long

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it's about 1/10 of an inch long

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.889 
it's about 1/10 of an inch long
I<00:00:49.020> think<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:49.800> small<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.480> some<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
I think that's small but to some that

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.060 
I think that's small but to some that
can<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.199> very<00:00:52.410> daunting

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
can be very daunting

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.100 
can be very daunting
I<00:00:53.100> wouldn't<00:00:53.640> necessarily<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:54.539> an<00:00:54.719> incision

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
I wouldn't necessarily want an incision

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.990 
I wouldn't necessarily want an incision
on<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> outside<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.770> my<00:00:55.920> nose<00:00:56.129> unless<00:00:56.460> there

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
on the outside of my nose unless there

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.360 
on the outside of my nose unless there
was<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> reason<00:00:57.620> well<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> can't<00:00:58.949> tell<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
was a reason well I can't tell you that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880 
was a reason well I can't tell you that
that<00:00:59.520> incision<00:01:00.000> heals<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:01.020> beautifully<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that incision heals very beautifully and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.009 
that incision heals very beautifully and
is<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.309> difficult<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.879> notice<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
is very difficult to notice and the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.160 
is very difficult to notice and the
decision<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> proceed<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:06.150> an<00:01:06.299> open<00:01:06.810> or

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
decision to proceed with an open or

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.070 
decision to proceed with an open or
closed<00:01:07.680> rhinoplasty<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.810> make

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
closed rhinoplasty is one that I make

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
closed rhinoplasty is one that I make
together<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> patient<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.400> was<00:01:11.640> trained

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
together with the patient I was trained

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.990 
together with the patient I was trained
in<00:01:12.420> both<00:01:12.630> open<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.350> closed<00:01:13.950> rhinoplasty<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
in both open and closed rhinoplasty and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.710 
in both open and closed rhinoplasty and
I<00:01:15.119> continue<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:15.990> both<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:17.220> decision<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.509> do

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
I continue to do both the decision to do

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.109 
I continue to do both the decision to do
one<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> other<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:20.040> based<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.700> technical

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
one or the other is based on technical

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.570 
one or the other is based on technical
factors<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:22.290> depends<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.799> what's<00:01:23.100> wrong<00:01:23.369> with

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
factors it depends on what's wrong with

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.600 
factors it depends on what's wrong with
your<00:01:23.759> nose<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.720> needs<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.350> done

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
your nose and what needs to be done

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.819 
your nose and what needs to be done
there<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.790> certain<00:01:27.270> things<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.990> rhinoplasty

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
there are certain things in rhinoplasty

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.880 
there are certain things in rhinoplasty
that<00:01:29.479> quite<00:01:30.479> frankly<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:31.140> probably<00:01:31.619> better

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that quite frankly are probably better

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.950 
that quite frankly are probably better
done<00:01:32.220> through<00:01:33.180> an<00:01:33.299> open<00:01:33.780> rhinoplasty

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
done through an open rhinoplasty

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.410 
done through an open rhinoplasty
approach<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:36.090> things<00:01:36.329> in

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
approach and there are some things in

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.149 
approach and there are some things in
rhinoplasty<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.110> makes<00:01:37.470> sense<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.950> do

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
rhinoplasty that makes sense to do

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.429 
rhinoplasty that makes sense to do
through<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> closed<00:01:39.150> rhinoplasty<00:01:39.869> approach<00:01:40.200> of

through a closed rhinoplasty approach of

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.550 
through a closed rhinoplasty approach of
course<00:01:41.009> there's<00:01:41.220> some<00:01:41.400> overlap<00:01:41.820> where

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
course there's some overlap where

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.270 
course there's some overlap where
there'd<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.680> an<00:01:43.770> honest<00:01:44.130> disagreement

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
there'd be an honest disagreement

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.910 
there'd be an honest disagreement
between<00:01:44.909> surgeons<00:01:45.450> where<00:01:45.810> some<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.590> tend

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
between surgeons where some would tend

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.429 
between surgeons where some would tend
to<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> open<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.479> some<00:01:48.930> would<00:01:49.140> tend<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
to do it open and some would tend to

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.940 
to do it open and some would tend to
take<00:01:49.740> care<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.100> problem<00:01:50.250> closed<00:01:51.740> but<00:01:52.740> in

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
take care of that problem closed but in

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.170 
take care of that problem closed but in
general<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.270> technical<00:01:55.049> factors<00:01:55.710> will<00:01:56.549> guide

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
general the technical factors will guide

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.260 
general the technical factors will guide
the<00:01:57.479> decision<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:59.520> answer<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> question
