00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.670
 I am here in my old one 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.570
 Limestone quarry in the Bergisch land and in the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.210
 It would be just right 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.789
 setting for a suv or suvs 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.340
 But test times to be honest 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.390
 Suvs are usually not in such a way 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 driven a terrain 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.470
 That is why it also means something new 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.840
 Ford second generation ball 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.519
 he has to prove it on the street and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.519
 exactly when I will go back now 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.409
 the two liter tested by us 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.300
 diesel engine with 120 kilowatts of power 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.159
 and four-wheel drive costs in Germany 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.559
 around 32,000 euros 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:49.079
 He is the top model among the diesel 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.030
 versions of the four-cylinder turbodiesel 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.789
 accelerates the ford kuga thanks to one 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.710
 torque of 340 newton meters 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.399
 powerful and confident in 9 9 seconds 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.649
 achieves the compact suv tempo 100 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.689
 no later than at 198 km h is the end 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.789
 with the acceleration the values are in 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.789
 but not outstanding 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 as expected that every size 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.780
 diesel engine very powerful and that 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.010
 overall driving behavior in the second 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.270
 generation is also very satisfied 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.510
 of course, here is the co2 emissions 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.160
 Of course, not optimal with 154 grams 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.260
 co2 per kilometer 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.820
 but who a little more environmentally friendly 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.460
 of course wants to be on the move 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.850
 to the smaller engine and is always with it 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.440
 still very fast on the way 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.950
 the security continues with the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.000
 cougar sets new standards up to twelve 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.710
 Assistance systems can be ordered 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.230
 from the lane assistant with 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.570
 fatigue warning to the active city 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.570
 stop system and parking assistants 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.440
 we have cockpit here in the ford kuga 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.900
 again many buttons in the middle fittings 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.910
 but everyone is up for this 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.470
 auto interested or bought it at all 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.110
 had pressed the button once 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.150
 have and then know where which functions 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.710
 is and during the ride you need 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.720
 just a fraction of it 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.710
 and thus the distraction is only 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.710
 relatively large 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.570
 another small point of criticism 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.180
 maybe next to the many buttons 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.460
 that the display of the navis in comparison 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.340
 to the display of a cell phone clearly 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.020
 is smaller and here should be gone 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.720
 maybe worth a little more 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.520
 The size make it easier to read 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.560
 is and so less confusion occurs 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.780
 the design of the new ford kuga is clear 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.850
 and elegantly gives the line guidance 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.210
 the compact suv a sporty and 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.480
 Robust appear the bonnet is 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.480
 stronger than the first generation 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.480
 contoured 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.140
 The new kuka is 8.1 inches longer 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.209
 eight millimeters flatter and 4 mm 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.400
 narrower than the predecessor what is in 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.959
 larger space and smaller 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.959
 drag is reflected 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.110
 we can see the rising here 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.840
 shoulder straps ami the a-pillar the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.910
 clear b-pillar the c-pillar but 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.390
 It will be real here at the d pillar 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.890
 confusing if you sit indoors 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.370
 the visible area starts almost here 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.340
 on 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.080
 with her is that black and we have 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.970
 here in the area a dead angle 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.960
 where you can not see that means children 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.520
 which are smaller than one meter 20 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.540
 about are just not seen 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.850
 not perceived 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.070
 unless you are lucky that you from the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.410
 park sense so be recognized or you 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.520
 also the rear view camera sees then is 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.140
 that no longer a problem 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.940
 without getting your hands dirty 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.910
 I can open the trunk 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.230
 with the help of a foot third and that works 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.980
 completely automatically to the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.180
 sensor-controlled tailgate 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.700
 but only for an additional charge 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.620
 included 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.090
 the eight centimeters more carriage length 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.760
 can be found here among others in the 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.620
 footwell of the passengers again the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.940
 both front seats are whole 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.130
 still going back here 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.050
 a good twelve inches square and the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.190
 Backrest is still only possible 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.620
 Split two fold if you both 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.730
 fold back seat backs widens 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.620
 the traffic jams can reach from 481 to 1653 liters 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.690
 loading volume 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.090
 my conclusion to the second generation ford 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.340
 kuga the new face is good for him 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.510
 it is even more angular and more masculine 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.310
 even more succinct the 120 kw diesel engine 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.750
 is not the greenest one now 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.790
 but if you maybe a high one 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.770
 Trailer would like to drive or pull 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.900
 you want the performance 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.510
 otherwise you can go ecologically on the way 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.850
 his and just the next or one 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.050
 from the petrol engines and also you can 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.050
 then save even cash
