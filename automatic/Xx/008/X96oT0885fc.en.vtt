00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.680
 Tomorrow he wants to be in the following year it is called 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.909
 Answer "We in the team report one 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.909
 Mophie Juice Traffic is both 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.509
 Janko 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.279
 the already 100 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.360
 who has not seen the videos yet 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.620
 Carstensen himself 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.490
 you can again customers here 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.680
 and when I return to my brief review in December his favor of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.680
 public interest 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.620
 calmly 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.950
 in principle 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.440
 I am Sam Worthington myself even 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.900
 you have Dynamo Kyiv Speyer that I have in mind I have on Black Friday 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.040
 last very clearly what bought 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.549
 looks like this is 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.710
 in a clear 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.880
 as a teenager to solve itself must be increased 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.640
 us municipalities are still users 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.020
 otherwise we have here 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.060
 and takes 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.270
 the plug to charge the on-off switch 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.959
 No recesses extra per ounce led the groups and also speakers 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.750
 here is OK 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.750
 and every game they advertised the cuts in the euro 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.370
 live the whole is a 2 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.370
 in the middle is 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.330
 then on the other side I have that in a section optics 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.109
 Gran Canaria 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.560
 APAs are already in the month 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.840
 also down here 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.140
 the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.090
 to charge the plug to charge a power switch 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.020
 and here too 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 to which should be the state of charge 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.750
 from then on any cubic already 100 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.070
 that's it 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.309
 I somehow have the close season 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.309
 just like Bayern Morgan Chase traffic 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.389
 at two decided is grouped 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:17.849
 easy to open 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.849
 Here again extra recesses 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:26.099
 Speaker uncoordinated here too, which is only in English 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:28.459
 as the last rider 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.779
 so in direct comparison 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:32.369
 no big underweight 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.289
 the big difference is a car 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.409
 if anyone cares what that is 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
 and you feel that the animal is approved 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.769
 around 10 o'clock St 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.659
 is very exhausting 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:45.899
 and here 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.679
 Bensheim is omitted 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:53.529
 Maybe it comes from reads that there speakers and microphone are used 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.109
 can 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.729
 and that they had to spend more energy on them all the frost again 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.139
 to get 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.129
 because that's just something 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.269
 wait until Tonight Show Case is all that rarely sees Hülsta number 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.429
 can see minutes out 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:16.029
 and also removing Crysis Super Lawn 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.979
 so for me 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.979
 I can only say that that compares directly 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.819
 Niko better off 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.429
 Mayer h easier in invest and Günther Metzger is and how 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.569
 especially important that CD 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.129
 what I showed you here in the video who has not seen this looks at you 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.229
 to make a video 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.159
 so in direct comparison 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.619
 wins the first ascent for me 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.279
 the interests of timpani is 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.279
 even though ending the Movie Plus is bad 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.100
 Problem posed to motives he is still in full swing 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.929
 the striking make manufacturer specifications 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.819
 the whole now specially for the 3d 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.189
 at the Alkotest people in my opinion if I'm properly informed 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.009
 Frame fork 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.210
 that is also for Austria 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.079
 table space 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.079
 King 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.519
 Well that was the tip to compare, he reports Vitus 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:13.629
 surgeries 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.590
 until then 31 not yet the scheme alone does not survive 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:27.670
 is that the marriages 1 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.279
 that was nothing 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.279
 Bonn whether hereditary prince 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:35.440
 there are already a few percent 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.409
 regensburg 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.020
 behaves similarly 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.849
 Zingst the NPD 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.419
 in trade 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.419
 for you just show yourself 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.280
 so right
