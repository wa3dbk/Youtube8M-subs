garden now the buzzword at the moment is
sustainability<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.180> garden<00:00:57.420> certainly

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
sustainability and this garden certainly

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.830 
sustainability and this garden certainly
is<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.430> levels<00:00:59.760> if<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.539> wanted

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
is that on all levels if I wanted

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.299 
is that on all levels if I wanted
something<00:01:01.079> she<00:01:01.410> could<00:01:01.559> garden<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.070> all

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
something she could garden in all

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.609 
something she could garden in all
year-round<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> results<00:01:04.470> are

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
year-round and I think the results are

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
year-round and I think the results are
just<00:01:05.159> brilliant<00:01:05.640> you've<00:01:05.970> got<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> come<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
just brilliant you've got to come and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.480 
just brilliant you've got to come and
visit<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:07.020> yourself<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> something<00:01:08.340> you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
visit for yourself and something you

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.359 
visit for yourself and something you
would<00:01:08.670> never<00:01:09.000> expect<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> backyard

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
aerated back to the fish I came up with

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
aerated back to the fish I came up with
this<00:01:33.689> idea<00:01:33.930> because<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.619> wanted<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.250> healthy

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
this idea because I wanted a healthy

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.660 
this idea because I wanted a healthy
alternative<00:01:36.380> with<00:01:37.380> no<00:01:37.590> waste<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.579> the

alternative with no waste and with the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
alternative with no waste and with the
aquaponic<00:01:39.299> system<00:01:39.810> traditionally<00:01:40.740> in

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
aquaponic system traditionally in

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.069 
aquaponic system traditionally in
aquaculture<00:01:41.430> what<00:01:42.299> would<00:01:42.450> happen<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.810> lot<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
aquaculture what would happen a lot of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.620 
aquaculture what would happen a lot of
water<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.560> wasted<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> be

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
water was wasted and then have to be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
water was wasted and then have to be
replaced<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.470> new<00:01:46.500> water<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.700> system

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
replaced with new water in this system

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.539 
replaced with new water in this system
it's<00:01:48.560> recirculated<00:01:49.560> through<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.040> grow<00:01:50.220> beds

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and with hydroponics as well you have to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969 
and with hydroponics as well you have to
add<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> lot<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.240> chemical<00:01:54.750> nutrients<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.680> is

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
add a lot of chemical nutrients which is

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.920 
add a lot of chemical nutrients which is
something<00:01:56.250> I'm<00:01:56.549> trying<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.090> avoid<00:01:57.329> these<00:01:57.630> days

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
something I'm trying to avoid these days

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.230 
something I'm trying to avoid these days
so<00:01:58.560> once<00:01:59.070> you've<00:01:59.280> spent<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> money<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
so once you've spent the money on the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.830 
so once you've spent the money on the
system

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
system

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
system
there's<00:02:01.229> no<00:02:01.500> ongoing<00:02:01.860> cost<00:02:02.490> other<00:02:02.820> than<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
there's no ongoing cost other than the
