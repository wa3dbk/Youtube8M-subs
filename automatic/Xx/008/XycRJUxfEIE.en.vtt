and after the patch so i feel like i got
a<00:01:37.829> good<00:01:38.040> idea<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.640> what<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.600> sort<00:01:39.780> did<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.110> it

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
and focus on keeping getting more kills

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.800

than<00:02:15.159> my<00:02:15.310> gun<00:02:15.519> I<00:02:15.730> don't<00:02:16.060> like<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.299> have<00:02:16.750> to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
than my gun I don't like to have to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.720 
than my gun I don't like to have to
control<00:02:17.290> my<00:02:17.470> kill<00:02:17.650> streak<00:02:17.890> because<00:02:18.549> that<00:02:18.700> just

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
control my kill streak because that just

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.259 
control my kill streak because that just
limits<00:02:19.239> how<00:02:19.360> much<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.780> owning<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.709> can<00:02:20.860> do<00:02:21.269> but

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
limits how much like owning I can do but

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.070 
limits how much like owning I can do but
anyways<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.140> before<00:02:23.890> patch<00:02:24.450> awesome<00:02:25.450> gun<00:02:25.629> post

extremely powerful I mean you'll see in

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.369 
extremely powerful I mean you'll see in
this<00:02:30.010> video<00:02:30.129> it<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.209> didn't<00:02:31.569> get<00:02:31.659> nerfed<00:02:31.989> that

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
this video it it didn't get nerfed that

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.580 
this video it it didn't get nerfed that
hard<00:02:32.650> on<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:34.120> exact<00:02:34.720> details<00:02:35.110> from<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.349> patch

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
hard on the exact details from the patch

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.979 
hard on the exact details from the patch
notes<00:02:35.620> are<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.700> all<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.269> SMGs<00:02:37.690> had<00:02:37.870> their

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
notes are that all the SMGs had their

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.020 
notes are that all the SMGs had their
hipfire<00:02:38.349> recoil<00:02:38.829> increased<00:02:39.159> their<00:02:39.640> hip<00:02:39.819> fire

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
hipfire recoil increased their hip fire

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.809 
hipfire recoil increased their hip fire
spread<00:02:40.060> increase<00:02:40.540> from<00:02:40.870> 4.75<00:02:41.769> 25<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.489> their

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
spread increase from 4.75 25 and their

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.509 
spread increase from 4.75 25 and their
bullet<00:02:43.060> penetration<00:02:43.860> reduced<00:02:44.860> which<00:02:45.370> was

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
bullet penetration reduced which was

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.309 
bullet penetration reduced which was
like<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.849> think<00:02:46.090> Banda<00:02:46.420> heart<00:02:46.599> went<00:02:47.019> weeded

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
like I think Banda heart went weeded

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.990 
like I think Banda heart went weeded
about<00:02:47.470> earlier<00:02:47.819> but<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.910> MSMC<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.780> pw<00:02:50.260> t<00:02:50.379> 7

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
about earlier but the MSMC in pw t 7

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.280 
about earlier but the MSMC in pw t 7
specifically<00:02:52.000> had<00:02:52.150> their<00:02:52.329> recoil<00:02:52.720> increased

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
specifically had their recoil increased

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.030 
specifically had their recoil increased
slightly<00:02:53.500> now<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:55.269> pdw-57<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:56.290> noticed<00:02:56.890> it

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
slightly now the pdw-57 I noticed it

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.280 
slightly now the pdw-57 I noticed it
definitely<00:02:57.609> while<00:02:58.299> aiming<00:02:58.510> down<00:02:58.690> sights<00:02:58.750> I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
definitely while aiming down sights I

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.899 
definitely while aiming down sights I
mean<00:02:59.500> before<00:02:59.709> it<00:03:00.010> was<00:03:00.069> just<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.310> laser<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:00.849> it

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
mean before it was just a laser and it

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.190 
mean before it was just a laser and it
still<00:03:01.120> kind<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.510> but<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.720> was<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:02.079> was

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
still kind of is but it was it was

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.869 
still kind of is but it was it was
definitely<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.739> laser<00:03:02.980> before<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.549> open

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
definitely a laser before and the open

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.059 
definitely a laser before and the open
sights<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:04.329> are<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.690> beautiful<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.349> could<00:03:05.890> I

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
sights on it are so beautiful I could I

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.130 
sights on it are so beautiful I could I
can<00:03:06.310> find<00:03:06.519> an<00:03:06.609> extremely<00:03:07.239> extremely<00:03:07.690> easy<00:03:08.019> to

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
can find an extremely extremely easy to

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.170 
can find an extremely extremely easy to
aim<00:03:08.349> with<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.799> I<00:03:09.190> could<00:03:09.340> kill<00:03:09.549> kids<00:03:09.790> across

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
aim with and I could kill kids across

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.720 
aim with and I could kill kids across
the<00:03:10.420> map<00:03:10.599> no<00:03:10.959> problem<00:03:11.379> now<00:03:11.920> there's<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.459> little

the map no problem now there's a little

the map no problem now there's a little
bit<00:03:12.940> more<00:03:13.150> recoil<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.690> not<00:03:13.900> I'm<00:03:14.200> like<00:03:14.650> you

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
bit more recoil it's not I'm like you

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.259 
bit more recoil it's not I'm like you
know<00:03:14.799> I'm<00:03:14.980> bearable<00:03:15.519> but<00:03:15.819> it's<00:03:16.000> it's

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
know I'm bearable but it's it's

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.580 
know I'm bearable but it's it's
definitely<00:03:16.720> noticeable<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.139> think<00:03:17.410> it's<00:03:17.530> a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
definitely noticeable I think it's a

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.440 
definitely noticeable I think it's a
good<00:03:17.709> thing<00:03:17.919> I<00:03:18.099> haven't<00:03:18.370> tried<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.609> MSMC<00:03:19.030> yet

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.539 
good thing I haven't tried the MSMC yet
I<00:03:19.660> think<00:03:20.139> that's<00:03:20.260> an<00:03:20.380> amazing<00:03:20.620> smg2<00:03:21.099> it's

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
I think that's an amazing smg2 it's

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.920 
I think that's an amazing smg2 it's
pretty<00:03:21.700> much<00:03:21.790> all<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.030> use<00:03:22.269> in<00:03:22.419> league<00:03:22.540> platform

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
pretty much all I use in league platform

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.349 
pretty much all I use in league platform
is<00:03:22.989> in<00:03:23.079> an<00:03:23.169> SMG<00:03:23.760> definitely<00:03:24.760> try<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.940> later<00:03:25.150> but

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
is in an SMG definitely try to later but

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.539

for the pw i noticed the recoil you know
increase<00:03:27.970> definitely<00:03:28.780> as<00:03:29.650> for<00:03:29.859> the<00:03:29.950> hipfire

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129
