00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello you love I turn you today 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.600
 again a video and I ate 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.610
 start directly with this product 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.500
 I've just had that in one lately 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.929
 Wood is called the so-called jato soja spray cream 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.820
 So a spray cream I found it completely 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.520
 funny shown the 30 the video I have 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.830
 you had a few times before 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.609
 have quite a lot of communities because of that 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.289
 that at some point I will not do it anymore 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.670
 spraying can be very much product 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.310
 then you keep that in it 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.570
 would have and so on and I can 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.160
 somehow not understand 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.329
 I have these experiences I made 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.070
 she had a few times as I said 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.540
 they always went completely empty with me 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.090
 I never had any problems with it 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.050
 I have some people already 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.520
 rausbekommt simply times the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.950
 wrong storage was because here stands 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.000
 Also several times on the logo on it product 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.370
 does not need cooling 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.500
 if the fridge is only there head 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.020
 overlay and emerge in the back 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.449
 explicitly on it the cream can be 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.850
 If cool, just spray it cumbersome 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.989
 the cows then 15 then at least 15 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.449
 minutes before use out of the fridge 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.399
 Of course you use wrong to apply 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.820
 yes somehow blame myself I can only 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.040
 say with me has worked great and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.140
 the tastes really great so I think 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.090
 it tastes like normal spray cream 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.430
 So I do not notice a difference now 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.509
 will not taste soy or something 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.950
 I think it just tastes like whole 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.500
 normal spray cream I have to stop for 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.850
 for decorating desserts or for 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.439
 cake or what do I know so if you 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.030
 So just use spray cream 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.430
 I can absolutely recommend it 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.830
 i had the now from edeka and had 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.960
 so no problem 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.490
 I had a battery again at any time 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.410
 I am here every so many years 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.900
 also and edeka the chives 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.510
 charlotte spread that is solactive 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.220
 imitated I think I'm really great 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.690
 he thinks he tastes like fresh cheese 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.040
 right taste still in memory 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.450
 I've been with her for a while 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.670
 me the last time animal 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.990
 I have eaten products but I find it 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.590
 tastes possible so a really nice 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.010
 herbal cream cheese then spread too 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.540
 for 3 billion times empty of n 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.120
 Joy of daring bold android the sylter 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.370
 the rafting is vegan and 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.970
 gluten free with vegan lungs and everything 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.700
 here and there 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.619
 and here it is a dressing should be kind 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.110
 and really tastes gigantic 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.140
 really good what I honestly say 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.580
 a bit disturbing is that there again 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.570
 on the first, second, third, fourth place 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.520
 sugar is already in it so it is 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.670
 tastes really good but I only 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.370
 towards us because I was still painting one 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.709
 and from el cambio the gun barrel 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.870
 spread that is a plastic one 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.030
 bread spread with sea salt refined 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.220
 and stop just stayed with wild garlic 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.900
 pretty strong score but I will 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.690
 I did not buy anymore because that was 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.000
 precisely at the time that as the Berlocq 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.410
 Season started here and then I have 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.670
 Just realized that you can do it all 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.200
 That's why I do it myself 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.150
 Today, everything is still the same 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.890
 lemons in the fridge in the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.239
 swimming pool and that's why I stop it 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.709
 but even for the lazy ones 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.110
 you do not want to do it yourself can 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.460
 Whatever you can do that 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.880
 it tastes delicious in any case 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.780
 very very bearded then I have the front 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.180
 to care 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.970
 that's great now two ready 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.520
 forget this from net is now 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.870
 Although not so much the replacement product 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.100
 but I thought I'll show you 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.510
 Just hit that did not share 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.360
 knows and happens down here namely 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.810
 on it lactose free and vegan and ironic 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.190
 sometimes when I'm in between boxer 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.290
 Now she has occupied with whom 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.630
 Burgau salad cucumbers made themselves 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.980
 remoulade or mario that I can 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.120
 In any case , taste like 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.800
 just add normal 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.000
 then I have this from rewe bio this 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.640
 lemon sorbet that I bought myself 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.310
 had tasted really delicious right 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.810
 intense after lemon of course absolutely 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.640
 not artificially we can do really well 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.170
 namely absolutely recommend really good 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.550
 where we hardly have an ice theme there 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.170
 I have two other things I think 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.520
 I had already shown but 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.959
 given occasion was now the 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.000
 summer is what I thought it to you 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.700
 again because have recently been there 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.060
 many still wondered that it was something 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.230
 and where there is something to buy 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.630
 because of him at least once again 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.310
 So here are the edeka's 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.700
 this brand because soja gelato three 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.780
 premium ice cream lactose free gluten free 100% 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.030
 There are these once plant 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.980
 quirks art, so to speak, then there's yes 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.049
 always this what's that again 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.459
 cornetto this skeleton tastes good 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.930
 in any case absolutely milk 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.280
 tastes no difference 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.960
 I absolutely recommend us they are 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.610
 as I said at eca I believe that gives 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.300
 but also at Kaufland or something 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.470
 but is now unsure found 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.120
 it know and the company core in the 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.590
 comments then write for the others 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.160
 I would have been this medal once 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.440
 a lot of milks bought this here 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.920
 Unfortunately , time is not there yet 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.350
 meanwhile 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.360
 Once again I found the one here 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.060
 soy drink vanilla and calcium from rewe 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.370
 Bio was not my thing with me 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.570
 this all drinks taste him 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.190
 simple tastes are just total 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.060
 is over because I like it 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.110
 always a bit like jello 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.970
 somehow a bit artificial 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.350
 yes I think with these two 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.220
 natural vanilla where you can not 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.630
 really much in common 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.430
 That's why I just do not tell you 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.190
 So all the ones I have activated so far 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.270
 I need artificial carriages on which car 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.730
 However, I noticed that 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.050
 Oat drink totally super likes like the 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.810
 here for example super delicious that is 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.240
 a harp sojadrink sojadrink is yes 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.920
 I do not like mine that much 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.710
 not as i like most nut milk 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.170
 or 30 is also I have too 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.210
 My everyday life is very much in decline 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.530
 rice, of course, if you do not 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.660
 Bothers us on our very good but 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.470
 I'm here really turns those 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.640
 oatmeal drinks like so the likes 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.930
 tastes quite good yet 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.180
 little soy with buy that is the pure 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.950
 produces the super of alpo the 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.350
 Great shape is not a superman either 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.739
 tolerable change had water 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.089
 oats 

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:46.069
 there is no sugar that's good because 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:47.509
 with some a prince is very much 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.639
 sugar then it's a bit similar 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.659
 little albers in any case, I'm fine 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.469
 it will soon probably 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.479
 do it yourself 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.649
 let's see how it tastes but he 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.699
 spends tastes good in any case 

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:58.399
 very very good 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.379
 then you have to buy rating I have 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:03.469
 but first try a pack and say 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:05.149
 here from alnatura the patties my 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:10.279
 Voice is not mediterranean today 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:12.049
 and being a murderer is just like that or 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:14.959
 you can cut that someday 

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:16.369
 however I ate this one 

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:18.679
 I do not remember where I think so 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:20.899
 a rice pan was that and I have to 

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:23.209
 say they do not taste me personally 

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:24.949
 so good at least that I still remember 

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:26.749
 not like the other kind tastes 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.009
 I personally think I have now 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:28.669
 just after I do not have one 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:30.709
 tell crap 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.449
 but that's really how it is 

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:34.279
 vegetable patties are so main 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.199
 So vegetables and green stuff in it 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.459
 and now no tofu can be sides though 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.929
 something I find but that anyway 

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:40.729
 It is very much like meat substitute product 

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:42.259
 tastes and I have personal 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.209
 problem because I do not like meat 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:45.679
 I meat of times already disgusting and 

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:47.209
 I do not like these replacement products like that 

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:48.439
 really that's why tell me personally 

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:50.389
 just not to me now rather 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.619
 thought the visa advice is to vegetables 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:55.789
 just a little vegetables tastes 

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:57.679
 but that's right and it works 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:58.939
 not so busy vegetables there are 

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:00.409
 more so the direction meat substitute in 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:02.209
 I just do not like that but when 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:04.159
