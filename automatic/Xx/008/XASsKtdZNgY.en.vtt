00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.360
 Greetings from the enjoyment zone we 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.779
 do today eggs in mustard sauce which we 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.270
 follow things we have salt pepper here 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:28.320
 vegetable stock cream a finely diced 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.470
 Onions in butter eggs and a bit 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.180
 watercress when the onions are diced and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.390
 the eggs are shaped we come directly 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.970
 the pot which we can only times as 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.370
 and in it melt the butter 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.780
 when the mother is almost melted and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.409
 easy to catch we both go 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.769
 onion cubes and win measurable 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.769
 on 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.140
 if the extent is it with us more 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.140
 this best by a sieve 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:31.200
 then that will be good with the pointed 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.200
 have chemistry after all our cows 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.800
 then we add our cream 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:11.870
 then we would all that too 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:13.160
 a little salt a bit and then 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.650
 Let's go easy again 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.310
 on kitchens when it started to easy then 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:28.459
 simmering is not down anymore because there 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:31.250
 do and then that's it 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.180
 almost done of course there is of it 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.920
 now also many different ones 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.030
 Some recipes also do a bit 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.989
 canceled and off 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.920
 some prefer dill and parsley 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.980
 but that we have it now 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.110
 simple concept of what players and 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.730
 It is easy to prepare if you have it now 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.630
 would like to have a bit more hearty 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.390
 you can also do a little bit more 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.810
 make purely self have to stop everything 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.810
 a matter of taste 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.570
 And finally comes ours too 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.010
 to relate again really nice and hot 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.500
 and we will give it while serving 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.180
 not a bit bigger the crisis 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.750
 directly to the sauce demand is 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.760
 very fast gray and can be very 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.910
 fast musty of it only at 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.260
 serve a nice sprinkle over it 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.260
 then it is already good appetite
