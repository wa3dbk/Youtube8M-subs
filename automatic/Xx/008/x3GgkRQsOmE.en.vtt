00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hi there, youtube viewers 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.200
 I have to encrypt I have to wear 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.559
 glasses 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.590
 this cap and save your weekly 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.820
 unshaven to me no one 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.670
 did not calculate then 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.380
 not found and not killed because I 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.210
 I have to say that gta 5 is bullshit 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.349
 Well, as if not quite garbage but in principle 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.140
 very close to this ie rockstar 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.390
 games which always develops games 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.250
 somewhere around for five years if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.219
 Well, that is, every episode it comes out 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.910
 big enough big enough 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.460
 span of time each series up to 17 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 expect something like that pizdets 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.079
 breakthrough but if 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.230
 dug could say before that 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.969
 With 4 this is the fifth version as it were, in principle 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.489
 nothing has changed by and large 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.920
 really so it is 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.860
 1 between 1 and 2 then of course pipets very 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.750
 strong difference between the first part 2 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.330
 here then between 3 and 4 strong difference yes 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.090
 jumped very much does not burn cleanly about 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.119
 such original versions do not speak 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.060
 glade addition what fashion xx u yoda 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.759
 well, purely about the original version yes here 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.670
 I personally have a playstation 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:33.990
 3 prefix I thought to buy this data 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 to this fifth as soon as she came out 17 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.700
 I do not remember the number of short matter here I 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.079
 there was a mass of the house were from the type it was necessary 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.240
 sure that I am very big 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.000
 fan of this from the first part as soon as 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.680
 Part 1 of this institute 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.930
 it was studied for a long time, respectively, yes 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.060
 there is a top view a little bit of no side 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.040
 not three-dimensional so primitive but she 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.159
 even then I am very much 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.380
 fascinated by its singularity, that is, how 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.840
 freedom of action 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.729
 In principle, you do what you want 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.280
 it is a pity that the houses are not grain, I think maybe 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.409
 be they knew through fifty horseradish 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.149
 through lope it may already be possible to 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.770
 gta because there’s hardly any project 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.500
 I will most likely continue 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.230
 release this series of this series of games and 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.510
 this means it can be possible 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.170
 well it does not matter in general that's when another 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.860
 I was fascinated 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.330
 and how would I expect garlic 5 what 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.180
 will be generally fucked up I thought at all 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.030
 just made up will be a breakthrough in graphics 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.530
 now wait a second so okay so 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.000
 i just have a camera recording somewhere in 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.010
 about 10 minutes like sweat anna 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.470
 cut with rollers reluctance to mount 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.440
 how much easier would it be for me to release 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.530
 video than with montage fucking how would it 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.739
 would stop me from being creative 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.560
 the process of removing the rollers means shorter 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.110
 again don't dismiss the side mean by 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.900
 every kind of thumbnail mpa trailer there I already 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.239
 I do not know what to call it before gta 5 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.790
 because a very beautiful schedule in general 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.010
 just unusual something just like a movie 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.989
 some look but in reality myself 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.140
 the gameplay is by and large the same 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.659
 gta 4 before it became a little more drawing 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.480
 up everything became more clearly if here I am 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.659
 really remember gta 4 you start i love 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.849
 play it well to lie down with 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.709
 joystick there you relax on the couch 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.180
 here so lay back and enjoy 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.129
 gameplay and yes on joystick 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.000
 more comfortable rocking this fucking keyboard 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:29.489
 more often the computer for a long time in 32 years too 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.110
 he really got fucked up because i 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.209
 how would all life be connected with computers 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.640
 there is a lot of computer 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.049
 still spend time playing 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.090
 computer and there it is shorter okay so im i 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.030
 looked all there surveyors so yes 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.170
 called there ready fuck him some 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:54.060
 there are still darts in general I don't know how I would 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.280
 absolutely not admired by the 5 series absolutely 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.200
 that is, and you honestly here now 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.569
 I would like to give money to this 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.569
 Machines can not repair you at all 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.819
 we seem to be barely enough for the huts 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.140
 pay what I rent apartment in 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.340
 Moscow live those who do not know me here to them 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.090
 pay almost three pieces for a disk of pancakes 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.880
 it is honest in the padla if it were for 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.270
 what pay the dao so damn read this 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.100
 not impressive this is not impressive what but 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.350
 general books of course for the sake of interest 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.160
 Of course I would buy but in the aggregate everything 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.520
 it together somehow I don’t really grieve 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.300
 the desire of the only thing there is supposedly Tipo 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.580
 so new yes there is all sorts like him 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.650
 cuddle it can be some kind of there 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.660
 the depth go down there basement under water 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.780
 yes there fuck there some kind of rides 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.610
 there ride like a roller coaster and 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.100
 cheek breathing added here such a plan 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.360
 yes but it was possible to fly in the previous one 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.550
 the series fly there it is the most tales from 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.270
 liberty city there is such an addition 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.520
 as if 4 of them could fly there 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.680
 fuck up there with skydiving jump 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.990
 and that same ebony anton huyarit pizdato 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.990
 it was so fucking new here 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.560
 did nothing in general so here such 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.960
 Here is a shit is a shame that nothing 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.680
 supernatural that's the only thing 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.660
 probably probably such an innovation but not 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.960
 brought out as far as I understood as far as I 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.680
 heard from any reviewers means something 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.110
 that there is added a skill system yes type 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.690
 as warpa gastein it can be pumped 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.669
 like your characters dick knows 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.979
 as if everyone from somewhere is still waiting 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.039
 graphics yes she used to forever 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.990
 shocked 7 this is still shocking gta 5 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.930
 then they began to equal her 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.780
 was a pioneer in games open 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.960
 the world is all fucking under it 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.310
 paint only then as I understand it 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.039
 I hope I did not hurt anyone 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.950
 these words but how would my opinion 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.550
 I consider it important to convey this because I 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.270
 I never pisyun ass nobody there 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.810
 Well, as it were, I express everything as it is 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.000
 each person has his own point of view and 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.950
 be a man bleat and express your 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.060
 point of view 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.060
 all poked comrades
