like<00:01:53.880> pita<00:01:54.420> bread<00:01:54.779> wasa<00:01:55.409> crackers<00:01:55.619> something

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
like pita bread wasa crackers something

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.489 
like pita bread wasa crackers something
that's<00:01:56.609> a<00:01:56.729> little<00:01:56.939> lighter<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.959> going<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
that's a little lighter that's going to

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.039 
that's a little lighter that's going to
be<00:01:58.649> able<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.009> digest<00:01:59.279> very<00:01:59.759> easily<00:02:00.049> another

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
be able to digest very easily another

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.010 
be able to digest very easily another
idea<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.919> be<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.609> like<00:02:02.759> oatmeal<00:02:03.090> have

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
idea would be if you like oatmeal have

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.580 
idea would be if you like oatmeal have
an<00:02:04.439> oatmeal<00:02:04.799> packet<00:02:05.609> or<00:02:05.819> keep<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.509> around<00:02:06.810> 1/3

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
an oatmeal packet or keep it around 1/3

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.919 
an oatmeal packet or keep it around 1/3
or<00:02:07.919> 1/2<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.399> cup<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.390> need<00:02:09.630> more

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
or 1/2 a cup and if you need more

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.280 
or 1/2 a cup and if you need more
carbohydrates<00:02:10.830> add<00:02:10.979> some<00:02:11.550> granola<00:02:12.000> or<00:02:12.450> some

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
carbohydrates add some granola or some

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.229 
carbohydrates add some granola or some
honey<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.670> way<00:02:14.879> you're<00:02:15.090> giving

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
honey to it that way you're giving

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.170 
honey to it that way you're giving
yourself<00:02:15.540> more<00:02:16.230> carbohydrate

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
yourself more carbohydrate

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.050 
yourself more carbohydrate
without<00:02:17.450> more<00:02:17.750> volume<00:02:18.409> another<00:02:19.250> idea<00:02:19.760> is<00:02:20.030> that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
without more volume another idea is that

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.110 
without more volume another idea is that
you<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.750> stick<00:02:21.140> with<00:02:21.170> bars<00:02:22.159> if<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:22.849> bars

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
you can stick with bars if you like bars

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.330 
you can stick with bars if you like bars
but<00:02:23.420> we<00:02:23.569> do<00:02:23.719> want<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.049> keep<00:02:24.290> them<00:02:24.590> without<00:02:25.189> the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
but we do want to keep them without the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.220 
but we do want to keep them without the
sugar<00:02:25.489> alcohols<00:02:26.150> because<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.750> can<00:02:27.049> also

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
sugar alcohols because that can also

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.550 
sugar alcohols because that can also
irritate<00:02:27.590> your<00:02:28.159> digestive<00:02:29.030> system<00:02:29.560> another

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
irritate your digestive system another

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
idea is that you want to combine some

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.410 
idea is that you want to combine some
protein<00:02:33.859> with<00:02:34.459> your<00:02:34.609> carbohydrate<00:02:35.389> to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
protein with your carbohydrate to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.599 
protein with your carbohydrate to
minimize<00:02:36.019> any<00:02:36.319> spikes<00:02:36.709> in<00:02:36.950> your<00:02:37.069> blood<00:02:37.280> sugar
