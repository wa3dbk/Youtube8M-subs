00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
from regular logs since both our shafts

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.939

and outs from regular tables my regular

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.210 
and outs from regular tables my regular
logs<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.550> grouped<00:00:23.970> them<00:00:24.119> together<00:00:24.830> from<00:00:25.830> levels

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
logs I grouped them together from levels

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.609 
logs I grouped them together from levels
1<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.730> 20<00:00:27.090> you'll<00:00:27.689> need<00:00:28.160> 563<00:00:29.160> regular<00:00:29.550> logs<00:00:29.789> I

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
1 to 20 you'll need 563 regular logs I

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.290 
1 to 20 you'll need 563 regular logs I
know<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.099> logs<00:00:32.279> are<00:00:32.460> kind<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.669> expensive<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
know the logs are kind of expensive and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.790 
know the logs are kind of expensive and
you<00:00:33.510> won't<00:00:33.660> make<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.960> much<00:00:34.140> selling<00:00:34.469> items

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you won't make that much selling items

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
you won't make that much selling items
you<00:00:34.890> make<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.309> don't<00:00:35.910> know<00:00:36.000> why<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> logs<00:00:36.510> cost

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you make I don't know why the logs cost

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240 
you make I don't know why the logs cost
that<00:00:37.020> much<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.710> won't<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.950> doing<00:00:38.160> this

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
that much but you won't be doing this

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
that much but you won't be doing this
for<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> long<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.989> much<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
for a long so it's not that much of a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.020 
for a long so it's not that much of a
loss<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.950> ko<00:00:41.129> actually<00:00:41.370> gets<00:00:41.520> cheaper

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
loss and this ko actually gets cheaper

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.590 
loss and this ko actually gets cheaper
as<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.300> along

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
as you go along

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.270 
as you go along
is<00:00:42.809> even<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> method<00:00:43.500> that's<00:00:43.649> profitable<00:00:44.040> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
is even a method that's profitable so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.869 
is even a method that's profitable so
let's<00:00:44.460> continue<00:00:45.170> from<00:00:46.170> levels<00:00:46.559> 20<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> 25<00:00:47.370> make

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
let's continue from levels 20 to 25 make

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.910 
let's continue from levels 20 to 25 make
under<00:00:48.300> strong<00:00:48.450> short<00:00:48.930> bills<00:00:49.200> from<00:00:49.440> oak<00:00:49.649> logs

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
under strong short bills from oak logs

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.450 
under strong short bills from oak logs
and<00:00:50.520> from<00:00:51.090> levels<00:00:51.390> 25<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> 35<00:00:52.680> make<00:00:52.980> unshrunk

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and from levels 25 to 35 make unshrunk

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.569 
and from levels 25 to 35 make unshrunk
shield<00:00:54.000> bows<00:00:54.210> from<00:00:54.390> also<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:54.960> oak<00:00:55.050> logs

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
shield bows from also from oak logs

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.160 
shield bows from also from oak logs
since<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:56.760> both<00:00:56.910> require<00:00:57.059> oak<00:00:57.390> logs<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.840> group

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
since they both require oak logs I group

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.150 
since they both require oak logs I group
them<00:00:58.320> together<00:00:58.500> once<00:00:58.859> again

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
them together once again

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
them together once again
so<00:01:00.149> from<00:01:00.449> Lowe's<00:01:00.629> xx<00:01:01.440> 35<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.340> need<00:01:02.870> 788<00:01:03.870> oak

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
so from Lowe's xx 35 you need 788 oak

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.020 
so from Lowe's xx 35 you need 788 oak
logs<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:05.159> still<00:01:05.369> cost<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.790> bit<00:01:05.939> of

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
logs this still cost a little bit of

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.550 
logs this still cost a little bit of
money<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.510> once<00:01:06.780> again<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.140> won't<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.380> doing

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
money but once again you won't be doing

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320 
money but once again you won't be doing
this<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.369> long<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.970> still<00:01:09.180> gets

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
this for that long and it still gets

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.980 
this for that long and it still gets
cheaper<00:01:10.010> from<00:01:11.010> levels<00:01:11.520> 35<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.390> 40<00:01:12.720> make

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
cheaper from levels 35 to 40 make

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.200 
cheaper from levels 35 to 40 make
