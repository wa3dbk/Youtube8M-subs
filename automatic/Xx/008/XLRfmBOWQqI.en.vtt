go-to<00:00:13.920> thing<00:00:14.070> from<00:00:14.519> like<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> lot<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.179> Korean

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
go-to thing from like a lot of Korean

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.510 
go-to thing from like a lot of Korean
teams<00:00:15.719> especially<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.500> SKT<00:00:16.890> they<00:00:17.160> kind<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
teams especially like SKT they kind of

made this whole thing happen because

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.170 
made this whole thing happen because
Java<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.010> pro<00:00:20.220> like<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> best<00:00:20.699> jungler<00:00:20.910> right

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
Java is pro like the best jungler right

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.800 
Java is pro like the best jungler right
now<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.619> just<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.070> way<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.279> works<00:00:23.490> he<00:00:24.090> fits<00:00:24.600> so

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
now and just the way it works he fits so

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.439 
now and just the way it works he fits so
many<00:00:24.990> team<00:00:25.199> compositions<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.130> especially<00:00:27.119> if

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
many team compositions and especially if

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.540 
many team compositions and especially if
you<00:00:27.570> get<00:00:27.689> not<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.289> sandra<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.920> java<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.369> one

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
you get not the sandra and java in one

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.330 
you get not the sandra and java in one
team<00:00:29.810> you're<00:00:30.810> most<00:00:31.080> likely<00:00:31.679> guaranteed<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
team you're most likely guaranteed to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
team you're most likely guaranteed to
actually<00:00:32.669> win<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> team<00:00:33.149> fights<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.600> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
actually win the team fights and you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
actually win the team fights and you
have<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.200> much<00:00:34.320> heart<00:00:34.500> engage<00:00:34.860> even<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
have so much heart engage even the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.549 
have so much heart engage even the
general<00:00:35.969> pic<00:00:36.120> doesn't<00:00:36.390> work<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
general pic doesn't work out because the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.770 
general pic doesn't work out because the
second<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.129> yet<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.610> champion<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
second you and yet with one champion the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.650 
second you and yet with one champion the
dynamic<00:00:40.350> Jenna<00:00:40.649> has<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> teammate<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.660> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
dynamic Jenna has so I teammate and the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
dynamic Jenna has so I teammate and the
second<00:00:43.020> time<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.559> get<00:00:43.710> re-engaged<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> then

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
second time you get re-engaged on then

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.700 
second time you get re-engaged on then
it's<00:00:44.789> too<00:00:45.629> overwhelming<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.140> deal<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it's too overwhelming to deal with I

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's too overwhelming to deal with I
think<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.340> my<00:00:47.489> eyes<00:00:47.640> yeah<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> definitely<00:00:48.390> think

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
think in my eyes yeah I definitely think

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.100 
think in my eyes yeah I definitely think
good<00:00:49.680> draft<00:00:49.920> coming<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.340> formation<00:00:50.520> okay

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
good draft coming out formation okay

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.330 
good draft coming out formation okay
questionable<00:00:52.110> draft<00:00:52.410> from<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.739> faculty<00:00:53.129> but

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
questionable draft from and faculty but

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.160 
questionable draft from and faculty but
they<00:00:53.760> had<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> lot<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> issues<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.020> but

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
they had a lot of issues with that but

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.479 
they had a lot of issues with that but
they<00:00:55.260> solve<00:00:55.590> lot<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> lane

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
they solve lot of them with the lane

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.889 
they solve lot of them with the lane
swap<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.449> something<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.719> want

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
swap and I think that's something I want

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.150 
swap and I think that's something I want
to<00:00:57.960> highlight<00:00:58.050> how<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.680> did<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.949> they

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to highlight how they did that they

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.760 
to highlight how they did that they
basically<00:00:59.489> let<00:01:00.359> page<00:01:00.840> 2<00:01:01.020> K<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.289> greedy<00:01:01.559> they're

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
basically let page 2 K be greedy they're

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
basically let page 2 K be greedy they're
battling<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.250> example<00:01:02.699> two<00:01:03.329> columns<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
battling for example two columns and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
battling for example two columns and
that<00:01:04.379> gives<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> late<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.610> fact<00:01:05.790> we

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that gives you a late but in fact we

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.340 
that gives you a late but in fact we
said<00:01:06.119> no<00:01:06.210> we're<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:06.450> lean<00:01:06.659> swap<00:01:06.900> because

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
said no we're gonna lean swap because

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.810 
said no we're gonna lean swap because
you're<00:01:07.590> taking<00:01:07.710> golems<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> can't<00:01:08.549> freeze

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you're taking golems you can't freeze

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.920 
you're taking golems you can't freeze
that<00:01:09.000> bottom<00:01:09.270> line<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.630> means<00:01:09.810> you're

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that bottom line that means you're

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.690 
that bottom line that means you're
automatically<00:01:10.470> gonna<00:01:10.650> push<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.220> later

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
automatically gonna push that in later

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.250 
automatically gonna push that in later
on<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.150> sent<00:01:12.390> Jackson<00:01:12.810> Jenna<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
on they sent Jackson Jenna to the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.050 
on they sent Jackson Jenna to the
bottling<00:01:13.590> soak<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.310> experience<00:01:14.880> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
bottling soak up that experience that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.310 
bottling soak up that experience that
was<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.360> meanwhile<00:01:15.659> their<00:01:15.840> top<00:01:16.020> lane<00:01:16.170> was

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
was good meanwhile their top lane was

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.109 
was good meanwhile their top lane was
frozen<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> lane<00:01:17.189> swap<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:17.939> did<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
frozen in the lane swap so they did a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.929 
frozen in the lane swap so they did a
lot<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> good<00:01:18.630> things<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.110> lane<00:01:19.409> swap

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
lot of good things with that lane swap

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
lot of good things with that lane swap
including<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.360> counter<00:01:21.689> gank<00:01:21.900> around

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
including I think a counter gank around

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.929 
including I think a counter gank around
the<00:01:22.799> seven-minute<00:01:23.310> mark<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.640> even<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the seven-minute mark and we even have a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.100 
the seven-minute mark and we even have a
replay<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.930> on

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
replay for that if we can get that on

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.440 
replay for that if we can get that on
your<00:01:25.140> screen<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:26.159> away<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.150> actually

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
your screen right away that's actually

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.539 
your screen right away that's actually
show<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.020> faculty<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:29.040> understood<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
show that faculty just understood the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.740 
show that faculty just understood the

game and decks together for a couple

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.780 
game and decks together for a couple
things<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> say<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.409> um<00:01:31.619> yeah<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.159> mean<00:01:32.310> the

things to say here um yeah I mean the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
things to say here um yeah I mean the
way<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:32.970> works<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.960> second

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
way it works right now is the second

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.289 
way it works right now is the second
lisandro<00:01:34.920> hits<00:01:35.070> level<00:01:35.220> six<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.880> want<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> call

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
lisandro hits level six you want to call

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
lisandro hits level six you want to call
your<00:01:36.390> jungler<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> top<00:01:37.470> plane<00:01:37.619> right

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
your jungler into the top plane right

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.950 
your jungler into the top plane right
now<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.360> guaranteed<00:01:39.750> kill

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
now and because it's a guaranteed kill

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
now and because it's a guaranteed kill
but<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.530> fact<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.369> read<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.670> pretty

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
but in fact they actually read it pretty

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
well I mean at least already set up for
the<00:01:43.979> counter<00:01:44.250> gang<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.549> because<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.420> just

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the counter gang here because it's just

teammate but um yeah although commitment
and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:55.079> dont<00:01:55.350> even<00:01:55.500> calculate<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
and then it dont even calculate in the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.459 
and then it dont even calculate in the
here<00:01:56.219> right<00:01:56.340> now<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.670> yeah<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> heel<00:01:57.780> makes

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
here right now and yeah the heel makes

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.260 
here right now and yeah the heel makes
it<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.860> they<00:01:59.399> actually<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.759> double<00:02:00.090> killed

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it so they actually get double killed

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.609 
it so they actually get double killed
yeah<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> could<00:02:00.869> chase<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.200> stalkers<00:02:01.560> in

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
yeah I could chase with stalkers in

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.109 
yeah I could chase with stalkers in
there<00:02:01.890> finishing<00:02:02.310> Sox<00:02:02.610> turned<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:02.880> least<00:02:03.000> not

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
there finishing Sox turned at least not

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.370 
there finishing Sox turned at least not
something<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.420> see<00:02:03.540> all<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.719> time<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.170> flash

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
something we see all the time to flash

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
something we see all the time to flash
coming<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> play

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
coming up I just I really like this play

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.940 
coming up I just I really like this play
as<00:02:06.210> well<00:02:06.360> good<00:02:06.750> counter<00:02:07.049> gank<00:02:07.229> yes<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> wasn't

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
as well good counter gank yes it wasn't

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.290 
as well good counter gank yes it wasn't
mechanically<00:02:08.340> executed<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.149> can

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
mechanically executed but if you can

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.760 
mechanically executed but if you can
make<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> plague<00:02:09.720> work<00:02:09.959> without<00:02:10.289> even

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
make a plague work without even

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.229 
make a plague work without even
executing<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.340> properly<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.730> means<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.090> was<00:02:12.209> a

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
executing it properly it means it was a

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.590 
executing it properly it means it was a
really<00:02:12.540> good<00:02:12.660> idee<00:02:12.810> it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
really good idee it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.820 
really good idee it
that's<00:02:14.600> basically<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.110> premise<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.740> this

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
that's basically the premise of this

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.920 
that's basically the premise of this
entire<00:02:16.130> series<00:02:16.460> there<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:17.270> faculty<00:02:17.780> had<00:02:17.900> a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
entire series there and faculty had a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.900 
entire series there and faculty had a
better<00:02:18.110> ideas<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.530> think<00:02:18.680> later<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.160> h2k

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
better ideas but I think later on h2k

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.550 
better ideas but I think later on h2k
came<00:02:20.330> with<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.630> better<00:02:20.810> idea<00:02:21.080> yes<00:02:21.380> they

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
came with the better idea yes they

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.410 
came with the better idea yes they
weren't<00:02:21.830> perfect<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.760> vision<00:02:23.030> control<00:02:23.150> was

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
weren't perfect the vision control was

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.850 
weren't perfect the vision control was
lacking<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.050> some<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.380> rotations<00:02:24.770> could

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
lacking and some of the rotations could

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.620 
lacking and some of the rotations could
have<00:02:24.950> been<00:02:25.070> quicker<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:25.850> h2k<00:02:26.270> had<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.450> really

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
have been quicker but h2k had a really

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.540 
have been quicker but h2k had a really
good<00:02:26.780> strategy<00:02:27.260> they<00:02:27.680> use<00:02:27.860> split<00:02:28.160> push<00:02:28.310> well

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
good strategy they use split push well

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.740 
good strategy they use split push well
for<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.790> first<00:02:29.030> time<00:02:29.180> today<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.510> we've

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
for the first time today I we've

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.720 
for the first time today I we've
actually<00:02:29.900> seen<00:02:30.170> how<00:02:30.470> powerful<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:31.490> you

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
actually seen how powerful it is if you

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.040 
actually seen how powerful it is if you
have<00:02:31.820> split<00:02:32.090> bush<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:32.540> people<00:02:32.780> back<00:02:32.900> off

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
have split bush and then people back off

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.510 
have split bush and then people back off
at<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> right<00:02:33.410> times<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:33.950> contest

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
at the right times and just contest

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.220 
at the right times and just contest
objectives<00:02:34.970> yeah<00:02:35.300> let's<00:02:35.540> break<00:02:35.690> actually<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
objectives yeah let's break actually a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.510 
objectives yeah let's break actually a
couple<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.590> those<00:02:36.710> things<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.040> they<00:02:37.340> did

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
couple of those things that they did

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.280 
couple of those things that they did
well<00:02:37.790> or<00:02:37.820> maybe<00:02:38.120> not<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:38.630> go<00:02:38.750> down<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.110> were

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
well or maybe not so go down you were

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.620 
well or maybe not so go down you were
mentioning<00:02:39.800> vision<00:02:40.460> control<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.030> as<00:02:41.210> we<00:02:41.420> see

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
mentioning vision control and as we see

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.600 
mentioning vision control and as we see
oftentimes<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:42.860> teams<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.160> are<00:02:43.250> not<00:02:43.400> that

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
oftentimes in teams that are not that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.520 
oftentimes in teams that are not that
experienced<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.360> higher<00:02:44.540> echelons<00:02:44.960> they

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
experienced in the higher echelons they

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.710 
experienced in the higher echelons they
don't<00:02:46.130> seem<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.340> ward<00:02:46.670> deep<00:02:47.060> enough<00:02:47.390> early

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
don't seem to ward deep enough early

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.150 
don't seem to ward deep enough early
enough<00:02:47.840> when<00:02:48.050> they<00:02:48.230> are<00:02:48.320> able<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.710> get<00:02:49.040> the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
enough when they are able to get the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.560 
enough when they are able to get the
advantage<00:02:49.340> yeah<00:02:49.910> don't<00:02:50.330> get<00:02:50.450> me<00:02:50.540> wrong

then<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.220> had<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:14.240> Sun<00:04:14.420> were<00:04:14.510> actually<00:04:14.750> not

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
then you had the Sun were actually not

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.810 
then you had the Sun were actually not
doing<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.320> well<00:04:15.350> but<00:04:15.650> he<00:04:16.160> actually<00:04:16.310> made<00:04:16.670> like

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
doing so well but he actually made like

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.180 
doing so well but he actually made like
pigs<00:04:17.060> happen<00:04:17.390> so<00:04:17.600> pretty<00:04:18.350> good<00:04:18.530> execution

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
pigs happen so pretty good execution

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.880 
pigs happen so pretty good execution
from<00:04:19.670> the<00:04:19.820> team<00:04:19.970> come<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.210> think<00:04:20.450> from<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:21.020> h2k<00:04:21.799> in

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
from the team come I think from a h2k in

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.710 
from the team come I think from a h2k in
my<00:04:21.980> eyes<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:23.000> biggest<00:04:23.180> problem<00:04:23.390> is<00:04:23.630> even

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
my eyes and the biggest problem is even

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.510 
my eyes and the biggest problem is even
if<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.020> have<00:04:24.110> an<00:04:24.230> early<00:04:24.410> game<00:04:24.650> leads<00:04:24.919> in<00:04:25.130> in

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
if you have an early game leads in in

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.100 
if you have an early game leads in in
faculties<00:04:25.970> case<00:04:26.180> like<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.870> have

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
faculties case like you have

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.600 
faculties case like you have
Jack's<00:04:27.289> at<00:04:27.500> scales<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:27.919> everything<00:04:28.250> but<00:04:28.370> in

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
Jack's at scales and everything but in

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.879 
Jack's at scales and everything but in
the<00:04:28.789> end<00:04:28.879> just<00:04:29.330> an<00:04:29.960> overwhelming<00:04:30.289> team

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
the end just an overwhelming team

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.830 
the end just an overwhelming team
composition<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.400> by<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.580> stroke<00:04:31.789> a<00:04:31.939> and<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.330> think

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
composition of by a stroke a and I think

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.179 
composition of by a stroke a and I think
it<00:04:32.960> all<00:04:33.110> came<00:04:33.379> down<00:04:33.439> to<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.830> drafting

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:34.189 
it all came down to the drafting

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.879 
it all came down to the drafting
actually<00:04:34.490> because<00:04:34.990> this<00:04:35.990> under<00:04:36.289> job<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.710> like

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
actually because this under job and like

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.730 
actually because this under job and like
I<00:04:36.919> said<00:04:37.039> very<00:04:37.789> high<00:04:37.969> when<00:04:38.180> we're<00:04:38.300> together

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
I said very high when we're together

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.899 
I said very high when we're together
incredibly<00:04:39.740> synergy<00:04:40.370> between<00:04:40.490> both

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909 
incredibly synergy between both

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.330 
incredibly synergy between both
champions<00:04:41.419> and<00:04:41.770> if<00:04:42.770> they<00:04:42.949> actually<00:04:43.189> at<00:04:43.250> this

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
champions and if they actually at this

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.550 
champions and if they actually at this
tiny<00:04:43.789> edge<00:04:44.060> in<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.780> draft<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.199> think<00:04:45.409> and

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
tiny edge in the draft I think and

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.260 
tiny edge in the draft I think and
faculty<00:04:46.159> can<00:04:46.280> actually<00:04:46.580> take<00:04:46.759> your<00:04:46.879> games<00:04:47.090> off

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
faculty can actually take your games off

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.899 
faculty can actually take your games off
because<00:04:47.599> the<00:04:48.139> execution<00:04:48.680> an<00:04:48.770> idea<00:04:49.099> even<00:04:49.789> if

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
because the execution an idea even if

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.209 
because the execution an idea even if
they<00:04:50.060> put<00:04:50.330> themselves<00:04:50.509> into<00:04:50.870> like<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.379> whole

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219 
they put themselves into like a whole

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.309 
they put themselves into like a whole
more<00:04:52.550> or<00:04:52.610> less<00:04:52.789> in<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.210> pigs<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:53.599> pants<00:04:53.750> the

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
more or less in the pigs and pants the

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.050 
more or less in the pigs and pants the
execution<00:04:54.860> an<00:04:55.159> early<00:04:55.490> game<00:04:55.580> was<00:04:55.729> actually

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
execution an early game was actually

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.059 
execution an early game was actually
pretty<00:04:56.240> good<00:04:56.479> for<00:04:56.539> foreign<00:04:57.500> faculties<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:57.919> I

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
pretty good for foreign faculties so I

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.800 
pretty good for foreign faculties so I
have<00:04:58.189> to<00:04:58.310> compliment<00:04:58.490> them<00:04:58.909> on<00:04:58.939> that<00:04:59.389> part<00:04:59.629> I

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
have to compliment them on that part I

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.959 
have to compliment them on that part I
think<00:04:59.840> so<00:05:00.259> yeah<00:05:01.219> definitely<00:05:01.370> agree<00:05:01.789> there<00:05:01.939> I

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 
think so yeah definitely agree there I

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.399 
think so yeah definitely agree there I
think<00:05:02.150> effectively<00:05:02.479> went<00:05:02.779> for<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.020> just

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
think effectively went for the just

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.399 
think effectively went for the just
tilting<00:05:03.740> strategy<00:05:04.159> just<00:05:04.449> sadly<00:05:05.449> enough<00:05:05.629> for

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
tilting strategy just sadly enough for

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.890 
tilting strategy just sadly enough for
them<00:05:06.560> h2k<00:05:06.949> did<00:05:07.189> actually<00:05:07.370> stay<00:05:08.300> composed<00:05:08.659> if

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
them h2k did actually stay composed if

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.149 
them h2k did actually stay composed if
we<00:05:09.020> saw<00:05:09.169> like<00:05:09.349> the<00:05:09.379> game<00:05:09.650> was<00:05:09.800> going<00:05:09.919> down<00:05:10.129> a

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
we saw like the game was going down a

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:11.709 
we saw like the game was going down a
drain<00:05:10.340> a<00:05:10.370> lot<00:05:10.520> of<00:05:10.639> kills<00:05:10.819> the<00:05:11.150> goal<00:05:11.330> was<00:05:11.360> even

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
drain a lot of kills the goal was even

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:12.850 
drain a lot of kills the goal was even
but<00:05:11.840> if<00:05:11.930> you're<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.199> that<00:05:12.229> seat<00:05:12.650> right<00:05:12.830> there

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
but if you're in that seat right there

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.830 
but if you're in that seat right there
all<00:05:13.219> you<00:05:13.460> have<00:05:13.639> to<00:05:13.759> go<00:05:13.939> and<00:05:14.150> base<00:05:14.330> yourself<00:05:14.659> off

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
all you have to go and base yourself off

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.749 
all you have to go and base yourself off
is<00:05:14.990> that<00:05:15.710> golden<00:05:16.069> you<00:05:16.189> don't<00:05:16.460> count<00:05:16.639> the

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
is that golden you don't count the

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.040 
is that golden you don't count the
dragons<00:05:17.180> either<00:05:17.389> you<00:05:17.569> know<00:05:17.599> because<00:05:17.810> it's<00:05:17.960> an

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
dragons either you know because it's an

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.779 
dragons either you know because it's an
invisible<00:05:18.469> stat<00:05:18.650> I<00:05:18.830> really<00:05:19.520> like<00:05:19.639> how

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
invisible stat I really like how

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.640 
invisible stat I really like how
composed<00:05:20.090> htk<00:05:20.629> state<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.139> if<00:05:21.199> everyone<00:05:21.439> he

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
composed htk state and if everyone he

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.559 
composed htk state and if everyone he
showed<00:05:21.830> up<00:05:21.979> 500<00:05:22.669> at<00:05:22.969> one<00:05:23.090> point<00:05:23.270> I<00:05:23.360> don't<00:05:23.449> even

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
showed up 500 at one point I don't even

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.330 
showed up 500 at one point I don't even
know<00:05:23.779> what<00:05:23.870> crazy<00:05:24.110> score<00:05:24.379> you<00:05:24.529> said<00:05:24.949> he's<00:05:25.310> a

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
know what crazy score you said he's a

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.760 
know what crazy score you said he's a
fantastic<00:05:26.029> set<00:05:26.659> and<00:05:26.870> we<00:05:27.050> saw<00:05:27.289> it<00:05:27.469> he<00:05:27.620> did

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
fantastic set and we saw it he did

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.769 
fantastic set and we saw it he did
absolutely<00:05:28.099> great<00:05:28.430> in<00:05:28.759> its<00:05:28.879> h2k<00:05:29.419> that's<00:05:29.629> going

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779 
absolutely great in its h2k that's going

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.269 
absolutely great in its h2k that's going
to<00:05:29.840> take<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.169> first<00:05:30.409> game<00:05:30.680> we're<00:05:31.039> going<00:05:31.159> to

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:31.279 
to take the first game we're going to

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:32.920 
to take the first game we're going to
take<00:05:31.520> a<00:05:31.550> short<00:05:31.879> break<00:05:32.029> but<00:05:32.360> when<00:05:32.509> we<00:05:32.569> come<00:05:32.659> back

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
take a short break but when we come back

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.110 
take a short break but when we come back
it'll<00:05:33.379> be<00:05:33.529> game<00:05:33.800> to<00:05:33.860> between<00:05:34.339> n<00:05:34.460> faculty<00:05:34.940> and

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
it'll be game to between n faculty and

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.110 
it'll be game to between n faculty and
h2k<00:05:35.599> stay<00:05:35.930> put
