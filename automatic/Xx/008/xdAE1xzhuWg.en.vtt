00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 already the guys iran here and I'll tell 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.259
 You but the commented gameplay 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.540
 I would ask again black ops 2 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.210
 traffic coming back with the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.769
 our little bit of what the eyes are 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.440
 at least while I 'm doing 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.109
 of each agent other minor announcements 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.720
 higher and maybe it is that longer 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.880
 and maybe rename maybe not anymore 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.970
 I guarantee nothing good I look back I see that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.130
 the process of how to do the pec the bridge 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.960
 faster is much faster is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 more power to use a turbine that does not 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.600
 is completely new , but one that 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.920
 You 've used one more time and a lot of time. 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.360
 condition will have to go back there in the manager 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.489
 Tap, boy, beauty, you got here. 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.680
 example I'm going to use a turbine that I 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.550
 used to me the coast of Brazil and stop 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.010
 to look for doll parts more 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.160
 I did not spend much time until 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.250
 here I'm going to make a difference and until 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.140
 had a few blows from the zombie in her but 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.519
 nothing that hinders quickly as it does 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.450
 important leap forward and to make 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.180
 to function 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.250
 well you'll have to come here in lusa 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.040
 he announces that here leave a 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.810
 thurman there to open this line 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.119
 What do you have in the bank and can you ride? 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.000
 the pec a band because all the pieces are 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.900
 there after and ride it just do 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 usually with good connected energy you 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.880
 You'll see, there, just leave this 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.220
 Cabin corner where you could 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 go down or buy the 34 well in the corner 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.780
 there right on the line and run to there 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 town that goes to serginho field and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.420
 could take the bus that would be in 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 front would not have to go that way 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.640
 all downstairs energy rise after 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.530
 to pass in front of the bus 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.110
 He managed to get into an avalanche 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.119
 if you can take the bus you can go on foot 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.030
 You can also do whatever you want and it will 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.700
 little to much time in a 15 10 seconds 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.409
 there then guys, that's it, I'll go 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.719
 staying here stick with the rachÃ£o 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.299
 video to show there that still works 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.299
 So it was a hug, I went. 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.620
 arriving in the shirt disappeared 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.210
 I thought I had torn apart 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.210
 years 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.220
 the strange sensation in the trigger finger 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.970
 Who knows, the author knows what to do with 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.970
 that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.070
 this here seems to be one of the players 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.770
 I 'm an expert on that.
