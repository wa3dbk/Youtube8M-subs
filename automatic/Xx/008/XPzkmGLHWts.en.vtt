00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
iPad so here's a cheap alternative and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
iPad so here's a cheap alternative and
the<00:01:07.110> second<00:01:07.500> benefit<00:01:07.860> I've<00:01:08.070> found<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.430> that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the second benefit I've found is that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.760 
the second benefit I've found is that
the<00:01:08.670> quality<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.570> new<00:01:09.780> battery<00:01:10.140> packs<00:01:10.409> last

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the quality of my new battery packs last

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.490 
the quality of my new battery packs last
longer<00:01:11.159> than<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.030> original<00:01:12.570> batteries<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
longer than the original batteries of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
longer than the original batteries of
whatever<00:01:13.680> Makita<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.610> their<00:01:14.880> battery

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
whatever Makita use in their battery

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.010 
whatever Makita use in their battery
packs<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:17.060> bit<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.540> buy<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> new

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
packs a bit like when you buy a new

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140 
packs a bit like when you buy a new
printer<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.650> intakes<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.250> come<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:20.970> them

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
printer the intakes that come with them

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.700 
printer the intakes that come with them
you<00:01:21.270> print<00:01:21.570> are<00:01:21.659> only<00:01:21.810> half-full

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
you print are only half-full

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.920 
you print are only half-full
so<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.520> boy<00:01:23.820> new<00:01:24.450> cartridge

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so if you have to go boy new cartridge

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.719 
so if you have to go boy new cartridge
is<00:01:25.080> pretty<00:01:25.409> well<00:01:25.590> straight<00:01:25.770> away<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.369> they

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is pretty well straight away and they

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.530 
is pretty well straight away and they
cost<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> new<00:01:27.810> printer<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.880> I'll

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
cost as much as a new printer so I'll

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.500 
cost as much as a new printer so I'll
show<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> how<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.650> battery<00:01:32.009> now

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.820 

actually<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:36.190> here<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.550> is<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.000> bought<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:38.080> 7.2

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.210 
positive and negative wires and just
join<00:01:59.110> so<00:01:59.410> than<00:01:59.650> one<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.900> then<00:02:02.050> I<00:02:02.230> glued<00:02:02.770> the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
join so than one and then I glued the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.180 
join so than one and then I glued the
tin<00:02:03.550> plate<00:02:03.880> on<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.350> top<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.800> battery

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
tin plate on to the top of the battery

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.580 
tin plate on to the top of the battery
with<00:02:06.460> hot<00:02:07.090> glue<00:02:07.420> or<00:02:07.660> whatever<00:02:08.170> it'll<00:02:08.320> glue

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
with hot glue or whatever it'll glue

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.880 
with hot glue or whatever it'll glue
you've<00:02:08.770> got<00:02:10.110> marked<00:02:11.110> up<00:02:11.200> with<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.410> positive

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
you've got marked up with the positive

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.580 
you've got marked up with the positive
and<00:02:12.150> negative<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:14.230> same<00:02:14.470> on<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.010> drill

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
and negative and the same on the drill

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.320 
and negative and the same on the drill
positive<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.830> negative<00:02:18.550> which<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.940> tells<00:02:19.180> you

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
positive and negative which it tells you

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.190 
positive and negative which it tells you
on<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.510> old<00:02:19.900> drill<00:02:20.260> which<00:02:21.040> way<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.340> goes<00:02:21.550> in

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
on the old drill which way it goes in

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.050 
on the old drill which way it goes in
then<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:23.590> put<00:02:24.250> some<00:02:24.370> insulation<00:02:24.610> tape

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
then you just put some insulation tape

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.760 
then you just put some insulation tape
around<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.660> one<00:02:25.840> I've<00:02:25.959> taken<00:02:26.170> them<00:02:26.290> off<00:02:26.470> just

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
around that one I've taken them off just

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.760 
around that one I've taken them off just
to<00:02:26.890> show<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:28.330> couple<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:28.900> cable<00:02:29.260> ties<00:02:29.440> just

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
to show you a couple of cable ties just

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.610 
to show you a couple of cable ties just
to<00:02:29.860> keep<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.820> wires<00:02:31.120> together<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.540> then<00:02:32.410> all

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
to keep the wires together and then all

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.990 
to keep the wires together and then all
you<00:02:32.740> do<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:34.330> fits<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.810> there<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:36.370> pushes<00:02:36.850> up

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
you do it fits in there just pushes up

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.420 
you do it fits in there just pushes up
spring<00:02:37.420> tension<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.739> away<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.010> go<00:02:39.130> that's

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
spring tension and away you go that's

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.520 
spring tension and away you go that's
under<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.760> drill<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.140> on<00:02:41.290> slow

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
under the drill and this is on slow

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.210 
under the drill and this is on slow
speed<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.270> plenty<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.300> talk<00:02:43.709> all<00:02:44.709> over<00:02:44.739> added

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
speed and plenty of talk all over added

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.130 
speed and plenty of talk all over added
is<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:46.560> chinstrap<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:49.360> holds<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.930> battery

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
is a chinstrap so it holds the battery

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.190 
is a chinstrap so it holds the battery
and<00:02:51.630> if<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.750> want<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.959> hold<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.959> works

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
and if you want to hold it in it works

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.709 
and if you want to hold it in it works
fine<00:02:58.709> okay
