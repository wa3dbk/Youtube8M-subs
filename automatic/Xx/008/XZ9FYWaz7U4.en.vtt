00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
of all three of those so you really have

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.070 
of all three of those so you really have
a<00:04:28.790> bunch<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:29.910> customization<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:30.930> can

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.570 
a bunch of customization that you can
get<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.530> I'm<00:04:31.680> going<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.860> talk<00:04:32.010> about<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.310> little

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
get to I'm going to talk about a little

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.700 
get to I'm going to talk about a little
bit<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.700> it<00:04:32.880> in<00:04:32.970> this<00:04:33.060> video<00:04:33.419> but<00:04:34.260> there's<00:04:34.470> so

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
bit of it in this video but there's so

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.670 
bit of it in this video but there's so
much<00:04:34.889> of<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.220> i'll<00:04:35.400> probably<00:04:35.729> only<00:04:36.720> scratch

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
much of it i'll probably only scratch

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.719 
much of it i'll probably only scratch
the<00:04:37.710> surface<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.710> this<00:04:43.890> first<00:04:44.010> boot<00:04:44.280> up<00:04:44.430> takes

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
the surface so this first boot up takes

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.730 
the surface so this first boot up takes
a<00:04:44.970> little<00:04:45.780> bit<00:04:45.960> longer<00:04:46.169> than<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.560> normally

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
a little bit longer than it normally

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.850 
a little bit longer than it normally
would<00:04:47.060> don't<00:04:48.060> panic<00:04:48.500> give<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.620> two<00:04:49.740> or<00:04:49.830> three

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
would don't panic give it two or three

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.400 
would don't panic give it two or three
minutes<00:04:50.130> if<00:04:50.910> it<00:04:51.090> goes<00:04:51.210> on<00:04:51.419> longer<00:04:51.960> than<00:04:52.110> five

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
minutes if it goes on longer than five

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.279 
minutes if it goes on longer than five
minutes<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.830> may<00:04:52.979> have<00:04:53.160> an<00:04:53.280> issue<00:04:53.430> but<00:04:54.300> two<00:04:55.200> or

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
minutes you may have an issue but two or

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.710 
minutes you may have an issue but two or
three<00:04:55.440> minutes<00:04:55.560> mmm<00:04:56.550> it's<00:04:56.880> normal<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.419> first

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
three minutes mmm it's normal the first

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.390 
three minutes mmm it's normal the first
time<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.140> boot<00:04:58.289> up<00:04:58.470> after<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:58.860> flashed<00:04:59.190> a<00:04:59.370> new

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
time you boot up after you flashed a new

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.670 
time you boot up after you flashed a new
rom<00:05:03.289> so<00:05:04.289> i<00:05:04.860> think<00:05:05.370> i'm<00:05:05.580> going<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:05.820> jump<00:05:06.000> ahead

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
rom so i think i'm going to jump ahead

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.440

right here with his rom control you got

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.640 
right here with his rom control you got
your<00:06:56.889> AO<00:06:57.490> KP<00:06:58.060> settings<00:06:58.479> and<00:06:58.659> one<00:06:59.199> step<00:06:59.440> below
