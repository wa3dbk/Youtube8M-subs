it's been one big announcement after
another<00:00:03.449> when<00:00:03.629> it<00:00:03.659> comes<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.080> space<00:00:04.700> and

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
another when it comes to space and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.009 
another when it comes to space and
especially<00:00:06.330> Mars<00:00:07.550> now<00:00:08.550> they've<00:00:08.790> told<00:00:09.059> us<00:00:09.210> here

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
especially Mars now they've told us here

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.350 
especially Mars now they've told us here
just<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> past<00:00:10.679> year<00:00:10.940> that<00:00:11.940> there<00:00:12.179> have

been multiple discoveries you're talking

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.160 
been multiple discoveries you're talking
planets<00:00:15.139> or<00:00:16.139> moons<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:17.039> planets<00:00:17.580> especially

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
planets or moons of planets especially

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.400 
planets or moons of planets especially
that<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.410> layers<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.250> ice<00:00:20.720> or<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> lot<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.199> ice

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that have layers of ice or a lot of ice

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.240 
that have layers of ice or a lot of ice
or<00:00:22.740> massive<00:00:23.550> oceans<00:00:24.180> underneath<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.320> crust<00:00:26.099> of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
or massive oceans underneath a crust of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.939 
or massive oceans underneath a crust of
ice<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> lot<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> water<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.320> there<00:00:28.349> they're

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
ice so a lot of water out there they're

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.749 
ice so a lot of water out there they're
saying<00:00:29.300> when<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> comes<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.720> Mars<00:00:31.279> it<00:00:32.279> seems<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
saying when it comes to Mars it seems to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
saying when it comes to Mars it seems to
be<00:00:32.880> no<00:00:33.030> different<00:00:33.450> because<00:00:33.780> they<00:00:34.079> state<00:00:34.380> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
be no different because they state that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.940 
be no different because they state that
it<00:00:35.250> had<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.270> water<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.800> question<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it had a lot of water on it question is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.229 
it had a lot of water on it question is
what<00:00:38.520> happened<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
what happened to it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.030 
what happened to it
well<00:00:39.899> now<00:00:40.079> they're<00:00:40.290> saying<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.800> there's

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
well now they're saying that there's

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.709 
well now they're saying that there's
belts<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:42.500> glaciers<00:00:43.500> buried<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.670> Mars<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
belts of glaciers buried on Mars that

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
belts of glaciers buried on Mars that
still<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.530> lots<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> water<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.789> them<00:00:49.550> could

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
still have lots of water in them could

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
still have lots of water in them could
you<00:00:50.640> imagine<00:00:51.079> they<00:00:52.079> could<00:00:52.110> find<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.620> way<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
you imagine they could find a way to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.380 
you imagine they could find a way to
release<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:55.680> seems<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.120> big

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
release this it seems to be one big

release this it seems to be one big
announcement<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> time<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:59.149> and<00:01:00.440> now

announcement at a time here and now
they're<00:01:01.739> saying<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.039> these<00:01:02.250> belts<00:01:02.820> are

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
they're saying that these belts are

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.109 
they're saying that these belts are
situated<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.250> northern<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.850> southern

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
situated in the northern and southern

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.179 
situated in the northern and southern
hemisphere<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.549> here

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
hemisphere and you can see right here

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.710 
hemisphere and you can see right here
and<00:01:12.290> they're<00:01:13.290> arranged<00:01:13.970> kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> weird<00:01:15.479> they

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and they're arranged kind of weird they

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.359 
and they're arranged kind of weird they
say<00:01:17.570> they<00:01:18.570> sit<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.710> latitudes<00:01:20.189> between

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
say they sit at the latitudes between

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.320 
say they sit at the latitudes between
300<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.330> 500<00:01:21.630> which<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.860> earth<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.850> just

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
300 and 500 which on earth that is just

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.719 
300 and 500 which on earth that is just
south<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:25.040> Denmark's<00:01:26.040> position<00:01:28.700> here's<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
south of Denmark's position here's a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.240 
south of Denmark's position here's a
shot<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.119> them<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.600> they're<00:01:33.930> saying<00:01:34.259> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
shot of them so they're saying that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.240 
shot of them so they're saying that
these<00:01:35.790> glaciers<00:01:36.409> have<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.590> equivalent<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
these glaciers have the equivalent to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.319 
these glaciers have the equivalent to
over<00:01:38.659> 150<00:01:39.659> billion<00:01:40.340> cubic<00:01:41.340> meters<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.909> ice<00:01:42.420> now

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
over 150 billion cubic meters of ice now

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.300 
over 150 billion cubic meters of ice now
that<00:01:45.329> much<00:01:45.630> ice<00:01:45.869> could<00:01:46.409> cover<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.860> entire

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that much ice could cover the entire

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.399 
that much ice could cover the entire
surface<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:48.060> Mars<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.960> 1.1<00:01:49.950> meters<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.579> ice

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
surface of Mars with 1.1 meters of ice

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.600 
surface of Mars with 1.1 meters of ice
that's<00:01:52.409> how<00:01:52.710> much<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that's how much is so and you have to

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.179 
that's how much is so and you have to
remember<00:01:56.790> Mars<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.450> smaller<00:01:57.920> smaller<00:01:58.920> than

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
remember Mars is smaller smaller than

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.319 
remember Mars is smaller smaller than
Earth<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:01.250> finding<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.460> much<00:02:02.700> water<00:02:03.030> there

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
Earth so finding this much water there

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.010 
Earth so finding this much water there
is<00:02:03.890> significant<00:02:04.890> or<00:02:05.040> ice<00:02:05.790> all<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.659> has<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.780> do

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
is significant or ice all it has to do

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.830 
is significant or ice all it has to do
is<00:02:07.140> melt<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:08.090> they're<00:02:09.090> gonna<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.390> water<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
is melt and they're gonna have water and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.970 
is melt and they're gonna have water and
mass<00:02:10.050> amounts<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:12.840> big<00:02:13.080> announcement

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
mass amounts so one big announcement

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.059 
mass amounts so one big announcement
time<00:02:14.690> basically<00:02:15.690> they've<00:02:16.319> just<00:02:16.560> came<00:02:16.800> out<00:02:16.950> and

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
time basically they've just came out and

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.500 
time basically they've just came out and
stated<00:02:18.349> there's<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.440> whole<00:02:19.680> lot<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.890> water<00:02:20.129> here

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
stated there's a whole lot of water here

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.710 
stated there's a whole lot of water here
guys<00:02:21.709> where<00:02:22.709> there's<00:02:22.950> water<00:02:23.250> all<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.510> this

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
guys where there's water all of this

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.020 
guys where there's water all of this
there<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.379> life<00:02:26.239> I'll<00:02:27.239> leave<00:02:27.780> links<00:02:28.580> eyes<00:02:29.580> to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
there is life I'll leave links eyes to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.360 
there is life I'll leave links eyes to
the<00:02:30.090> skies
