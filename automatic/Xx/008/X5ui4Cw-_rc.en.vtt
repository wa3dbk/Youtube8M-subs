00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.089
 hello how about you salute duch sativa and 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.890
 this time we have to talk about the 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:08.660
 playstation 4 good yesterday 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.090
 pretty good before untying he spoke 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.519
 much of the xbox 1 and so on and now he plays 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.230
 talk about the playstation 4 what we're going 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.230
 to listen is a rumor and we are going to do 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.850
 the sony people confirm this or not the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.070
 which says that 3.5 gigas if of the 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.350
 playstation 4 is reserved for the 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.660
 operating system we all know that the 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.090
 Playstation 4 will have 8 GB of memory 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.770
 ram if I'm not wrong this report is good 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.930
 I suggest next that the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.920
 videogame developers are going to 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.190
 be able to use less than 70% of memory 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.079
 ram of the playstation 4 if the new 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:51.440
 console I repeat has 8 gigs of ddr 5 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.199
 there is said a total memory 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.079
 and well, it's going to require 3.5 of 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.219
 memory for the operating system of the 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.190
 playstation 4 and leaving 4.5 gigabytes 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.900
 available for video games this 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.820
 this even because they say that a giga 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.590
 will be as flexible reserve or that 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.900
 the other good I do not know about computers 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.030
 but people know computer 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.950
 there I was reading some things and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.390
 I am informing myself and many people of pc 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.220
 but you can confirm what can 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.170
 deny you people of pc who knows 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.480
 computers on the next occasion that 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.480
 for a good play console game 4 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.180
 and xbox 1 with only 5.5 gigabytes 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.130
 enough but we are talking about 4.5 the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.150
 precision 4 so it's not going to have very 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.600
 good not to have good quality 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.070
 but I repeat this what can they can 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.840
 find is or can I 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.120
 affirm those who know about pc and 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.100
 videogames not anybody because no longer a 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.020
 person who knows no but repeats 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.960
 only a rumor which has left 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.360
 many people with their mouths open saying 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.760
 that if war is the typical fanboy 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.909
 you already know that the xbox is better than it is going 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.100
 starting with the play 4 good 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.979
 but let's see let's see let's see 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.649
 is not I do not know how much the 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.929
 xbox 1 to run game has not been said 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.759
 nothing yet but the 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.849
 first report of playstation 4 which 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.500
 I repeat, the war of the 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.390
 saying that play is rubbish now 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.720
 I happened to the xbox typical comments 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.560
 I hope that does not happen here, not because 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.799
 usa but you know the rumor to be true 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.410
 it would only work 4 points 4.5 gigas 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.660
 Memory game 3.5 for 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.910
 station operating system and out there 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.450
 suddenly one out there telling them a 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.769
 jig 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.930
 it will not be virtual it is not flexible 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.940

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.849

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.099
 it's true I think long games 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.599
 they have five points something of 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.590
 gigabytes of ram memory up to where I 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.230
 I know but well I think 4.5 gigabyte like 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.920
