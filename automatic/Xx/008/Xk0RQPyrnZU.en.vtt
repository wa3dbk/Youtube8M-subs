00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.957
Today, we dive into the world of Son Goku and his friends. We'll present you interesting facts about the anime "Dragonball".

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.840
The manga comic series Dragonball was created by the Japanese artist Akira Toriyama.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.000
From 1984 to 1995 it was featured in the manga magazine "Weekly Shōnen Jump" and after that also published in 42 separate volumes. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.020
Even as a kid, Akira Toriyama was a huge fan of classical animation

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.340
After watching Disney's 101 Dalmatians, he decided to start drawing himself. 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:44.700
With about 156 million copies sold in Japan and 230 million sold worldwide, Dragonball is the second most-sold manga of all time after "One Piece".  

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.320
The story follows the adventures of protagonist Son-Goku and his friends. 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.800
Together, they go on a quest to find the seven Dragonballs. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.160
Who finds those seven Dragonballs is awarded with one wish. That of course attracts many villains who strive for immortality and world domination. 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.480
By now, 18 Dragonball motion pictures, 3 TV movies and 32 video games were produced. 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.520
In addition to the books, the story was told in the anime tv shows Dragonball, Dragonball Z &amp; Dragonball GT

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.600
In Dragonball, Son-Goku is still a child. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.860
Dragonball Z is set four years after that.  The "Z" stands for Son-Goku's team, the Z Fighters.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.800
Dragonball GT is set even further in the future.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.800
In this series, Son-Goku and his granddaughter Pan travel though outer space in search for the "Super Dragonballs". 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.920
It is rumored that Dragonball GT was continued as a fan project. 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.340
The rumor is a result of an Aprils Fool's joke by Dragonball inventor Toriyama in which he announced a new series "Dragonball AF"

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.000
As a result to the joke, disappointed Fans created teasers &amp; trailers for the "fake series" -- which eventually never was produced. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.500
A huge part of the shows are the fight scenes. Some of them even stretch over several episodes

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.680
for example the fight between Son Goku &amp; Freezer which lasted over 13 episodes. 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:14.220
The name of the most popular attack, the „Kamehameha", refers to a famous Hawaiian King, who led Hawaii to prosperity in the 17th century.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.020
Akira Toriyama chose the name on his wife's advice in order to honor that king. 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.660
Garlic Junior is the only villain who asked the Dragonballs for immortality. 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.560
Further wishes included eternal youth, new underpants and also the return of deceased characters.  

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.280
In Dragonball Z, Son-Goku discovers that he is not from Earth, but a descendant of the warrior race "Saiyajin". 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.860
They have the special ability to multiply their combat power after they've successfully recovered from a fight. 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:56.080
In his top form, Son-Goku can lift 160.000 tons and his flying speed reaches 2.3 times the speed of light.  

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.500
The last episode of Dragonball Z was first aired on April 7th, 2003. That was more than 11 years ago! 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:12.460
The names of the 3 Dragonball Z characters Bibidi, Babidi und Boo were inspired by the spell / song of the good fairy in Disney's Cinderella. 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.160
The name of Son-Gokus race „Saiyajin" is a play on words

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.320
If you switch around the letters, you get the word "yasai", which means "vegetables" in Japanese. The suffix "Jin" stands for "race".    

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.940
At a martial arts competition, Son-Gokus coach participates under the pseudonym Jackie Chun 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.780
which is of course a reference to the actor Jackie Chan. 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.580
It is said that the character "Korin" was modeled after "Akira Toriyama's cat... 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.040
which was sleeping when Toriyama draw the character -- that's why Korins eyes are closed most of the time.  

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.280
The famous internet meme „over 9000" is actually a translation error. 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.620
In the original show the power level of Son-Goku  is described as "over 8000". 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:57.080
If you post the words „It's over 9000" on twitter, a tweet bot named „DBZ Nappa" will answer „What, Nine Thousand???"

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.680
In 2013 the Film „Dragonball Z, Battle of Gods" was released in Japan.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.680
It is set in the time between Dragonball Z &amp; Dragonball GT

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.500
It is the first digitally animated Dragonball movie and the first vital sign of the Dragonball series after more than 17 years. 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.680
After the 2013 movie, the producers mentioned in an interview that 200 new episodes are being planned.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.220
But wouldn't that require new mangas in the first place? 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.960
But nevermind - as a huge Dragonball fan, I'm excited about the news and I hope you enjoyed watching my video.
