I don't know why I have
this<00:01:58.930> one<00:01:59.080> up<00:01:59.200> yet<00:01:59.380> but<00:01:59.760> again<00:02:00.760> it's<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.030> short

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.700 
this one up yet but again it's a short
read<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.570> I<00:02:01.600> think<00:02:01.780> it's<00:02:01.900> one<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:02.200> i<00:02:02.440> can

a collection of short stories kind of

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.580 
a collection of short stories kind of
slice<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.330> life<00:02:40.600> from<00:02:40.989> these<00:02:41.200> kind<00:02:41.470> of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
slice of life from these kind of

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.820 
slice of life from these kind of
unordinary<00:02:42.459> people<00:02:43.060> there<00:02:43.480> stay<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.530> just

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
unordinary people there stay to just

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.710 
unordinary people there stay to just
being<00:02:45.130> heartbreaking<00:02:45.910> but<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.209> prose<00:02:46.480> is

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
being heartbreaking but the prose is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.199 
being heartbreaking but the prose is
really<00:02:46.989> simple<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.800> straightforward<00:02:48.489> and

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
really simple and straightforward and

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.300 
really simple and straightforward and
since<00:02:49.390> I'm<00:02:49.510> getting<00:02:49.810> into<00:02:50.260> short<00:02:50.650> stories<00:02:51.070> at

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
since I'm getting into short stories at

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.580 
since I'm getting into short stories at
the<00:02:51.520> moment<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:52.120> think<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.380> kind

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
the moment I think that this is a kind

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.920 
the moment I think that this is a kind
of<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.770> quintessential<00:02:54.570> collection<00:02:55.570> so

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
of a quintessential collection so

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.750 
of a quintessential collection so
hopefully<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:56.830> get<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.160> at<00:02:57.459> least<00:02:57.580> in

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
hopefully I can get to that at least in

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.520 
hopefully I can get to that at least in
the<00:02:57.820> new<00:02:57.970> year<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.300> those<00:02:58.930> are<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.140> three

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
the new year and those are the three

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.780
