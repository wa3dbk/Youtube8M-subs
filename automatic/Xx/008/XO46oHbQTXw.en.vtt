 easy to just give a click is free and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.580

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.740
 pillow novels say 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.810
 finally a lot of legal accounting stuff 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.480
 will be posted here the video lessons 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:42.590
 reports all about the world 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:42.590
 accounting and 12 2010 public tender 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:28.200
 salary is very interesting for those who 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:02:01.590
 study accounting sciences 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:02:06.060
 now 52 solve the case 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.399
 he said that the board is yes 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.979
 management is expense so we can 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.180
 confirm because everything related to 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.909
 senior business analyst 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.709
 it is not related to production at the 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:21.159
 factory floor is expense 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.629
 then the board is a sales expense 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.209
 also the expense 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.909
 After all, every effort is made to 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:33.819
 sell ready-made product is considered 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:36.219
 an extra expense then but how are we 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.650
 studying and we'll then there is an emphasis 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:41.040
 the other alternatives see why they 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.040
 they are wrong 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:50.650
 Board hours are an expense 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:53.409
 yes but from the factory injunction because of 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.150
 of the factory insurance issue 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.150
 a tip is very good 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.639
 in the case of the exercise with that word 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.530
 factory-related production costs 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:12.730
 with words like director 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:18.729
 to the board of directors of 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:22.799
 management has nothing to do with the 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:34.799
 production of the product would be all expenses 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:34.799
 because of the cost of production 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.470
 W 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.990
 costs are also eliminating the letter b 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.050
 the letter and raw material and cost all 

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:26.760
 world knows raw material echoes we eliminate 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:29.280
 labor is also cost and expense - 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:05:08.910
 two courses then because of these two 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:05:12.180
 courses here generally do not understand 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:18.200
 pretty much what you leave doubts the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:21.560
 channel or accounting tv.com 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.810
 answer them being the rest of doubt 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.530
 very important on the tip of the tongue 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.300
 every time in a public tender with 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.330
 efficiency is of paramount importance 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.260
 Thank you very much. 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.510

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.170
