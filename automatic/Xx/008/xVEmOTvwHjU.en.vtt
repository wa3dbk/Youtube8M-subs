00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 or 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.100
 I hope we see a quick match with 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.020
 intensity and many goals 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.020
 and team can undo the tie 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.520
 turned the defense into attack 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.909
 and they lost the ball 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.730
 they could open the score and take a 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.680
 good center 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.680
 they will be able to continue defending themselves 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.020
 look for someone to help you 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.810
 he came in abruptly committing 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.810
 free shot 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 31 and the shot went over the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.329
 really watch that has no technique 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.479
 nor precision to mark from there a 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.320
 missed opportunity seeks space for the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.080
 left side 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.450
 we know that there is brass and well 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.740
 we are moving well on the right or 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.740
 I feel inside the planet 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.870
 we already have two goals here in this 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.870
 match the score is 11 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.650
 they maintain the position 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.200
 sneaks 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.780
 very well found 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.280
 that value is for the goalkeeper 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.280
 this seems dangerous 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.990
 no one to go to continue with the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.990
 ball 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.030
 the attack was useless 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.030
 and he gives it to him again 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.890
 and they stole the ball good opportunity 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.720
 the gold is not yours there is defended well not 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.760
 has finished yet 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.040
 if you get a good center you can have 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.540
 possibilities to mark 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.540
 and I will try to take it
