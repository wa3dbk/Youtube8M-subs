what's<00:05:40.470> going<00:05:40.710> on<00:05:40.860> right<00:05:41.040> here<00:05:41.100> now<00:05:41.580> if<00:05:41.610> you

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
what's going on right here now if you

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.160 
what's going on right here now if you
look<00:05:41.910> in<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.120> sky<00:05:42.210> this<00:05:42.510> is<00:05:42.630> basically<00:05:42.930> what

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
look in the sky this is basically what

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.170 
look in the sky this is basically what
my<00:05:43.320> idea<00:05:43.620> was<00:05:43.860> let's<00:05:44.070> think<00:05:44.610> about<00:05:44.640> go<00:05:45.000> back

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
my idea was let's think about go back

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.270 
my idea was let's think about go back
all<00:05:45.450> the<00:05:45.480> way<00:05:45.630> to<00:05:45.750> where<00:05:46.050> Superman<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:46.890> Hal

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
all the way to where Superman and Hal

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.240 
all the way to where Superman and Hal
Jordan<00:05:47.730> were<00:05:47.940> in<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.330> air<00:05:48.510> together<00:05:48.980> the<00:05:49.980> sky

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
Jordan were in the air together the sky

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.160 
Jordan were in the air together the sky
looked<00:05:50.610> basically<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.270> same<00:05:51.510> color<00:05:51.840> as<00:05:52.050> it

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
looked basically the same color as it

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.220 
looked basically the same color as it
does<00:05:52.350> right<00:05:52.590> now<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:53.780> basically<00:05:54.780> we're

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
does right now and basically we're

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.870 
does right now and basically we're
getting<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.560> whole<00:05:55.770> bunch<00:05:55.950> of<00:05:56.130> Atlantean

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.140 
just then you got a great glimpse at

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.530 
just then you got a great glimpse at
what<00:07:10.650> looks<00:07:11.280> like<00:07:11.310> to<00:07:11.430> me<00:07:11.520> either<00:07:11.880> a<00:07:12.120> stage

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540 
what looks like to me either a stage

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.790 
what looks like to me either a stage
transition<00:07:13.230> or<00:07:14.660> you<00:07:15.660> know<00:07:15.780> Aquaman<00:07:16.470> super

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
transition or you know Aquaman super

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.490 
transition or you know Aquaman super
move<00:07:16.980> I'm<00:07:17.910> fine<00:07:18.300> with<00:07:18.450> it<00:07:18.540> being<00:07:18.720> either<00:07:18.990> you

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 
move I'm fine with it being either you

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.140 
move I'm fine with it being either you
know<00:07:19.590> the<00:07:19.710> Sharks<00:07:20.010> coming<00:07:20.190> out<00:07:20.400> and<00:07:20.610> attacking

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
know the Sharks coming out and attacking

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.760 
know the Sharks coming out and attacking
them<00:07:21.390> what<00:07:21.840> I'm<00:07:21.930> assuming<00:07:22.170> is<00:07:22.470> going<00:07:22.710> to

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
them what I'm assuming is going to

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.310 
them what I'm assuming is going to
happen<00:07:23.040> is<00:07:23.160> a<00:07:23.370> tidal<00:07:23.940> wave<00:07:23.970> comes<00:07:24.390> in<00:07:24.600> and<00:07:24.840> then

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.320 
happen is a tidal wave comes in and then

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.310 
happen is a tidal wave comes in and then
as<00:07:25.620> you're<00:07:25.860> in<00:07:25.980> the<00:07:26.070> tidal<00:07:26.280> wave<00:07:27.110> sharks<00:07:28.110> come

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.320 
as you're in the tidal wave sharks come

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.560 
as you're in the tidal wave sharks come
in<00:07:28.440> and<00:07:28.620> attack<00:07:28.920> you<00:07:29.160> and<00:07:29.400> then<00:07:29.730> maybe<00:07:29.940> Aquaman

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
in and attack you and then maybe Aquaman

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.970
