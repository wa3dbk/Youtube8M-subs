00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.860
 Reverse Hand + Double Water &lt;Verbatped Draft: Li Mingjuan's Manuscript: Li Tanku&gt; 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.160
 This is the first course we have around 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.020
 "Reverse hand" plus "two points of water" to unlock, first demonstration 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.360
 &lt;&lt;Action demonstration&gt;&gt; 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.920
 "Reverse hand" is the most basic movement in our "hands around" movement, it is very important! So be sure to! 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.320
 &lt;&lt;Basic skills&gt;&gt; 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.520
 Basic skill: "Basic bell" The bell speed is enough. After the bell is turned on, it is better to be more than 20 seconds. 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:56.280
 Basic skills: "Let's go to the left and right water" is best, because the end of the action requires some water to unlock the bell 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.240
 But if you don't get some water, there are other solutions, but it's best to learn some water first. 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.300
 &lt;&lt;Decomposition teaching&gt;&gt; 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.340
 Now I’m going to start explaining the reverse hand. 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.640
 1. Bell, bell speed is enough, first "open the line" 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.300
 2. Go to the side, elbow line 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.180
 3. After the pressure line, Dam pushes the right hand stick and hooks up from the bottom up. 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.520
 4. Let the left hand go out and let the bell go. 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.740
 5. Put all the lines to the right hand 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.320
 6. Pull the bell "toward, go up" to the rear 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.140
 7. When the bell comes back, you will find that there is a "cross line" that has not been unlocked. 8. "Left hand" two water points 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.880
 9. Put it down and unlock it. 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.800
 &lt;&lt;Common errors&gt;&gt; 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.540
 Wrong: "The back of the line is too high." Many people are behind the line and this action is too high. 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.860
 This is also done 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.400
 But the bell is easier to see, pay attention to 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.220
 Key reminder: "Put the right hand line out." Right hand thumb must be "pressed out of the stick" 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.280
 Otherwise, the club head is not taken out, the line will be too short, it is difficult to hook the bell. 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.560
 It’s better to push the stick out. 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.880
 Key reminder: "Take the left hand line to the right hand and then squat" When you have finished before 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.260
 Before the bell, the line will be returned to the right hand as much as possible. 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.020
 Error demonstration: the line of the right hand is too short, the bell is easy to fly out 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.540
 &lt;&lt;Extension action&gt;&gt; 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:53.880
 Extended action: "Continuous reverse hand" 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.080
 1. Reverse the hand 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.860
 2. Left hand water 3. Right hand down to ring the bell 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.340
 After cooking, you can continue to do it without water. 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.620
 Extension action: "Extension of the hook bell" Because the check is done after the completion, the actions related to the hook can be done. 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.660
 Such as "spider netting" 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:29.480
 "turn around" 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.660
 This set is very important! 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.480
 Thanks for watching
