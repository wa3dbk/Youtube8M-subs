00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
this provides a little bit more

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.450 
this provides a little bit more
protection<00:01:10.710> than<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.909> regular<00:01:12.090> snap<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:14.509> and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460

into some cases that have better
coverage<00:03:02.180> better<00:03:03.049> protection<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:04.250> course

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
coverage better protection of course

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.699 
coverage better protection of course
this<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.120> otterbox<00:03:05.720> this<00:03:05.989> is<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.260> Commuter

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
because on this communication it

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.309 
because on this communication it
actually<00:03:26.599> has<00:03:26.780> more<00:03:27.049> coverage<00:03:27.860> on<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.040> front

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319

don't<00:03:30.319> normally<00:03:30.590> see<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:34.480> then<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.629> put

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
don't normally see that and then you put

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.030 
don't normally see that and then you put
on<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.109> hardshell<00:03:36.609> making<00:03:37.609> sure<00:03:37.790> that<00:03:38.060> you

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
on the hardshell making sure that you

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.729 
on the hardshell making sure that you
free<00:03:40.040> up<00:03:40.160> all<00:03:40.340> your<00:03:40.489> ports<00:03:41.420> here<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.349> know

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.380 

as<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:48.890> can<00:03:48.980> see<00:03:49.129> this<00:03:49.280> provides<00:03:49.670> really<00:03:50.120> good

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
as you can see this provides really good

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
as you can see this provides really good
coverage<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:53.299> dual<00:03:53.510> layer<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:53.930> can<00:03:53.989> feel<00:03:54.379> it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
coverage the dual layer you can feel it

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.140 
coverage the dual layer you can feel it
I<00:03:54.620> mean<00:03:54.769> it<00:03:54.890> does<00:03:55.040> make<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.400> phone<00:03:55.609> feel<00:03:56.120> a

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
I mean it does make the phone feel a

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.000 
I mean it does make the phone feel a
little<00:03:56.359> thicker<00:03:56.690> these<00:03:56.989> other<00:03:57.230> cases<00:03:57.500> here

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
little thicker these other cases here

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.270 
little thicker these other cases here
really<00:03:58.819> don't<00:03:59.000> increase<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.510> size<00:03:59.720> of<00:04:00.280> the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
really don't increase the size of the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.180 
really don't increase the size of the
phone<00:04:01.549> but<00:04:01.880> when<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.599> move<00:04:02.780> into<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:03.410> better

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190

protective<00:04:05.150> shell<00:04:05.419> like<00:04:06.169> otterbox<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:08.569> it's

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
protective shell like otterbox and it's

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:24.590 
protective shell like otterbox and it's
even<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:09.109> pain<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.410> take<00:04:09.560> off
