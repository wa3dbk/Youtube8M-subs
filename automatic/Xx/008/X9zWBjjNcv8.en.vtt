00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
this time since we plan on doing this

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:54.680 
this time since we plan on doing this
with<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:42.990> brushstroke<00:03:43.380> on<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.100> camels

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.220 

and<00:03:56.310> here<00:03:57.310> we're<00:03:57.489> going<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.970> gently<00:03:58.360> twist<00:03:59.050> the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
and here we're going to gently twist the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.830 
and here we're going to gently twist the
brush<00:03:59.500> around<00:03:59.739> in<00:04:00.129> the<00:04:00.310> perfect<00:04:00.550> circle<00:04:01.120> or<00:04:01.720> as

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
brush around in the perfect circle or as

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.230 
brush around in the perfect circle or as
perfect<00:04:02.260> as<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.530> can<00:04:02.709> get<00:04:02.890> it

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.720 

this<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:07.020> in<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.290> perfect<00:04:07.530> example<00:04:07.920> but<00:04:08.550> you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
this is in the perfect example but you

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.460 
this is in the perfect example but you
get<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:08.970> idea

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
get the idea

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.710 
get the idea
but<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.400> good<00:04:11.670> example<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:12.240> show<00:04:12.360> what

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
but this is a good example to show what

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.650 
but this is a good example to show what
can<00:04:12.840> happen<00:04:13.050> if<00:04:13.320> your<00:04:13.470> paint<00:04:13.770> is<00:04:13.920> too<00:04:14.190> dry<00:04:14.660> when

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
can happen if your paint is too dry when

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.020 
can happen if your paint is too dry when
you<00:04:15.810> go<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:15.990> blend<00:04:16.459> let's<00:04:17.459> see<00:04:17.670> it's<00:04:17.790> starting

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you go to blend let's see it's starting

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.199 
you go to blend let's see it's starting
to<00:04:18.269> cake<00:04:18.510> up<00:04:18.720> on<00:04:18.930> me<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.370> didn't<00:04:20.370> make<00:04:20.730> my<00:04:20.940> paint

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
to cake up on me I didn't make my paint

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.300 
to cake up on me I didn't make my paint
wet<00:04:21.450> enough<00:04:21.720> before<00:04:22.230> I<00:04:22.290> went<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.830> took<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.070> to

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
wet enough before I went and took it to

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:33.530 
wet enough before I went and took it to
the<00:04:23.340> canvas
