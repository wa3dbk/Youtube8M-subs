00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 good morning to all of you guys it's not little 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.460
 today I'm here with a new video of the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.480
 red series are pro or better today is not 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.980
 own income a little because of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.450
 wrightson there is little and nothing but everywhere 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.099
 I'm here to deal with one of the things 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.019
 funniest I've ever found in 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.790
 minecraft and of course you can 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.800
 replicate you too in your worlds both 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.510
 single player that multiplayer but it 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.760
 same time in both creative and non-creative 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.529
 creative then very important though 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.420
 that you follow these steps well her 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.580
 the idea was not mine I found it on 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.289
 a you tube rams English youtuber 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.789
 however try leaving linke 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.949
 description if I remember why I am 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.200
 a prosperous chronic forgetful of 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 remember I see what it consists of 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.020
 before leaving as you do then if 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.430
 note here if it's a fence no ok 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.230
 interesting animals 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.930
 I can go through this thing 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.840
 which is a bit of a magnetic field a force 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.129
 field however animals cannot 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 practically makes sure that you create one 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.449
 door and then only go beyond the man 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.789
 but the npc the animals or any other 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.829
 what cannot go beyond it 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.600
 and we do not even find certain to see though 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.440
 this is a marginal soldier thing 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.879
 the animals 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.860
 watch this world test of 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.360
 cross obviously sometimes 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.310
 maybe for bagheri they come out though 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.540
 normally they should not succeed in 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.189
 to go through the penalty even to how much 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.950
 expense make this port which we will then notice 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.200
 I have to better in the island details you create 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.600
 a force field that something epic 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 tell the truth we give you another thing 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.920
 very interesting look here now 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.990
 I put myself in survive you see it 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 zombie attracted to me I know he wants me 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.710
 well anyway he wants to eat me what 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.170
 it can't go through 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 this kind of door I can switch into 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.259
 this case eats me a practitioner 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.729
 try to eat me as soon as I go 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.040
 on the other side 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.140
 nothing for him is over he no longer has 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.460
 hope to catch me is a door for 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.840
 nothing that the passage consists of 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.430
 usually of normal people while 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.009
 for all the rest it is a force field 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.920
 magnetic something epic at the base 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.390
 your noises ok now we notice immediately 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.250
 how do you build this thing 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.140
 because I think it's something brilliant 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.530
 then we first need to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.600
 know materials a porthole of the blocks from 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.420
 very simple construction to find 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.219
 any a fear of reil or any 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.840
 ray type left the powered because 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.290
 I like the powered rail is a lot 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.250
 simple 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.830
 we can use also wanting for example 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.660
 the art director rail the tears rail 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.600
 tower any kind of rail is not 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.130
 important is a lot and this is it 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.580
 reveals quite expensive in the modes 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.840
 normal minecraft with something inside 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.340
 then 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.470
 I mean you can take that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.680
 so minecraft minecraft chest minecraft 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.680
 excuse me but I wrap witch est but in 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.090
 card with four born with the tnt neck 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.500
 for all you want, it's enough 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.120
 is not the normal minecraft because mob 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.310
 they end up in it 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.830
 ok then now as we do then 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.700
 first we create a fence 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.770
 touch something like that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.770
 we decide where you have to admit the door 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.140
 in this case this is a fence 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.420
 horrible I want to put the door here 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.850
 on this block what I do the excavation 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.050
 two blocks in front of me I stand here 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.600
 I admit the rail 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.550
 you see that there is a small thickness of the 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.220
 rail and that this is this border that 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.510
 really microscopic I put myself here I press 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.230
 right with the cart 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.830
 now you see that I see you again on the edge 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.269
 of the thing and keep pressing right 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.519
 we must also do particular 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.260
 trident shift ati attention you succeed 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.350
 better and continue to place 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.540
 minecraft up about a fortnight 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.769
 twenty also depends on the results 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.560
 sometimes they manage to pass 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.820
 through if they put a few and for 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.680
 this point we put the two pegs 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.570
 side so that they remain locked 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.370
 at this point we will have our field of 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.519
 force totally created by us without 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.989
 no problem even the spiders 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.239
 on other mobs like that can 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.950
 crossing is something brilliant 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.930
 something very useful something that 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.880
 all of us we could use is 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.370
 just a little bit the cost because in the end 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.650
 15 mine cards are the type that stack of 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.690
 iron in the end to create however vi 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.280
 I assure you that you have a door like that 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.049
 something brilliant because you don't have to 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.930
 not even the animals will open it 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.579
 come out they don't enter the furniture either is 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.670
 something very useful now for 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.600
 prove it to you I take place of pique 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.920
 maybe we put some others but also 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.930
 to be sure I don't know how many 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.090
 I had seen so many are the 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.829
 creative and I can abound no I can't 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.970
 more to put it here than you know it well then 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.039
 now we do so we'll do some 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.919
 pighi we expose a little pighi for 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.780
 show you this stuff for how long 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.730
 overcrowding may be there 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.380
 pighi will never come out of this 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.510
 door while instead wanting I can 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.180
 enter to feed her they do not 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.050
 they will not be able to go out as president 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.150
 also very good for crops 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.740
 entry must eat there do you play 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.860
 then maybe on a cd 2 and you go outside 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.100
 happy with a smile on his lips 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.060
 I would like you to notice the last coconut on 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.960
 these are bugs here 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.340
 if you notice it really fails there is practical 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.260
 god what paid stuff 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:59.180
 perhaps they have put too many remedies 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:05:00.710
 immediately ok ok okay i know that i am 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.480
 it will be time to let it go 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.550
 now there are just a few e 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.020
 tired destroying perfect minecraft 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.180
 the lava destroys but in kart and true me 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.560
 I was forgotten though then now 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.030
 wanted to show the last thing one 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.040
 pretty nice thing or thing 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.669
 it can happen if you don't do it 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.900
 things correctly or you do so 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.000
 it seems please in this way 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.160
 let's place a lot of 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.870
 minecraft minecraft rail 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.640
 ok good boy and i want to put 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.060
 just enough I want to fill in 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.520
 inrail we put a blow and those methods 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.960
 rail out just so randomly and 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.650
 continue to run by if we see some 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.650
 the sounds to make you understand 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:47.009
 and wanting to go around the world and 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.960
 that is, I will return here first penalty 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.099
 will register sent out a type one 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.189
 quarter of an hour fi but turned back 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:55.650
 however recently in this field of 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.879
 strength is everything I thank you and you 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.870
 I hope this thing can be there 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.449
 useful against zombies 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.969
 be advised that in any case enough bankruptcy 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.689
 eh already because it is enough bankrupt 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:04.740
 stuff 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.780
 I don't know if there are any in the next ones 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.699
 versions anyway as long as he made us in 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.710
 the good use I recommend not crammed 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.330
 too many animals or in any case a number of 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.490
 enough carts could be there 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.560
 some bugs or they could get out of 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.719
 there is little to say to these animals 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.719
 something by saving money
