00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
lecturing so today's topic is toxic rain

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.609 
lecturing so today's topic is toxic rain
we're<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> talk<00:01:17.100> about<00:01:17.250> toxic<00:01:17.939> rain

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
we're going to talk about toxic rain

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.730 
we're going to talk about toxic rain
what<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> comes<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.240> how<00:01:21.290> we<00:01:22.290> can

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
what it comes from and how we can

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.270 
what it comes from and how we can
prevent<00:01:23.280> rain<00:01:24.180> from<00:01:24.509> being<00:01:24.750> toxic<00:01:25.080> by<00:01:26.009> being

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
prevent rain from being toxic by being

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.660 
prevent rain from being toxic by being
responsible<00:01:26.759> citizens<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.320> avoid<00:01:29.009> putting

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
responsible citizens and avoid putting

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.359 
responsible citizens and avoid putting
toxic<00:01:30.240> chemicals<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.079> our<00:01:31.259> lawns<00:01:31.560> blah<00:01:32.159> blah

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
toxic chemicals on our lawns blah blah

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.700 
toxic chemicals on our lawns blah blah
blah<00:01:32.579> let's<00:01:33.570> say<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> teacher<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.350> wants

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
blah let's say the teacher then wants

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
blah let's say the teacher then wants
you<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> diagram<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.759> she<00:01:36.150> has<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
you to do a diagram like she has on the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.980 
you to do a diagram like she has on the
board<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.880> rain<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> hit<00:01:39.810> this

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
board and so it's rain if you hit this

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.530 
board and so it's rain if you hit this
squiggly<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.070> freeform<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.210> here's

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
squiggly you can do freeform so here's

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.319 
squiggly you can do freeform so here's
the<00:01:42.720> rain<00:01:42.930> coming<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.250> here's<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
grass and here's a person pouring toxic

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.200 
grass and here's a person pouring toxic
chemicals<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:53.159> grass<00:01:55.399> which<00:01:56.399> seeps<00:01:56.700> into<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
chemicals the grass which seeps into the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.020 
chemicals the grass which seeps into the
earth<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> water<00:01:58.439> table<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.490> spreads

she's talking about that let's jump down

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.349 
she's talking about that let's jump down
to<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.739> negative<00:03:40.190> effects<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.790> recycling

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.030 

let's<00:03:47.359> go<00:03:47.540> back<00:03:47.750> up<00:03:47.930> here<00:03:48.139> to<00:03:48.169> recycling<00:03:48.889> we

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
let's go back up here to recycling we

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.110 
let's go back up here to recycling we
want<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.280> hear<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.519> part<00:03:49.819> of<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.000> lecture

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.449 

and<00:03:56.120> then<00:03:56.810> we<00:03:56.840> can<00:03:57.079> go<00:03:57.169> back<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.349> toxic<00:03:57.980> rain<00:03:58.220> if

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
and then we can go back to toxic rain if

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.770 
and then we can go back to toxic rain if
we<00:03:58.609> wanted<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:58.940> review<00:03:59.359> that<00:04:03.970> we<00:04:04.970> can<00:04:05.150> even<00:04:05.299> top

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
we wanted to review that we can even top

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.259 
we wanted to review that we can even top
a<00:04:06.019> tap<00:04:06.230> on<00:04:06.349> our<00:04:06.530> picture<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:07.250> go<00:04:07.430> back<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.120> what

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
a tap on our picture to go back to what

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:17.529 
a tap on our picture to go back to what
she<00:04:08.450> was<00:04:08.510> saying<00:04:08.599> while<00:04:08.989> we<00:04:09.139> were<00:04:09.260> drying<00:04:16.539> so

she was saying while we were drying so
it's<00:04:17.690> turning<00:04:18.079> blue<00:04:18.380> as<00:04:18.560> it<00:04:18.739> goes<00:04:18.919> across<00:04:19.570> so

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
it's turning blue as it goes across so

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.440 
it's turning blue as it goes across so
you<00:04:20.630> can<00:04:20.750> hit<00:04:20.900> pause<00:04:21.909> alright<00:04:22.909> so<00:04:23.150> it's<00:04:23.330> an

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
you can hit pause alright so it's an

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.540 
you can hit pause alright so it's an
easy<00:04:23.659> way<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.930> navigate<00:04:24.229> through<00:04:24.620> recorded

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
easy way to navigate through recorded

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.890 
easy way to navigate through recorded
information

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900

what she just wants the drawing so let's
just<00:05:02.720> do<00:05:03.020> PDF<00:05:05.800> otherwise<00:05:06.800> we<00:05:07.039> could<00:05:07.220> have

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
just do PDF otherwise we could have

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.450 
just do PDF otherwise we could have
recorded<00:05:07.639> our<00:05:07.910> thoughts<00:05:08.210> about<00:05:08.510> it<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.460> added

ask<00:05:58.099> for<00:05:58.280> a<00:05:58.460> name<00:05:58.699> will<00:05:59.150> type<00:05:59.330> in<00:05:59.539> science<00:06:02.889> say

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
ask for a name will type in science say

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:12.850 
ask for a name will type in science say
and<00:06:04.389> let's<00:06:05.389> do<00:06:05.539> a<00:06:05.570> math<00:06:05.870> folder<00:06:06.320> to<00:06:10.750> save<00:06:11.860> you

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
and let's do a math folder to save you

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.830 
and let's do a math folder to save you
can<00:06:13.039> see<00:06:13.130> you<00:06:13.220> could<00:06:13.400> do<00:06:13.580> subfolders<00:06:14.479> if<00:06:14.690> you

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
can see you could do subfolders if you

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.080 
can see you could do subfolders if you
wanted<00:06:15.169> to<00:06:15.349> like<00:06:15.710> further<00:06:16.160> divide<00:06:16.699> up<00:06:16.880> the

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
wanted to like further divide up the

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.210 
wanted to like further divide up the
science<00:06:17.510> folder<00:06:18.050> but<00:06:18.889> let's<00:06:19.190> be<00:06:19.400> done<00:06:19.580> done

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
science folder but let's be done done

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.920 
science folder but let's be done done
okay<00:06:22.220> so<00:06:22.430> now<00:06:23.150> we're<00:06:23.270> going<00:06:23.360> to<00:06:23.419> go<00:06:23.570> and<00:06:23.750> move

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
okay so now we're going to go and move

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.140 
okay so now we're going to go and move
our<00:06:24.320> notes<00:06:25.030> into<00:06:26.030> those<00:06:26.210> folders<00:06:27.130> so<00:06:28.150> we're

our notes into those folders so we're
going<00:06:29.330> to<00:06:30.220> tap<00:06:31.220> Edit<00:06:33.550> math<00:06:34.659> see<00:06:35.659> how<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:35.810> check

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
going to tap Edit math see how the check

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.839 
going to tap Edit math see how the check
is<00:06:36.289> there<00:06:36.560> now<00:06:36.950> we're<00:06:37.130> gonna<00:06:37.219> go<00:06:37.430> down<00:06:37.610> here
