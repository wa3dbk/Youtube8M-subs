edition of views as ever my name is
Connie<00:00:18.950> Smith<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:19.550> today<00:00:19.810> for<00:00:20.810> me<00:00:20.900> awesome

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
Connie Smith and today for me awesome

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.130 
Connie Smith and today for me awesome
people<00:00:21.529> over<00:00:22.010> at<00:00:22.130> one<00:00:22.550> control<00:00:23.029> I<00:00:23.300> have<00:00:23.990> the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
people over at one control I have the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.540 
people over at one control I have the
bjf<00:00:25.070> buffer<00:00:25.609> now<00:00:26.000> this<00:00:26.269> is<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:26.840> b<00:00:27.230> jf<00:00:28.099> buffer

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
bjf buffer now this is the b jf buffer

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.300 
bjf buffer now this is the b jf buffer
designed<00:00:29.060> obviously<00:00:29.689> by<00:00:29.960> bjf<00:00:30.679> in<00:00:30.890> conjunction

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
designed obviously by bjf in conjunction

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.180 
designed obviously by bjf in conjunction
with<00:00:31.550> one<00:00:31.880> control<00:00:32.350> making<00:00:33.350> really<00:00:33.920> high

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
with one control making really high

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.759 
with one control making really high
quality<00:00:34.250> parts<00:00:34.910> now<00:00:35.090> i<00:00:35.120> must<00:00:35.570> say<00:00:35.840> that<00:00:36.110> this

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
quality parts now i must say that this

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.860 
quality parts now i must say that this
has<00:00:36.890> got<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:37.159> be<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.549> nicest<00:00:37.820> case<00:00:38.510> i've<00:00:38.750> ever

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
has got to be the nicest case i've ever

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.869 
has got to be the nicest case i've ever
seen<00:00:39.199> you<00:00:39.680> know<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.860> graphics<00:00:40.339> on<00:00:40.519> the<00:00:40.610> case

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
seen you know the graphics on the case

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.270 
seen you know the graphics on the case
are<00:00:41.239> really<00:00:41.420> nice<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:42.140> it's<00:00:42.710> just<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:42.979> really

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
are really nice and it's just a really

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.000 
are really nice and it's just a really
nice<00:00:43.430> small<00:00:43.940> footprint<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:44.839> you<00:00:45.530> can<00:00:45.680> stick<00:00:45.890> it

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
nice small footprint so you can stick it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.380 
nice small footprint so you can stick it
on<00:00:46.100> your<00:00:46.220> board<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.729> it's<00:00:46.879> not<00:00:47.030> going<00:00:47.150> to<00:00:47.239> take

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
on your board and it's not going to take

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.439 
on your board and it's not going to take
up<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:47.780> much<00:00:47.839> room<00:00:48.070> so<00:00:49.070> what<00:00:49.760> does<00:00:49.879> a<00:00:49.909> buffer<00:00:50.269> do

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
up so much room so what does a buffer do

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.780 
up so much room so what does a buffer do
but<00:00:50.809> basically<00:00:51.229> it<00:00:52.100> turns<00:00:52.430> your

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
but basically it turns your

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.700 
but basically it turns your
low-impedance<00:00:53.449> signal<00:00:54.229> into<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.530> high

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
low-impedance signal into a high

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.070 
low-impedance signal into a high
impedance<00:00:55.040> signal<00:00:55.659> why<00:00:56.659> do<00:00:56.720> you<00:00:56.869> need<00:00:56.989> a

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
impedance signal why do you need a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.780 
impedance signal why do you need a
buffer<00:00:57.260> well<00:00:57.619> to<00:00:58.010> start<00:00:58.250> off<00:00:58.369> with<00:00:58.489> I<00:00:58.549> didn't

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
buffer well to start off with I didn't

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.420 
buffer well to start off with I didn't
think<00:00:58.909> you<00:00:59.089> did<00:00:59.330> until<00:01:00.229> I<00:01:00.290> tried<00:01:00.650> one<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.220> then

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
think you did until I tried one and then

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.850 
think you did until I tried one and then
I<00:01:01.460> realized<00:01:01.940> that's<00:01:02.390> why<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:02.629> need<00:01:02.839> one<00:01:02.869> cuz

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
I realized that's why you need one cuz

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
I realized that's why you need one cuz
my<00:01:04.580> live<00:01:04.820> rig<00:01:05.150> I'm<00:01:05.449> running<00:01:06.070> about<00:01:07.070> 40<00:01:07.580> foot<00:01:07.760> of

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
my live rig I'm running about 40 foot of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.210 
my live rig I'm running about 40 foot of
cable<00:01:08.090> in<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.479> front<00:01:08.720> end<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.260> about<00:01:09.530> 40<00:01:10.070> foot

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
cable in the front end and about 40 foot

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.090 
cable in the front end and about 40 foot
of<00:01:10.310> cable<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.120> effects<00:01:11.390> loop<00:01:11.630> and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
of cable in the effects loop and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.830 
of cable in the effects loop and
obviously<00:01:13.100> with<00:01:13.370> mic<00:01:13.610> cables<00:01:14.120> you<00:01:14.690> know

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
obviously with mic cables you know

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.210 
obviously with mic cables you know
there's<00:01:15.050> there's<00:01:15.470> obviously<00:01:15.920> going<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.160> be

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
there's there's obviously going to be

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.800 
there's there's obviously going to be
signal<00:01:16.640> loss<00:01:16.790> there<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.270> then<00:01:17.390> there's<00:01:17.630> the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
signal loss there and then there's the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.980 
signal loss there and then there's the
pedal<00:01:18.170> board<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.070> what<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.090> was<00:01:20.210> going<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.510> do<00:01:20.690> is

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
pedal board so what I was going to do is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.410 
pedal board so what I was going to do is
I'm<00:01:21.410> going<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.590> use<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.800> frequency<00:01:22.250> analyzer<00:01:22.700> on

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
I'm going to use a frequency analyzer on

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.300 
I'm going to use a frequency analyzer on
my<00:01:23.570> computer<00:01:24.020> will<00:01:24.260> train<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.740> camera<00:01:25.100> on<00:01:25.160> it

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
my computer will train the camera on it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.700 
my computer will train the camera on it
and<00:01:25.700> we'll<00:01:26.060> just<00:01:26.090> show<00:01:26.510> you<00:01:26.570> what<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.350> buffers

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
and we'll just show you what the buffers

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.100 
and we'll just show you what the buffers
actually<00:01:28.040> doing<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.580> see<00:01:29.570> if<00:01:29.660> we<00:01:29.750> can<00:01:29.900> tell

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
actually doing and see if we can tell

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.590 
actually doing and see if we can tell
what<00:01:30.170> it's<00:01:30.620> actually<00:01:30.740> doing<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.700> let's<00:01:32.240> get<00:01:32.450> it

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
what it's actually doing so let's get it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.260 
what it's actually doing so let's get it
plugged<00:01:32.930> in<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.409> have<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.310> listen<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.909> look<00:01:35.150> at

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
plugged in and have a listen and look at

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.720 
plugged in and have a listen and look at
the<00:01:35.360> chart<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.409> let's<00:01:37.130> have<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.310> look<00:01:37.520> at<00:01:37.640> the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
the chart so let's have a look at the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.300 
the chart so let's have a look at the
frequencies<00:01:38.300> that<00:01:38.330> we're<00:01:38.780> creating<00:01:39.310> without

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
frequencies that we're creating without

00:01:40.310 --> 00:02:02.260 
frequencies that we're creating without
the<00:01:40.550> buffer

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:28.470 

now<00:02:03.270> let's<00:02:03.540> try<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:03.870> with<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.170> buffer

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.970 

so<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:29.750> notice<00:02:30.140> at<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.380> end<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> graph

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
so just notice at the end of the graph

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:40.800 
so just notice at the end of the graph
just<00:02:31.430> look<00:02:31.610> at<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.880> high-end<00:02:32.120> roll-off

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.699 

now<00:02:41.350> without<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.650> buffer<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.990> as<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.350> can<00:02:47.500> see

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
now without the buffer so as you can see

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.160 
now without the buffer so as you can see
the<00:02:48.520> peak<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.240> coming<00:02:49.510> down<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> little<00:02:49.870> bit

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
the peak is coming down a little bit

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.870 
the peak is coming down a little bit
quicker<00:02:50.470> when<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.220> buffer<00:02:51.520> isn't<00:02:51.760> engaged

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
quicker when the buffer isn't engaged

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.180 
quicker when the buffer isn't engaged
let's<00:02:52.690> have<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> look<00:02:53.020> at<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.140> again<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:54.040> this

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
let's have a look at that again so this

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.530 
let's have a look at that again so this
is<00:02:54.340> without<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.790> buffer

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:16.530 

you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.619 

so<00:03:17.319> yeah<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.769> think<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.730> gives<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> little

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
so yeah I think it gives you a little

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.069 
so yeah I think it gives you a little
bit<00:03:19.870> more<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:21.159> brighter<00:03:21.400> tone<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.599> guitar

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
bit more of a brighter tone the guitar

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.410 
bit more of a brighter tone the guitar
feels<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.890> bit<00:03:24.010> more<00:03:24.120> responsive<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.239> your

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
feels a bit more responsive on your

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.330 
feels a bit more responsive on your
fingertips<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.439> lose<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.739> bit<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.129> that

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
fingertips you lose a bit of that

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.809 
fingertips you lose a bit of that
muffled<00:03:28.239> sound<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:29.340> let's<00:03:30.340> see<00:03:30.549> if<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.790> does

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
muffled sound so let's see if it does

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.069 
muffled sound so let's see if it does
much<00:03:31.269> when<00:03:31.840> we're<00:03:32.200> chugging<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:34.870> is

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
much when we're chugging so this is

00:03:35.079 --> 00:04:09.980 
much when we're chugging so this is
before<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.709> buffer

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.070 

so<00:04:10.990> it's<00:04:11.770> definitely<00:04:12.250> doing<00:04:12.520> something<00:04:13.080> so

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
so it's definitely doing something so

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.870 
so it's definitely doing something so
the<00:04:14.500> buffer<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.130> definitely<00:04:15.490> doing<00:04:15.670> something

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
the buffer is definitely doing something

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.850 
the buffer is definitely doing something
you<00:04:16.299> know<00:04:16.390> when<00:04:16.540> it<00:04:16.660> when<00:04:17.140> you<00:04:17.290> engage<00:04:17.440> the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
you know when it when you engage the

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.250 
you know when it when you engage the
buffer<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.640> does<00:04:18.910> seem<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.510> lift<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.019> tone<00:04:20.230> a

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
buffer it does seem to lift the tone a

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.470 
buffer it does seem to lift the tone a
bit<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:21.549> know<00:04:21.670> it's<00:04:21.850> not<00:04:22.030> one<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.300> those

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
bit you know it's not one of those

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.020 
bit you know it's not one of those
pedals<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.200> doesn't<00:04:23.470> do<00:04:23.560> anything<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.880> know

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
pedals that doesn't do anything you know

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.170 
pedals that doesn't do anything you know
I<00:04:25.240> think<00:04:25.690> if<00:04:26.470> you're<00:04:26.710> running<00:04:26.950> lots<00:04:27.460> of<00:04:27.640> cable

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
I think if you're running lots of cable

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.220 
I think if you're running lots of cable
and<00:04:29.640> your<00:04:30.640> guitars<00:04:30.970> maybe<00:04:31.690> a<00:04:31.810> little<00:04:31.990> bit

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
and your guitars maybe a little bit

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.160 
and your guitars maybe a little bit
muffled<00:04:32.710> or<00:04:33.180> some<00:04:34.180> of<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.330> high<00:04:34.510> end<00:04:34.540> is<00:04:34.900> lost

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
muffled or some of the high end is lost

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.070 
muffled or some of the high end is lost
I<00:04:35.500> suggest<00:04:36.220> checking<00:04:36.490> out<00:04:37.180> some<00:04:37.390> buffers<00:04:37.750> and

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
I suggest checking out some buffers and

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.580 
I suggest checking out some buffers and
I<00:04:38.470> highly<00:04:38.800> recommend<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:39.910> bjf<00:04:40.840> buffer<00:04:41.350> for

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
I highly recommend the bjf buffer for

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.250 
I highly recommend the bjf buffer for
one<00:04:41.800> control<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:42.970> I've<00:04:43.510> been<00:04:43.720> kind<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:43.990> sniff

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
one control so I've been kind of sniff

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.180 
one control so I've been kind of sniff
see<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.040> again<00:04:45.190> next<00:04:45.400> time<00:04:45.670> please<00:04:46.060> subscribe
