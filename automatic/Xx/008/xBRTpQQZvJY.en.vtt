is not an alternative to exercise and
dieting<00:00:58.159> but<00:00:58.730> it's<00:00:58.909> a<00:00:58.999> great<00:00:59.269> way<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.480> get<00:00:59.749> rid

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
dieting but it's a great way to get rid

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.919 
dieting but it's a great way to get rid
of<00:00:59.989> those<00:01:00.109> unwanted<00:01:00.800> areas<00:01:01.429> of<00:01:01.609> fat<00:01:01.969> that<00:01:02.629> are

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
of those unwanted areas of fat that are

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.170 
of those unwanted areas of fat that are
genetically<00:01:03.530> predisposed<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.729> grow<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:04.940> little

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
genetically predisposed to grow a little

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.090 
genetically predisposed to grow a little
bigger<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:06.080> example<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.650> back<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:07.010> the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
bigger so for example the back of the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.880 
bigger so for example the back of the
arms<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.760> inner<00:01:07.940> thighs<00:01:08.360> love<00:01:09.110> handles<00:01:09.650> a

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
arms the inner thighs love handles a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.040 
arms the inner thighs love handles a
little<00:01:10.190> bit<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.370> tummy<00:01:10.610> or<00:01:10.910> backside<00:01:11.450> then<00:01:11.960> no

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
little bit of tummy or backside then no

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.080 
little bit of tummy or backside then no
matter<00:01:12.200> how<00:01:12.500> much<00:01:12.650> we<00:01:12.860> exercise<00:01:12.890> or<00:01:13.520> diet<00:01:13.670> it's

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
matter how much we exercise or diet it's

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.120 
matter how much we exercise or diet it's
still<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.600> little<00:01:14.930> bigger<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.590> out<00:01:16.010> of

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
still a little bigger and out of

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.060 
still a little bigger and out of
proportion<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.940> rest<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.360> us<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:18.650> science

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
proportion to the rest of us the science

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.340 
proportion to the rest of us the science
for<00:01:19.340> CoolSculpting<00:01:20.000> is<00:01:20.150> actually<00:01:20.930> really

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
for CoolSculpting is actually really

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.200 
for CoolSculpting is actually really
great<00:01:21.590> because<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:22.160> years<00:01:22.520> we've<00:01:22.850> known<00:01:23.060> in

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
great because for years we've known in

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.570 
great because for years we've known in
dermatology<00:01:23.870> that<00:01:23.990> if<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:24.200> cool<00:01:24.590> fat<00:01:24.950> you'll

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
dermatology that if you cool fat you'll

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.400 
dermatology that if you cool fat you'll
be<00:01:25.700> able<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:26.060> permanently<00:01:26.420> destroy<00:01:27.170> those

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
be able to permanently destroy those

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.710 
be able to permanently destroy those
cells<00:01:27.790> but<00:01:28.790> if<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.000> cool<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.540> right

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
cells but if you cool it the right

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.330 
cells but if you cool it the right
temperature<00:01:30.260> not<00:01:30.590> only<00:01:30.800> to<00:01:30.920> get<00:01:31.040> rid<00:01:31.190> of<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
temperature not only to get rid of the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.280 
temperature not only to get rid of the
fat<00:01:31.550> but<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:31.790> can<00:01:31.940> also<00:01:32.180> keep<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.750> top<00:01:33.050> of<00:01:33.230> the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
fat but you can also keep the top of the

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.530 
fat but you can also keep the top of the
skin<00:01:33.500> perfectly<00:01:34.040> healthy<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.700> have<00:01:35.240> no

the<00:01:39.260> skin<00:01:39.530> which<00:01:39.710> is<00:01:39.860> quite<00:01:40.160> revolutionary<00:01:41.090> as

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
the skin which is quite revolutionary as

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.150 
the skin which is quite revolutionary as
compared<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.080> a<00:01:42.170> liposuction<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.980> other

compared to a liposuction and other

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.010 
compared to a liposuction and other
techniques<00:01:43.520> we've<00:01:43.790> had<00:01:44.060> where<00:01:44.540> we<00:01:44.570> have<00:01:44.900> to

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
techniques we've had where we have to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.080 
techniques we've had where we have to
actually<00:01:45.470> induce<00:01:45.860> damage<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.550> underlying

actually induce damage to underlying
tissue<00:01:47.420> structure<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.980> the<00:01:49.100> number<00:01:49.370> one

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400

tissue structure so the number one
question<00:01:49.550> I<00:01:49.940> always<00:01:50.060> ask<00:01:50.210> people<00:01:50.690> if<00:01:50.840> once<00:01:51.500> you

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
question I always ask people if once you

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.490 
question I always ask people if once you
kill<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.040> fat<00:01:52.250> cells<00:01:52.580> where<00:01:53.210> do<00:01:53.300> they<00:01:53.450> go<00:01:53.660> well

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
kill the fat cells where do they go well

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.290 
kill the fat cells where do they go well
the<00:01:54.650> scientific<00:01:55.130> answer<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.730> that<00:01:55.970> once<00:01:56.150> you

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
the scientific answer is that once you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.930 
the scientific answer is that once you
cool<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.630> fat<00:01:56.840> cell<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.290> actually<00:01:57.860> once<00:01:58.700> it's

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
cool the fat cell you actually once it's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.180 
cool the fat cell you actually once it's
thawing<00:01:59.210> it<00:01:59.840> enters<00:02:00.650> what's<00:02:00.920> called

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
thawing it enters what's called

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.320 
thawing it enters what's called
apoptosis<00:02:01.670> which<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.450> natural<00:02:02.930> style

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
apoptosis which is natural style

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.690 
apoptosis which is natural style
and<00:02:03.660> we<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.260> macrophages<00:02:04.800> in<00:02:05.070> our<00:02:05.190> body<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and we have macrophages in our body that

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.940 
and we have macrophages in our body that
gets<00:02:06.390> rid<00:02:06.660> of<00:02:06.690> them<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.110> gulfs<00:02:07.410> them<00:02:07.620> and<00:02:07.800> gets

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
gets rid of them and gulfs them and gets

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.100 
gets rid of them and gulfs them and gets
rid<00:02:08.100> of<00:02:08.160> them<00:02:08.430> but<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.180> non<00:02:09.360> scientific<00:02:09.960> way

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
rid of them but the non scientific way

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.020 
rid of them but the non scientific way
to<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:10.440> about<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.010> once<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.820> rid<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to think about it is once you get rid of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.480 
to think about it is once you get rid of
the<00:02:12.210> fat<00:02:12.630> cells<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.590> actually<00:02:13.920> put<00:02:14.100> them<00:02:14.340> out

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
the fat cells you actually put them out

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.490 
the fat cells you actually put them out
and<00:02:14.790> are<00:02:15.090> eliminated<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:15.960> rest<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.410> the

junk in the body that is not needed each
treatment<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.840> lose<00:02:22.020> about<00:02:22.260> 20<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.770> 25

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
treatment if you lose about 20 to 25

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.680 
treatment if you lose about 20 to 25
percent<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> fat<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.270> if<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.420> were<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
percent of the fat so if you were to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.780 
percent of the fat so if you were to
pinch<00:02:25.020> an<00:02:25.200> area<00:02:25.470> fat<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.950> lose<00:02:26.100> about<00:02:26.340> 20<00:02:26.670> to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
pinch an area fat you lose about 20 to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.420 
pinch an area fat you lose about 20 to
25%<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.960> with<00:02:28.350> each<00:02:28.500> treatment<00:02:28.770> now

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
25% of that with each treatment now

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.300 
25% of that with each treatment now
what's<00:02:29.610> amazing<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.660> these<00:02:30.930> areas<00:02:31.680> will

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
what's amazing is that these areas will

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.370 
what's amazing is that these areas will
always<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.300> less<00:02:33.600> fat<00:02:33.870> cells

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
always have less fat cells

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.000 
always have less fat cells
20<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.130> 25%<00:02:35.550> less<00:02:36.150> than<00:02:36.420> other<00:02:36.840> areas<00:02:37.140> now<00:02:37.920> if

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
20 to 25% less than other areas now if

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.610 
20 to 25% less than other areas now if
you<00:02:38.130> were<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.430> go<00:02:39.360> ahead<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.690> go<00:02:39.780> crazy<00:02:40.080> and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
you were to go ahead and go crazy and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.040 
you were to go ahead and go crazy and
put<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> lot<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.370> weight<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.940> course<00:02:42.570> you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
put on a lot of weight of course you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.840 
put on a lot of weight of course you
still<00:02:43.110> have<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> ton<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.890> other<00:02:44.130> fat<00:02:44.370> cells<00:02:44.700> that

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
still have a ton of other fat cells that

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.810 
still have a ton of other fat cells that
can<00:02:45.150> respond<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:45.840> fat<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.490> those

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
can respond and get fat but in those

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.600 
can respond and get fat but in those
areas<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.330> had<00:02:48.770> who<00:02:49.770> was<00:02:49.920> treated<00:02:50.430> with

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
areas that had who was treated with

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.240 
areas that had who was treated with
CoolSculpting<00:02:50.850> we<00:02:51.780> get<00:02:51.960> less<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.770> bulge

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
CoolSculpting we get less of a bulge

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.400 
CoolSculpting we get less of a bulge
so<00:02:53.610> therefore<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.060> contours<00:02:54.690> still<00:02:55.020> remain

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
so therefore the contours still remain

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.010 
so therefore the contours still remain
the<00:02:55.590> same<00:02:55.860> even<00:02:56.430> if<00:02:56.580> weight<00:02:56.910> gain<00:02:57.210> were<00:02:57.780> too

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.630 

so<00:03:02.020> one<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.470> most<00:03:02.620> important<00:03:03.250> parts<00:03:03.550> of

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
so one of the most important parts of

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.430 
so one of the most important parts of
doing<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:03.970> procedure<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.750> be<00:03:05.020> able<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.260> do

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
doing this procedure is to be able to do

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.960 
doing this procedure is to be able to do
the<00:03:05.560> assessment<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.400> that's<00:03:06.580> why<00:03:06.760> it's

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
the assessment and that's why it's

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.180 
the assessment and that's why it's
really<00:03:07.120> hard<00:03:07.209> over<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.870> phone<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.709> able<00:03:08.830> to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
really hard over the phone to be able to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.920 
really hard over the phone to be able to
say<00:03:09.459> what<00:03:10.000> your<00:03:10.150> treatment<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:10.600> gonna<00:03:10.690> look

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
say what your treatment is gonna look

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.400 
say what your treatment is gonna look
like

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
like

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.510 
like
one<00:03:11.740> of<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.890> things<00:03:12.100> we're<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.459> be

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
one of the things we're going to be

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.820 
one of the things we're going to be
looking<00:03:12.910> for<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.330> any<00:03:13.540> asymmetry<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.620> body

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
looking for is any asymmetry on the body

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.340 
looking for is any asymmetry on the body
we're<00:03:15.550> going<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.760> look<00:03:15.850> at<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.150> 360<00:03:16.660> degree

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
we're going to look at the 360 degree

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.620 
we're going to look at the 360 degree
view<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.830> have<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.310> patient<00:03:18.520> rotate<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.480> be

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
view and have the patient rotate to be

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.449 
view and have the patient rotate to be
able<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:20.050> see<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:20.650> everything<00:03:20.980> looks<00:03:21.370> like

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
able to see what everything looks like

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.510 
able to see what everything looks like
in<00:03:22.680> respect<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.920> areas<00:03:24.220> we're<00:03:24.340> going<00:03:24.459> to

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
in respect to the areas we're going to

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.770 
in respect to the areas we're going to
be<00:03:24.580> treating<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.120> then<00:03:25.420> we're<00:03:25.540> going<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.720> be

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
be treating and then we're going to be

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.270 
be treating and then we're going to be
doing<00:03:25.870> pinch<00:03:26.230> tests<00:03:26.590> we're<00:03:26.739> going<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:26.950> see<00:03:27.100> how

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
doing pinch tests we're going to see how

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.970 
doing pinch tests we're going to see how
the<00:03:27.340> fat<00:03:27.760> aligns<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.870> patient<00:03:29.319> and<00:03:29.500> how

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
the fat aligns on the patient and how

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.030 
the fat aligns on the patient and how
we're<00:03:30.190> gonna<00:03:30.340> put<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.730> different<00:03:32.040> function

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
we're gonna put the different function

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.860 
we're gonna put the different function
cups<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.580> be<00:03:33.700> able<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.940> achieve<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.390> contour

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
cups to be able to achieve the contour

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.020 
cups to be able to achieve the contour
we<00:03:34.989> want<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.590> where<00:03:35.890> we<00:03:36.370> strategize

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
we want and this is where we strategize

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.030 
we want and this is where we strategize
and<00:03:37.269> we<00:03:37.330> personalize<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.170> plan<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.860> be<00:03:38.980> able

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
and we personalize the plan to be able

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.820 
and we personalize the plan to be able
to<00:03:39.190> fit<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.670> patient<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.630> 360<00:03:41.500> degree<00:03:41.800> view

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
to fit the patient in a 360 degree view

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.220 
to fit the patient in a 360 degree view
to<00:03:42.220> be<00:03:42.310> able<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.519> get<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.030> right<00:03:43.209> contours<00:03:43.810> and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
to be able to get the right contours and

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.900 
to be able to get the right contours and
of<00:03:44.320> course<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.650> right<00:03:44.830> contour<00:03:45.280> for<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.580> woman

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
of course the right contour for a woman

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.970 
of course the right contour for a woman
is<00:03:46.060> more<00:03:46.239> hourglass<00:03:46.840> or<00:03:47.140> for<00:03:47.350> a<00:03:47.380> man<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:47.800> want

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
is more hourglass or for a man you want

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.040 
is more hourglass or for a man you want
a<00:03:48.040> v-shape<00:03:48.459> distribution<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.870> where

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
a v-shape distribution and this is where

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.500 
a v-shape distribution and this is where
we<00:03:50.170> get<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.580> get<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.730> right<00:03:51.970> contour

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
we get to get the right contour

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:03.059 
we get to get the right contour
porcelain<00:03:53.019> lies<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.410> planned<00:03:53.650> up

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.009 

and<00:04:03.219> then<00:04:03.819> we'll<00:04:04.000> switch<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.239> over<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.840> to

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
and then we'll switch it over and to

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.410 
and then we'll switch it over and to
another<00:04:05.200> 60<00:04:05.680> minutes<00:04:05.950> on<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.189> other

another 60 minutes on the other

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.150 
another 60 minutes on the other
