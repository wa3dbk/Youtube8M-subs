Rickenbacker's and I don't know the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
exact reason why but they they have a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.890 
exact reason why but they they have a
sound<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.530> their<00:01:10.650> own<00:01:11.270> my<00:01:12.270> own<00:01:12.420> feeling<00:01:12.810> is

sound of their own my own feeling is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.950 
sound of their own my own feeling is
it's<00:01:13.290> something<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.780> bit<00:01:15.780> more

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
wanted a little bit more sound out of it

is<00:01:44.830> flat<00:01:45.100> wound<00:01:45.280> strings<00:01:45.430> but<00:01:45.850> then<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.060> get

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.050 

this<00:01:56.800> guy<00:01:57.040> came<00:01:57.280> along<00:01:57.430> who<00:01:57.700> decided<00:01:58.000> you

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
this guy came along who decided you

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.090 
this guy came along who decided you
wanted<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.420> be<00:01:58.510> very<00:01:58.570> bright<00:01:59.020> sounding<00:01:59.560> so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
wanted it to be very bright sounding so

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.040 
wanted it to be very bright sounding so
he<00:02:00.190> put<00:02:00.370> round<00:02:00.580> round<00:02:00.790> strings<00:02:01.150> on<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
he put round round strings on it and and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:14.070 
he put round round strings on it and and
therefore<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.380> sort<00:02:05.650> of

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:23.620 

so<00:02:21.760> then<00:02:22.760> they<00:02:22.880> say<00:02:23.060> that's<00:02:23.240> just<00:02:23.420> part<00:02:23.600> of

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
so then they say that's just part of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.090 
so then they say that's just part of
changing<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.110> tone<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.560> changing<00:02:24.980> your

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
changing the tone and changing your

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.650 
changing the tone and changing your
angle<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.700> attack<00:02:25.820> I<00:02:26.120> suppose<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
angle of attack I suppose on the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.530 
angle of attack I suppose on the
plectrum<00:02:26.900> yeah<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.920> other<00:02:28.070> pick<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.210> on<00:02:29.360> these

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
plectrum yeah the other pick up on these

and you see the feeling maintenance
high-maintenance<00:02:57.830> thing<00:02:58.310> they<00:02:58.760> do<00:02:58.820> have<00:02:59.330> that

of<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.620> whole<00:03:03.860> equation

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.539 

Oh

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.979 

you<00:03:18.549> see<00:03:18.819> it's<00:03:18.939> not<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.090> lot<00:03:19.239> of<00:03:19.299> bombing<00:03:19.510> going

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
you see it's not a lot of bombing going

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.300 
you see it's not a lot of bombing going
on<00:03:20.109> though<00:03:20.290> there's<00:03:20.890> certainly<00:03:21.099> a<00:03:21.159> lot<00:03:21.189> of

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
on though there's certainly a lot of

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.990 
on though there's certainly a lot of
sparkle<00:03:21.819> to<00:03:21.849> it<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.469> guess<00:03:23.469> the<00:03:24.040> other<00:03:24.159> sound<00:03:24.819> is

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
sparkle to it I guess the other sound is

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.490 
sparkle to it I guess the other sound is
when<00:03:25.329> both<00:03:25.569> are<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:25.900> together<00:03:27.989> yeah<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.170> said

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
when both are on together yeah you said

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:52.259 
when both are on together yeah you said
that<00:03:29.530> other<00:03:29.769> recognizable<00:03:30.310> music<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:52.150> I'm

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
that other recognizable music so I'm

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.789 
that other recognizable music so I'm
just<00:03:52.569> eat<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.109> just<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.349> picture<00:03:53.560> or

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
just eat this is just a picture or

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.409 
just eat this is just a picture or
anything<00:03:53.829> these<00:03:56.310> again<00:03:57.310> I've<00:03:57.790> not<00:03:58.000> really

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
anything these again I've not really

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.330 
anything these again I've not really
heard<00:03:58.629> another<00:03:58.959> bass<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.439> sounds<00:03:59.769> quite<00:03:59.980> like

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
heard another bass it sounds quite like

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.800 
heard another bass it sounds quite like
this<00:04:00.579> one<00:04:00.639> or<00:04:01.030> these<00:04:01.780> ones<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:03.599> guess<00:04:04.599> that's

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
this one or these ones I guess that's

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.780 
this one or these ones I guess that's
part<00:04:05.049> of<00:04:05.109> the<00:04:05.230> appeal<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.769> them<00:04:06.010> many<00:04:06.519> both

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
part of the appeal of them many both

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.159 
part of the appeal of them many both
bass<00:04:07.090> players<00:04:07.359> pick<00:04:07.599> them<00:04:07.689> up<00:04:07.780> think<00:04:08.049> walk
