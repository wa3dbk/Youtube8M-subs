the foot switch my hand you will notice

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.570 
the foot switch my hand you will notice
that<00:00:17.240> we<00:00:17.449> can<00:00:17.630> rotate<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.110> turntable<00:00:18.580> this

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
that we can rotate the turntable this

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.550 
that we can rotate the turntable this
means<00:00:19.850> that<00:00:20.090> the<00:00:20.630> turntable<00:00:21.170> is<00:00:21.230> doing<00:00:21.470> all

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
means that the turntable is doing all

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.160 
means that the turntable is doing all
the<00:00:21.710> work<00:00:21.760> when<00:00:22.760> you<00:00:22.940> put<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.240> load<00:00:23.420> on<00:00:23.600> and

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
the work when you put the load on and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.490 
the work when you put the load on and
not<00:00:24.980> you<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:25.580> this<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.180> a<00:00:26.210> replacement<00:00:26.900> for<00:00:27.260> the

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
not you so this is a replacement for the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.320 
not you so this is a replacement for the
time<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:28.700> you<00:00:28.760> can<00:00:28.880> see<00:00:29.000> that<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.210> can

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
time and you can see that you can

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.850 
time and you can see that you can
actually<00:00:29.600> move<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.900> turntable<00:00:30.440> by<00:00:30.590> foot

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
actually move the turntable by foot

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.679 
actually move the turntable by foot
which<00:00:31.039> is<00:00:31.070> quite<00:00:31.400> easy<00:00:31.580> so<00:00:31.820> you<00:00:32.270> can<00:00:32.509> already

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
which is quite easy so you can already

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.739 
which is quite easy so you can already
enter<00:00:32.989> at<00:00:33.110> any<00:00:33.200> time<00:00:33.879> and<00:00:34.879> we'll<00:00:35.239> just<00:00:35.449> grab

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:35.749 
enter at any time and we'll just grab

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:37.899 
enter at any time and we'll just grab
the<00:00:35.989> pallet<00:00:36.350> truck<00:00:36.589> and<00:00:36.920> you'll<00:00:37.190> notice<00:00:37.550> there

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
the pallet truck and you'll notice there

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.479 
the pallet truck and you'll notice there
that<00:00:37.940> we<00:00:38.719> are<00:00:38.899> putting<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.620> truck<00:00:39.980> under<00:00:40.460> the

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
that we are putting the truck under the

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.279 
that we are putting the truck under the
unit<00:00:40.850> which<00:00:41.390> means<00:00:41.600> we<00:00:41.749> can<00:00:41.899> move<00:00:42.079> it<00:00:42.230> around

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
unit which means we can move it around

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.250 
unit which means we can move it around
very<00:00:42.769> easily<00:00:42.859> simply<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:44.059> that<00:00:44.809> can<00:00:44.929> also<00:00:45.079> be

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
very easily simply and that can also be

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.590 
very easily simply and that can also be
done<00:00:45.499> with<00:00:45.559> a<00:00:45.800> forklift<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:46.999> you<00:00:47.089> can<00:00:47.239> lift<00:00:47.420> it

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
done with a forklift so you can lift it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.389 
done with a forklift so you can lift it
and<00:00:47.780> put<00:00:47.839> it<00:00:48.710> away

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
and put it away

stager and you know it doesn't have to
be<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:10.820> precise<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:11.510> yeah<00:01:11.660> I've<00:01:11.870> actually

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.040 
be that precise so yeah I've actually
put<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.710> off-center<00:01:13.310> but<00:01:13.700> that's<00:01:14.630> fine<00:01:14.840> you

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
put it off-center but that's fine you

and you'll see we'll take a piece of the
film<00:01:20.590> we'll<00:01:21.590> attach<00:01:22.160> it<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.550> anywhere<00:01:23.300> on<00:01:23.510> the

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
film we'll attach it to anywhere on the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.380 
film we'll attach it to anywhere on the
pallet<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.650> can<00:01:24.770> be<00:01:24.860> in<00:01:24.980> the<00:01:25.100> box<00:01:25.390> around

pallet and it can be in the box around

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.140 
pallet and it can be in the box around
the<00:01:26.570> edge<00:01:26.690> of<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.900> box<00:01:27.080> anywhere<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:28.150> started

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
the edge of the box anywhere and started

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.630 
the edge of the box anywhere and started
off<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.660> of<00:01:30.200> course<00:01:30.410> on<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.800> top<00:01:31.010> of<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.310> ham

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
off and of course on the top of the ham

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.670 
off and of course on the top of the ham
pallet<00:01:31.970> dispenser<00:01:32.540> is<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.050> tensioning

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
pallet dispenser is the tensioning

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.130 
pallet dispenser is the tensioning
device<00:01:33.980> so<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:34.940> need<00:01:35.120> to<00:01:35.270> tension<00:01:35.690> as<00:01:35.840> we<00:01:35.990> go

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
device so we need to tension as we go

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.930 
device so we need to tension as we go
along<00:01:36.230> but<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.680> best<00:01:36.890> thing<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.430> can<00:01:37.580> do<00:01:37.730> is

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
along but the best thing you can do is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.660 
along but the best thing you can do is
to<00:01:38.450> start<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.440> off<00:01:39.560> as<00:01:39.800> we're<00:01:39.980> doing<00:01:40.250> here<00:01:40.490> by

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
to start it off as we're doing here by

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.940 
to start it off as we're doing here by
putting<00:01:40.880> your<00:01:41.060> foot<00:01:41.240> on<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.540> switch<00:01:41.830> let<00:01:42.830> it

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
putting your foot on the switch let it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.980 
putting your foot on the switch let it
go<00:01:43.100> around<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:44.120> first<00:01:44.360> layer<00:01:44.570> is<00:01:44.810> usually

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
go around and the first layer is usually

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.470 
go around and the first layer is usually
a<00:01:45.200> soft<00:01:45.590> layer<00:01:45.830> so<00:01:46.160> it<00:01:46.280> takes<00:01:46.550> up<00:01:46.760> all<00:01:47.150> of<00:01:47.210> those

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
a soft layer so it takes up all of those

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.960 
a soft layer so it takes up all of those
sharp<00:01:47.810> edges<00:01:48.080> on<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.470> corners<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.700> you'll

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
sharp edges on the corners and you'll

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.490 
sharp edges on the corners and you'll
notice<00:01:50.150> that<00:01:50.390> when<00:01:50.570> we've<00:01:50.810> gone<00:01:51.140> around<00:01:51.380> once

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
notice that when we've gone around once

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.260 
notice that when we've gone around once
we<00:01:51.830> can<00:01:52.010> now<00:01:52.160> tighten<00:01:52.460> up<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.880> tensioning

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
we can now tighten up the tensioning

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.970 
we can now tighten up the tensioning
device<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:53.720> see<00:01:53.930> that<00:01:54.080> in<00:01:54.170> my<00:01:54.260> left<00:01:54.440> hand<00:01:54.680> and

device you see that in my left hand and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.940 
device you see that in my left hand and
we're<00:01:55.880> going<00:01:56.150> up<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.720> overlapping<00:01:57.590> each

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
we're going up and overlapping each

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.020 
we're going up and overlapping each
section<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:59.060> the<00:02:00.020> previous<00:02:00.560> wrap<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:01.580> enable

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
section of the previous wrap to enable

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.280 
section of the previous wrap to enable
us<00:02:02.120> to<00:02:02.150> get<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.840> load<00:02:03.290> fully<00:02:03.740> wrapped<00:02:04.400> and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
us to get the load fully wrapped and

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.690 
us to get the load fully wrapped and
pretty<00:02:06.290> much<00:02:06.470> that's<00:02:06.710> all<00:02:06.890> there<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.400> to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
pretty much that's all there is to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.630 
pretty much that's all there is to
wrapping<00:02:08.659> a<00:02:08.780> load<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:08.989> can<00:02:09.170> then<00:02:09.440> go<00:02:09.649> down<00:02:10.429> the

bottom you can go under the corners of

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.710 
bottom you can go under the corners of
the<00:02:12.710> pallets<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.460> go<00:02:13.550> back<00:02:13.790> over<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.270> top
