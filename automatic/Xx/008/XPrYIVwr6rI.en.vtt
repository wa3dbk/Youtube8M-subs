fun doing that I know you get that
gigantic<00:00:44.250> boost<00:00:44.700> once<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> start<00:00:45.390> getting

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
gigantic boost once you start getting

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389 
gigantic boost once you start getting
enough<00:00:45.809> damage<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.890> did<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.219> like

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399

starting<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.120> being<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.289> slow<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.890> did<00:00:50.070> not

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
starting off being very slow I did not

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.220 
starting off being very slow I did not
like<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.300> jumped<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> air

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
like that if you jumped into the air

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.229 
like that if you jumped into the air
jump<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.129> would<00:00:53.280> lose<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.610> entire<00:00:53.879> boost

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
jump you would lose your entire boost

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.430 
jump you would lose your entire boost
when<00:00:54.449> you'd<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.930> back<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.260> being

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
when you'd have to go back to being

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
when you'd have to go back to being
super<00:00:55.739> slow<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> only<00:00:56.820> used<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> weapon<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
super slow so I only used the weapon a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.060 
super slow so I only used the weapon a
couple<00:00:57.719> times<00:00:57.899> never<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.469> liked<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
couple times never really liked it

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.549 
couple times never really liked it
but<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.550> did<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> bit<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.390> nerfing<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
but they did a bit of nerfing and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.799 
but they did a bit of nerfing and
buffing<00:01:02.250> today<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.149> first<00:01:03.420> thing<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.750> did

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
buffing today the first thing they did

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960

was<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.170> took<00:01:04.350> away<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.070> accuracy<00:01:05.760> buff

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970

that they had before the baby faces
blaster<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> 40<00:01:09.420> percent

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570

accuracy<00:01:10.530> buff<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.760> helped<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> lot

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

of<00:01:12.420> people<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.900> were<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.200> starting<00:01:13.409> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
play Scout I know a lot of people that I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
play Scout I know a lot of people that I
talked<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> would<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.680> gun<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.280> they

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
talked to would use this gun so they

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
talked to would use this gun so they
could<00:01:17.580> work<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.970> their<00:01:18.150> accuracy<00:01:18.659> which<00:01:19.350> is

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
could work on their accuracy which is

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.499 
could work on their accuracy which is
cool<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.340> fisher-price<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:21.210> first

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
scout gun but they took that away so you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440 
penalty it wasn't negative 35% that's
why<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.530> started<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.130> slow<00:01:38.490> today<00:01:39.210> they

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
why you started off all slow today they

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.319 
why you started off all slow today they
changed<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.200> only<00:01:40.590> negative<00:01:41.040> 10%<00:01:41.850> which

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
changed it to be only negative 10% which

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.810 
changed it to be only negative 10% which
is<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.570> huge<00:01:43.049> improvement<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.399> still<00:01:44.579> not

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
is a huge improvement but it's still not

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.510 
is a huge improvement but it's still not
fast<00:01:45.360> enough<00:01:45.649> another<00:01:46.649> thing<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.070> did<00:01:47.310> was

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
fast enough another thing they did was

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.120 
fast enough another thing they did was
they<00:01:47.729> took<00:01:47.759> away<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.810> whole<00:01:49.560> air<00:01:49.829> jump

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
they took away the whole air jump

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.249 
they took away the whole air jump
instead<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.850> losing<00:01:51.090> your<00:01:51.329> entire<00:01:51.659> boost<00:01:51.990> when

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
instead of losing your entire boost when

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.020 
instead of losing your entire boost when
you<00:01:52.350> did<00:01:52.500> an<00:01:52.590> air<00:01:52.710> jump<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.520> only<00:01:53.759> use<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you did an air jump you only use a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.270 
you did an air jump you only use a
partial<00:01:54.450> amount<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.170> which<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.829> cool<00:01:56.100> I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
partial amount of it which is cool I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.889 
partial amount of it which is cool I
mean<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.610> shoot<00:01:56.820> person<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.479> time<00:01:57.750> you're

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
mean you shoot person one time you're

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.810 
mean you shoot person one time you're
gonna<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.680> unless<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.790> a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
gonna get that back unless you do like a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.280 
gonna get that back unless you do like a
couple<00:02:00.180> double<00:02:00.479> jumps<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.960> triple<00:02:01.170> jump

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
couple double jumps in a triple jump

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.410 
couple double jumps in a triple jump
enough<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.950> triple<00:02:02.490> lindy<00:02:02.700> off<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> high<00:02:03.210> dive

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
enough a triple lindy off of a high dive

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.690 
enough a triple lindy off of a high dive
then<00:02:04.020> your<00:02:04.170> boost<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.500> gone<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.219> main

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
then your boost is gone so the main

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.639 
then your boost is gone so the main
thing<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.869> gets<00:02:07.079> me<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.350> this

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
thing that that kind of gets me on this

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.639 
thing that that kind of gets me on this
they<00:02:07.920> would<00:02:08.069> reduce<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.670> clip<00:02:09.209> size<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:10.259> four

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
they would reduce the clip size to four

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.260 
they would reduce the clip size to four
instead<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.370> ten<00:02:11.580> which<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.819> kind<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.180> odd

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
instead of ten which is kind of odd

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.150 
instead of ten which is kind of odd
because<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.470> force<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.800> nature<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
because the the force of nature is the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.980 
because the the force of nature is the
only<00:02:15.400> gun<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.850> has<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> really<00:02:16.390> small<00:02:16.690> clip

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
only gun that has a really small clip

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.870 
only gun that has a really small clip
scatter<00:02:17.290> guns<00:02:17.530> pretty<00:02:17.740> decent<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.340> then<00:02:18.790> you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
scatter guns pretty decent and then you

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.320 
scatter guns pretty decent and then you
have<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> four<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:20.340> pistol<00:02:21.340> whatever<00:02:22.240> the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
have the four in the pistol whatever the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.730 
have the four in the pistol whatever the
pistol<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:22.720> called<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.050> never<00:02:23.260> use<00:02:23.440> it

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
pistol is called I never use it

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.160 
pistol is called I never use it
but<00:02:24.220> there's<00:02:24.490> four<00:02:24.790> rounds<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.330> on<00:02:25.840> a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
but there's four rounds in that on a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.470 
but there's four rounds in that on a
pretty<00:02:26.500> fast<00:02:26.740> reload<00:02:27.130> time<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.640> they<00:02:28.180> took<00:02:28.360> it

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
pretty fast reload time so they took it

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.310 
pretty fast reload time so they took it
down<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.780> four

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
down to four

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.560 
down to four
they<00:02:29.590> also<00:02:29.830> remove<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.520> damage<00:02:30.940> penalty<00:02:31.120> so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
they also remove the damage penalty so

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.850 
they also remove the damage penalty so
you<00:02:31.660> wouldn't<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:32.020> won't<00:02:32.200> take<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.500> damage

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
you wouldn't you won't take the damage

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.620 
you wouldn't you won't take the damage
but<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.490> main<00:02:33.610> thing<00:02:33.820> for<00:02:34.000> me<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.240> they<00:02:34.420> took

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
but the main thing for me is they took

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.720 
but the main thing for me is they took
away<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:35.020> clip<00:02:35.320> they<00:02:35.740> increase<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.490> speed

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
away that clip they increase the speed

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.760 
away that clip they increase the speed
penalty<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.420> negative<00:02:37.870> ten<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.320> thirty<00:02:38.560> five

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
penalty to negative ten to thirty five

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.920 
penalty to negative ten to thirty five
so<00:02:39.100> actually<00:02:39.850> played<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.060> couple<00:02:40.570> rounds<00:02:40.690> with

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
so actually played a couple rounds with

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.960 
so actually played a couple rounds with
it<00:02:41.230> it's<00:02:41.650> not<00:02:41.860> as<00:02:42.040> bad<00:02:42.190> I'll<00:02:42.430> still<00:02:42.700> probably

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
it it's not as bad I'll still probably

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.990 
it it's not as bad I'll still probably
stick<00:02:43.570> with<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:44.020> scatter<00:02:44.590> gun<00:02:44.830> but<00:02:45.490> it's<00:02:45.760> not

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
stick with the scatter gun but it's not

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.530 
stick with the scatter gun but it's not
bad<00:02:46.480> now<00:02:47.250> definitely<00:02:48.250> give<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.610> try<00:02:48.640> it's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
bad now definitely give it a try it's

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.880 
bad now definitely give it a try it's
pretty<00:02:49.660> cool<00:02:49.960> that<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.200> go<00:02:50.410> from<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:50.710> a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
pretty cool that you go from just a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.130 
pretty cool that you go from just a
regular<00:02:51.310> slow<00:02:51.820> little<00:02:52.090> scout<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:53.110> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
regular slow little scout to a

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
running all around and it definitely

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.680 
running all around and it definitely
comes<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.430> handy<00:02:57.490> you'll<00:02:58.120> see<00:02:58.270> in<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.480> video
