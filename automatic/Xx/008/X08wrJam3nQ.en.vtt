 hello guys good tone making this video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.450
 for some reasons 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.110
 The first reason is that I made a video 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.109
 some time ago last year on the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.180
 Please format your tablet for this video 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.430
 it was the video that most certainly had 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.119
 programming that same time it had 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.470
 more audience around 48 thousand 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.570
 hits of something in this video 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.420

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.469
