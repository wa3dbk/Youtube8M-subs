00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.990
 Hello 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.070
 Sorry, but I have to say my name. 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.690
 bicalho 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.480
 I know everyone is now 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.760
 saying that but it's because many people 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.539
 Do not know at last, I'll keep explaining. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 right here 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.550
 I would like to ask you to be 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.840
 subscribe to my channel 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.390
 If you can, please do it for free . 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:37.440
 even a good mother- of-pearl, right? 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:40.980
 Good, I'll spend here in this pop rock video. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.000
 then peal there'll show you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.000
 with what does 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:54.960
 So we're going to split it into two parts. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:01:00.989
 to get easier is not that up to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:06.290
 14 neighborhood with a bad two ozzy kick in 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.290
 3d balcomb 4 schmall along with box 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 and the second part will be as follows 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:20.040
 peal because of this that dinho peaks 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.180
 O gives here that even when there is his mother 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.240
 wife by the quota on the onion is in that 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:37.890
 Repeated, let's do it, you can train. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:41.310
 I hit this down here, train it. 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.460
 good for you to do a second part that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.460
 and 5689 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.820
 then the two together the two together 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.399
 was here seeing the disadvantage of 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.259
 battery is that the parts are 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.840
 very small they have little space 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.580
 to do things but has the advantage 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.770
 hair field 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.080
 You are seeing here in the corner and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.890
 opened four then and then you go 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.660
 do 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.660
 still in the second part of the debate in the foot 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:48.020
 again from the beginning but slow 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.030
 the foot of the end along with the foot of the beginning 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.790
 of the second part then the eleventh 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.660
 touch is the one here will join with the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.270
 number 1 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:14.640
 and so it will be like this when 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:17.310
 you put one piece together, now it 's 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.959
 only thing from one part to another then more 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:30.769
 Once we show you the picture to 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:30.769
 You guys are faster 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:46.190
 I'll show you the picture I had. 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.100
 even a good suggestion from a friend 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.040
 commented one of our videos so that 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.140
 I put this picture on the wall 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.610
 We already have a nail on the wall of the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.010
 side of where he led the classes of 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.690
 guitar tips sticking to new wall 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.820
 anyway until I came back 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.860
 the camera because of the zoom 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.299
 there is no one can do this for me 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.930
 so it has to be the same as the 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.770
 whole picture for you the box symbol 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.690
 bass drum 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.790
 What I said at the beginning of the video 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.050
 countdown 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.510
 So, imagine the cushion bytes are the box and one 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.800
 lipstick 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.250
 so we have a good set with the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.720
 symbol we will have a team to show 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.620
 the bush hit alone after dalton 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.050
 number 2 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:49.610
 everything is new, the box is here 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:53.670
 simple taxidermist odessa together chimbau and 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.700
 box and then the kick drum and a 11th tone 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:02.370
 along with the first one up there from everything 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:06.270
 stat stats stats and so on 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:09.180
 I hope you can develop 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.490
 It might be that you find it instead of 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.860
 box do you think a bo for example 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.720
 Peaked part in there that I went back to 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.550
 You make those penguins lined up. 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.680
 in the green brush 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.280
 some people like to do the good of 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.950
 everything is different but it does not lose 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.760
 essence of the legal pace people 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:32.300
 Thank you very much, once more. 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.300
 stay with God
