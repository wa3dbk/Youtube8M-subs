match<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.330> said<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.570> knew<00:01:12.720> Rotom<00:01:13.080> wash

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
match so like I said I knew Rotom wash

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.440 
match so like I said I knew Rotom wash
would<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> best<00:01:13.890> bet<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> start<00:01:15.360> off

the<00:01:15.630> game<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.930> figured<00:01:16.170> gengar<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the game and I figured gengar would be a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.830 
the game and I figured gengar would be a
good<00:01:17.100> partner<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.520> pair<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.180> because

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
good partner to pair it up with because

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.780 
good partner to pair it up with because
I<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:19.530> target<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> Shan<00:01:20.070> no<00:01:20.189> Lauren<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.580> even

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
I can target the Shan no Lauren can even

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.120 
I can target the Shan no Lauren can even
burn<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.360> mega<00:01:21.930> venusaur<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.950> mega

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
burn the mega venusaur and you know mega

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.649 
burn the mega venusaur and you know mega
video<00:01:23.250> stores<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.880> anyway<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.479> my

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
video stores really anyway so if my

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
video stores really anyway so if my
opponent<00:01:24.810> did<00:01:25.110> decide<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> lead<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.009> I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
opponent did decide to lead with it I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
opponent did decide to lead with it I
could<00:01:26.549> burn<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.820> right<00:01:26.850> from<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> start<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
could burn it right from the start and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.030 
could burn it right from the start and
just<00:01:27.689> chip<00:01:27.990> away<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.530> residual

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
just chip away at it with residual

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
just chip away at it with residual
damage<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> lead<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.659> perfect

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
damage so the lead is really perfect

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.420 
damage so the lead is really perfect
with<00:01:31.110> me<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.470> he<00:01:31.590> goes<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.890> Shandor<00:01:32.310> an

road and wash this term and because i

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.580 
road and wash this term and because i

and<00:03:42.829> i<00:03:43.280> figured<00:03:43.579> my<00:03:43.819> end<00:03:44.000> game<00:03:44.120> was<00:03:44.269> basically

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
and i figured my end game was basically

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.360 
and i figured my end game was basically
have<00:03:44.780> guard<00:03:44.989> war<00:03:45.199> and<00:03:45.410> Rotom<00:03:45.680> wash<00:03:45.829> together

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.409 
out on the field but having mega Lucario
actually<00:03:49.220> helps<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.549> lot<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.030> because<00:03:50.299> I<00:03:50.359> do

much damage at this point there's really
nothing<00:05:01.780> my<00:05:01.870> opponent<00:05:02.230> can<00:05:02.350> do<00:05:02.470> so<00:05:02.680> he

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
nothing my opponent can do so he

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.220 
nothing my opponent can do so he

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.150 
definitely a lot closer than you'd
anticipated<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:07.600> be<00:05:07.630> like<00:05:07.930> I<00:05:08.050> said<00:05:08.260> if<00:05:09.100> my

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
anticipated to be like I said if my

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.010 
anticipated to be like I said if my
opponent<00:05:09.430> was<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.670> bit<00:05:09.850> more<00:05:09.970> aggressive<00:05:10.090> since

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
opponent was a bit more aggressive since

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.930 
opponent was a bit more aggressive since
he<00:05:11.140> was<00:05:11.290> ahead<00:05:11.410> already<00:05:11.770> at<00:05:11.920> some<00:05:12.130> points<00:05:12.490> I'm

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
he was ahead already at some points I'm

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.640 
he was ahead already at some points I'm
double<00:05:13.450> targeted<00:05:13.810> instead<00:05:14.110> of<00:05:14.290> you<00:05:14.620> know

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
double targeted instead of you know

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.590 
double targeted instead of you know
attacking<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:15.610> making<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:15.880> safe<00:05:16.090> play<00:05:16.300> he

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
attacking and making the safe play he

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.060 
attacking and making the safe play he
very<00:05:16.960> well<00:05:17.110> could<00:05:17.290> have<00:05:17.410> won<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.710> game<00:05:17.740> I

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
very well could have won the game I

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.060 
very well could have won the game I
really<00:05:19.000> relied<00:05:19.360> on<00:05:19.390> switches<00:05:20.290> I<00:05:20.320> you<00:05:20.980> know

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
really relied on switches I you know

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.530 
really relied on switches I you know
hoping<00:05:21.370> that<00:05:21.580> he<00:05:21.760> wouldn't<00:05:21.940> double<00:05:22.210> target<00:05:22.480> US

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
hoping that he wouldn't double target US

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.000 
hoping that he wouldn't double target US
law<00:05:22.690> and<00:05:22.990> in<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.170> end<00:05:23.290> it<00:05:23.410> did<00:05:23.560> work<00:05:23.710> out<00:05:23.890> like

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
law and in the end it did work out like

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.190 
law and in the end it did work out like
that<00:05:24.070> he<00:05:24.970> was<00:05:25.090> also<00:05:25.210> playing<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:25.600> bit<00:05:25.750> safer<00:05:26.080> by

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
that he was also playing a bit safer by

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.480 
that he was also playing a bit safer by
not<00:05:26.380> sleep<00:05:26.650> powdering<00:05:26.950> you<00:05:27.220> know<00:05:27.310> if<00:05:27.400> you

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
not sleep powdering you know if you

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.920 
not sleep powdering you know if you
sleep<00:05:27.790> powdered<00:05:28.120> instead<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:28.450> Giga<00:05:28.660> draining

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
sleep powdered instead of Giga draining

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.630 
sleep powdered instead of Giga draining
at<00:05:29.020> any<00:05:29.170> given<00:05:29.470> point<00:05:29.620> that<00:05:30.310> would<00:05:30.400> have<00:05:30.520> put

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
at any given point that would have put

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.940 
at any given point that would have put
me<00:05:30.790> set<00:05:31.510> me<00:05:31.600> back<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.900> lot<00:05:32.140> because<00:05:32.620> basically

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
me set me back a lot because basically

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.680 
me set me back a lot because basically
if<00:05:33.220> I<00:05:33.250> lost<00:05:33.460> any<00:05:33.640> momentum<00:05:34.150> in<00:05:34.270> terms<00:05:34.540> of

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
if I lost any momentum in terms of

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.730 
if I lost any momentum in terms of
switches<00:05:35.080> there<00:05:35.200> I<00:05:35.230> would<00:05:35.380> have<00:05:35.410> lost<00:05:35.620> the

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
switches there I would have lost the

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.470 
switches there I would have lost the
game<00:05:35.800> but<00:05:36.490> of<00:05:36.580> course<00:05:36.610> Lee<00:05:36.880> powder<00:05:37.060> is<00:05:37.270> kind<00:05:37.419> of

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
game but of course Lee powder is kind of

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.630 
game but of course Lee powder is kind of
a<00:05:37.540> bad<00:05:37.750> move<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.140> rely<00:05:38.410> on<00:05:38.440> but<00:05:38.890> really<00:05:39.460> cool

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
a bad move to rely on but really cool

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.890 
a bad move to rely on but really cool
