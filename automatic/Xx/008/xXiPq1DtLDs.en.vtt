00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 great love 1000 ps fans for the test 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.410
 some entry-level motorcycles are themselves 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.040
 go out with the a2 license 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.990
 we can have them, so to speak, 48 ps 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.460
 But there are some concepts found 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.460
 that fit into the class 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.519
 among other things fits for the a2 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.160
 license also the honda cbr 500 r 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.589
 the name promises some cbr 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.900
 honda the supersport devices and 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.890
 purely visually, she fits in very well 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.600
 the turn into it 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.880
 the front is extremely close to the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.770
 Super athletes also adapted the line 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 the paint of this model hair 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.450
 But it's the top ten 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.250
 a very easy to drive 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.960
 motorcycle just for beginners 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.630
 newcomer is suitable 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.759
 48 ps I have already mentioned the engine 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.640
 471 cubic a rows two-cylinder engine 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.310
 I find that relatively strong 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.190
 even works go up to 9000 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.630
 So that's fun to do, but this is fun 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.630
 also easy to drive 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.230
 mister code like you are gone very well 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.690
 I think visually also very successful 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.370
 Tricolor paint at Honda a real one 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.050
 Legend has already given right away 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.090
 c30 or maybe even earlier 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.380
 so you can really proud of it 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.720
 will be when you are so 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.820
 Of course, honestly, of course 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.680
 not super sporty but in this 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.890
 not possible, but not possible 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.390
 actually it is a non-travel of 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.950
 but never very pleasant if you 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.540
 now compares as a super sporty 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.600
 handlebars would probably be down 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.090
 Can you down there and there it is 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.420
 built really nice high 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.530
 lc display unfortunately without analog 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.750
 I always have the tachometer 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.110
 pretty much feels like spinning so high 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.510
 you then stop racer again and so 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.090
 otherwise little vibration in the handlebar 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.040
 and in the buttocks in the rivers there are 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.660
 maybe there would be some 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.520
 Greasy under sugar will be there 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.740
 still something to explain what that one 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.750
 system is that the that the 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.150
 information as to take out again 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.560
 but otherwise for beginners there 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.800
 motorcycle would be a bit sporty 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.320
 oriented and that he had already 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.320
 better for that is optimal 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.700
 Dear Mr. Tsonga in a nutshell has me 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.590
 especially because of these 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.160
 Suspension tuning important succeeded 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.590
 think that's the way it is is not 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.840
 really board but it is still 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.640
 tight enough to attack before in 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.070
 the bend and if you even motorcycles 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.490
 sell because he explains the suburb 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.740
 want 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.210
 otherwise you would open the disguise and 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.100
 what you notice is what objects 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.670
 great are surgical clothes 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.120
 attract 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.560
 Compared to the netbook, it is included 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.150
 higher speeds witte stable 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.660
 and also the cover printing on the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.430
 upper body really comes fortes 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.080
 stable there and I must say I am 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.200
 actually surprised how good it is 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.670
 Actually it is 48 ps thing now 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.650
 of course so if you really think so 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.520
 stretch very fast on very fast 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.170
 go after 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.380
 then you will be terribly prevented 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.530
 or once you are in the normal country roads 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.720
 operation continues 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.000
 the super one has trusted and because that 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.100
 have addressed this vibrational 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.709
 Share on the footrests that know 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.270
 Of course, just before frida you are even 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:05.720
 not to be seen thanks to the trap of 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.340
 war back but in the end it is 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.050
 so there is often down to the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.360
 Footpegs to the weight on it like that 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.040
 balancing weights then you feel the 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.609
 vibration is not strong at all 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.680
 felt no vibration at all 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.769
 on the contrary, the engine would have disturbed 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.380
 is relatively mau and book is but that 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.360
 I think it's really great, like you 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.470
 have already addressed it is just there 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.500
 also a naked bike the cb 500 f has 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.720
 then the handlebar in one and none 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.320
 wars but I find just the ergonomics 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.700
 the cbr 500 he is also very upright 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.860
 So you can not expect it 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.380
 now quite comfortable supersportlers 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.270
 but that works too, too 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.090
 for longer tours drive excellent 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.180
 you have a windshield and yes, too 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.210
 as you mentioned who with 48 ps 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.100
 I do not think well of hungry yes 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.770
 necessarily and it is for the entry 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.300
 also thought perfect and you have in the 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.289
 special program yes then enough others 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.770
 models 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.180
 with which one can ascend many 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.339
 thanks for watching if it's you 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.580
 Please, give us a favor 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:15.289
 thumbs up subscribes to our channel and 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.110
 maybe watch the others too 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.710
 again see videos of the series on 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.219
 say 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.219
 pauli code and congo
