00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.910
 it's not fair's fault it's not the fault of the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.719
 throat but it was not in me and I will 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.570
 of the flu but you want to put it here 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 nor did I take the course does not mean that 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.939
 clock already rained and shopping stores 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.890
 Look, I think it's a lack of 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.449
 knowledge of what is 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.949
 happening at petrobras 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.250
 Now I have no doubt that the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.260
 petrobras will be a company with a 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.840
 great ability to recover from it 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.010
 without big ones without great consequences 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.870
 now I wanted to talk better 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.050
 mainly in the country president does not 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.350
 I do not believe but I want to talk about 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.730
 The program that I came to do here, right ? 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.730
 I think that's an excuse 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.879
 the avaÃ­ is the head of den it all 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.870
 If you can respond, you 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.049
 demotion 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 the performance of the levi boy I think not 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.190
 the government will always try to avoid 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.240
 relegation this is absolutely 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.960
 Natural 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.049
 there is only regret that you do not have 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 had correspondence from 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.369
 the agency but I think it can 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.840
 fuel prices may increase. 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:29.729
 Discard anything but I think it has 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.390
 some problem because you do not have any 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.880
 expected fuel increase at bay 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.369
 the studio with old truck driver not 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.729
 government or how to lower the price of 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.899
 everything is interesting this story net me 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.340
 like style we spent the year 2013 and 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:54.810
 2014 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:57.689
 about criticism saying that the government 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.040
 and petrobras where to raise the price of 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.890
 gasoline and diesel 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:08.140
 Suddenly , we do not take 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:12.010
 spend the entire period from 100 to 120 reais 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.470
 in fact between 100 and 120 dollars a barrel 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.190
 both from brazil and wt without touching 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.180
 significantly in the prices of 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.580
 fuels 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.440
 now we also do not mess with what we did 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.090
 was resources 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.310
 that we did recompose so and not 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.700
 we took a villa in the price of 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.430
 fuel or lower because now 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.370
 politics is always better than 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.370
 fuel for it is what is what 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.190
 it is not possible to subject the country to high 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.130
 and oil policy cuts if 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.580
 back to rise too we are not 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.680
 pretending to touch the price now he has 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.840
 oscillations you can see if you 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.880
 Followed the market now I wanted 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.430
 Talk about my house, my life did not 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.590
 I say I will not talk about my home 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.430
 It was only when I made the turn and I 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.430
 I believe
