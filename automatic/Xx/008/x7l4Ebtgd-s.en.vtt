00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 yes I have here that the charging cable of 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.920
 systems that make a table for the xperia 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.940
 c1 c2 and c3 and here i have my z1 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.189
 that has to be plugged into the socket 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.500
 and I was asked if you could do that too 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.710
 can still hold in your hand how to do it 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.890
 operated and I just put it now 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.500
 times in the standby on the table is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:39.960
 and you realize that really locks into place 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 and immediately recognized and only that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.770
 is now picking up too 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.219
 really tight and you can do that too 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:59.309
 turn device to use normal as well 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:00.510
 use in the endgame and only in 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.600
 small active 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.049
 that should really fall off 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.659
 you just take the cable and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.490
 a little hold on the housing that one 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.479
 the back is clamped by hand and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.130
 then that is not fixed that way 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.439
 can go off and also with cover you can 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.390
 the lan I tell you now how times 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.000
 you have to cover it for that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.150
 do it once 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.360
 many also have a cover for it and 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.630
 frank you can recharge the one anyway 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.930
 must be careful that the magnet 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.759
 the connection with open otherwise has 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.659
 it does not work 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.350
 but with my role of semmel alone 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.350
 that works in any case 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.640
 you can see that the magnet connections 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.640
 are free 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.550
 they are already free and also rested here 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:15.750
 the magnet karl load if I put one 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:19.400
 well and it also charges up when the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.550
 someone moves a bit nothing happens 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.760
 So you can really great 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:31.140
 use 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:33.570
 the charging time / 7 percent to 100 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.680
 percent at the z1 now just as long 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:43.320
 as with the original charging cable from Sony 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:48.209
 with the normal microsd plug 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.860
 and I'm just happy and me 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.380
 can recommend it because you do not have the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.720
 cut off has to do and it can be 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.160
 even though one is careful now 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.160
 For me, for example, there are a few things 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.750
 slipped but that's not really 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.150
 problem 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.680
 you should only pay attention so if 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.049
 You have to lie that was right 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.010
 You do not live that high if you do 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:18.540
 so that gives that the then drops 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:22.400
 Throws but gives up but that is 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.400
 actually no problem with the device
