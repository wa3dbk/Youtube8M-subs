 Maneuverability What makes a normal transporter not fast enough 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.150
 is there are people next to a Porsche and let the conversion

 beaten a little out of the way was the 9 44 from Zuffenhausen already done 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.239
 thanks to a small company from Oberrad that is not enough she builds on basis 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.269
 of the Porsche 911 in the first brisk Combé

 since 1973 Liebke a porsche model untouched by his ideas 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.940
 if you have one in your life we ​​will see a lot poorer 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.240
 and the demand was very high 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.339
 for smaller tags and size 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.920
 Wolfsburg BoerseGo 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.470
 Haberberger because of these proteins demand on Laufer run over it 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.430
 thought 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.340
 what you want to continue over normal 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.990
 the idea to make out Homer was third the way the two places go in the

 Haufe 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 Percent of the Steiling he has done very well 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.840
 Zimmermanns the meadow to optimize the given forms of the production vehicle 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 to keep the Porsche typical face 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.060
 a total of 8000 cargo 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.759
 Streep Motorsport previously built seven of them were to Norway 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:31.700
 exported 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.720
 the station wagon would be classified there as a wet motor car 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.900
 Luxury tax on sports cars is thus eliminated 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.100
 a VW Passat that was the basis to model a relief goods also and 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.290
 provides the necessary rigidity 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.920
 Percent even if a vehicle ends here 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.680
 above the windshield 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.960
 and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.480
 this entire area here 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 is now the change of the station wagon 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.219
 both the change selected at the station wagon substantially further back

 open it electrically and close it again 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.659
 Sosa used to stand in the way that has now been accommodated here 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.979
 so you just a big gap 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.979
 Loading area gets 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.620
 just to round off the project Simon Athens have gone the complete 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.250
 Interior equipment to be made new principle on the basis of consequences 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.399
 the sides of it we have made new padded up larger 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:44.609
 old red wheels also the sky of the first brood has been made more

 the production model of the 9 44 and the Porsche Carrera Cups 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.089
 only the form test recognize that it is the same model 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.079
 the absolute highlight, of course, is the loading area 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.529
 and if they want to get firewood with their Porsche in the future 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.849
 Just announce one at GP Motorsport
