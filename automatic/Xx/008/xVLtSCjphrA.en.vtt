00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello i 'm in video souza 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.980
 spectacular and in the viola of today I go 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.590
 tell you about breakers I 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.620
 I have here a breaker of 20 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.080
 amperes is and I went to give an explanation 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.160
 basic for you on what goes together 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.160
 and where it is used the circuit breaker 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.250
 it is a switch that you when 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 exceeds the load established by it 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.030
 he is going to disarm 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.460
 then it will stay connected in case you 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.300
 join here it has the capacity of 20 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.120
 pet 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.360
 so if you suddenly no machine 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.989
 an electric shower anything 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 on the exit of joined and for some reason 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.100
 will be to see a short or the machine of a 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.230
 overheating extrapolated and 20 amps 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.140
 What will not he do? 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.260
 automatically disarm 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.280
 so the primary function of a circuit breaker is 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.570
 this is to protect the circuit is that this 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.540
 first video here I 'm just going to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.000
 show what is today joined for you 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.640
 to have an idea this model exists 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.630
 here I usually more modern 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.400
 above is that and that other model is a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 little older than it is still 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.799
 much used it is black forgot the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.930
 his correct name but the two of them 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.659
 work the same way 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.259
 so it 's always when you will use 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.320
 a circuit breaker you will break the wire 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.979
 positive and it will pass through the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.079
 circuit breaker on the output of it will do this 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.520
 existing load shedding along the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:51.990
 various capacities such as 15 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.600
 perez 20 30 40 and the use of the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.579
 must be made in accordance with the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.340
 circuit you are going to use 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.630
 so for example is when you buy 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.520
 something that consumes a lot 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.280
 such as the showerhead 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.719
 in the operating instructions manual 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.869
 of installation 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.959
 it will already indicate which wire gauge 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.360
 that is the thickness of the wire and which 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.200
 with the ability of the circuit breaker to 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.069
 you will use and in homes not 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.380
 It's important, you always have it together. 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.260
 unprotecting each step so you have 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.989
 in your internal power grid at least 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.900
 circuit breaker to protect the 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.360
 from the other disposal to protect 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.239
 the part of the takes or you do is to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.239
 segmentation by house rooms 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.090
 so for example I go there the next 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.160
 the distribution panel and then 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.069
 I put it for example of a whole going 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.890
 protect the other room will protect the 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.220
 the other manager will promote the other will have 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.489
 conditioning and the more segmented 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.340
 better because you 're going to have a circuit 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.650
 in your home that it will 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.060
 be more protected then if you 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.850
 one day you have to make a 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.040
 repair for example in the room 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.690
 you will simply turn off the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.870
 room breaker you will have energy 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.109
 electric in the rest of the house so it's 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.579
 basically that's what it's for, not me 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.819
 this first video the intention was only 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:28.680
 even to demonstrate what they a whole 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:32.040
 it has that ijf entry on the output and 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.410
 in the next video I make the channel 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.350
 I'll try to make a practical example. 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.329
 and also show how you 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.389
 assembly distributed here in a 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.790
 distribution box since it has joined the 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.790
 that he has a really cool system that he 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.660
 fixed by a clip that has here then 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.700
 It's this video I'll end up here and 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.260
 I make available through the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.500
 comments you have any questions 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.810
 Do you want to ask any questions you can? 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.849
 try to clarify for you if you go 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.910
 like the video I ask you here click 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.560
 I did not like it and signed up for the channel I 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.670
 I'm publishing content 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.190
 related to him 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.900
 roni electricity and telecommunications 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.900
 Thank you so much for watching the video.
