 I will slowly show what it is 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.539
 what happens patricia more than 40 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.340
 self-managed workers who are the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.039
 that are carrying forward this 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.800
 Grill restored one of the four 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.750
 you will remember this system of 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 restaurants that are self-managed 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 that are the same as we are 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 showing the sunny spot is and don 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.030
 battle 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.159
 are being self managed by these 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.130
 workers when their respective 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.950
 owners left them emptied and so on 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.990
 a situation that we will later be 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 detailing with the members of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 this permanent guard of workers 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.280
 that is here in the room on the floor 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.680
 high there are workers sleeping because 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.500
 they take turns every 6 hours to be 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.580
 permanently awake and alert the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.530
 24 hours for fear of eviction and yesterday in 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.869
 night hours lots of 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.210
 public and representatives of different 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.250
 cooperative sectors also and 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.310
 cooperativists have come up 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.869
 here to this important corner of 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.479
 porteño neighborhood of villa crespo el 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.909
 heart of villa crespo to tell you yes 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.460
 to this family work source if you 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.680
 it seems good we share it 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.100
 they are still the goiás 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.759
 because we are fighting 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.580
 I had a lot of pain at the time 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.350
 for my son and was the support of the laburo 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.350
 I had tell him the truth 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.150
 and we are struggling how to get to the ideal 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.939
 and it grew thanks to the management of 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.250
 employees and the good customers that 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.290
 they trusted them but there is still a 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.930
 issue to resolve that worries them and 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.689
 very much fear that the completion of the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.909
 legal travel impede continuity 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.099
 work we did until we wanted each other 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.230
 Concentrate with the neighbors to be able to 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.569
 sign something to see if it was of any use 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.700
 because that's what I say meeting 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.450
 for family friends we have come to 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.760
 celebrate almost the end of the year almost Christmas the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.319
 friend's day all cute reasons for 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.870
 open here we make us know 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.909
 a lot so it's going back with someone 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.859
 known by luck in fact to the owner 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.389
 we physically did not know her 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.609
 never because who are all day 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.290
 with us are they so for 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.400
 we are a continuity and hopefully 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.919
 follow do not leave others stayed and 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.739
 the bravest resisted and the 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.930
 brave they brought to others was 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.669
 working on something else and first 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.480
 as i tell you 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:22.920
 I wanted to elaborate and well and here 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.930
 apart you do not love much and you take 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.650
 a lot and then you can follow 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.940
 growing in all the truth that not in 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.379
 no time I thought it was going to be a 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.470
 madness for nothing you feel proud if 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.849
 for that reason I am here though 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.970
 I went in after everything was already 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.310
 concluded, I also feel part and 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.210
 I work alongside that to do 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.150
 the best possible for all 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.760
 [Music] 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.069
 well this is the patriotic panorama and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.739
 roberto the after the grill of two 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.870
 plants so important that it has been very 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.349
 known in his time remember and that 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.489
 now it is being carried forward 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.980
 commercially by this group of 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.500
 self-managed workers obviously 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.079
 the only one remember if I finished 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.909
 patrick tale that there was 5 grill 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.370
 do these characteristics in these 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.410
 characteristics akhter east and almost in the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.180
 fifth that was the zaranda that was 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.280
 also in villa urquiza is the one that closed 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.470
 The truth is that here are these four 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.810
 grills in this case ale ale the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.139
 main the most important resisting 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.440
 at this moment I remind you that here more 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.780
 of 140 workers more than 140 families 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.580
 patricians are resisting this 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.650
 situation I hear you yes there we are 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.940
 seeing the faces of the workers 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.990
 the effort they are making 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.760
 keep your forts 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.590
 sources of work laura and many 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.690
 customers who are not aware of these 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.240
 situations that go the ends of 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.310
 week to these places and that the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.979
 workers keep not the same 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.720
 way they did it before 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.970
 then they are not oblivious to these 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.160
 also good can get involved and 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.810
 collaborate and support so that you do not 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.430
 lose sources of work if you 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.560
 transform these restaurants into 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.360
 cooperatives can go ahead and 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.240
 working normally as they came 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.040
 doing so far and as I said 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.020
 normally and as you say robert 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.270
 and patricia normally and also with 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.640
 all the legal procedures taking them to 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.230
 because we remember that they started a 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.910
 process this have announced what we can 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.770
 talk in minutes on the other exit with 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.230
 them that of course we're going to try to 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.910
 have any contact have made the 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.250
 corresponding procedures before the 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.620
 national institute of associativism and 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.660
 social economy to be constituted 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.970
 formally as a true 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.500
 cooperative work really a 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.940
 merit and an effort that are leading 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.370
 forward this group of families 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.740
 workers that is made as you wish 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.510
 in this case there are 140 families but there 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.040
 to keep in mind that in all the 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.060
 Buenos Aires city are more than 2,000 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.400
 workers almost 30 SMEs recovered and 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.960
 who are in this situation 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.000
 precarious after the veto of the head of 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.220
 Buenos Aires government mauricio macri in 2011 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.080
 of the extension of this law that protected 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.479
 to this kind of 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.889
 recovered factories let's go back 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.139
 right away laura if it seems like a 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.770
 just a minute later 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.770
 see you later
