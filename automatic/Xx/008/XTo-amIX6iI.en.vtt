screen<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> second<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.219> has<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.520> is

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
screen all the second one has to do is

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
screen all the second one has to do is
touch<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.059> different<00:00:48.420> mode<00:00:48.559> you<00:00:49.559> have

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
touch the different mode you have

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.430 
touch the different mode you have
different<00:00:49.920> panoramic<00:00:50.760> modes<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.780> also<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.200> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
different panoramic modes we also have a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
different panoramic modes we also have a
couple<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> streets<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.309> settings<00:00:53.640> what's

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
couple of streets at settings what's

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.760 
couple of streets at settings what's
nice<00:00:54.390> about<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.200> KDP<00:00:55.469> it's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
nice about this is that the KDP it's

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.279 
nice about this is that the KDP it's
automatically<00:00:56.219> said<00:00:56.489> adjusting<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.289> patient

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
automatically said adjusting to patient

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.010 
automatically said adjusting to patient
so<00:00:58.680> depending<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> patient's<00:00:59.610> age<00:01:00.020> size

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
so depending on the patient's age size

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.529 
so depending on the patient's age size
all<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.620> kvp<00:01:02.190> would<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.550> KP<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.120> ma<00:01:03.239> setting

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
all the kvp would be KP and ma setting

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.559 
all the kvp would be KP and ma setting
to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.960> automatically<00:01:05.209> we<00:01:06.209> also<00:01:06.359> have<00:01:06.509> a

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:06.569 
to be just automatically we also have a

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:11.749 
to be just automatically we also have a
couple<00:01:06.689> 50<00:01:07.139> modes<00:01:07.850> TMJ<00:01:09.770> with<00:01:10.770> TMJ<00:01:11.039> we<00:01:11.399> also<00:01:11.549> do

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
couple 50 modes TMJ with TMJ we also do

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.769 
couple 50 modes TMJ with TMJ we also do
a<00:01:11.969> sinus<00:01:12.719> scan<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.450> also<00:01:15.569> have<00:01:15.749> a

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:15.779 
a sinus scan and we also have a

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:18.499 
a sinus scan and we also have a
specialty<00:01:16.439> screen<00:01:16.799> where<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.039> can<00:01:17.279> do<00:01:17.509> might

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
specialty screen where we can do might

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.429 
specialty screen where we can do might
wings<00:01:18.719> and<00:01:19.020> orthogonal<00:01:19.709> cuts

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
wings and orthogonal cuts

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.510 
wings and orthogonal cuts
unlike<00:01:22.439> your<00:01:22.560> traditional<00:01:22.709> panorex<00:01:23.310> where

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
unlike your traditional panorex where

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.039 
unlike your traditional panorex where
you<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.789> a<00:01:23.819> mirror<00:01:24.149> system<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.599> patient<00:01:24.959> is

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you have a mirror system that patient is

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.989 
you have a mirror system that patient is
looking<00:01:25.859> into<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.039> mirror<00:01:26.219> and<00:01:26.549> your<00:01:26.789> staff

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:26.999 
looking into the mirror and your staff

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:28.249 
looking into the mirror and your staff
members<00:01:27.149> standing<00:01:27.539> on<00:01:27.599> the<00:01:27.659> side<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.079> trying

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
members standing on the side and trying

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.569 
members standing on the side and trying
to<00:01:28.380> adjust<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.859> laser<00:01:29.039> light<00:01:29.279> for

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
to adjust the laser light for

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.969 
to adjust the laser light for
positioning<00:01:30.029> with<00:01:30.630> our<00:01:30.749> device<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
positioning with our device we do a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.559 
positioning with our device we do a
front-loading<00:01:32.429> and<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:33.419> it's

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
front-loading and because it's

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.330 
front-loading and because it's
front-loading<00:01:34.049> now<00:01:34.499> the<00:01:34.560> staff<00:01:34.889> member<00:01:35.130> has<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
front-loading now the staff member has a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.669 
front-loading now the staff member has a
direct<00:01:35.700> frontal<00:01:36.270> view<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.569> the<00:01:36.689> patient<00:01:36.840> okay

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
direct frontal view of the patient okay

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.379 
direct frontal view of the patient okay
so<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.189> positioning<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.759> could<00:01:38.880> liner

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:39.389 
so for positioning that we could liner

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:41.239 
so for positioning that we could liner
up<00:01:39.599> correctly<00:01:39.959> so<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.679> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.859> see<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.130> have

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
up correctly so as you can see we have

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:42.499
