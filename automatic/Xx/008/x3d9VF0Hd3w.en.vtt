that's<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.840> really<00:01:19.170> good<00:01:22.460> but<00:01:23.460> having<00:01:23.670> varied

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that's a really good but having varied

terrain<00:01:24.710> as<00:01:25.710> part<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.220> horses<00:01:26.610> daily

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
terrain as part of your horses daily

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.600 
terrain as part of your horses daily
life<00:01:27.149> if<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.960> can't<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.830> out<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.250> terrain

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
life if you can't get out on terrain

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.660 
life if you can't get out on terrain
like<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.050> when<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:31.140> exercise<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:32.460> horse

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
like this when you exercise your horse

then<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.240> great<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:34.170> emulate<00:01:34.649> this<00:01:34.950> sort<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
then it's great to emulate this sort of

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.580 
then it's great to emulate this sort of
thing<00:01:35.759> inside<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.600> own<00:01:36.720> domestic<00:01:37.080> paddock

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and whether that's just having rocks

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.490 
and whether that's just having rocks
around<00:01:39.360> your<00:01:39.509> water<00:01:39.690> trough<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.229> where<00:01:40.380> your

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
around your water trough or where your

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.580 
around your water trough or where your
feed<00:01:40.740> source<00:01:41.240> gives<00:01:42.240> them<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.990> good

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.600 

anyway<00:01:46.590> we'll<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.039> a<00:01:47.069> spin<00:01:47.100> we'll<00:01:47.459> show
