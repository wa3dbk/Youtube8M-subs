00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
hi today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.789 
hi today I'm going to show you how to
make<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.370> loop<00:00:05.700> in<00:00:05.940> GarageBand<00:00:06.870> using<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.350> iPad

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
make a loop in GarageBand using the iPad

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.169 
make a loop in GarageBand using the iPad
we're<00:00:08.130> going<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> use<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.700> simple<00:00:08.910> acoustic

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
we're going to use a simple acoustic

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.360 
we're going to use a simple acoustic
guitar<00:00:09.630> track<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.260> one<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.950> drum<00:00:11.130> loops

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
guitar track and one of the drum loops

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.519 
guitar track and one of the drum loops
included<00:00:11.820> with<00:00:12.000> GarageBand<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:15.350> let's<00:00:16.350> create

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
included with GarageBand so let's create

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.550 
included with GarageBand so let's create
a<00:00:16.619> new<00:00:16.680> song<00:00:17.010> let's<00:00:17.869> go<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.230> audio

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
a new song let's go to the audio

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.349 
a new song let's go to the audio
recorder<00:00:20.070> first<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.820> all<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.000> want<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> pick

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
recorder first of all you want to pick

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.269 
recorder first of all you want to pick
out<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> drum<00:00:21.869> loop<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.800> want<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.070> use

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
out the drum loop that we want to use

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.839 
out the drum loop that we want to use
and<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> pattern<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.490> we're<00:00:26.490> gonna<00:00:26.580> be

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and the pattern that we're gonna be

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.190 
and the pattern that we're gonna be
using<00:00:27.949> a<00:00:28.949> loop<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.369> will<00:00:30.590> my<00:00:31.590> guitar<00:00:31.920> pick

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
using a loop with will my guitar pick

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:46.240 
using a loop with will my guitar pick
should<00:00:34.200> sound<00:00:34.410> something<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.069 

okay<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.309> let's<00:00:47.670> figure<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> tempo

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
okay so let's figure out what the tempo

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.000 
okay so let's figure out what the tempo
for<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:50.420> first<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:51.739> I'm<00:00:52.739> gonna<00:00:52.920> need

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
for that is first of all I'm gonna need

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.340 
for that is first of all I'm gonna need
the<00:00:53.100> metronome<00:00:53.579> we're<00:00:54.539> gonna<00:00:54.809> use<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> count

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the metronome we're gonna use the count

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.010 
the metronome we're gonna use the count
in<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.480> want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
in for this because we want to have a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.040 
in for this because we want to have a
count<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> recording<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.690> 110

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
count in for the recording so it's 110

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.530 
count in for the recording so it's 110
what<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.350> want<00:01:01.559> okay

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.940 

pretty<00:01:07.140> close<00:01:07.320> let's<00:01:07.650> keep<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> at<00:01:08.010> 110<00:01:09.950> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
pretty close let's keep it at 110 and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
pretty close let's keep it at 110 and
time<00:01:11.310> signature<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.909> 4<00:01:14.000> okay<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.750> everything

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
time signature for 4 okay so everything

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
time signature for 4 okay so everything
looks<00:01:16.140> good<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.460> 1

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
looks good here you see it's the 1

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.310 
looks good here you see it's the 1
through<00:01:17.820> 8<00:01:17.909> at<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> top<00:01:18.330> that's<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
through 8 at the top that's because the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.780 
through 8 at the top that's because the
default<00:01:21.020> setting<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.590> loop<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:23.009> actually<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
default setting for a loop or actually a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.480 
default setting for a loop or actually a
section<00:01:24.240> rather<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.740> GarageBand<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.860> 8<00:01:26.070> bar<00:01:26.310> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
section rather on GarageBand is 8 bar so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
section rather on GarageBand is 8 bar so
we're<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.790> keep<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> same<00:01:28.040> okay

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
we're going to keep that the same okay

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.630 
we're going to keep that the same okay
let's<00:01:29.220> pick<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> drum<00:01:29.970> loop<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.900> like

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
let's pick out a drum loop that we like

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.160 
let's pick out a drum loop that we like
and<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.880> listen<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.600> these<00:01:33.780> drum

and you can listen to all these drum

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.020 
and you can listen to all these drum
loops<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.860> here<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.759> instance

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
loops that they have here for instance

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:45.920 
loops that they have here for instance
this<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:40.170> fine

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
