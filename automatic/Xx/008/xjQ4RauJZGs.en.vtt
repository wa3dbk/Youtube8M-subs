00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.140 
know when do you want me to talk to her
hold<00:04:20.630> this<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:21.139> kind<00:04:21.409> of<00:04:21.490> can<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.610> do<00:04:22.669> that<00:04:22.970> and

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
hold this and kind of can I do that and

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:33.859 
hold this and kind of can I do that and
that<00:04:23.630> can<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:23.990> try<00:04:24.229> that<00:04:24.259> he<00:04:24.500> said

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:33.869 

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:37.999 

and<00:04:34.869> so<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.139> have<00:04:35.319> no<00:04:35.349> direction<00:04:35.830> from<00:04:36.309> Jerry

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
and so I have no direction from Jerry

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.589 
and so I have no direction from Jerry
but<00:04:39.009> I<00:04:39.039> I<00:04:39.369> guess<00:04:39.729> I<00:04:39.909> know<00:04:39.969> I<00:04:40.089> just<00:04:40.210> need<00:04:40.479> to

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
but I I guess I know I just need to

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.389 
but I I guess I know I just need to
follow<00:04:40.779> him<00:04:41.020> because<00:04:41.169> he<00:04:41.529> was<00:04:41.649> so<00:04:41.830> amazing<00:04:42.039> and

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:42.399 
follow him because he was so amazing and

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:44.219 
follow him because he was so amazing and
if<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.669> just<00:04:42.999> listen<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:43.569> what<00:04:43.960> he<00:04:43.990> was<00:04:44.169> doing

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
if I just listen to what he was doing

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.609 
if I just listen to what he was doing
maybe<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.830> could<00:04:45.009> figure<00:04:45.159> out<00:04:45.309> what<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.699> do<00:04:46.619> and

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:47.619 
maybe I could figure out what to do and

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:50.219 
maybe I could figure out what to do and
and<00:04:48.009> I<00:04:48.339> guess<00:04:48.520> that<00:04:48.550> speaks<00:04:49.059> to<00:04:49.210> Jenni<00:04:49.779> Terry's

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
and I guess that speaks to Jenni Terry's

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.089 
and I guess that speaks to Jenni Terry's
generosity<00:04:51.099> you<00:04:51.249> know<00:04:51.369> you<00:04:51.430> didn't<00:04:52.389> really<00:04:53.099> it

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
wasn't kind of controlling in the way

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.119 
wasn't kind of controlling in the way
that<00:04:55.839> he<00:04:55.930> would<00:04:56.080> tell<00:04:56.319> you<00:04:56.499> you're<00:04:56.830> supposed

to do this we're supposed to do that he

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:04.499 
to do this we're supposed to do that he
trusted<00:04:59.879> that<00:05:00.879> you<00:05:01.029> would<00:05:01.180> just<00:05:01.389> do<00:05:01.599> what<00:05:03.509> the
