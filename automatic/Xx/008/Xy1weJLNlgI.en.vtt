jailbreaks<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.520> red<00:01:47.909> snow<00:01:48.209> so<00:01:48.419> all<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.599> have

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
jailbreaks of red snow so all you have

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.659 
jailbreaks of red snow so all you have
to<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.319> just<00:01:49.349> click<00:01:49.679> jailbreak<00:01:50.069> and<00:01:50.520> then

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:50.669 
to do is just click jailbreak and then

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:52.999 
to do is just click jailbreak and then
watch<00:01:50.849> the<00:01:51.119> magic<00:01:51.299> happen<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:52.049> your<00:01:52.679> device

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.009 

restoring<00:02:10.879> in<00:02:11.060> progress<00:02:11.450> that's<00:02:11.689> excellent

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.020 
restoring in progress that's excellent
that<00:02:12.290> means<00:02:12.469> the<00:02:12.650> jailbreak<00:02:13.099> went<00:02:13.310> pretty

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
that means the jailbreak went pretty

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.149 
that means the jailbreak went pretty
