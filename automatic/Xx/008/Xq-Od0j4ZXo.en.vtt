years<00:01:03.570> later<00:01:04.549> do<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:06.090> realize<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.960> he

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
years later do we now realize that he

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.890 
years later do we now realize that he
wasn't<00:01:07.439> crazy<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.869> yet<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:11.450> some<00:01:12.450> more

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
wasn't crazy at all yet so some more

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.230 
wasn't crazy at all yet so some more
methods<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.680> crystal<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.430> blazing<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.119> all

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
methods are crystal and blazing and all

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.310 
methods are crystal and blazing and all
that<00:01:15.750> rock<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:17.090> basically<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.020> any

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that rock but basically if you do any

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
that rock but basically if you do any
two<00:01:19.740> hybrid<00:01:20.340> standing<00:01:20.790> probably<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
two hybrid standing probably going to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600 
two hybrid standing probably going to
get<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.350> i<00:01:22.380> did<00:01:22.650> my<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:22.950> crispin<00:01:23.369> right

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
get one but i did my with crispin right

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.770 
get one but i did my with crispin right
change<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.409> level<00:01:28.799> 1<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:30.750> level

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
change so this is it at level 1 to level

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.220 
change so this is it at level 1 to level
3<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.340> level<00:01:32.640> 46
