00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.270
 we had sashed 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.880
 process production lines structure 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.880
 we were not together in a week 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.609
 the incoming components 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.609
 in the making of a clear rise in structures 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
 the manufacturing process of the quarter 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.570
 blogs a corresponding 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.539
 smith position as crimes must be taken 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.590
 through this film 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.590
 to be positioned relative to each other 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.910
 fixation yet positioned together made more 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.430
 fixed by common term 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.790
 crowd success 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.790
 to enjoy my children 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.090
 products 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.330
 an official 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.920
 video editing lines design below turpin 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.440
 allows to manufacture 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.590
 in one operation all the fixtures 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.590
 and operations and making necessary 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.909
 the presence of numerous sensors to identify the unfolding 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760
 fabrications 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 alerted remote operators 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
 intervention required 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.620
 these devices 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.840
 allowing an operator 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.860
 to drive easily 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 since, 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 active lines between masked time 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.210
 the capacity of these machines 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.850
 offers a performance of 15 linear meters per minute 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.480
 the accessories are 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.820
 a power supply cabinet 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.990
 forklifts handling mountain slabs 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.400
 readiness 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.170
 for the fabrications
