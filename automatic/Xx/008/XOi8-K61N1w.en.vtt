had a lot of squeaking going on in the
suspension<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.090> I've<00:00:35.600> dealt<00:00:35.810> with<00:00:35.840> that

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
suspension so I've dealt with that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.810 
suspension so I've dealt with that
before<00:00:36.380> in<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.560> old<00:00:36.710> trailer<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.280> I<00:00:37.520> want<00:00:37.730> to

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
before in the old trailer and I want to

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.220 
before in the old trailer and I want to
just<00:00:37.910> do<00:00:38.150> a<00:00:38.180> quick<00:00:38.480> video<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:38.900> show<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:39.080> how

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
just do a quick video to show you how

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.980 
just do a quick video to show you how
I'm<00:00:39.710> actually<00:00:40.010> dealing<00:00:40.610> with<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:41.060> so<00:00:41.660> we've

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
I'm actually dealing with that so we've

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.510 
I'm actually dealing with that so we've
lifted<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.380> whole<00:00:42.500> trailer<00:00:42.860> up<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.250> got<00:00:43.400> it

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
lifted the whole trailer up and got it

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.760 
lifted the whole trailer up and got it
up<00:00:43.550> on<00:00:43.730> jack<00:00:43.970> stands<00:00:44.300> remove<00:00:44.990> the<00:00:45.140> wheel<00:00:45.320> and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
up on jack stands remove the wheel and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.050 
up on jack stands remove the wheel and
then<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:46.100> have<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.400> floor<00:00:46.610> jack<00:00:46.850> underneath

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
then I have the floor jack underneath

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.180 
then I have the floor jack underneath
the<00:00:47.390> axle<00:00:47.510> itself<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:48.200> I<00:00:48.260> can<00:00:48.470> manipulate<00:00:48.680> that

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
the axle itself so I can manipulate that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.430 
the axle itself so I can manipulate that
this<00:00:49.820> trailer<00:00:50.120> has<00:00:50.330> a<00:00:50.360> leaf<00:00:50.720> spring<00:00:51.020> on<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:51.200> is

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
this trailer has a leaf spring on it is

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.890 
this trailer has a leaf spring on it is
most<00:00:51.770> do<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:53.060> has<00:00:53.240> to<00:00:53.360> come<00:00:53.540> off<00:00:53.570> in

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
most do and that has to come off in

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.720 
most do and that has to come off in
order<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.170> put<00:00:54.680> some<00:00:54.800> lubrication<00:00:55.250> on<00:00:55.490> there

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
order to put some lubrication on there

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.340 
order to put some lubrication on there
I'm<00:00:56.270> using<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.600> high<00:00:56.750> temperature<00:00:57.050> grease

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
I'm using a high temperature grease

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.960 
I'm using a high temperature grease
because<00:00:57.680> not<00:00:58.370> because<00:00:58.490> we<00:00:58.730> have<00:00:58.850> high

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
because not because we have high

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.550 
because not because we have high
temperature<00:00:59.420> issues<00:00:59.780> here<00:01:00.020> but<00:01:00.170> what<00:01:00.320> we<00:01:00.440> do

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
temperature issues here but what we do

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.010 
temperature issues here but what we do
have<00:01:00.770> is<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:01.730> does<00:01:02.240> really<00:01:02.450> really<00:01:02.510> well<00:01:02.720> when

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
have is it does really really well when

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.780 
have is it does really really well when
you<00:01:03.080> continually<00:01:03.770> dip<00:01:04.009> it<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.309> water<00:01:04.489> it's

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
you continually dip it in the water it's

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.249 
you continually dip it in the water it's
completely<00:01:05.180> waterproof<00:01:05.479> like<00:01:05.900> some<00:01:06.109> other

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
completely waterproof like some other

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.010 
completely waterproof like some other
grease<00:01:06.469> will<00:01:06.829> start<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.219> wash<00:01:07.670> away<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.030> using

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
grease will start to wash away so using

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.810 
grease will start to wash away so using
high<00:01:09.170> temp<00:01:09.409> here<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:09.829> if<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.340> come<00:01:10.490> over<00:01:10.520> here

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
high temp here and if you come over here

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.669 
high temp here and if you come over here
and<00:01:10.969> look<00:01:11.390> I've<00:01:11.570> got<00:01:11.749> basically<00:01:12.350> just<00:01:12.590> two

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
and look I've got basically just two

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.139 
and look I've got basically just two
bolts<00:01:12.950> that<00:01:13.070> pulled<00:01:13.340> out<00:01:13.490> one<00:01:13.729> here<00:01:13.999> in<00:01:14.060> the

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
bolts that pulled out one here in the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.370 
bolts that pulled out one here in the
front<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.570> we've<00:01:14.689> got<00:01:14.840> another<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.229> back

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
front and we've got another in the back

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.539 
front and we've got another in the back
and<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.649> can<00:01:15.770> see<00:01:15.890> this<00:01:15.950> is<00:01:16.070> really<00:01:16.340> really

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
and you can see this is really really

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.580 
and you can see this is really really
dry<00:01:16.789> it's<00:01:17.359> all<00:01:17.479> rusty<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:17.899> that's<00:01:18.409> what's

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
dry it's all rusty and that's what's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.919 
dry it's all rusty and that's what's
causing<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.039> squeaking<00:01:19.789> that<00:01:20.569> holds<00:01:20.840> the

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
causing the squeaking that holds the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:22.599 
causing the squeaking that holds the
leaf<00:01:21.109> spring<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.859> shackle<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.460> the

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
leaf spring to the shackle and the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.940 
leaf spring to the shackle and the
shackle<00:01:22.999> up<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.420> frame<00:01:23.659> of<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:24.229> trailer

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
shackle up to the frame of the trailer

really<00:01:58.039> quite<00:01:58.279> a<00:01:58.310> job<00:01:58.579> I<00:01:58.609> really<00:01:58.729> had<00:01:59.029> to<00:01:59.060> stand

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
really quite a job I really had to stand

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.569 
really quite a job I really had to stand
on<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.600> trigger<00:01:59.840> in<00:01:59.990> order<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.319> make<00:02:00.499> that<00:02:00.649> you

know cooperate with me you could do it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.809 
know cooperate with me you could do it
with<00:02:03.139> a<00:02:03.170> say<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.829> ratchet<00:02:04.219> or<00:02:04.310> something<00:02:04.670> but

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
with a say a ratchet or something but

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.090

you're<00:02:05.029> going<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.359> be<00:02:05.479> out<00:02:05.600> here<00:02:05.749> for<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.049> while

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
you're going to be out here for a while

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.410 
you're going to be out here for a while
the<00:02:07.100> way<00:02:07.219> that<00:02:07.459> I<00:02:07.789> think<00:02:07.999> it's<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.149> way<00:02:08.270> it's

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
the way that I think it's the way it's

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.300 
the way that I think it's the way it's
built<00:02:08.660> if<00:02:08.869> they<00:02:09.050> do<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.289> reel<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.679> nut<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:10.069> the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
built if they do the reel the nut in the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.710 
built if they do the reel the nut in the
the<00:02:10.610> bolt<00:02:10.819> they're<00:02:11.030> very<00:02:11.330> very<00:02:11.450> tight

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
the bolt they're very very tight

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.199 
the bolt they're very very tight
together<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:13.069> tolerances<00:02:13.580> are<00:02:13.790> very<00:02:13.970> tight

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
together the tolerances are very tight

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.059 
together the tolerances are very tight

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
know kind of lubricated all the face on

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.869 
know kind of lubricated all the face on
here<00:02:20.290> wherever<00:02:20.530> metal<00:02:20.920> touches<00:02:21.280> metal<00:02:21.579> of

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
here wherever metal touches metal of

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.459 
here wherever metal touches metal of
course<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.239> bolts<00:02:22.540> themselves<00:02:22.719> we'll<00:02:23.170> get<00:02:23.319> it

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
course the bolts themselves we'll get it

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.559

what<00:02:24.189> I<00:02:24.219> have<00:02:24.400> had<00:02:24.579> problems<00:02:24.730> with<00:02:24.999> before<00:02:25.269> in

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
what I have had problems with before in

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.000 
what I have had problems with before in
the<00:02:25.659> old<00:02:25.810> one<00:02:26.019> where<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.230> kind<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:26.769> let<00:02:26.889> that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
the old one where I kind of let that

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.830 
the old one where I kind of let that
squeak<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.519> go<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.879> it's<00:02:28.359> started<00:02:28.629> to<00:02:28.659> eat

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
squeak and go is it's started to eat

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.679 
squeak and go is it's started to eat
away<00:02:28.959> here<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.859> this<00:02:30.099> area<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.700> there's<00:02:31.540> not

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
away here in this area and there's not

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:32.940 
away here in this area and there's not
much<00:02:31.840> room<00:02:32.049> there<00:02:32.260> that's<00:02:32.439> maybe<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.709> quarter

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
much room there that's maybe a quarter

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.289 
much room there that's maybe a quarter
of<00:02:33.040> an<00:02:33.189> inch<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.459> metal<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:33.849> we<00:02:33.939> have<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> lot<00:02:34.269> of

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
of an inch of metal and we have a lot of

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.030 
of an inch of metal and we have a lot of
weight<00:02:34.569> being<00:02:34.870> transferred<00:02:35.319> around<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.889> so

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
weight being transferred around and so

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.530 
weight being transferred around and so
forth<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.430> it's<00:02:36.549> starting<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.849> unlock<00:02:37.150> this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
forth so it's starting to unlock this

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.420 
forth so it's starting to unlock this
hole<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:38.079> actually<00:02:38.590> had<00:02:38.859> to<00:02:38.980> build<00:02:39.159> that<00:02:39.370> up

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
hole I actually had to build that up

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.420 
hole I actually had to build that up
with<00:02:39.909> some<00:02:40.150> with<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.540> welder<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.169> grind<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.310> and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
with some with a welder and grind it and

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.860 
with some with a welder and grind it and
weld<00:02:42.579> it<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.760> grind<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.269> back<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.629> forth

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
weld it and grind it and back and forth

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.449 
weld it and grind it and back and forth
until<00:02:44.049> this<00:02:44.319> became<00:02:44.620> actually<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.010> round<00:02:45.219> hole

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
until this became actually a round hole

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.220 
until this became actually a round hole
again<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:45.939> it<00:02:46.299> will<00:02:46.480> eat<00:02:46.689> its<00:02:46.840> way<00:02:46.900> through

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
again but it will eat its way through

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.750 
again but it will eat its way through
there<00:02:47.469> and<00:02:47.680> then<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.919> spring<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.489> actually

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
there and then the spring is actually

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.530 
there and then the spring is actually
going<00:02:48.879> to<00:02:48.969> come<00:02:49.090> apart

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
going to come apart

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.970 
going to come apart
I<00:02:49.689> don't<00:02:50.169> think<00:02:50.349> you<00:02:50.409> have<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.650> get<00:02:50.769> all<00:02:50.859> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
I don't think you have to get all the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.740 
I don't think you have to get all the
way<00:02:51.069> through<00:02:51.340> maybe<00:02:51.519> maybe<00:02:52.269> half<00:02:52.540> this

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
way through maybe maybe half this

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.209 
way through maybe maybe half this
distance<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:53.409> probably<00:02:53.590> break<00:02:53.980> this

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 
distance and you probably break this

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.220 
distance and you probably break this
after<00:02:54.639> a<00:02:54.669> while<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:55.180> it's<00:02:55.719> something<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.079> has

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
after a while so it's something that has

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.140 
after a while so it's something that has
to<00:02:56.349> be<00:02:56.530> dealt<00:02:56.799> with<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.730> will<00:02:57.939> take<00:02:58.120> it

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
to be dealt with and this will take it

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.610 
to be dealt with and this will take it
for<00:02:58.389> quite<00:02:58.540> some<00:02:58.750> time<00:02:58.959> before<00:02:59.109> I<00:02:59.290> have<00:02:59.500> to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
for quite some time before I have to

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.339 
for quite some time before I have to
redo<00:02:59.949> this<00:03:00.129> so<00:03:00.879> that's<00:03:01.329> today's<00:03:01.780> project

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
redo this so that's today's project

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.980 
redo this so that's today's project
thanks<00:03:02.530> for<00:03:02.650> watching
