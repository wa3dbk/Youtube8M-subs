00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:18.390
 Today I decided to multiply my figs 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.840
 Brown Turks sent me three days ago 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.970
 Here is this seedling Brown Turks sent 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.060
 clementine 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.869
 Klimentiy the role of chukov by the way in the description 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.850
 you can see a link to his site there 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.910
 talks a lot about benders 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.940
 passionflower hvy about other exotic animals so here 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.680
 he sent me this one seedling sapling 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.530
 figs brown turks and with rather long 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.860
 the stem see the lower lower escape here 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.780
 he is as high as the bottom escape 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:59.100
 then escapes the empty stem goes and here 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.170
 just at the top one more. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.680
 one barrel here here is the second kidney 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.140
 blossomed and glass 3 but then I decided 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:15.720
 so from this here's a long sapling 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:19.830
 grow another sapling 2 is running 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.720
 for this above the bottommost escape here 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:29.310
 I made several scratches on the stem 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:33.090
 knife and section on the stem from the container 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.690
 this is a half-liter bottle of drinks 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.150
 cropped on top I do on the stem and 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.670
 covered with nutrient primer 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.980
 why the nourishing ordinary soil from 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.980
 the store he is pretty 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.869
 It was a capacious that is, it keeps moisture well 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.250
 and at the same time allows you to breathe 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.610
 the roots formed which in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.220
 will continue to form on this 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.430
 trunks scratches applied to 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:11.430
 scratches gauss wound tissue is formed 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:15.600
 and then roots will appear by the way all the nuances 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.459
 so to say how to install this 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.350
 container how to make air slips 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.610
 you can see by clicking on the link 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.000
 you see on the top left, you see 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.150
 here I have a little escape 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.739
 here here is another bud blossomed then 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:42.709
 there is here it will be a new new 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:46.350
 the seedling of the bottom will be on its roots 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:51.850
 a new 2 seedling will be on the roots which 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:55.240
 grow from the stem 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.810
 Well, so that he does not have this sapling 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.750
 hung out along with the container as 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.860
 barrel long I've set a couple 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.590
 wooden 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.420
 such here small stands screwed fortified 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.900
 here is the crossbar on which 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.880
 set set container notes 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.730
 I wrapped it with tape then there's this 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.580
 position see that he is no longer afraid 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.020
 no winds no 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:33.670
 so say the cataclysms but also because 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.090
 the roots germinate better in the dark and for 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:42.360
 so that my this container with 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.360
 the soil did not overheat and did not dry up 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:51.700
 I wrap this bottle of this dark 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.390
 wrap under this dark wrap like this 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.970
 not paradoxically my container will 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.350
 overheat the least accurate he 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.120
 will not overheat at all and 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:12.190
 periodically there once every two days i will 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.290
 pour some water in a container so that it is not 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.750
 overdry and from above naturally I 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:23.730
 ground the soil that in this 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:27.030
 the bottle munched just grass and 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:33.009
 so here we are waiting 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.729
 root formation is separated in new 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.800
 will sound 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:42.389
 but educated grown sapling and 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:46.830
 We have been growing for two saplings 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:52.680
 good luck and success 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:05:00.810
 your favorite business is a young bush 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:06.939
 figs brunswick we give fruits visible 1 2 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:10.560
 3 fruit that's pretty much hooked 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.560
 who are they 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.349
 young bush 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:21.400
 but already its fruits we will try in this hell 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:24.580
 and this is an ethical white audrey too young 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.900
 not too with the fruits here but a few here it is 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:34.509
 how many of them there are many possible 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:36.580
 something frayed but something we try 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:43.300
 always from young bushes 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:52.169
 and here adults bushes in the greenhouse so 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:52.169
 it's not bad for the bushes to tell them 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.040
 and here the grapes are first-called
