prepare<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:25.909> every<00:01:26.909> possible<00:01:27.390> instance<00:01:28.049> but

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
prepare for every possible instance but

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.969 
prepare for every possible instance but
what<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.079> expect<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.590> thrown<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.770 
what you can do is expect to be thrown a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
a small part like a co-star scenes that
could<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.180> looked<00:01:42.750> easy<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.040> weren't

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
could have looked easy but they weren't

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.819 
could have looked easy but they weren't
whether<00:01:45.210> you're<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> seasoned<00:01:46.049> professional

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
or brand-new small parts can be really

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
or brand-new small parts can be really
really<00:01:49.979> tricky<00:01:50.549> actually<00:01:50.909> even<00:01:51.390> trickier

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
really tricky actually even trickier

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.389 
really tricky actually even trickier
than<00:01:51.810> big<00:01:52.020> parts<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.979> another<00:01:53.220> video

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
than big parts but that's another video

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.999 
than big parts but that's another video

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
anyway so he had these two scenes there

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.980 
anyway so he had these two scenes there
were<00:01:56.130> tricks<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.700> them<00:01:56.909> we<00:01:57.390> worked<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
were tricks in them we worked out the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.160 
were tricks in them we worked out the
kinks<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.610> he<00:01:59.610> went<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.939> go<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.750> them<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.110> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
kinks and he went to go do them and I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.929 
kinks and he went to go do them and I
you<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> gave<00:02:02.070> him<00:02:02.219> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.579> an<00:02:02.670> idea

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
you know so I gave him kind of an idea

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.770

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
being prepared for something that you're

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.300 
being prepared for something that you're
not<00:02:38.090> expecting<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:39.350> again<00:02:39.620> this<00:02:39.800> doesn't<00:02:40.160> mean

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
not expecting so again this doesn't mean

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.340 
not expecting so again this doesn't mean
preparing<00:02:41.180> your<00:02:41.300> audition<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.810> thousand

preparing your audition a thousand
different<00:02:42.470> ways<00:02:42.769> this<00:02:43.400> means<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.209> a

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
different ways this means this is a

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.130 
different ways this means this is a
mindset<00:02:44.690> thing

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
mindset thing

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.560 
mindset thing
this<00:02:45.380> is<00:02:45.530> having<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.070> expectation<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.060> they

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
this is having the expectation that they

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.449 
this is having the expectation that they
may<00:02:47.810> throw<00:02:48.080> something<00:02:48.530> different<00:02:48.920> at<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.250> and

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
may throw something different at you and

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.780 
may throw something different at you and
instead<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.450> going<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.280> freezing<00:02:52.280> or<00:02:52.459> having

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
instead of going and freezing or having

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.550 
instead of going and freezing or having
it<00:02:52.850> screw<00:02:53.269> up<00:02:53.360> your<00:02:53.480> audition<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:53.989> then<00:02:54.050> you
