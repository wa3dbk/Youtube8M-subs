demon collection and fusion system way

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.040 
demon collection and fusion system way
this<00:00:35.309> works<00:00:35.519> is<00:00:35.640> really<00:00:35.909> simple<00:00:36.149> while<00:00:36.659> you're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
system that's where things get really

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.160 
system that's where things get really
interesting<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.479> basically<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
interesting because basically you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.139 
interesting because basically you
confuse<00:01:04.799> different<00:01:05.309> demons<00:01:05.430> together<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
confuse different demons together to

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.749 
confuse different demons together to
make<00:01:06.270> them<00:01:06.450> more<00:01:06.479> powerful<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:08.250> actually

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
make them more powerful you can actually

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.359 
make them more powerful you can actually
take<00:01:09.210> some<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> their<00:01:09.840> abilities<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.770> use

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
take some of their abilities and use

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.760 
take some of their abilities and use
them<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:12.119> main<00:01:12.390> character<00:01:12.719> it's<00:01:13.289> just

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
them on your main character it's just

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.310 
them on your main character it's just
it's<00:01:13.979> an<00:01:14.130> incredibly<00:01:14.759> deep<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.509> rich<00:01:15.750> system

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it's an incredibly deep and rich system

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.569 
it's an incredibly deep and rich system

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
videos that I've done on the system it's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.420 
videos that I've done on the system it's
really<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.450> interesting<00:01:22.159> next<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.399> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
really really interesting next up is the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.700 
really really interesting next up is the
combat<00:01:23.850> system<00:01:24.030> itself<00:01:24.539> I<00:01:24.780> really<00:01:25.409> enjoyed

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
combat system itself I really enjoyed

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.349 
combat system itself I really enjoyed
this<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.070> possible<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> eight

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
this it's possible to get up to eight

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.929 
this it's possible to get up to eight
attacks<00:01:28.079> per<00:01:28.649> turn<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.609> a<00:01:29.640> turn-based

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
attacks per turn this is a turn-based

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.929 
attacks per turn this is a turn-based
game<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.560> think<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.039> that<00:01:32.219> that<00:01:32.460> makes<00:01:32.820> you

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
game so think of that that makes you

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
game so think of that that makes you
feel<00:01:33.420> pretty<00:01:33.840> damn<00:01:34.109> powerful<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:35.039> way<00:01:35.070> this

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
feel pretty damn powerful the way this

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.099 
feel pretty damn powerful the way this
is<00:01:35.340> done<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.939> basically<00:01:36.119> by<00:01:36.570> exploiting

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
is done is basically by exploiting

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.669 
is done is basically by exploiting
demons<00:01:38.119> weaknesses<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.259> takes<00:01:40.469> a<00:01:40.560> little

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
demons weaknesses so it takes a little

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.380 
demons weaknesses so it takes a little
trial<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.070> error<00:01:41.280> first<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> really<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.149> used

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
trial and error first to really get used

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
trial and error first to really get used
to<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> system<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.409> works<00:01:43.619> exceedingly

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to the system but it works exceedingly

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
to the system but it works exceedingly
well<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.600> level<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.020> system<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.619> equally

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
well the level up system is equally

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.489 
well the level up system is equally
impressive<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.210> gain<00:01:48.479> levels<00:01:48.929> you<00:01:49.200> get

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
impressive as you gain levels you get

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.830 
impressive as you gain levels you get
app<00:01:49.829> points<00:01:50.520> which<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.359> basically<00:01:51.539> use

positives<00:04:00.720> now<00:04:00.810> let's<00:04:01.049> jump<00:04:01.260> into<00:04:01.410> some<00:04:01.650> of

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
positives now let's jump into some of

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.710 
positives now let's jump into some of
the<00:04:01.799> negatives<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.610> story<00:04:02.880> line<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.390> thought

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
the negatives the story line I thought

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.660 
the negatives the story line I thought
started<00:04:04.230> off<00:04:04.380> really<00:04:04.830> strong<00:04:05.130> was<00:04:05.430> really

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
started off really strong was really

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.670 
started off really strong was really
interesting<00:04:06.150> about<00:04:06.269> different<00:04:06.780> classes<00:04:07.380> how

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
interesting about different classes how

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.590 
interesting about different classes how
about<00:04:07.709> like<00:04:08.310> basically<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.850> society<00:04:09.540> is

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
about like basically the society is

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.729 
about like basically the society is
broken<00:04:09.870> down<00:04:09.959> into<00:04:10.019> two<00:04:10.230> different<00:04:10.470> classes

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
broken down into two different classes

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.180 
broken down into two different classes
and<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:12.390> know<00:04:12.570> you<00:04:12.720> don't<00:04:12.930> decide<00:04:13.380> where<00:04:13.890> you

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
and you know you don't decide where you

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.340 
and you know you don't decide where you
end<00:04:14.640> up<00:04:15.269> it's<00:04:15.510> basically<00:04:15.750> you're<00:04:15.900> born<00:04:16.200> into

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
end up it's basically you're born into

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.250 
end up it's basically you're born into
this<00:04:16.620> class<00:04:16.940> but<00:04:17.940> later<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.540> story<00:04:18.810> as<00:04:19.109> it

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
this class but later on the story as it

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.630 
this class but later on the story as it
evolves<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.829> becomes<00:04:20.040> much<00:04:20.250> more<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.579> your

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
evolves it becomes much more of your

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.640 
evolves it becomes much more of your
typical<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.299> either<00:04:21.510> save<00:04:21.840> or<00:04:21.959> destroy<00:04:22.140> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
typical like either save or destroy the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.700 
typical like either save or destroy the
world<00:04:22.860> type<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.460> stuff<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:24.479> said<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:25.080> really

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
world type of stuff that said I really

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.230 
world type of stuff that said I really
enjoyed<00:04:26.130> how<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.370> story<00:04:26.640> gets

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
enjoyed how the story gets

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.570 
enjoyed how the story gets
worker<00:04:27.449> and<00:04:27.599> darker<00:04:27.900> as<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.050> progress<00:04:28.580> the

worker and darker as you progress the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.740 
worker and darker as you progress the
other<00:04:29.729> complaints<00:04:30.210> i<00:04:30.300> have<00:04:30.449> i've<00:04:30.630> already

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
other complaints i have i've already

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.450 
other complaints i have i've already
mentioned<00:04:30.990> before<00:04:31.319> which<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.800> essentially

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
mentioned before which is essentially

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.480 
mentioned before which is essentially
the<00:04:32.610> no<00:04:33.180> map<00:04:33.539> there's<00:04:34.050> no<00:04:34.229> world<00:04:34.500> map<00:04:34.949> there<00:04:35.370> is

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
the no map there's no world map there is

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.969 
the no map there's no world map there is
while<00:04:35.819> you're<00:04:35.849> exploring<00:04:36.660> in<00:04:37.080> third<00:04:37.770> person

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
while you're exploring in third person

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.029 
while you're exploring in third person

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
overworld things sort of take a nosedive

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.339 
overworld things sort of take a nosedive
because<00:04:44.940> it<00:04:45.060> becomes<00:04:45.240> very<00:04:45.389> cumbersome<00:04:46.050> in

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
because it becomes very cumbersome in

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.740 
because it becomes very cumbersome in
order<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.710> find<00:04:46.949> where<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.580> need<00:04:47.789> to<00:04:47.970> go<00:04:48.000> you

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
order to find where you need to go you

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.450 
order to find where you need to go you
might<00:04:48.930> have<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.110> quest<00:04:49.349> that<00:04:49.410> says<00:04:49.680> okay<00:04:50.009> I<00:04:50.039> like

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
might have a quest that says okay I like

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.420 
might have a quest that says okay I like
head<00:04:50.699> to<00:04:50.940> XYZ<00:04:51.599> but<00:04:52.500> they<00:04:52.620> don't<00:04:52.800> tell<00:04:53.039> you<00:04:53.220> that

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
head to XYZ but they don't tell you that

in<00:04:53.580> order<00:04:53.669> to<00:04:53.940> get<00:04:54.210> there<00:04:54.449> you<00:04:54.479> have<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.780> bypass

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
in order to get there you have to bypass

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.010 
in order to get there you have to bypass
two<00:04:55.740> completely<00:04:56.280> different<00:04:56.849> areas<00:04:57.300> a<00:04:57.539> world

two completely different areas a world

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.960 
two completely different areas a world
map<00:04:58.259> would<00:04:58.530> have<00:04:58.650> at<00:04:58.770> least<00:04:58.800> giving<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.669> an

map would have at least giving you an

map would have at least giving you an

idea of okay it's in like the

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.399 
idea of okay it's in like the
northwestern<00:05:02.940> area<00:05:03.300> now<00:05:03.780> sometimes<00:05:04.169> they<00:05:04.349> do

tell you that but not always and when

they don't tell you you can expect to

they don't tell you you can expect to

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
take a good hour to just finding out

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.409 
take a good hour to just finding out
where<00:05:10.889> you<00:05:11.009> got<00:05:11.039> to<00:05:11.190> go<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.669> that<00:05:11.849> that<00:05:12.180> can<00:05:12.330> be

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
where you got to go and that that can be

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.779 
where you got to go and that that can be
a<00:05:12.449> little<00:05:12.599> annoying<00:05:12.870> at<00:05:13.110> times<00:05:13.550> another<00:05:14.550> issue

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
a little annoying at times another issue

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.969 
a little annoying at times another issue
that<00:05:15.150> pops<00:05:15.750> up<00:05:15.990> quite<00:05:16.259> frequently<00:05:16.409> is<00:05:16.830> the

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
that pops up quite frequently is the

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.100 
that pops up quite frequently is the
cumbersome<00:05:17.370> camera<00:05:17.849> system<00:05:18.300> because<00:05:18.960> you're

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
cumbersome camera system because you're

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.140 
cumbersome camera system because you're
constantly<00:05:19.440> in<00:05:19.919> tight<00:05:20.159> corridors<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.940> things

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
constantly in tight corridors and things

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.960 
constantly in tight corridors and things
like<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.360> I<00:05:21.780> found<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.319> very<00:05:23.009> frequently

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
like that I found that very frequently

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.149 
like that I found that very frequently
it's<00:05:24.720> just<00:05:24.960> awkward<00:05:25.380> position<00:05:25.889> the<00:05:26.009> camera

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
it's just awkward position the camera

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.420 
it's just awkward position the camera
where<00:05:26.699> you<00:05:26.970> exactly<00:05:27.690> want<00:05:28.620> it<00:05:28.919> it<00:05:29.250> would<00:05:29.340> have

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
where you exactly want it it would have

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.300 
where you exactly want it it would have
been<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.550> lot<00:05:29.610> easier<00:05:30.229> with<00:05:31.229> a<00:05:31.259> second<00:05:32.099> analog

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
been a lot easier with a second analog

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.740 
been a lot easier with a second analog
stick<00:05:32.669> but<00:05:32.849> that's<00:05:33.030> not<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.270> game's<00:05:33.449> fault

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
stick but that's not the game's fault

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.110 
stick but that's not the game's fault
that's<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.050> limitations<00:05:34.590> of<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.770> 3ds<00:05:35.130> but<00:05:35.969> by

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
that's the limitations of the 3ds but by

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.189 
that's the limitations of the 3ds but by
and<00:05:36.330> far<00:05:36.509> the<00:05:36.900> worst<00:05:37.409> feature<00:05:38.130> of<00:05:38.690> smt<00:05:39.690> for<00:05:39.960> is

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
and far the worst feature of smt for is

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.589 
and far the worst feature of smt for is
the<00:05:40.409> lack<00:05:40.620> of<00:05:40.650> an<00:05:40.889> agro<00:05:41.310> table<00:05:41.820> on<00:05:42.030> enemies

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
the lack of an agro table on enemies

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.020 
the lack of an agro table on enemies
this<00:05:43.139> means<00:05:43.440> that<00:05:43.620> every<00:05:44.219> single<00:05:44.430> enemy<00:05:44.699> in

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
this means that every single enemy in
