okay<00:00:07.170> so<00:00:07.230> here<00:00:07.649> we<00:00:07.770> are<00:00:07.799> in<00:00:07.950> Japan<00:00:08.280> at<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
okay so here we are in Japan at the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.520 
okay so here we are in Japan at the
Nissan's<00:00:09.090> R&amp;D<00:00:09.540> center<00:00:09.900> where<00:00:10.380> we're<00:00:10.469> gonna

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
Nissan's R&amp;D center where we're gonna

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.140 
Nissan's R&amp;D center where we're gonna
have<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.830> first<00:00:10.980> ever<00:00:11.280> drive<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.880> Nissan

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
have the first ever drive of the Nissan

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.829 
have the first ever drive of the Nissan
Leaf<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:13.080> let's<00:00:14.070> let's<00:00:14.580> set<00:00:14.759> off<00:00:14.880> now<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.269> I'll

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
Leaf so let's let's set off now and I'll

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.750 
Leaf so let's let's set off now and I'll
see<00:00:16.049> how<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.230> get<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.340> we're<00:00:17.730> not

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
see how we get on with it so we're not

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.310 
see how we get on with it so we're not
gonna<00:00:17.910> find<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.330> much<00:00:18.539> about<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.930> right<00:00:19.140> or

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
gonna find out much about the right or

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.599 
gonna find out much about the right or
the<00:00:19.380> hiring<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.770> car<00:00:20.039> that's<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.400> certain

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the hiring of the car that's for certain

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.540 
the hiring of the car that's for certain
but<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.359> will<00:00:21.600> discover<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.230> exactly<00:00:23.100> how

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
but what we will discover is exactly how

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.060 
but what we will discover is exactly how
quiet<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.150> car<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.560> about<00:00:25.650> if<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
quiet the car is and it's about if I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.830 
quiet the car is and it's about if I
just<00:00:26.130> go<00:00:26.369> quiet<00:00:26.670> now<00:00:26.939> you'll<00:00:27.300> hear<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.660> set

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
just go quiet now you'll hear you set

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.849 
just go quiet now you'll hear you set
for<00:00:28.019> yourself<00:00:30.289> there's<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.380> slight<00:00:31.650> murmur

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
for yourself there's a slight murmur

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.770 
for yourself there's a slight murmur
from<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.340> electric<00:00:32.700> motor<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.270> accelerate

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
from the electric motor as we accelerate

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.380 
from the electric motor as we accelerate
away<00:00:33.950> but<00:00:34.950> from<00:00:35.309> from<00:00:35.730> my<00:00:35.820> point<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.120> view<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
away but from from my point of view the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
away but from from my point of view the
first<00:00:36.510> thing<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> strikes<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.559> was<00:00:37.890> strong

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
first thing that strikes is I was strong

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.369 
first thing that strikes is I was strong
the<00:00:38.280> car<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.610> under<00:00:38.879> acceleration<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.780> really

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the car is under acceleration a really

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.020 
the car is under acceleration a really
rockets<00:00:40.860> off<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.250> absolutely

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
rockets off with absolutely

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.470 
rockets off with absolutely
there's<00:00:42.360> no<00:00:42.540> gear<00:00:42.809> changes<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.530> worn<00:00:43.829> smooth

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
there's no gear changes just worn smooth

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.229 
there's no gear changes just worn smooth
linear<00:00:45.480> power<00:00:46.200> uptake<00:00:46.739> okay<00:00:47.520> now<00:00:48.090> obviously

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
linear power uptake okay now obviously

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.470 
linear power uptake okay now obviously
the<00:00:49.050> torque<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> delivered<00:00:49.860> immediately

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
the torque is delivered immediately

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.990 
the torque is delivered immediately
instantaneously<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.899> takeoff<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.000> it's

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
instantaneously from takeoff and it's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
instantaneously from takeoff and it's
like<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> hybrid<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.739> instance<00:00:56.039> where<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
like a hybrid for instance where you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.970 
like a hybrid for instance where you
would<00:00:56.550> hear<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.360> sound<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.440> CVT

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
would hear the sound of the CVT

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.310 
would hear the sound of the CVT
transmission<00:00:59.699> wiring<00:01:00.090> way<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> parallel

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
transmission wiring way as the parallel

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.720 
transmission wiring way as the parallel
engine<00:01:01.559> works<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> its<00:01:02.250> merits<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
engine works up to its merits the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.450 
engine works up to its merits the
maximum<00:01:03.149> power<00:01:03.300> delivery<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.890> come<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> our

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
maximum power delivery so we come to our

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.560 
maximum power delivery so we come to our
first<00:01:05.610> corner<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.240> turn<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:09.330> car

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
first corner we turn it in and the car

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.240 
first corner we turn it in and the car
is<00:01:09.689> pretty<00:01:10.110> well<00:01:10.290> balanced<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:10.950> honest

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
is pretty well balanced if I'm honest

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.760 
is pretty well balanced if I'm honest
you<00:01:11.369> know<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:12.150> previous<00:01:12.750> electric<00:01:13.350> cars<00:01:13.530> I've

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you know the previous electric cars I've

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
you know the previous electric cars I've
driven<00:01:13.799> routinely<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.640> they're<00:01:14.790> Tesla<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
driven routinely if they're Tesla and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
driven routinely if they're Tesla and
you<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.409> obviously<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.950> produces<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> lot

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you know obviously that produces a lot

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.789 
you know obviously that produces a lot
more<00:01:17.850> performance<00:01:18.000> than<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.630> car<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.619> it's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
more performance than this car but it's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
more performance than this car but it's
quite<00:01:20.070> crude<00:01:20.369> by<00:01:20.549> comparison<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.330> take<00:01:21.630> up

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
quite crude by comparison this take up

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.990 
quite crude by comparison this take up
it's<00:01:22.200> very<00:01:22.259> sudden<00:01:22.950> when<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.640> come<00:01:23.790> off<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it's very sudden when you come off the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.120 
it's very sudden when you come off the
accelerator<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.990> massive<00:01:25.439> braking

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
accelerator you get this massive braking

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
accelerator you get this massive braking
effect<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> motor<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.750> there's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
effect from the motor with this there's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.289 
effect from the motor with this there's
none<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.490> select<00:01:29.850> Eva

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
none of that you can actually select Eva

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.120 
none of that you can actually select Eva
mode<00:01:30.509> which<00:01:30.780> which<00:01:31.110> he<00:01:31.290> gives<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> even<00:01:31.950> more

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
mode which which he gives you even more

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.880 
mode which which he gives you even more
braking<00:01:32.820> effect<00:01:33.060> okay

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
braking effect okay

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.980 
braking effect okay
and<00:01:33.979> there's<00:01:34.550> less<00:01:34.760> of<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.970> throttle<00:01:35.360> reaction

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
and there's less of a throttle reaction

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.219 
and there's less of a throttle reaction
when<00:01:36.140> we<00:01:36.170> can<00:01:36.470> put<00:01:36.620> down<00:01:36.860> but<00:01:37.700> in<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.940> main

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
when we can put down but in the main

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.830 
when we can put down but in the main
yeah<00:01:39.290> or<00:01:39.440> when<00:01:39.710> overall<00:01:40.479> massively<00:01:41.479> massively

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
yeah or when overall massively massively

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.560 
yeah or when overall massively massively
impressive<00:01:42.590> prepared<00:01:43.190> them<00:01:43.430> we<00:01:44.270> just<00:01:44.390> slow

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
impressive prepared them we just slow

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.940 
impressive prepared them we just slow
down<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.810> bit<00:01:44.990> as<00:01:45.080> we<00:01:45.170> coming<00:01:45.409> into<00:01:45.560> this<00:01:45.650> corner

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
down a bit as we coming into this corner

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.100 
down a bit as we coming into this corner
turn<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.610> in

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
turn it in

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.160 
turn it in
this<00:01:48.110> cars<00:01:48.380> 10:05<00:01:49.000> for<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.030> worldwide<00:01:50.570> use<00:01:50.869> so
