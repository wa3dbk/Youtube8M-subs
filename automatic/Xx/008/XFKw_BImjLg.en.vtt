on<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.850> experience<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
on and so just from that experience I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.630 
on and so just from that experience I
started<00:02:06.929> thinking<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.530> know<00:02:07.859> that's<00:02:08.100> crazy

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
started thinking you know that's crazy

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.230 
started thinking you know that's crazy
how

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
how

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.180 
how
I<00:02:10.330> can<00:02:10.660> accomplish<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.260> or<00:02:11.590> achieve<00:02:11.920> that

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
I can accomplish that or achieve that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.920 
I can accomplish that or achieve that
and<00:02:12.460> then<00:02:12.940> right<00:02:13.180> away<00:02:13.300> it's<00:02:13.660> going<00:02:13.750> to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
and then right away it's going to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.050 
and then right away it's going to
inspire<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.410> motivate<00:02:14.680> other<00:02:15.310> people<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:16.030> I

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
inspire and motivate other people and I

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.150 
inspire and motivate other people and I
thought<00:02:16.420> how<00:02:16.630> can<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.050> be<00:02:17.110> applied<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.950> drum

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
thought how can this be applied to drum

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.930 
thought how can this be applied to drum
it<00:02:18.310> how<00:02:18.730> can<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.560> apply<00:02:20.560> social<00:02:21.400> achievement

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
it how can we apply social achievement

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.520 
it how can we apply social achievement
to<00:02:22.060> drum<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.360> because<00:02:22.690> when<00:02:23.170> we<00:02:23.260> have<00:02:23.500> that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
to drum it because when we have that

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.010 
to drum it because when we have that
when<00:02:24.310> we<00:02:24.400> achieve<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.090> should<00:02:25.330> say<00:02:25.480> that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
when we achieve I should say that

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.350 
when we achieve I should say that
becomes<00:02:26.380> very<00:02:26.740> very<00:02:26.860> contagious<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.000> your

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
becomes very very contagious and your

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.690 
becomes very very contagious and your
achievements<00:02:28.930> are<00:02:29.050> gonna<00:02:29.860> motivate<00:02:30.310> and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
achievements are gonna motivate and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.490 
achievements are gonna motivate and
inspire<00:02:30.790> other<00:02:31.300> people<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.750> want<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.350> do

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
inspire other people to want to do

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.920 
inspire other people to want to do
better<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.980> become<00:02:33.610> better<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.900> I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
better and become better and so I

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.830 
better and become better and so I
thought<00:02:35.140> let's<00:02:35.560> apply<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.180> drum<00:02:37.540> set

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
thought let's apply this to the drum set

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.020 
thought let's apply this to the drum set
and<00:02:38.080> what<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.040> guys<00:02:39.220> heard<00:02:39.430> me<00:02:39.550> playing<00:02:39.790> there

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
and what you guys heard me playing there

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.330 
and what you guys heard me playing there
in<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> intro<00:02:40.510> was<00:02:41.160> extremely<00:02:42.160> difficult

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
in the intro was extremely difficult

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.250 
in the intro was extremely difficult
pattern<00:02:42.880> something<00:02:43.210> that<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.930> get<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.170> that

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
pattern something that to get to that

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.480 
pattern something that to get to that
point<00:02:44.470> took<00:02:44.680> me<00:02:44.800> hours<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.160> hours<00:02:45.340> of

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
point took me hours and hours of

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.080 
point took me hours and hours of
practice<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.950> basically<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.640> single

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
practice and it's basically a single

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.520 
practice and it's basically a single
paradiddle<00:02:49.360> with<00:02:49.630> my<00:02:49.750> left<00:02:49.960> foot<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.410> then

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
paradiddle with my left foot and then

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.710 
paradiddle with my left foot and then
other<00:02:50.770> stuff<00:02:50.860> over<00:02:51.400> top<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.210> was<00:02:52.390> like

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
other stuff over top and that was like

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.480 
other stuff over top and that was like
is<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:52.870> an<00:02:53.080> extremely<00:02:53.290> difficult<00:02:53.890> pattern

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
is that an extremely difficult pattern

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.880 
is that an extremely difficult pattern
to<00:02:54.610> learn<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.630> feel<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:55.990> I've<00:02:56.230> achieved

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
to learn and I feel like I've achieved

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.040 
to learn and I feel like I've achieved
that<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.460> certain<00:02:57.820> level<00:02:58.060> but<00:02:58.660> what<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:58.840> want

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
that to a certain level but what I want

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.420 
that to a certain level but what I want
to<00:02:59.200> do<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.790> want<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:01.180> challenge<00:03:01.570> myself

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
to do is I want to challenge myself

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.640 
to do is I want to challenge myself
publicly<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.640> socially<00:03:04.570> through<00:03:05.320> you<00:03:05.440> guys

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
publicly and socially through you guys

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.800 
publicly and socially through you guys
and<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.130> want<00:03:06.490> to<00:03:06.550> learn<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.880> new<00:03:07.120> pattern

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
and I want to learn this new pattern

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.020 
and I want to learn this new pattern
which<00:03:08.020> kind<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.470> builds<00:03:09.220> off<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:09.880> it's

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
which kind of builds off of this so it's

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.280 
which kind of builds off of this so it's
going<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.210> be<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.420> single<00:03:10.660> paradiddle<00:03:11.020> with

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
going to be the single paradiddle with

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.500 
going to be the single paradiddle with
the<00:03:11.410> left<00:03:11.620> foot<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.010> then<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.490> double<00:03:12.850> between

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
the left foot and then a double between

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.330 
the left foot and then a double between
the<00:03:13.600> left<00:03:13.780> foot<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.200> left<00:03:14.230> hand<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.890> then

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the left foot in the left hand and then

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.980 
the left foot in the left hand and then
a<00:03:15.520> double<00:03:15.940> paradiddle<00:03:16.210> between<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.780> right

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
a double paradiddle between the right

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.510 
a double paradiddle between the right
foot<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.740> right<00:03:17.800> hand<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.340> that's

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
foot and the right hand and that's

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.370 
foot and the right hand and that's
actually<00:03:18.700> like<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.090> virgil<00:03:19.480> donati<00:03:19.510> exercise
