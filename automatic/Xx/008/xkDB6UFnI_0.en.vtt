Alzheimer's Center basically where Steve

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.580 
Alzheimer's Center basically where Steve
started<00:00:20.340> out<00:00:20.460> getting<00:00:20.910> his<00:00:21.570> diagnosis<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
started out getting his diagnosis and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.240 
started out getting his diagnosis and
where<00:00:22.769> he<00:00:22.980> tested<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.490> clinical<00:00:23.880> trials<00:00:24.269> and

they've embraced this whole concept of
looking<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:29.789> conditions<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.480> might<00:00:30.570> be

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
looking at conditions that might be

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.229 
looking at conditions that might be
treatable<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.140> ketones<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.239> Alzheimer's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
treatable with ketones and Alzheimer's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.139 
treatable with ketones and Alzheimer's
is<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.719> them<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.280> about<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
is one of them so they are about to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.630 
is one of them so they are about to
embark<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> study<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.559> coconut<00:00:38.070> oil<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
embark on a study of coconut oil and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.770 
embark on a study of coconut oil and
people<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.180> mild<00:00:39.450> cognitive

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
people that have mild cognitive

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.260 
people that have mild cognitive
impairment<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:41.160> these<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.550> people<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> can

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
impairment and these are people that can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.840 
impairment and these are people that can
progress<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.809> Alzheimer's<00:00:43.320> disease<00:00:43.850> they're

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
progress the Alzheimer's disease they're

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.250 
progress the Alzheimer's disease they're
gonna<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> pilot<00:00:45.570> study<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.899> think<00:00:45.930> it's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
gonna do a pilot study I think it's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020 
gonna do a pilot study I think it's
they're<00:00:46.710> playing<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.070> least<00:00:47.190> 50<00:00:47.579> people<00:00:47.730> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
they're playing at least 50 people in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
they're playing at least 50 people in
the<00:00:48.149> study<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.750> they're<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.980> look<00:00:50.129> at

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the study and they're going to look at

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
the study and they're going to look at
number<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.780> their<00:00:51.930> symptomatic

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
number one is their symptomatic

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.279 
number one is their symptomatic
improvement<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.280> secondly<00:00:54.270> well<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
improvement and secondly well can it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.660 
improvement and secondly well can it
prevent<00:00:55.770> progression<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.460> Alzheimer's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
prevent progression to Alzheimer's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.290 
prevent progression to Alzheimer's
disease<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.340> this<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> study<00:00:59.789> look<00:01:00.090> its

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
disease so this is a study look its

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.260 
disease so this is a study look its
primary<00:01:00.780> aimed<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.230> prevention<00:01:02.160> right<00:01:02.730> now<00:01:02.910> so

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
primary aimed at prevention right now so

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.880 
primary aimed at prevention right now so
that's<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.350> start

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that's a start

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
that's a start
I'm<00:01:05.309> aware<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.790> couple<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.270> others<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.930> think

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
I'm aware of a couple of others I think

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
up in Maryland there's a group that is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.130 
up in Maryland there's a group that is
playing<00:01:11.100> planning<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.090> study<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.990> know

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
playing planning a study I don't know

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.510 
playing planning a study I don't know
when<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.409> how<00:01:13.799> exactly<00:01:14.040> they're<00:01:14.490> going

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
when or how exactly they're going

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.249 
when or how exactly they're going
forward<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.270> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
forward with it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.770 
forward with it
the<00:01:16.710> exone<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> medical<00:01:17.759> food<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the exone of the medical food which is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.780 
the exone of the medical food which is
basically<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> active<00:01:20.189> ingredient<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
basically the active ingredient is a

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.929 
basically the active ingredient is a
medium<00:01:21.330> chain<00:01:21.509> triglyceride<00:01:22.170> oil<00:01:22.820> they<00:01:23.820> have

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
medium chain triglyceride oil they have

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.940 
medium chain triglyceride oil they have
larger<00:01:24.299> studies<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:25.140> larger<00:01:25.470> studies<00:01:25.770> going

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
larger studies to larger studies going

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.179 
larger studies to larger studies going
on<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.369> now<00:01:26.659> one<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.689> them<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.110> chart<00:01:28.799> review

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
on right now one of them is chart review

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
on right now one of them is chart review
that's<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.970> multicenter<00:01:30.509> study<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.079> they're

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that's a multicenter study and they're

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.870 
that's a multicenter study and they're
looking<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:31.680> patients<00:01:32.250> who<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.430> been<00:01:32.579> taking

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
looking at patients who have been taking

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.840 
looking at patients who have been taking
acts<00:01:33.060> ona<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.829> how<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.369> their<00:01:35.490> outcome

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
acts ona to see how what their outcome

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.319 
acts ona to see how what their outcome
is<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:37.100> think<00:01:38.100> compared<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.549> people<00:01:38.700> who<00:01:38.970> have

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
is I think compared to people who have

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.569 
is I think compared to people who have
not<00:01:39.509> been<00:01:39.540> taking<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> yeah<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.549> I

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
not been taking it yeah so you know I

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.490 
not been taking it yeah so you know I
think<00:01:41.700> we're<00:01:41.970> about<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.570> some<00:01:43.380> more

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
think we're about to get some more

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
think we're about to get some more
information<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.280> these<00:01:44.549> studies<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:44.939> take

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
information but these studies will take

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.350 
information but these studies will take
a<00:01:45.119> couple<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.600> years<00:01:45.840> again<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:47.340> my<00:01:48.149> own

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
a couple of years again so my own

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.770 
a couple of years again so my own
feeling<00:01:48.390> about<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:50.119> well<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.570> people

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
feeling about it is well you know people

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
feeling about it is well you know people
should<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.380> wait<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.040> coconut
