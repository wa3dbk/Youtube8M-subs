in<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.410> lesson<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.949> will<00:00:02.100> talk<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.340> little<00:00:02.639> bit

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
in this lesson I will talk a little bit

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.120 
in this lesson I will talk a little bit
about<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.389> mammillary<00:00:03.750> body<00:00:04.170> about<00:00:04.950> the

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
about the mammillary body about the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.340 
about the mammillary body about the
fornix<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:05.940> corpus<00:00:06.330> callosum<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.080> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
fornix and the corpus callosum and the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.950 
fornix and the corpus callosum and the
lateral<00:00:07.740> ventricle<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:09.210> mammillary<00:00:09.599> body

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
lateral ventricle the mammillary body

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.879 
lateral ventricle the mammillary body
are<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.500> small<00:00:11.150> round<00:00:12.150> bodies<00:00:12.809> they<00:00:13.469> are<00:00:13.590> part

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
are the small round bodies they are part

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.160 
are the small round bodies they are part
of<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.280> diencephalon<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.150> they<00:00:15.420> formed<00:00:15.839> part

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
of the diencephalon and they formed part

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.120 
of the diencephalon and they formed part
of<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.500> MOOC<00:00:16.680> system<00:00:18.560> then<00:00:19.560> comes<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> fornix

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
of the MOOC system then comes the fornix

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.720 
of the MOOC system then comes the fornix
fornix<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.369> c-shape<00:00:24.150> bundle<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.930> fibres

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
fornix is a c-shape bundle of fibres

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.290 
fornix is a c-shape bundle of fibres
this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> anterior<00:00:27.480> pillar<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.260> fornix

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
this is the anterior pillar of fornix

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.880 
this is the anterior pillar of fornix
these<00:00:30.300> over<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.630> were<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.349> mammillary

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
these over here were the mammillary

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.100 
these over here were the mammillary
bodies<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.640> then<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.329> next<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.200> next<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
bodies and then for next one for next to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.280 
bodies and then for next one for next to
the<00:00:37.110> part<00:00:37.380> very<00:00:37.620> fornix<00:00:38.219> joined<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.989> over

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the part very fornix joined and over

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.810 
the part very fornix joined and over
here<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.829> called<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.460> body<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.879> fornix<00:00:43.820> then

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
here is called the body of fornix then

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.450 
here is called the body of fornix then
comes<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.270> cross<00:00:45.510> fornix<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.820> fembra<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
comes the cross fornix and the fembra a

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.770 
comes the cross fornix and the fembra a
so<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.670> was<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> cross<00:00:51.980> this<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> ferry

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
so this was the cross this was the ferry

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.420 
so this was the cross this was the ferry
now<00:00:54.780> think<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:55.829> goes<00:00:56.129> all<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
now think about it it all goes all the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.209 
now think about it it all goes all the
way<00:00:56.520> around<00:00:57.140> we<00:00:58.140> said<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> fornix<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
way around we said at the fornix is a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.000 
way around we said at the fornix is a
bundle<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.789> nerve<00:01:00.000> fibers<00:01:00.239> fibers<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.800> this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
bundle of nerve fibers fibers go in this

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.539 
bundle of nerve fibers fibers go in this
direction<00:01:02.359> they<00:01:03.359> transfer<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.140> information

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
direction they transfer the information

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.800 
direction they transfer the information
from<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> hippocampus<00:01:07.040> over<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.810> towards

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
from the hippocampus over here towards

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
from the hippocampus over here towards
the<00:01:09.990> hypothalamus<00:01:10.830> through<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> mammillary

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the hypothalamus through the mammillary

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.800 
the hypothalamus through the mammillary
bodies<00:01:12.240> over<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> takes<00:01:15.150> information

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
bodies over here so takes information

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.280 
bodies over here so takes information
from<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> hippocampus<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.780> they<00:01:18.780> suit<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
from the hippocampus and they suit to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.249 
from the hippocampus and they suit to
the<00:01:20.090> mammillary<00:01:21.090> bodies<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the mammillary bodies and then to the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.820 
the mammillary bodies and then to the
hypothalamus<00:01:23.450> actually<00:01:24.450> many

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830

a part of hypothalamus same on the other
side<00:01:30.200> then<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> Illustrated<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.979> corpus

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
side then I Illustrated a corpus

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.120 
side then I Illustrated a corpus
callosum<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.990> biggest<00:01:34.380> common<00:01:34.799> sure<00:01:34.920> in

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
callosum is the biggest common sure in

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.969 
callosum is the biggest common sure in
our<00:01:35.250> brain<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.630> common<00:01:36.960> sure<00:01:37.110> connects<00:01:37.650> two

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
our brain the common sure connects two

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.280 
our brain the common sure connects two
sides<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> brain<00:01:38.909> two<00:01:39.390> hemispheres<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
sides of the brain two hemispheres and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.819 
sides of the brain two hemispheres and
here<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> sagittal<00:01:41.610> slice<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.619> made<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
here is the sagittal slice so we made a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.690 
here is the sagittal slice so we made a
cut<00:01:44.100> here

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.760 

here<00:01:48.700> is<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.970> anterior<00:01:49.390> commissure<00:01:49.870> it<00:01:50.620> also

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
here is the anterior commissure it also

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.670 
here is the anterior commissure it also
connects<00:01:51.690> certain<00:01:52.690> parts<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.290> two

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
connects certain parts of two

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.980 
connects certain parts of two
hemispheres<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.910> divided<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.450> more<00:01:55.630> parts

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
hemispheres it is divided in more parts

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.220 
hemispheres it is divided in more parts
I<00:01:56.110> will<00:01:56.260> talk<00:01:56.410> about<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.860> in<00:01:56.980> other<00:01:57.340> videos<00:01:57.520> and

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
I will talk about it in other videos and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.370 
I will talk about it in other videos and
here<00:01:59.230> is<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.620> septum<00:02:00.070> pellucidum<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.900> septum

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
here is the septum pellucidum the septum

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.170 
here is the septum pellucidum the septum
pellucidum<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.460> membrane<00:02:03.850> that

that there is a fissure like this and

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.650 
that there is a fissure like this and
then<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.500> simply<00:03:23.709> makes<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.310> eminence<00:03:24.790> inside

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
then it simply makes the eminence inside

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.630 
then it simply makes the eminence inside

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
the bulb of posterior horn then we had

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.800 
the bulb of posterior horn then we had
the<00:05:37.950> cingulate<00:05:38.490> selfish<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:40.470> we<00:05:41.340> had<00:05:41.810> the

cingulate gyrus this part of here was

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.870 
cingulate gyrus this part of here was
genuine<00:05:49.080> of<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:50.010> corpus<00:05:50.370> callosum<00:05:50.969> which

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
genuine of the corpus callosum which

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.600 
genuine of the corpus callosum which
means<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:54.180> knee

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
means the knee

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.350 
means the knee
it's<00:05:56.749> the<00:05:57.749> most<00:05:57.930> anterior<00:05:58.379> part<00:05:59.060> this<00:06:00.060> part

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
it's the most anterior part this part

it's the most anterior part this part
over<00:06:00.509> here<00:06:01.430> was<00:06:02.539> rostrum<00:06:04.669> this<00:06:05.669> was<00:06:05.969> the<00:06:06.719> body

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
over here was rostrum this was the body

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.640 
over here was rostrum this was the body
