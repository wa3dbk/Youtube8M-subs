00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.920
 to 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.580
 the rust is a somewhat program 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.830
 peculiar where the laws of 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.050
 space-time are suspended 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.750
 temporarily during the time that 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.340
 We dedicate to use the test program 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.590
 of it is the fact that I'm going to record 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.100
 a video about a subject so allegedly 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.039
 simple as how to select or 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.080
 to select images ie 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.720
 choose what images we want to see 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.760
 affected by a series of operations 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.710
 what we do with the interface and the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.809
 way to stop them from being 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.640
 selected starting at the most 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.170
 basic and using the view of 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.360
 grid that I have now here in the 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.129
 library module I can click on 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.600
 any element so that this 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.280
 element is selected and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.710
 obviously the this election that I 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.080
 perform in the grid area as in 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.089
 the strip of images is synchronized is 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.850
 say what I select here too 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.290
 is selected here above can 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.940
 it is a bit absurd that this is 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.010
 duplicated but you have to take into account 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.200
 that there is another mode that is the magnifying glass mode 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.240
 what can I activate by clicking here or 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.740
 pressing the e key on which I lose 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.420
 this possibility to select 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.030
 contents 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.020
 from the grid view I had 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.509
 here a moment ago and I'm going to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.630
 recover by pressing the g key doing 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.520
 Click on this icon or double click 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.590
 of the image in the magnifying glass module 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.509
 up to here everything normal I can also 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.820
 use the keyboard modifiers 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.670
 control or command in mac and upper case 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.399
 to select continuous elements or 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.080
 discontinuous is to say if I want 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.330
 select this photograph and also 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.220
 he's here and he's here at the same time 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.460
 I have to hold the key down 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.020
 control or command while I click and 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.789
 in this way I can select 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.690
 discontinuous elements elements that do not 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.399
 are touching one with another perfect if 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.619
 I would like to select contiguous elements 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.350
 elements that are online en bloc 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.840
 I click on the first one and now I do 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.399
 uppercase click on the last one I am 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.380
 doing in the image strip but 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.400
 could do it equally in the view of 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.830
 Grid 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.640
 arrived at this point if I wanted 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.200
 Cancel this selection of images 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.210
 I would surely click instinctively 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.970
 in any other image for example 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.000
 is here and yet I see that no 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.190
 I lose the selection is a selection that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.580
 it stays if I click outside of the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.320
 selection yes I get to cancel the but 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.380
 it may seem a bit strange I'm going to 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.240
 re-selecting a group can 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.700
 it's a bit strange that they are all 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.860
 selected and that the fact of doing 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.990
 click on a photograph the only thing you do 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.790
 be that the frame of the photo is more 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.170
 clear that the rest is good that's 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.060
 because the lightroom we found a 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.890
 concept that is not totally new either 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.110
 but you do not see it very often that is the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.570
 most selected photo concept 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.920
 it is no longer enough to be selected photos 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.050
 now to get to the top 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.209
 Olympus of the selected photos there 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.190
 what to do the most selected photo what 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.290
 meaning has this in the sense that 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.820
 has fundamentally is that if 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.550
 We want to perform some operation of 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.020
 synchronization of both metadata and 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.580
 of development settings 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.170
 there must be a reference photo 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.510
 to determine what it is that 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.760
 synchronizes what is copied to the rest of 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.260
 photographs and for this it is necessary that 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.030
 a photograph is the photograph of 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.459
 reference the photograph more 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.140
 selected to put an example I come 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.830
 to reveal module 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.020
 and if I select sync here I 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.390
 determines what parameters are going to 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.310
 equalize to synchronize between all 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.500
 photos and then we would ask 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.350
 good what is the photo that is going to 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.450
 determine the origin of these settings 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.700
 obviously, as I just said 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.590
 will be the most selected photograph the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.660
 that has the edge more clearly good 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.780
 said this below we can 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.970
 ask is there any way that if 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.920
 I now want to select for example 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.600
 this photograph of lampposts a 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.430
 magnificent photography indeed indeed 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.440
 I'm going to put five stars because 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.870
 it deserves good if this photograph that 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.790
 should go to the annals of the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.640
 story I want it to be the only 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.560
 selected photograph would oblige me 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.360
 apparently clicking out of the 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.370
 selection and then again click on the 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.470
 image to select the one 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.880
 fortunately there is a little trick that 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.500
 the truth is that it is very useful since 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.840
 we spent the day selecting and 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.430
 selecting images that consists of 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.910
 click on the image but not on the 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.139
 image directly but in this framework 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.080
 white surrounding the image 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.909
 if I click on this area 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.639
 automatically select the 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:38.249
 others and will be selected only 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.080
 this is another way to get the 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:43.020
 same effect that is to press 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.689
 control or command of mac with what 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.520
 I get forgiveness in this case is canceled 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.400
 the whole selection if you wanted to keep 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.159
 only this photograph is control 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.840
 capitals of if I'm not wrong if I 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.909
 I was saying backwards sorry with 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.289
 control of we fully load the 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.990
 selection here there is no picture 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.939
 selected and with uppercase control of 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.710
 we are only with the photograph 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.029
 that currently was the most 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.669
 selected but I think that the most 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:10.710
 easy is to simply click on the 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.479
 outline of the photograph and good for 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.039
 explain something so simple something that 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.689
 theoretically it should be of sense 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.539
 common but I think it is not 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.889
 all I take the nothing despicable figure of 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.110
 five minutes so I'm going to finish 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.270
 here although there will be a small video of 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.840
 continued explaining more phenomena 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.449
 paranormals that take place 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.560
 the fearsome library module thank you for 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.560
 follow this and see you soon
