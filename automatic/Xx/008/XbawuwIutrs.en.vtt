coming<00:01:13.020> out<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.770> his<00:01:13.890> time

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
coming out of this one and so his time

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.250 
coming out of this one and so his time
is<00:01:14.310> limited<00:01:14.420> we're<00:01:15.420> thinking<00:01:15.780> maybe<00:01:15.900> heard<00:01:16.170> of
