00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
I realized that the Christmas nativity

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.170 
I realized that the Christmas nativity
story<00:03:22.959> uncut<00:03:23.819> wasn't<00:03:24.930> probably<00:03:25.930> not<00:03:26.140> made<00:03:26.500> for

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
story uncut wasn't probably not made for

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.339 
story uncut wasn't probably not made for
Christians<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.299> sit<00:03:28.659> and<00:03:28.780> watch<00:03:29.049> and

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
Christians to sit and watch and

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.099 
Christians to sit and watch and
chocolate<00:03:29.980> because<00:03:30.250> it's<00:03:30.609> not<00:03:31.540> funny<00:03:31.870> does

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
chocolate because it's not funny does

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.690 
chocolate because it's not funny does
right

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.180 

maybe<00:03:37.300> you<00:03:37.510> should<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:38.770> only<00:03:38.920> thing<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.129> can
