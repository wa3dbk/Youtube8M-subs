I mean it's epidemic how bad the problem

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.670 
I mean it's epidemic how bad the problem

crazy<00:00:26.939> radio<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.930> don't<00:00:28.080> really

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
crazy radio because you don't really

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
crazy radio because you don't really
want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> spend<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.830> money<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.519> wanted

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
want to spend the money on it I wanted

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.310 
want to spend the money on it I wanted
to<00:00:30.449> show<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.250> replace<00:00:32.250> these<00:00:32.579> bulbs

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
to show you how to replace these bulbs

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.889 
to show you how to replace these bulbs
and<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.130> complicated<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.270> task<00:00:36.540> as

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and it's not as complicated a task as

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.260 
and it's not as complicated a task as
some<00:00:37.200> people<00:00:37.530> would<00:00:37.649> think<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.950> would<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.270> so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
some people would think it would be so

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510 
some people would think it would be so
first<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.110> first<00:00:40.290> step<00:00:40.620> obviously<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.399> get

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
first the first step obviously is to get

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.560 
first the first step obviously is to get
the<00:00:41.640> faceplate<00:00:42.210> separated<00:00:42.930> from<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:44.100> radio

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
the faceplate separated from the radio

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
the faceplate separated from the radio
now<00:00:45.570> I've<00:00:45.719> already<00:00:46.020> taken<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.680> off<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
now I've already taken this one off and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.549 
now I've already taken this one off and
you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.370> kind<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> see<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.059> tabs<00:00:48.329> around<00:00:49.200> if

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
you can kind of see the tabs around if

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.920 
you can kind of see the tabs around if
you<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.829> take<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.250> screwdriver<00:00:50.660> that<00:00:51.660> looks

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you just take a screwdriver that looks

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
you just take a screwdriver that looks
somewhat<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.789> flat-head

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
somewhat of this you know flat-head

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
somewhat of this you know flat-head
screwdriver<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.260> shimmy<00:00:55.530> these<00:00:55.800> up

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
screwdriver you can just shimmy these up

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.410 
screwdriver you can just shimmy these up
and<00:00:56.510> they'll<00:00:57.510> work<00:00:57.719> fine<00:00:58.940> when<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.270> this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and they'll work fine when you get this

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.349 
and they'll work fine when you get this
open<00:01:01.640> you're<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> notice<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
open you're going to notice that it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
open you're going to notice that it
doesn't<00:01:03.660> come<00:01:03.809> off<00:01:03.840> very<00:01:04.350> easy<00:01:04.680> that's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
doesn't come off very easy that's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.630 
doesn't come off very easy that's
because<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.700> attached<00:01:06.150> by<00:01:06.740> two<00:01:07.740> sets<00:01:08.340> of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
because it's attached by two sets of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
because it's attached by two sets of
cables<00:01:09.540> which<00:01:10.140> I've<00:01:10.530> removed<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.310> already

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
cables which I've removed here already

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.950 
cables which I've removed here already
but<00:01:12.570> they<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.860> attached<00:01:14.549> inside<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.750> see

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
but they are attached inside you can see

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.940 
but they are attached inside you can see
the<00:01:20.299> one<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:21.509> second<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.770> where

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the one one second you can see where

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.760 
the one one second you can see where
they<00:01:23.070> connect<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:24.450> important<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.380> pry

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
they connect it's important that you pry

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.390 
they connect it's important that you pry
these<00:01:26.100> free<00:01:26.810> from<00:01:27.810> side<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.170> side<00:01:28.400> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
these free from side to side and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.969 
these free from side to side and
carefully<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:31.020> remember<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:31.740> come

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
carefully and remember that they come

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.210 
carefully and remember that they come
off<00:01:32.130> from<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> inside<00:01:33.049> not<00:01:34.049> from<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.950> panel

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
off from the inside not from this panel

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.340 
off from the inside not from this panel
those<00:01:36.060> are<00:01:36.540> soldered<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:38.240> now<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.810> next<00:01:40.140> step

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
those are soldered on now the next step

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.160 
those are soldered on now the next step
is<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.490> remove<00:01:41.610> each<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.689> these<00:01:43.189> smaller<00:01:45.170> bolts

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
is to remove each of these smaller bolts

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.719 
is to remove each of these smaller bolts
they're<00:01:46.770> literally<00:01:47.250> bolts<00:01:48.560> from<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.490> back

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
they're literally bolts from the back

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.280 
they're literally bolts from the back
panel<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.689> separate<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.259> from

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
panel here so you can separate it from

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.209 
panel here so you can separate it from
the<00:01:52.500> faceplate<00:01:53.210> now<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.509> don't<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.649> this

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the faceplate now I don't have this

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.730 
the faceplate now I don't have this
tight<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.850> size<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> if

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
tight of this size so you can do it if

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.120 
tight of this size so you can do it if
you're<00:01:58.829> careful<00:01:59.210> with<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> pair<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> pliers

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
you're careful with a pair of pliers

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.889 
you're careful with a pair of pliers
just<00:02:02.130> say<00:02:03.500> once<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.159> off<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
just say once you get this off and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.600 
just say once you get this off and
before<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.110> start<00:02:07.170> disassembling<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
before you start disassembling the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.040 
before you start disassembling the
faceplate<00:02:09.119> take<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> picture<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.959> this

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
faceplate take a picture of this

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.309 
faceplate take a picture of this
faceplate<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:11.209> took<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.540> two<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.870> these<00:02:13.020> so

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
faceplate I took I have two of these so

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.900 
faceplate I took I have two of these so
I<00:02:13.349> was<00:02:13.530> lucky

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
I was lucky

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.150 
I was lucky
I<00:02:15.080> went<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> goodwill<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.590> that's<00:02:16.890> kind

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
I went to the goodwill and that's kind

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
I'll post pictures these tabs right here

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.259 
I'll post pictures these tabs right here
all<00:03:13.110> needed<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.799> be<00:03:13.860> straightened<00:03:14.190> out<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:17.269> I

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
all needed to be straightened out and I

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.750 
all needed to be straightened out and I
just<00:03:18.600> want<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.140> rest<00:03:19.410> assure<00:03:19.799> if<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.280> push<00:03:20.549> on

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
just want to rest assure if you push on

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.130 
just want to rest assure if you push on
it<00:03:20.790> you'll<00:03:21.180> get<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.390> little<00:03:21.630> bit<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.810> resistance

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
it you'll get a little bit of resistance

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.840 
it you'll get a little bit of resistance
but<00:03:22.590> it's<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:22.980> because<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.370> tabs<00:03:23.640> aren't

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
but it's just because this tabs aren't

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.120 
but it's just because this tabs aren't
coming<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.180> clean<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> one<00:03:25.859> from

the<00:03:53.880> bulbs<00:03:54.269> here<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.690> found<00:03:55.350> out<00:03:55.620> these<00:03:55.799> are<00:03:55.950> not

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
the bulbs here I found out these are not

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.670 
the bulbs here I found out these are not
LED<00:03:56.730> bulbs<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.810> was<00:03:58.019> actually<00:03:58.440> kind<00:03:58.650> of

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
LED bulbs it was actually kind of

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.400 
LED bulbs it was actually kind of
interesting<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.970> see<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.299> these<00:04:00.840> are<00:04:00.900> in

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
interesting to see that these are in

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.430 
interesting to see that these are in
fact<00:04:01.640> Krypton<00:04:02.640> bulbs<00:04:05.750> they<00:04:06.750> were<00:04:06.810> attached<00:04:07.170> to

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
fact Krypton bulbs they were attached to

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.430 
fact Krypton bulbs they were attached to
the<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:08.340> circuit<00:04:08.730> board<00:04:08.970> right<00:04:09.840> here<00:04:09.870> in

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
the the circuit board right here in

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.199 
the the circuit board right here in
these<00:04:10.560> three<00:04:10.620> places<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.519> if<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:11.700> flip<00:04:12.000> this

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
these three places and if you flip this

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.590 
these three places and if you flip this
around<00:04:12.769> you'll<00:04:13.769> be<00:04:13.859> able<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:15.329> line

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
around you'll be able to and just line

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.750 
around you'll be able to and just line
it<00:04:15.630> up<00:04:15.900> at<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.229> top<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.799> can<00:04:16.829> see<00:04:17.250> where<00:04:17.579> they

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
it up at the top you can see where they

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.310 
it up at the top you can see where they
fit<00:04:18.180> into<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.510> back<00:04:18.780> here<00:04:19.200> here<00:04:19.820> here<00:04:20.820> and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
fit into the back here here here and

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.350 
fit into the back here here here and
here<00:04:24.950> you<00:04:25.950> can<00:04:26.160> take<00:04:26.370> your<00:04:26.760> soldering<00:04:27.270> iron

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
here you can take your soldering iron

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.180 
here you can take your soldering iron
and<00:04:29.150> place<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.330> against<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.840> stock<00:04:31.530> ones<00:04:31.860> and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
and place it against the stock ones and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.380 
and place it against the stock ones and
then<00:04:33.060> just<00:04:33.360> slowly<00:04:34.550> kind<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.640> jiggle<00:04:36.060> them<00:04:36.210> out

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
then just slowly kind of jiggle them out

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.030 
then just slowly kind of jiggle them out
while<00:04:36.630> holding<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.050> soldering<00:04:37.440> iron<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:37.950> the

while holding the soldering iron in the
other<00:04:38.190> hand<00:04:39.890> just<00:04:40.890> repeat<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.670> same<00:04:41.880> process

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
other hand just repeat the same process

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.450 
other hand just repeat the same process
and<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.660> got<00:04:42.900> these<00:04:43.050> bulbs<00:04:43.410> these<00:04:43.710> replacements

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
and I got these bulbs these replacements

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.040

milliamp bulbs those are the ones that

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.120 
milliamp bulbs those are the ones that
will<00:04:58.230> be<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.620> correct<00:05:00.410> correct<00:05:01.410> voltage<00:05:01.590> and

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
will be the correct correct voltage and

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.130 
will be the correct correct voltage and
correct<00:05:02.370> amperage<00:05:02.880> for<00:05:03.270> our<00:05:03.720> purpose<00:05:04.320> here

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
correct amperage for our purpose here

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.550 
correct amperage for our purpose here
once<00:05:07.140> you've<00:05:07.350> installed<00:05:07.860> these<00:05:09.200> and<00:05:10.200> I<00:05:10.260> really

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
apologize for the blur here is my first

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.710 
apologize for the blur here is my first
video<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.140> I'm<00:05:13.290> using<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.620> crappy<00:05:13.920> camera<00:05:14.310> I

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
video and I'm using a crappy camera I

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.130 
video and I'm using a crappy camera I
put<00:05:15.720> a<00:05:17.090> screw<00:05:18.090> driver<00:05:18.240> right<00:05:18.690> next<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.050> the

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
put a screw driver right next to the

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.440 
put a screw driver right next to the
base<00:05:19.350> of<00:05:19.560> these<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.010> bent<00:05:20.370> them<00:05:20.670> over<00:05:21.120> because

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
base of these and bent them over because

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.390 
base of these and bent them over because
you<00:05:21.570> can't<00:05:21.930> just<00:05:22.470> put<00:05:22.710> them<00:05:22.860> in<00:05:22.980> sticking

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
you can't just put them in sticking

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.020 
you can't just put them in sticking
straight<00:05:23.760> up<00:05:23.820> obviously<00:05:25.280> so<00:05:26.280> I<00:05:26.310> wanted<00:05:26.880> them

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
straight up obviously so I wanted them

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.580 
straight up obviously so I wanted them
to<00:05:27.090> be<00:05:27.330> able<00:05:27.600> to<00:05:27.720> fit<00:05:27.960> in<00:05:28.110> these<00:05:28.260> little

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
to be able to fit in these little

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.250 
to be able to fit in these little
pockets<00:05:29.130> here<00:05:29.370> when<00:05:29.940> we<00:05:30.270> went<00:05:30.480> to<00:05:30.510> go<00:05:30.720> put<00:05:31.080> this

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
pockets here when we went to go put this

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:38.810 
pockets here when we went to go put this
back<00:05:32.220> together<00:05:35.930> so<00:05:36.930> there's<00:05:37.470> that<00:05:37.860> what<00:05:38.730> I'm

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
back together so there's that what I'm

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.640 
back together so there's that what I'm
going<00:05:38.910> to<00:05:38.970> do<00:05:39.120> now<00:05:39.360> is<00:05:39.720> reassemble<00:05:40.410> all<00:05:40.500> the

going to do now is reassemble all the

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.450 
going to do now is reassemble all the
fancy<00:05:41.010> buttons<00:05:41.400> on<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.760> board<00:05:43.460> reassemble

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
fancy buttons on the board reassemble

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.480 
fancy buttons on the board reassemble
this<00:05:45.150> machine<00:05:45.660> bring<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.710> out<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.830> my<00:05:47.070> car<00:05:47.340> and

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490
