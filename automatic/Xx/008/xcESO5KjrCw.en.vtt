fly<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.150> let's<00:00:15.360> make<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:15.750> attractor<00:00:16.320> fly<00:00:16.820> one

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820

fly so let's make an attractor fly one
of<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> few<00:00:18.210> things<00:00:18.500> as<00:00:19.500> far<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.740> Orbis<00:00:20.100> tied

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
of the few things as far as Orbis tied

flies<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.150> liked<00:00:21.390> was<00:00:22.670> that<00:00:23.670> they

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
flies that I really liked was that they

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.630 
flies that I really liked was that they

nymph and their fly formerly known as

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.070 
nymph and their fly formerly known as
Prince<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.210> you'll<00:00:30.210> notice<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:30.599> here<00:00:30.840> I

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
Prince and you'll notice right here I

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.370 
Prince and you'll notice right here I
extend<00:00:31.859> back<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.270> little<00:00:33.690> bit<00:00:33.780> beyond<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
extend back just a little bit beyond the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.799 
extend back just a little bit beyond the
band<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.210> think<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.600> bit<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
band and a I just think a little bit of

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.979 
band and a I just think a little bit of
that<00:00:36.960> red<00:00:37.260> showing<00:00:37.820> after<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.719> bend

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that red showing after the bend

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.930 
that red showing after the bend
certainly<00:00:40.710> doesn't<00:00:40.890> hurt<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> fly<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> first

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
certainly doesn't hurt the fly so first

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.160 
certainly doesn't hurt the fly so first
thing<00:00:45.090> I'm<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.750> tie<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.050> my

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
thing I'm going to do is tie in my

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.580 
thing I'm going to do is tie in my
buyouts<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.059> tie<00:00:48.300> those<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:49.020> right<00:00:49.410> up

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
buyouts and I tie those in just right up

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.290 
buyouts and I tie those in just right up
along<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.890> side<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> fly

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.060 

and<00:00:58.840> I<00:00:58.960> just<00:00:59.200> adjust<00:00:59.680> them<00:00:59.860> as<00:01:00.040> need<00:01:00.310> be<00:01:02.070> until

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
and I just adjust them as need be until

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:13.410 
and I just adjust them as need be until
they're<00:01:05.520> to<00:01:06.520> about<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.120> right<00:01:07.300> length

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:22.200 

and<00:01:13.900> I<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:16.509> one<00:01:16.750> more<00:01:16.960> wrap<00:01:17.140> back<00:01:21.210> that's

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
and I get one more wrap back that's

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
and I get one more wrap back that's
about<00:01:22.570> right<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.540> now<00:01:25.659> I'll<00:01:25.810> come<00:01:26.049> forward<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
about right so now I'll come forward and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.870 
about right so now I'll come forward and
just<00:01:29.530> cover<00:01:29.890> up<00:01:30.009> all<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.460> Biot<00:01:34.110> thread<00:01:35.110> back

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880

and now I'm going to do is tie in both
my<00:01:44.860> peacock<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:50.729> my<00:01:52.530> flat<00:01:53.530> wagger<00:01:53.950> tune<00:01:54.250> wire

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
my peacock and my flat wagger tune wire

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:10.590 
my peacock and my flat wagger tune wire
or<00:01:56.259> braid<00:01:56.590> or<00:01:57.420> which<00:01:58.420> I<00:01:58.600> just<00:01:58.869> dropped<00:02:00.330> this<00:02:09.600> so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
or braid or which I just dropped this so

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.420 
or braid or which I just dropped this so
I'm<00:02:10.929> going<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.170> tie<00:02:11.319> those<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.830> there<00:02:12.040> just

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
I'm going to tie those in there just

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
I'm going to tie those in there just
right<00:02:12.549> there<00:02:12.880> on<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.090> side

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.100 

and<00:02:22.250> what<00:02:23.250> I've<00:02:23.490> found<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.870> to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and what I've found that I can do to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.250 
and what I've found that I can do to
increase<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.550> durability<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.930> fly<00:02:28.170> is

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
increase the durability of this fly is

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.530 
increase the durability of this fly is
to<00:02:31.260> take<00:02:31.620> either<00:02:32.959> head<00:02:33.959> cement<00:02:34.230> or<00:02:35.209> Zappa<00:02:36.209> gap

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
to take either head cement or Zappa gap

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.600 
to take either head cement or Zappa gap
and<00:02:37.580> apply<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.640> before<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:40.280> before<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.310> wrap

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and apply it before just before I wrap

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.660 
and apply it before just before I wrap
my<00:02:41.819> peacock<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.319> seems<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.739> bind<00:02:44.489> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
my peacock and it just seems to bind it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.050 
my peacock and it just seems to bind it
down<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.030> place<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:46.489> make<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.670> fly<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> little

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
down in place and make the fly a little

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.839 
down in place and make the fly a little
bit<00:02:48.209> more<00:02:48.450> durable<00:02:49.250> because<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.489> think<00:02:50.700> we've

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
bit more durable because I think we've

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.580 
bit more durable because I think we've
all<00:02:51.030> fists<00:02:51.390> enough<00:02:51.660> prints<00:02:51.930> nips<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.410> know

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
all fists enough prints nips to know

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.949 
all fists enough prints nips to know
that<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.269> get<00:02:54.420> chewed<00:02:54.630> up<00:02:54.780> pretty

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
that you can get chewed up pretty

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.820 
that you can get chewed up pretty
quickly<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:57.269> going<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.690> here<00:02:58.170> is

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
quickly so what I'm going to do here is

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.220 
quickly so what I'm going to do here is
just<00:02:59.569> drop<00:03:00.569> some<00:03:01.790> head<00:03:02.790> cement<00:03:03.030> again<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.080> can

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
just drop some head cement again you can

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.400 
just drop some head cement again you can
use<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:05.640> number<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.239> different<00:03:06.330> adhesives<00:03:06.750> for

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
use a number of different adhesives for

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.229 
use a number of different adhesives for
this<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:11.400> one<00:03:11.640> we're<00:03:11.880> just<00:03:11.910> going<00:03:12.209> to

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
this but on this one we're just going to

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.539 
this but on this one we're just going to
go<00:03:12.390> ahead<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.750> use<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.140> head<00:03:13.350> cement<00:03:13.709> and

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
go ahead and use that head cement and

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.640 
go ahead and use that head cement and
that<00:03:14.880> just<00:03:15.060> kind<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.360> locks<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.930> peacock<00:03:16.410> in

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
that just kind of locks that peacock in

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.039 
that just kind of locks that peacock in
place<00:03:17.069> with<00:03:17.640> each<00:03:17.670> rat<00:03:20.060> making<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.360> far<00:03:21.930> more

I've already got it splayed out and I'm
just<00:04:28.940> going<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.150> measure<00:04:29.360> up<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.750> bars<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.350> be

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
just going to measure up the bars to be

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.469 
just going to measure up the bars to be
about<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.919> length<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.430> hook<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:31.970> as<00:04:32.330> you

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
about the length of the hook and as you

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.210 
about the length of the hook and as you
get<00:04:32.600> closer<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.200> tip<00:04:33.440> they<00:04:33.620> get<00:04:33.800> shorter

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
get closer to the tip they get shorter

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.129 
get closer to the tip they get shorter
so<00:04:35.180> you<00:04:35.210> just<00:04:35.450> want<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.720> make<00:04:35.840> sure<00:04:35.870> that

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
so you just want to make sure that

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:43.000 
so you just want to make sure that
they're<00:04:36.320> not<00:04:36.530> too<00:04:36.919> long<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.320> looks<00:04:42.740> to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
they're not too long and that looks to

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.260 
they're not too long and that looks to
be<00:04:43.070> about<00:04:43.220> right<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:49.340> I'll<00:04:49.700> tie<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:50.060> in

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
be about right and I'll tie that in
