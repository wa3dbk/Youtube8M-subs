00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.080
 we are here in another video for 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.800
 show you and present our model 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.150
 of dummy camera dome 914 a camera that 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.480
 it is usually used as an element 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.609
 deterrent we recommend including the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.769
 normal administration me that I know if 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.989
 we have a four- camera kit that 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.149
 they are recording because it is advisable to put 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.000
 a couple of these in the middle for good 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.640
 so give more reliability to that guy 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.030
 of installation no greater deterrent power 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.560
 to say somehow these cameras do not 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.270
 they are functional, that is, they have nothing 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.150
 inside not in electronics simply 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.370
 they carry a hole for the batteries a pilot 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.020
 net with a system that causes it to provoke 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.810
 intermittent flashes that make the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.550
 simulation that is recording but its 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.960
 physical appearance does give us the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.059
 impression that it is a real camera 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.000
 and we're just going to make a brief 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.979
 explanation of how the batteries are placed 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.550
 as if they were that is very simple if 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.420
 you do not have to do big courses or 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.990
 things like that 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.850
 in this case as you see the camera to 914 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.450
 comes in a single box 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.220
 it brings some images from the outside since 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.810
 the interior tells us where the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.659
 location of the lives of how it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.320
 place the screws 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.870
 and certain stories while 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.310
 as you see 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.310
 unit of the box 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.280
 well in the template to do the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.280
 holes and oscar 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.090
 a set of two screws with two studs 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:55.730
 for transformation and as no bed 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.050
 are the batteries in this case this camera 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.310
 as you see one as the appearance 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.010
 totally a real camera the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.040
 batteries are dedicated here carries three 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.110
 units 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.570
 three double units we call 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.520
 brutally air 06 are a lot 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.550
 tranquility adds a stack of control 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.800
 Well, those are valid, they are already 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.840
 agreement arises we have the screws in 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.510
 the ceiling or on the wall that is to say we do 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.150
 a small turn would be nothing worth as 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.400
 you see is already simulating us 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.910
 simulating that is recording is 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.800
 makes a pulse more frequent than others 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.780
 models that we have 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.650
 which also in quotes is more 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.689
 interesting because 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.360
 he does not spend so much time in the studio 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:46.060
 outside and gives rise to lesser doubt 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.560
 in principle you see that he did not speak anything 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.770
 does not do anything in fact Sunday is a 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.010
 her video nor absolutely anything not 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.880
 the housing is very similar in fact that 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.100
 they are used by the original cameras 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.280
 And with this, what do I say? 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.220
 is very dissuasive where sales in 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.540
 a lot of investment when it comes to having little 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.830
 more security at home office 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.760
 anywhere 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.740
 in this case it comes back 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.990
 we recommend placing that type of cameras 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.640
 always accompanied by a kit that 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.260
 really is recording 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.760
 to give a little more good 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.439
 and that the individual wants to enter 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.360
 our home our office in 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.340
 our warehouse because you only have one 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.079
 little bit more and have the doubts to know 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.659
 if it's really recording us or 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.980
 has the mine end up by not entering 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.250
 worth noting is very economical 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.130
 a very good finish and it can get you out of 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.740
 more than one problem 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.740
 I see our product presentation 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.190
 and
