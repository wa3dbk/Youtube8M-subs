00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.440
 my cat the softest the softest 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.160
 wet nose and takes so well to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.080
 his master 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.150
 no joke he initially told me to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.500
 don't talk about my cat to avoid 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.639
 start a writing career for 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.160
 children of 4 years 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.869
 but who cares I will try to talk 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.720
 of my cat in the least curious way 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.570
 possible in my ambrÃ¬ of house one 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.730
 Basti on all fours hovers no no 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.230
 then he started with something in between 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.449
 then when i took my cat 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 I was six and stayed was a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.260
 vacation ladispoli from what I remember 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.329
 my brother 0 that I make the balls to my parents 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.280
 because we absolutely wanted a cat i 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.780
 My just to calm us were starting to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.670
 think about solving this need 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.320
 long before my mother had spotted 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.510
 a cat on the street enough 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 small to be taken but some 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.590
 day he was dressed so we will have to 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.199
 cat that we took 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.430
 ok ok what i have now we have it 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.620
 found when we were dining 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 practically while we were there from 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 his disturbing garden arrived 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.899
 meows so we saw it on 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.379
 railing between our curated garden 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.210
 of neighbors 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.430
 I think he didn't know how to get off or 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.930
 similar things so we took it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.280
 we did veterinary pampering 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.140
 play with the sticks play like 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.850
 play strings with fingers ends state 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.320
 he comes home to buy the litter box 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.900
 we have other boulders and so the cat 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.759
 arranged ps a cat or gray with the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.810
 tip of the white tail as soon as we have 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.490
 brought the documents to Rome 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.470
 this started purring more 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.700
 noisy I've ever heard 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.650
 this cat besides all the others 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.570
 strange attitudes of cats like 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.130
 sleep at night to mess the night 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.810
 and run around the corridors and turning 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.759
 the last moment banging against the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 doors sleeping in the sleeping boxes 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.060
 Over the clothes, sleep on the computer 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.130
 sleeping on homework sleeping if sheets of 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.540
 paper put us in front of who is treating 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.220
 a movie to put your nails in front of 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.720
 who is watching movies do ambushes 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.130
 to everyone and everything 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 but also to those who are watching a movie a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.369
 drinking water from the toilet put on suggested 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.170
 who sleeps steal food in the kitchen 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.820
 how such horrible hairballs open 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.770
 the doors enter the weapon to stay there 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.450
 for hours with even stranger behavior 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.040
 he thinks we caught him one day 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.689
 that he rubbed his life from the freezer 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.759
 I often found pastries with the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.890
 cream moved in my other shoes 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.110
 sometimes brewster his horse though 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.729
 battle and the immediate salad eats 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.469
 the salad leaves when lunch is 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.670
 puts two areas under the table and for 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.170
 make him feel good I'm forced to 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.550
 throw leaves that fails to 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.170
 eat very well because often i 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.030
 fall 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.680
 the mouth has lately decided that 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.330
 the only one that loves water is that 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.620
 I always find her in the kitchen 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.120
 over lavandina waiting for someone 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.950
 also open it because if we 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.900
 primizia slinguazzare it does a little 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.700
 still disgusting now in this case is 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.319
 become a fixed company when 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.030
 I sleep when I eat when I'm in the bathroom 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.410
 when you study when I draw when I read 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.330
 when I see a movie when it has to go out 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.830
 home and he runs 100 kilometers 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.810
 times and to exit the door e 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.550
 he ran about the palace once it was 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.780
 also managed to escape and returned 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.810
 of his own free will after a day 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.769
 it is because there is but too much truth is why 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.390
 it was pouring down 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.190
 I could continue telling of when 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.900
 he was operated on when in the mountains 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.640
 there were other acts or bullies here 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.100
 when he exchanged a cat stuffed toy for 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.410
 a real cat but I prefer to tell you that the 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.840
 my soft-haired soft cat the 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.720
 wet nose and loves his 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:05.090
 master eats so much pope and me too 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.569
 I love so much and it's called splinter 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.569
