00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.066
- There's a storm
hitting the east coast

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.333
which they say is
going to be historic.

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.800
That is crazy.
Here on the west coast,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.100
there's another historic event.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.800
It's day two of
my birthday week.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.000
[cheers and applause]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.166
Thanks.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.133
Thank you so much.
But I feel so bad

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.566
for everybody on the east coast.

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.733
They say that the storm could
bring up to three feet of snow.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.000
Wow.
Which means Boston and New York

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
are going to be whiter than
the Oscar nominees.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.633
[laughter and applause]

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.466
I said it.

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.700
It's the truth.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.733
This storm is so big
that it even has a name.

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.066
They're calling the winter storm
Juno,

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.333
as in, "Juno there's gonna be
a lot of snow?"

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.766
[laughter]

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.233
It sounds terrible.

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.400
They're predicting
80 mile-an-hour winds,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.866
whiteout conditions, and
something called thundersnow.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.266
What?
Thundersnow.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:02.333
That was my nickname when
I was on my roller derby team.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.500
[laughter]

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.166
That's what they called me.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.566
We're tracking the storm
in our storm center.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.433
We have a storm center.
I don't know if you knew that.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:11.400
But...we're tracking it live.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.333
We have cameras
all over the east coast.

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.600
Let's take a look at Boston
live right now.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.166
[growling]

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.800
[screams]

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.300
Wow.
So that's--yeah.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.300
It's hap--live.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.300
[applause]

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.300
Yeah.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.700
Oh, there's more.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.333
We're not done.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.900
The bit's not over.
Here's what's happening

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.700
right now in New York.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.033
[dramatic music]

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.266
- Come on!

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:46.866
- That's the East Village.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:47.866
And...

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.000
[applause]

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.333
There's more.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.600
[laughs]

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.033
Here's what's happening in
Washington, D.C.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.366
["Let it Go" playing]

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.066
[singing]
- Let it go

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.933
Let it go

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:04.433
I am one with the wind and sky

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.133
Let it go

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.300
Let it go

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.800
- No.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.100
[applause]

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.100
I'd just gotten that
out of my head.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.400
Washington, D.C. is
completely frozen.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.133
Everything is blocked.
Nothing is getting done.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.466
So the storm hasn't really
affected them much.

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:25.400
And I know some people like the
cold, but boy, it is not for me.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.466
The heat went out at my house
over Christmas.

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.500
I cried for three days.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.466
If you're stuck in the snow
and the cold,

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:32.466
I'm thinking about you.

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:33.800
And I dedicate this dance
to you.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200
Uh-oh.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.866
Did you want to see more videos?

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.366
Hold on.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.100
- These two girls got up in
the middle of my Q&amp;A and left.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.100
And I have a mic--

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.966
- Aah!
- Oh, you!

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:56.966
[cheers and applause]
