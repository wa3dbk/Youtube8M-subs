00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.910
 hello people I'm yours in the movie and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.070
 today or now I show you one so 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.480
 the promised review from my ps3 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.910
 super slim so the super slim 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.880
 So I have only the game so far 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.469
 fifa 13 played with her and I am 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.230
 totally convinced of me 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.719
 that is totally good so I think so 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.200
 graphics that's totally so I think it 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.000
 more than hd yes then I have me too 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.620
 a dvd looked at the dvd the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.230
 actually should not be hd plays 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.329
 I find it in hd so that's what it is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.730
 I also have a big plus of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.730
 her she is also very quiet i could 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.780
 I think there is nothing or 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.430
 just a bit 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.369
 so I, I think it's still very 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.650
 quietly and now you get the positive 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.880
 and negatives to the playstation 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.310
 So I think that negative here 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.439
 example is this 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.030
 there you see that maybe there that 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.430
 Fingerprints come on it very quickly 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 So on the black you have to 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.759
 keep very clean and here in the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.439
 black numbers 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.090
 then the dust will not come 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.220
 just slowly in 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.680
 That's why I'm here next to always 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.740
 a dust fisherman yes I think that is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.610
 actually the only negative thing about it 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.409
 otherwise I can not find anything about it 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.640
 not that negative either now if he does 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.810
 now the cd for example a lot 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.659
 then betrays sometimes that is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.250
 a bit louder but then it is quieter 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.780
 and that does not bother me personally 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.240
 and also with the bayer if I the dvd 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.590
 look then it is also very quiet and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.380
 I can hardly hear then yes 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.460
 there is also still here so that me 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.640
 show you now something even the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.679
 that is how it can be 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.230
 that's what I say here 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.920
 do not understand why some say that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:20.990
 that would not be so great and so me 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.760
 think this is totally awesome because I like it 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.350
 it is just something different than always 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.420
 to press a button then drives 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.280
 that out then goes back in there 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.690
 I do not think so at all 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.850
 no console at all or 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.810
 not something else that I now 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.160
 So, as I said, this sluice would have to 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.030
 is that called 13 games 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.380
 if we like the load but now 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.380
 start wondering 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.969
 yes, I do not want that loud now 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.629
 or above how different now he starts 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:00.040
 the game in a television 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.700
 I did want to do was not there is 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.430
 no matter 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:09.159
 yes then to the controller of the controller 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.889
 who is the controller what should i do 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:15.269
 because now say yes the controller of 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:19.329
 the battery that was not long so not short 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.609
 here it is on the back but I have 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.790
 already in an unboxing said there 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.430
 can read what there is 5 volt equal 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.819
 500 mio 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.819
 So that's not new, though 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.349
 as better or longer that holds now 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:45.939
 as those now at the others 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:48.250
 synonymous with the old controller yes what 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.060
 I can still show you now 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.370
 not much anymore 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.430
 that's the 500 gigabyte version of me 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.430
 think you can get it fully 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.269
 because five gigabytes how much can you 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.579
 save on it 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:05.979
 a lot is still the playstation 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:10.720
 logo then I'll show you again 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:16.750
 what's down here is once blu 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:19.900
 ray discs is then dvd dunn company 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.579
 disc that the reader thinks I can be called 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.190
 that then 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.280
 dolby true hd this is the newer one 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.349
 that only exists on the ps3 me now 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:38.590
 dolby digital plus and 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:43.750
 dts hd media audio that is there then 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:46.340
 bluetooth and hdmi of which here now the 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.349
 stand here 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.280
 then there are the two usb 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:56.099
 connections here you can watch how 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.639
 now the cp where is right now 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.419
 now also the trailer of how 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.419
 in front of 13 in it 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.969
 I'm still too much for 13 yet 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.849
 one by one many matches 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:15.419
 record for example fc bavaria against 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.830
 the and the and the matches I will 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.270
 then put on youtube and I will 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.280
 then create a playlist 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.340
 I do not know yet how many matches 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:28.289
 I will but continue to 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.039
 Playstation Portable continues the last 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.650
 make a place 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.469
 ok it 2012 I think you have me 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.639
 So this fc bavaria started this way 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.090
 special I will finish this 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.400
 to lead 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:43.050
 but you can see it here as well 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.449
 fluent that runs like real that just 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:50.629
 looks 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:50.629
 the players just everything 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:00.650
 You can also do it very well 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.790
 Check here what you are controlling 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.080
 that's it for my review 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.850
 I might have another one 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 video to ps3 shooters we do 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:13.200
 the next videos will be just that 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.020
 ps 2012 fc bavaria special lead to the end 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.520
 after that I will not think 2012 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.660
 but then make it more often 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.980
 playstation 3 to fifa 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.420
 Now it starts again , I hope so 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.530
 helped you a bit and 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.780
 continued to fall 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.600
 Maybe it will be me too 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.800
 can only recommend it 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.120
 then I'll say to the next video 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.560
 Saturday or whatever good night 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.560
 bye then
