00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
yeah / fiber boom okay so this is

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.150 
yeah / fiber boom okay so this is
derek's<00:00:02.129> Bo<00:00:02.340> Derek's<00:00:02.700> got<00:00:02.820> his<00:00:03.030> rig<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:04.160> rig

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
derek's Bo Derek's got his rig of rig

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.280 
derek's Bo Derek's got his rig of rig
pretty<00:00:05.400> advanced<00:00:05.970> compared<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.990> way<00:00:07.109> mine

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
pretty advanced compared to the way mine

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.110 
pretty advanced compared to the way mine
was<00:00:07.470> rigged<00:00:07.680> which<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.010> pretty<00:00:08.280> much<00:00:08.400> factory

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.089 

so<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.330> how<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.380> how<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.920> kind

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
so this is how this is how this is kind

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.029 
so this is how this is how this is kind
of<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> goal<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.700> mine<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.500> have<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.859> in

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
of the goal for mine is to have it in

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.279 
of the goal for mine is to have it in
the<00:00:17.160> end<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:17.850> Eric's<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:19.050> see<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the end just like Eric's you can see the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.320 
the end just like Eric's you can see the
nut<00:00:19.470> search<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:20.010> allow<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> master<00:00:21.210> be

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
nut search that allow the master be

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.509 
nut search that allow the master be
screwed<00:00:21.660> together<00:00:21.840> gotcha<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.189> mass<00:00:23.340> is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
screwed together gotcha so the mass is

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.310 
screwed together gotcha so the mass is
not<00:00:23.670> going<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.850> come<00:00:23.970> apart<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> in

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
not going to come apart on you and in

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.540 
not going to come apart on you and in
this<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> boat<00:00:25.890> there's<00:00:26.099> no<00:00:26.220> reason<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
this kind of boat there's no reason to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.370 
this kind of boat there's no reason to
have<00:00:26.789> because<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.180> you've<00:00:27.630> got<00:00:27.779> such<00:00:27.960> tension

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
have because you you've got such tension

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.080 
have because you you've got such tension
on<00:00:28.470> these<00:00:28.619> battens<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.310> there's<00:00:29.490> no<00:00:29.670> reason

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
on these battens that there's no reason

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
on these battens that there's no reason
the<00:00:30.480> mass<00:00:30.660> ought<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.929> ever<00:00:31.050> come<00:00:31.230> apart<00:00:31.529> oh<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the mass ought to ever come apart oh and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.950 
the mass ought to ever come apart oh and
there<00:00:31.949> would<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.070> no<00:00:32.279> real<00:00:32.460> reason<00:00:32.700> except<00:00:33.660> for

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
there would be no real reason except for

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.900 
there would be no real reason except for
breaking<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.410> down<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.800> transporting<00:00:35.700> got

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
breaking it down for transporting got

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.979 
breaking it down for transporting got
your<00:00:36.030> only<00:00:36.210> reason<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.600> did<00:00:36.690> everyone<00:00:36.840> take

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
your only reason you did everyone take

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.940 
your only reason you did everyone take
it<00:00:37.230> apart<00:00:37.440> okay<00:00:39.829> of<00:00:40.829> course<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.250> seems<00:00:44.629> Oh

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950

yeah<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> difference<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.640> how<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:09.630> 39

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
yeah you see the difference of how my 39

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.710 
yeah you see the difference of how my 39
days<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.130> uh-huh<00:01:11.520> simples<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.630> we'll

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
days down uh-huh simples that so we'll

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
days down uh-huh simples that so we'll
put<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.260> till<00:01:13.710> extension<00:01:14.130> stays<00:01:14.340> right

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
put this on till extension stays right

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.310 
put this on till extension stays right
in<00:01:14.610> place<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.360> where<00:01:15.570> how<00:01:15.840> might<00:01:16.049> slip

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
in place there see where how might slip

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.160 
in place there see where how might slip
works<00:01:16.790> kind<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.030> snap<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.110> you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
works kind of just snap so that you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.890 
works kind of just snap so that you
can't<00:01:19.409> come<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.850> simple<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:20.939> okay<00:01:21.600> that's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
can't come up simple as that okay that's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
can't come up simple as that okay that's
close<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> them<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:23.759> you'd<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
close to them it's you'd be a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.580 
close to them it's you'd be a
little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.570> farther<00:01:24.750> down<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.229> cannot

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
little bit farther down so that cannot

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.980 
little bit farther down so that cannot
physically<00:01:25.979> come<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.640> huh<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.630> then

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
physically come up at all huh but then

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.499 
physically come up at all huh but then
this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:29.400> course<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.759> pulls<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.119> down<00:01:30.150> but

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this is of course that pulls it down but

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.890 
this is of course that pulls it down but
this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> was<00:01:31.049> County<00:01:31.320> about<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
this is what it was County about the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.550 
this is what it was County about the
self<00:01:33.900> centering<00:01:34.259> okay<00:01:34.799> clips<00:01:35.689> bungees<00:01:36.689> simple

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
self centering okay clips bungees simple

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.330 
self centering okay clips bungees simple
