00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
that is just so much detailed this is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.360 
that is just so much detailed this is
crazy<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.109> would<00:02:13.439> not<00:02:13.590> even<00:02:13.709> thought<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.249> put

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
crazy I would not even thought to put

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.880

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
that in

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.460 
that in
but<00:02:15.640> obviously<00:02:15.730> he<00:02:16.090> did<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.510> did<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.050> great<00:02:17.319> job

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
here this is a very unique building I'm

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.920 
here this is a very unique building I'm
not<00:02:21.850> even<00:02:22.060> sure<00:02:22.180> which<00:02:22.300> one<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.660> he<00:02:22.810> has

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
not even sure which one this is he has

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.620 
not even sure which one this is he has
little<00:02:23.080> signs<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.560> show<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.670> names<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.300> what

little signs that show the names of what

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.820 
little signs that show the names of what
all<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.870> them<00:02:26.020> are<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.380> let's<00:02:26.500> fly<00:02:26.650> down<00:02:26.800> here

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
all of them are so let's fly down here

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.860 
all of them are so let's fly down here
and<00:02:27.520> this<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:30.030> obelisk<00:02:31.030> power<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.510> think<00:02:31.630> I

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
and this is obelisk power I think I

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.540 
and this is obelisk power I think I
don't<00:02:31.990> know<00:02:32.050> I'm<00:02:32.140> saying<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.470> right<00:02:32.620> but

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
don't know I'm saying that right but

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.710 
don't know I'm saying that right but
that's<00:02:33.820> just<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.120> tower<00:02:34.330> right<00:02:34.480> there

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720

more<00:03:16.989> office<00:03:17.260> space<00:03:17.320> in<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.769> giant<00:03:18.250> building

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
more office space in this giant building

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.610 
more office space in this giant building
right<00:03:18.610> there<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:18.970> one<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.209> massive<00:03:19.840> it's<00:03:20.500> go

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
right there this one is massive it's go

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.080 
right there this one is massive it's go
ahead<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:20.829> fly<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.190> top<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.910> get<00:03:22.060> a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
ahead and fly to the top and just get a

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.990 
ahead and fly to the top and just get a
big<00:03:22.450> view<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.079> sea<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.620> think<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:24.760> white

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
big view of the sea I think that white

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.150 
big view of the sea I think that white
one<00:03:25.209> might<00:03:25.630> be<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.840> tallest<00:03:26.170> or<00:03:26.680> maybe<00:03:26.890> one<00:03:27.100> of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
one might be the tallest or maybe one of

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.250 
one might be the tallest or maybe one of
these<00:03:27.310> but<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:28.120> think<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.600> few<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.810> them<00:03:28.930> go<00:03:29.019> up<00:03:29.140> to

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
these but I think a few of them go up to

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.259 
these but I think a few of them go up to
the<00:03:29.350> map<00:03:29.680> limits<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:30.220> let's<00:03:30.940> go<00:03:31.030> ahead<00:03:31.090> and

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
the map limits so let's go ahead and

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.910 
the map limits so let's go ahead and
turn<00:03:31.329> on<00:03:31.510> our<00:03:31.540> farm<00:03:31.959> owners<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.410> see<00:03:32.650> we<00:03:32.769> can

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
turn on our farm owners and see we can

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.520 
turn on our farm owners and see we can
see<00:03:33.600> there<00:03:34.600> we<00:03:34.750> go<00:03:34.840> okay<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:35.140> this<00:03:35.320> might<00:03:35.500> take

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
see there we go okay so this might take

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.520 
see there we go okay so this might take
a<00:03:35.680> while<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.950> load<00:03:36.220> up<00:03:36.400> but<00:03:36.880> let's<00:03:37.450> go<00:03:37.600> walk

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
a while to load up but let's go walk

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.319 
a while to load up but let's go walk
around<00:03:38.560> fire<00:03:39.160> on<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.459> tower<00:03:39.640> real<00:03:39.820> quick<00:03:40.030> and

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
around fire on this tower real quick and

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.600 
around fire on this tower real quick and
try<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.750> get<00:03:40.840> this<00:03:40.930> loaded<00:03:41.370> there<00:03:42.370> we<00:03:42.459> go

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
try and get this loaded there we go

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:46.809 
TV with his concerts there's always

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.779 
TV with his concerts there's always
people<00:04:47.080> that<00:04:47.229> are<00:04:47.349> setting<00:04:47.620> behind<00:04:48.219> the<00:04:48.580> stage

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
people that are setting behind the stage

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.909 
people that are setting behind the stage
I<00:04:49.029> would<00:04:49.120> just<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.449> mean<00:04:49.749> I<00:04:49.960> would<00:04:50.139> not<00:04:50.319> pay<00:04:50.889> for

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
I would just I mean I would not pay for

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.159 
I would just I mean I would not pay for
a<00:04:51.099> ticket<00:04:51.219> back<00:04:51.430> there<00:04:51.669> but<00:04:51.939> I<00:04:52.210> guess<00:04:52.809> you<00:04:53.050> do

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
a ticket back there but I guess you do

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.959 
a ticket back there but I guess you do
get<00:04:53.349> to<00:04:53.469> go<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.680> see<00:04:54.550> wherever<00:04:54.759> you're<00:04:54.849> going

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
get to go to see wherever you're going

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.749 
get to go to see wherever you're going
to<00:04:55.029> see<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:55.529> I<00:04:56.529> guess<00:04:56.949> it's<00:04:57.099> all<00:04:57.219> rights<00:04:57.430> but

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
to see so I guess it's all rights but

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.239 
to see so I guess it's all rights but
I'd<00:04:58.539> much<00:04:59.080> rather<00:04:59.139> be<00:04:59.349> the<00:04:59.559> one<00:04:59.589> lucky<00:05:00.009> in

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:00.249 
I'd much rather be the one lucky in

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:02.640 
I'd much rather be the one lucky in
