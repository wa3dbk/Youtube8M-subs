that<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.770> game<00:00:37.980> plan<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> start<00:00:38.940> quickly

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that the game plan was to start quickly

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
that the game plan was to start quickly
to<00:00:39.570> try<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.899> start<00:00:40.110> quickly<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.649> try<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:40.980> get

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
to try and start quickly to try and get

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.580 
to try and start quickly to try and get
some<00:00:41.280> confidence<00:00:41.640> into<00:00:42.120> them<00:00:42.500> but<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
some confidence into them but the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.020 
some confidence into them but the
problem<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.489> way<00:00:44.610> things<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:45.000> been

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
problem is that the way things have been

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.549 
problem is that the way things have been
going<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> moment<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.960> longer<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
going at the moment the longer that the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
going at the moment the longer that the
side<00:00:46.770> went<00:00:47.010> without<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.280> breakthrough<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
side went without a breakthrough you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.569 
side went without a breakthrough you
just<00:00:48.629> saw<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.870> confidence<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.680> down<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.280> down

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
just saw the confidence go down and down

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
just saw the confidence go down and down
and<00:00:50.879> down<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.930> more<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.230> happens<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and down and the more that happens of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.850 
and down and the more that happens of
course<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.399> more<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.610> opposition<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.860> yo

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
course the more the opposition and yo

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.180 
course the more the opposition and yo
gaining<00:00:56.370> confidence<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.410> not<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.800> something

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
gaining confidence and not the something

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.400 
gaining confidence and not the something
is<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.699> only<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.660> crowd<00:01:00.930> resigned

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
is that not only is the crowd resigned

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
is that not only is the crowd resigned
to<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> inevitable<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.670> almost<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.210> the

we're going on within three or four
minutes<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.930> that's<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.920> story

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
minutes that's that's that's the story

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.440 
minutes that's that's that's the story
at<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> moment<00:01:52.009> how<00:01:53.009> how<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.880> turn<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> around

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
at the moment how how we turn it around

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.969 
at the moment how how we turn it around
I<00:01:54.689> don't<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.990> probably<00:01:55.229> confidence<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
I don't know probably confidence is

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
I don't know probably confidence is
probably<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> hardest<00:01:57.090> things<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
probably one of the hardest things to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.350 
probably one of the hardest things to
regaining<00:01:57.960> football<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.060> from<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
regaining football and it's from that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.389 
regaining football and it's from that
point<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.689> view<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.899> maybe<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:02.040> look<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
point of view that maybe you look to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.639 
point of view that maybe you look to
Tuesday<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.360> say<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.229> could<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
Tuesday and you say it could be a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.459 
Tuesday and you say it could be a
godsend<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:06.210> gives<00:02:06.479> us<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.290> bit

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
godsend because it gives us a little bit

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.400 
godsend because it gives us a little bit
of<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.680> break<00:02:07.920> from<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> Premier<00:02:08.580> League<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
of a break from the Premier League and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.690 
of a break from the Premier League and
even<00:02:10.410> though<00:02:10.530> there's<00:02:10.979> no<00:02:11.099> point<00:02:11.370> looking<00:02:11.489> at

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
even though there's no point looking at

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.550 
even though there's no point looking at
the<00:02:11.760> league<00:02:11.970> table<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> moment<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.319> it

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the league table at the moment but it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.930 
the league table at the moment but it
is<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.739> break<00:02:14.010> from<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> rigmarole<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.849> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
is a break from the rigmarole of the

is a break from the rigmarole of the
Premier<00:02:15.270> League<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.660> gives<00:02:16.170> us<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.380> break<00:02:16.530> from

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
Premier League it gives us a break from

Premier League it gives us a break from
the<00:02:16.920> rigmarole<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:18.200> belief<00:02:19.200> that's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the rigmarole of this belief that's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.199 
the rigmarole of this belief that's
grown<00:02:19.709> up<00:02:19.860> amongst<00:02:20.250> opposition<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.030> all

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
grown up amongst opposition that all
