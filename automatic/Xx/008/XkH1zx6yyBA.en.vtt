the<00:02:03.030> following<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.049> take<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the following in and take the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.380 
the following in and take the
photographs<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:04.950> also<00:02:05.520> some<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.030> them<00:02:06.149> have

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
photographs but also some of them have

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.270 
photographs but also some of them have
been<00:02:06.540> photographed<00:02:06.960> before<00:02:07.079> how<00:02:07.619> difficult

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
been photographed before how difficult

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.460 
been photographed before how difficult
how<00:02:08.550> dangerous<00:02:09.300> are<00:02:09.450> some<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.750> these<00:02:09.869> k

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
how dangerous are some of these k

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.650 
how dangerous are some of these k
it<00:02:11.470> depends<00:02:12.250> really<00:02:12.430> when<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.850> assess<00:02:13.480> the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
it depends really when you assess the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.170 
it depends really when you assess the
risks<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.980> from<00:02:15.190> there<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.400> make<00:02:16.030> them

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
risks and and from there you make them

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.840 
risks and and from there you make them
as<00:02:16.240> little<00:02:16.420> as<00:02:16.690> dangerous<00:02:17.020> as<00:02:17.140> possible<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.920> I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
as little as dangerous as possible and I

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.670 
as little as dangerous as possible and I
generally<00:02:19.450> only<00:02:19.540> go<00:02:19.750> underground<00:02:20.080> with

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
generally only go underground with

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.380 
generally only go underground with
calculated<00:02:21.280> people<00:02:21.640> or<00:02:21.760> group<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.000> friends

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
calculated people or group of friends

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.120 
calculated people or group of friends
who<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.570> trust<00:02:22.810> completely<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:24.010> you're

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
who I trust completely so but you're

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.950 
who I trust completely so but you're
using<00:02:24.340> well<00:02:24.820> look<00:02:25.060> look<00:02:25.210> at<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.420> image<00:02:25.690> there

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
using well look look at that image there

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.980 
using well look look at that image there
that<00:02:26.170> since<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:26.950> sort<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.220> rappelling<00:02:27.700> down

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
that since you sort of rappelling down

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.710 
that since you sort of rappelling down
you're<00:02:28.990> using<00:02:29.170> what<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.370> wires<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.060> how

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
you're using what is it wires and how

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.020 
you're using what is it wires and how
actually<00:02:32.170> do<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.980> not<00:02:33.250> only<00:02:33.430> get<00:02:33.610> yourself

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
actually do you not only get yourself

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.370 
actually do you not only get yourself
but<00:02:34.210> your<00:02:34.330> equipment<00:02:34.840> cuz<00:02:34.960> don't<00:02:35.140> forget

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
but your equipment cuz don't forget

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.840 
but your equipment cuz don't forget
you've<00:02:35.470> got<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> likely<00:02:36.070> things<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.670> make<00:02:36.790> them

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
you've got a likely things to make them

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.330 
you've got a likely things to make them
look<00:02:37.000> fantastic<00:02:37.570> how<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.770> how<00:02:39.010> do<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.160> do<00:02:39.310> that

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
look fantastic how do how do you do that

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.940 
look fantastic how do how do you do that
well<00:02:40.240> year<00:02:40.480> we<00:02:40.630> use<00:02:40.810> ropes<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.440> access<00:02:41.800> the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
well year we use ropes to access the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.530 
well year we use ropes to access the
vertical<00:02:42.400> sections<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:42.970> cave<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.420> we

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
vertical sections of the cave so we

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.840 
vertical sections of the cave so we
would<00:02:43.690> say<00:02:43.990> Linda<00:02:44.560> them<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.460> carry<00:02:45.700> all

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
would say Linda them and it carry all

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.520 
would say Linda them and it carry all
the<00:02:46.000> equipment<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.360> we<00:02:46.480> need<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:47.350> photograph

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
the equipment that we need to photograph

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.740 
the equipment that we need to photograph
the<00:02:47.860> caves<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.550> yes<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.910> saw<00:02:49.210> them<00:02:49.390> are<00:02:49.480> quite

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
the caves and yes I saw them are quite

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.150 
the caves and yes I saw them are quite
big<00:02:49.960> like<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.740> some<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.130> areas

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
big like that and in some of the areas

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.710 
big like that and in some of the areas
we<00:02:51.550> have<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.730> go<00:02:51.820> through<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.060> quite<00:02:52.240> small<00:02:52.510> and

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
we have to go through a quite small and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.540 
we have to go through a quite small and
narrow<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.620> passing<00:02:54.070> all<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:54.370> equipment

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
narrow so passing all this equipment

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.790 
narrow so passing all this equipment
through<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.270> take<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> long<00:02:55.690> time<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:56.230> get<00:02:56.740> to

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
through can take a long time to get to

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.070 
through can take a long time to get to
the<00:02:56.950> location<00:02:57.490> where<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:57.880> want<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.240> wear<00:02:58.510> take

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
the location where you want to wear take

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.380 
the location where you want to wear take
the<00:02:59.140> photograph<00:02:59.530> hmm<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.250> just<00:03:00.700> wonder<00:03:01.120> you

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
the photograph hmm I just wonder you

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.360 
the photograph hmm I just wonder you
know<00:03:01.480> there<00:03:01.960> are<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.260> many<00:03:02.410> parts<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.070> the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
know there are so many parts of the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.790 
know there are so many parts of the
remote<00:03:03.730> world<00:03:04.030> which<00:03:04.390> are<00:03:04.630> now<00:03:04.800> threatened

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
remote world which are now threatened

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.000 
remote world which are now threatened
with<00:03:06.130> human<00:03:07.060> contact<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.290> environmental

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
with human contact and environmental

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.610 
with human contact and environmental
pollution<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.610> one<00:03:09.790> sort<00:03:10.030> or<00:03:10.210> another<00:03:10.380> are<00:03:11.380> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
pollution of one sort or another are the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.160 
pollution of one sort or another are the
caves<00:03:11.860> safe<00:03:12.340> because<00:03:12.790> they<00:03:13.390> are<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.780> remote

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
caves safe because they are so remote

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.870 
caves safe because they are so remote
and<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.620> course<00:03:14.800> underground<00:03:15.340> yeah<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.610> know

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
and of course underground yeah I know

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.430 
and of course underground yeah I know
that<00:03:16.090> they<00:03:16.209> are<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:16.750> remote<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.230> far

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
that they are so remote so far

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.220 
that they are so remote so far
underground<00:03:17.680> they<00:03:18.040> are<00:03:18.160> they<00:03:18.430> are<00:03:18.550> very<00:03:18.730> safe

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
underground they are they are very safe

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.690 
underground they are they are very safe
some<00:03:20.230> sometimes<00:03:20.860> they<00:03:21.160> get<00:03:21.310> they<00:03:21.550> get

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
some sometimes they get they get

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.980 
some sometimes they get they get
attacked<00:03:22.000> by<00:03:22.090> water<00:03:22.360> obviously<00:03:22.570> in<00:03:22.810> heavy

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
you're your own expeditions weren't in

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.370 
you're your own expeditions weren't in
any<00:03:30.610> way<00:03:30.940> threatening<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.660> sort<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:31.900> virgin

any way threatening the sort of virgin

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.520 
any way threatening the sort of virgin
nature<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:33.130> these<00:03:33.700> now<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.420> mean<00:03:34.690> that's<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.380> good

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
nature of these now I mean that's a good

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.870 
nature of these now I mean that's a good
point<00:03:35.680> actually<00:03:35.890> we<00:03:36.160> do<00:03:36.370> obviously<00:03:36.700> leave

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
point actually we do obviously leave

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.190 
point actually we do obviously leave
footprints<00:03:37.270> when<00:03:37.600> we<00:03:37.750> when<00:03:37.959> we<00:03:37.990> go<00:03:38.170> through

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
footprints when we when we go through

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.290 
footprints when we when we go through
these<00:03:38.530> caves<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:39.010> we<00:03:39.100> try<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.400> protect<00:03:40.150> that

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
these caves so we try and protect that
