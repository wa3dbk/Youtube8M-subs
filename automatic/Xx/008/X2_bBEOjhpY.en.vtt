topics<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.010> had<00:01:02.129> some<00:01:02.280> other<00:01:02.399> things

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
topics because I had some other things

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.430 
topics because I had some other things
that<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.940> mentioned<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.570> video<00:01:03.719> regarding

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
that I mentioned in that video regarding

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.560 
that I mentioned in that video regarding
the<00:01:04.920> whole<00:01:05.100> orangey<00:01:05.520> system<00:01:05.970> where<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.149> felt<00:01:06.450> it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the whole orangey system where I felt it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.270 
the whole orangey system where I felt it
was<00:01:06.660> broke<00:01:06.899> before<00:01:07.110> households<00:01:07.740> came<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.039> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
was broke before households came out and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.730 
was broke before households came out and
in<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:09.210> hope<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.930> don't<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.140> shit<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.530> but

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
in my hope I don't get shit for this but

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
in my hope I don't get shit for this but
i<00:01:10.770> probably<00:01:10.979> will<00:01:11.190> I<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:11.970> overdid<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
i probably will I think they overdid I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.240 
i probably will I think they overdid I
think<00:01:12.840> things<00:01:13.170> drop<00:01:13.439> way<00:01:13.710> too<00:01:13.770> much<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.189> know

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
think things drop way too much I know

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.800 
think things drop way too much I know
about<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.520> guys<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.180> way<00:01:15.390> too<00:01:15.450> many

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
about you guys but I have way too many

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.899 
about you guys but I have way too many
toys<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.920> too<00:01:17.159> many<00:01:17.280> new<00:01:17.460> things<00:01:17.490> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
toys and too many new things that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.550 
toys and too many new things that
dropped<00:01:18.150> every<00:01:18.479> time<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:18.840> anything<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
dropped every time I do anything in this

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
dropped every time I do anything in this
game<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.820> overboard<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
game that it's a little overboard and I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.020 
game that it's a little overboard and I
kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.659> wish<00:01:21.930> they<00:01:22.080> would<00:01:22.200> maybe<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:23.159> like

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
kind of wish they would maybe like like

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.640 
kind of wish they would maybe like like
orangey<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.450> broke<00:01:24.630> before<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.530> they

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
orangey was broke before I think they

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
orangey was broke before I think they
should<00:01:25.860> fix<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.340> maybe<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.670> halfway<00:01:27.000> where<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
should fix it maybe go halfway where it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.550 
should fix it maybe go halfway where it
is<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.630> now<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> still<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> play
