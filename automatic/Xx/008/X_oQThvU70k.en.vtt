that's<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.390> I'm<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:33.630> sure<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:34.200> will<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.799> octa

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that's it I'm not sure this will be octa

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.390 
that's it I'm not sure this will be octa
core<00:01:35.400> or<00:01:35.880> quad<00:01:36.540> core<00:01:37.200> guys<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> X<00:01:38.130> knows

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
core or quad core guys but the X knows

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.749 
core or quad core guys but the X knows
like<00:01:38.970> which<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> Exynos<00:01:40.369> processor<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.520> right

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
like which the Exynos processor is right

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.999 
like which the Exynos processor is right
and<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.420> am<00:01:42.479> sure<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.720> those<00:01:43.619> countries

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and then I am sure that those countries

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.670 
and then I am sure that those countries
will<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.610> quad<00:01:44.939> core<00:01:45.240> 1<00:01:45.509> clocked<00:01:45.899> at<00:01:46.079> 1.6

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
will get quad core 1 clocked at 1.6

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.270 
will get quad core 1 clocked at 1.6
