it so we're gonna explore this new game
together<00:01:03.949> okay<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.670> see<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.180> we

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
together okay so as you can see here we

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
together okay so as you can see here we
start<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.950> newly<00:01:08.280> created<00:01:08.310> world

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
start in the the newly created world

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.240 
start in the the newly created world
here<00:01:09.180> as<00:01:09.360> our<00:01:10.020> dwarf<00:01:10.470> character<00:01:11.010> which<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
here as our dwarf character which is

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.609 
here as our dwarf character which is
obviously<00:01:11.610> modeled<00:01:12.060> after<00:01:12.530> Simon<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:15.619> again

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
obviously modeled after Simon and again

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.030 
obviously modeled after Simon and again
very<00:01:17.520> basic<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.170> available<00:01:19.320> in

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
very basic as to what is available in

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.969 
very basic as to what is available in
the<00:01:20.310> game<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:21.479> they<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.619> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the game because they you know it's this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.499 
the game because they you know it's this
is<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> pre-alpha<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.939> again<00:01:24.119> we're<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.360> going

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
is a pre-alpha so again we're not going

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
is a pre-alpha so again we're not going
to<00:01:24.570> judge<00:01:25.040> but<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.250> does<00:01:26.400> give<00:01:26.549> us<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> nice

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
to judge but it does give us a nice

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
to judge but it does give us a nice
early<00:01:27.090> look<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:30.860> it's<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:31.950> too<00:01:32.100> bad<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
early look at it so it's not too bad it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.819 
early look at it so it's not too bad it
kind<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.880> basically<00:01:33.150> controls<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:34.020> any

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
kind of it basically controls like any

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.319 
kind of it basically controls like any
MMO<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.460> you've<00:01:35.579> played<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.090> don't<00:01:36.240> like

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
MMO that you've played you don't like

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.300 
MMO that you've played you don't like
will<00:01:36.479> work<00:01:36.659> after<00:01:37.020> whatever<00:01:37.170> WASD<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> control

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
will work after whatever WASD to control

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.640 
will work after whatever WASD to control
around<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.479> hold<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.170> right<00:01:40.619> mouse

minecraft is an inspiration for this
game<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.100> they<00:02:23.220> basically<00:02:23.550> wanted<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:23.970> have

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
game but they basically wanted to have

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.600 
game but they basically wanted to have
like<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.860> Minecraft<00:02:25.860> ffo<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:29.070> but<00:02:29.310> obviously

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
like a Minecraft ffo and I but obviously

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.830 
like a Minecraft ffo and I but obviously
there's<00:02:29.850> more<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.240> than<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.480> that's<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
there's more to it than that that's a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.590 
there's more to it than that that's a
very<00:02:31.020> basic<00:02:31.320> description<00:02:32.040> oh<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.450> jump

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
okay good it get at this whole because

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.110 
okay good it get at this whole because
everything<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.550> know<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.820> block

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
everything is not just you know a block

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.730 
everything is not just you know a block
as<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.570> see<00:02:39.690> there's<00:02:39.870> angles<00:02:40.230> here<00:02:40.470> and

as you can see there's angles here and
that<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.190> got<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.459> say<00:02:41.610> even<00:02:41.880> though<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.120> is

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
that I got to say even though this is

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.430 
that I got to say even though this is
just<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> pre-alpha<00:02:42.720> they've<00:02:42.990> done<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> good<00:02:43.380> job

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
just a pre-alpha they've done a good job

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.670

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
of mapping the game so that when you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.860 
of mapping the game so that when you
break<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.190> block<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.360> know<00:02:48.450> keeps<00:02:48.750> this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
break a block and it you know keeps this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.090 
break a block and it you know keeps this
kind<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.230> angled<00:02:49.740> shape<00:02:50.010> here<00:02:52.100> obviously

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
kind of angled shape here obviously

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.160

development just to come up with the
mountains<00:04:14.909> I've<00:04:15.090> been<00:04:15.209> keeping<00:04:15.359> up<00:04:15.659> with<00:04:15.959> the

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
mountains I've been keeping up with the

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.860 
mountains I've been keeping up with the
dev<00:04:17.759> videos<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.479> stuff<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.660> they've<00:04:18.840> been

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
dev videos and stuff that they've been

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.920 
dev videos and stuff that they've been
making<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.889> was<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.449> no<00:04:21.449> point<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:21.720> 10<00:04:21.840> it

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
making and it was a no point in 10 it

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.050 
making and it was a no point in 10 it
was<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.049> mountain<00:04:22.289> in<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.800> itself<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:23.310> make

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
was a mountain in and of itself to make

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.900 
was a mountain in and of itself to make
the<00:04:24.300> mountains<00:04:24.660> in<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.810> game<00:04:25.370> so<00:04:26.370> I'm<00:04:26.490> happy

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
the mountains in the game so I'm happy

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.790 
the mountains in the game so I'm happy
to<00:04:27.000> see<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.180> they<00:04:27.389> smooth<00:04:28.199> that<00:04:28.410> out<00:04:28.440> and

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
to see that they smooth that out and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.310 
to see that they smooth that out and
again<00:04:29.250> just<00:04:29.699> because<00:04:29.849> this<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.449> pre-alpha

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
again just because this is a pre-alpha

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.089 
again just because this is a pre-alpha
that<00:04:32.250> they<00:04:32.520> wanted<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.880> get<00:04:33.030> released<00:04:33.389> before

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
that they wanted to get released before

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.080 
that they wanted to get released before

multiplayer interactive game like this

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.200

our first possible look at the game and
then<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:39.289> and<00:05:40.289> then<00:05:40.409> there<00:05:40.530> should<00:05:40.680> be<00:05:40.770> one

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
then the and then there should be one

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.460 
then the and then there should be one
more<00:05:41.039> pre-build<00:05:41.729> before<00:05:42.330> at<00:05:42.690> least<00:05:43.110> I<00:05:43.320> don't

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
more pre-build before at least I don't

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.990 
more pre-build before at least I don't
know<00:05:43.530> if<00:05:43.620> they<00:05:43.740> plan<00:05:43.979> on<00:05:44.009> doing<00:05:44.430> more<00:05:44.639> but<00:05:44.970> I

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
know if they plan on doing more but I

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.730 
know if they plan on doing more but I
know<00:05:45.120> like<00:05:45.720> in<00:05:45.870> the<00:05:45.990> Kickstarter<00:05:46.470> it<00:05:46.530> said

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
know like in the Kickstarter it said

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.589 
know like in the Kickstarter it said
that<00:05:46.770> will<00:05:47.009> get<00:05:47.159> at<00:05:47.250> least<00:05:47.280> two<00:05:47.699> pre<00:05:48.210> alphas

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
that will get at least two pre alphas

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.800 
that will get at least two pre alphas
and<00:05:48.630> then<00:05:49.310> after<00:05:50.310> that<00:05:50.340> I<00:05:50.820> should<00:05:51.270> be<00:05:51.479> able<00:05:51.570> to

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
and then after that I should be able to

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.589 
and then after that I should be able to
get<00:05:51.900> access<00:05:52.110> to<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.909> official<00:05:53.909> alpha<00:05:54.360> and

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
get access to the official alpha and

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.430 
get access to the official alpha and

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
then get access to the beta before

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.560 
then get access to the beta before
getting<00:05:58.919> access<00:05:59.190> to<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.430> game<00:05:59.580> itself<00:05:59.880> so<00:06:00.000> I'm

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570
