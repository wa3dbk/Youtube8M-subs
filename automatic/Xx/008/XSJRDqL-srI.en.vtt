it's<00:00:21.550> amazing<00:00:22.300> how<00:00:22.420> great<00:00:22.690> this<00:00:22.900> works<00:00:23.140> you

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
it's amazing how great this works you

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.160 
it's amazing how great this works you
can<00:00:24.010> do<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:24.190> entire<00:00:24.310> mouth<00:00:24.910> with<00:00:25.390> one<00:00:25.630> Isolite

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
can do the entire mouth with one Isolite

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.470 
can do the entire mouth with one Isolite

upper and lower left upper and lower

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.200 
upper and lower left upper and lower
right<00:00:28.720> you'll<00:00:29.380> get<00:00:29.500> almost<00:00:30.190> virtually<00:00:30.640> 100%

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
right you'll get almost virtually 100%

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.240 
right you'll get almost virtually 100%
retention<00:00:31.840> because<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.259> mouth<00:00:32.439> stays<00:00:32.800> so<00:00:33.040> dry

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
retention because the mouth stays so dry

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.900 
retention because the mouth stays so dry
so<00:00:33.790> let's<00:00:34.030> look<00:00:34.480> into<00:00:34.690> isolate<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:35.910> sealants

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
so let's look into isolate and sealants

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.140 
so let's look into isolate and sealants
what<00:00:37.750> we're<00:00:37.870> doing<00:00:38.079> right<00:00:38.230> now<00:00:38.289> is<00:00:39.150> eight

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
what we're doing right now is eight

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.960 
what we're doing right now is eight
sealants<00:00:40.750> in<00:00:41.440> about<00:00:41.920> five<00:00:42.130> or<00:00:42.280> six<00:00:42.430> minutes<00:00:42.670> if

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
sealants in about five or six minutes if

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.340 
sealants in about five or six minutes if
we<00:00:43.000> were<00:00:43.180> doing<00:00:43.300> for<00:00:43.570> sealants<00:00:43.960> we<00:00:44.020> do<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.290> in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
we were doing for sealants we do it in

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.810 
we were doing for sealants we do it in
under<00:00:44.530> five<00:00:44.739> minutes<00:00:44.770> but<00:00:45.640> with<00:00:45.730> the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
under five minutes but with the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.040 
under five minutes but with the
additional<00:00:46.120> curing<00:00:46.480> time<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:46.780> we're<00:00:46.900> going

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
additional curing time that we're going

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.450 
additional curing time that we're going
to<00:00:47.140> need<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.470> would<00:00:47.560> probably<00:00:47.680> be<00:00:47.920> five<00:00:48.130> to<00:00:48.250> six

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
to need it would probably be five to six

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.770 
to need it would probably be five to six
minutes<00:00:48.610> to<00:00:48.790> deviate<00:00:49.120> sealants<00:00:49.510> we're<00:00:49.630> going

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
minutes to deviate sealants we're going

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.630 
minutes to deviate sealants we're going
to<00:00:49.870> be<00:00:49.960> doing<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.829> first<00:00:51.130> and<00:00:51.310> second-year

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
wide for me put the ice slide in slips

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.350 
wide for me put the ice slide in slips
in<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:57.190> all<00:00:57.310> of<00:00:57.460> about<00:00:57.670> three<00:00:58.120> or<00:00:58.149> four

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
in and all of about three or four

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.729 
in and all of about three or four
seconds<00:00:58.750> and<00:00:58.809> just<00:00:58.960> have<00:00:59.079> her<00:00:59.170> closed<00:00:59.380> down<00:00:59.559> on

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
seconds and just have her closed down on

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.130 
seconds and just have her closed down on
that<00:00:59.920> good<00:01:02.340> simultaneous<00:01:03.340> we<00:01:03.430> were<00:01:03.520> gonna<00:01:03.670> be

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
that good simultaneous we were gonna be

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.590 
that good simultaneous we were gonna be
aspirating<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.229> upper<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.619> lower<00:01:05.710> arches<00:01:06.600> at

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
aspirating the upper and lower arches at

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.959 
aspirating the upper and lower arches at
the<00:01:07.750> same<00:01:07.960> time<00:01:08.340> we're<00:01:09.340> using<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.790> cheap

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
the same time we're using the cheap

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.670 
the same time we're using the cheap
retractor<00:01:10.509> so<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.780> camera<00:01:11.170> can<00:01:11.200> get<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.500> better

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
retractor so the camera can get a better

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.940 
retractor so the camera can get a better
view<00:01:11.770> okay<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.960> here<00:01:14.170> we<00:01:14.200> go<00:01:14.470> let's<00:01:14.500> start<00:01:14.770> our

belt on clear is now applied the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.030 
belt on clear is now applied the
maxillary<00:02:53.280> teeth<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.959> left<00:02:55.230> hand<00:02:55.469> side<00:02:55.739> is

maxillary teeth the left hand side is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.640 
maxillary teeth the left hand side is
now<00:02:56.370> about<00:02:56.909> eight<00:02:57.540> seconds<00:02:58.109> away<00:02:58.230> from<00:02:58.349> being

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
now about eight seconds away from being

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.399 
now about eight seconds away from being
totally<00:02:58.890> completed<00:03:02.629> and<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.840> trick<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.260> this

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
totally completed and the trick to this

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.039 
totally completed and the trick to this
procedure<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.189> now<00:03:05.370> swishing<00:03:06.000> sides<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.959> want

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
procedure is now swishing sides you want

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.709 
procedure is now swishing sides you want
to<00:03:07.170> make<00:03:07.290> sure<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.560> patient<00:03:07.889> does<00:03:08.040> not<00:03:08.069> close

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
to make sure the patient does not close

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.869 
to make sure the patient does not close
open<00:03:09.719> real<00:03:10.049> wide<00:03:10.079> for<00:03:10.260> me<00:03:10.590> cuz<00:03:11.430> if<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.639> closed

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
open real wide for me cuz if you closed

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.369 
open real wide for me cuz if you closed
it<00:03:11.909> tastes<00:03:12.239> yucky<00:03:12.659> then<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.019> want<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.230> rinse

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
it tastes yucky then you want to rinse

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.170 
it tastes yucky then you want to rinse
out<00:03:13.620> again<00:03:13.889> so<00:03:14.099> we<00:03:14.250> just<00:03:14.400> switch<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.700> right<00:03:15.000> on

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
out again so we just switch it right on

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.379 
out again so we just switch it right on
over<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.349> can<00:03:16.500> see<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:16.829> how<00:03:16.950> easily<00:03:17.389> the

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
over and you can see just how easily the

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.940 
over and you can see just how easily the
ice<00:03:18.569> light<00:03:18.870> switches<00:03:19.200> from<00:03:19.379> one<00:03:19.469> side<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.920> the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
ice light switches from one side to the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:33.240 
ice light switches from one side to the
other<00:03:20.040> close<00:03:20.639> down<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:20.969> rest

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.400 

there's<00:03:33.850> two<00:03:34.320> there's<00:03:35.320> three

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.470 

31<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:41.000> 30<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:43.580> can<00:03:43.640> see<00:03:43.910> how<00:03:44.000> efficiently

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
31 and 30 you can see how efficiently

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.990 
31 and 30 you can see how efficiently
the<00:03:45.110> etch<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.410> all<00:03:45.590> evacuated<00:03:48.610> this<00:03:49.610> is<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.760> nice

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
the etch is all evacuated this is a nice

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:12.460 
the etch is all evacuated this is a nice
frosted<00:03:50.510> appearance<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.080> teeth

eight six and six seven minutes I don't

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.330 
eight six and six seven minutes I don't
know<00:04:15.380> what<00:04:15.500> our<00:04:15.590> active<00:04:15.860> time<00:04:16.040> was<00:04:16.190> on<00:04:16.340> that

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
know what our active time was on that

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.480 
know what our active time was on that
we're<00:04:19.340> done<00:04:20.829> we're<00:04:21.829> gonna<00:04:21.920> compare<00:04:22.400> and

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
we're done we're gonna compare and

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.680 
we're done we're gonna compare and
contrast<00:04:22.580> right<00:04:23.000> now<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.210> cotton<00:04:23.570> roll

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
contrast right now to cotton roll

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.950 
contrast right now to cotton roll
isolation<00:04:24.320> what<00:04:24.650> we<00:04:24.740> have<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:25.040> do<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.720> with

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
isolation what we have to do and with

isolation what we have to do and with
cotton<00:04:27.350> rolls<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.650> would<00:04:27.860> just<00:04:28.070> be<00:04:29.200> able<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.290> do

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
triangles in there just look at all the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.740 
triangles in there just look at all the
moisture<00:04:34.370> contamination<00:04:34.790> way<00:04:35.240> back<00:04:35.450> there

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
fighting fighting rolls and shaking even

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.590 
fighting fighting rolls and shaking even
if<00:04:52.430> I<00:04:52.490> make<00:04:52.700> it<00:04:52.730> real<00:04:53.000> equal<00:04:53.480> with<00:04:53.630> using<00:04:54.290> this

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
if I make it real equal with using this

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.270 
if I make it real equal with using this
you<00:04:56.600> can<00:04:56.780> see<00:04:56.960> I<00:04:56.990> can<00:04:57.470> really<00:04:57.650> only<00:04:57.740> do<00:04:58.100> these

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
you can see I can really only do these

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.880 
you can see I can really only do these
two<00:04:58.520> key<00:04:58.730> for<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:58.940> same<00:04:59.150> time<00:04:59.510> with<00:05:00.230> my<00:05:00.380> system

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
two key for the same time with my system

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.930 
two key for the same time with my system
the<00:05:01.040> way<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.520> lot<00:05:01.760> more

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
the way and this is a lot more

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.720 
the way and this is a lot more
cumbersome<00:05:02.919> so<00:05:03.919> you<00:05:04.010> just<00:05:04.190> kind<00:05:04.370> of<00:05:04.430> compare

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
cumbersome so you just kind of compare

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.250 
cumbersome so you just kind of compare
that<00:05:04.910> then<00:05:05.150> I'm<00:05:05.270> done<00:05:05.450> with<00:05:05.480> there<00:05:05.690> then<00:05:05.990> I<00:05:06.110> got

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
that then I'm done with there then I got

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.659 
that then I'm done with there then I got
to<00:05:06.380> go<00:05:06.470> up<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.770> upper<00:05:06.919> then<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.250> got<00:05:07.430> to<00:05:07.520> take

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
to go up to the upper then I got to take

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.010 
to go up to the upper then I got to take
out<00:05:07.790> all<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.000> cotton<00:05:08.330> rolls<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:08.660> it's<00:05:08.750> around

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
out all the cotton rolls and it's around

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.810 
out all the cotton rolls and it's around
me<00:05:09.169> to<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.380> other<00:05:09.530> side<00:05:09.860> it's<00:05:10.130> just<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.640> much

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
me to the other side it's just that much

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:22.220 
me to the other side it's just that much
harder

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:32.329
