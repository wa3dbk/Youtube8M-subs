00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.570
 and now I want to tell you how 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.620
 open ports on your router for 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.450
 create server 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.939
 why do android this mustache 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:19.670
 smartphones but because this is the first part 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.760
 my video I will of course do on 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.640
 computer itself is incomprehensible to someone 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.740
 but the first part is the first part of the video. 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.590
 by creating your own microsoft server. 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.540
 for this we go to the browser and enter 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.010
 such ip 192. 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:42.440
 160 8.1.1 or service or 0.1 for me 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.990
 1.1 someone may be 0.1 someone else 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.120

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.270

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.510

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.960

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:19.390
