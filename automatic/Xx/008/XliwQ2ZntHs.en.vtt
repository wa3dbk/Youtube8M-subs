00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.410
 obtain beneficial effects for the 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.460

 underground saturating it with 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:49.170
 salt and mineral microparticles is a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.590
 technique born and developed in europe 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.480
 from the east - more than 150 years ago 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.420
 by various countries and that came to the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.610
 our hand with these pioneers we 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.230
 move into a curious place where 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.390
 to guess that salt is the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.420
 star star cracovia south of 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.910
 poland in the year 1836 a doctor who 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.350
 called happy Bukovsky discovered that the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.789
 miners who worked in the mines of 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.250
 salt did not suffer from any problem 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.660
 respiratory and decided to investigate because 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.640
 was and he realized it was because of 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.190

 the boundaries between the medical and the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.250
 aesthetic they tell us that their 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.950
 effects are notorious in all kinds of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.800
 respiratory conditions such as asthma 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.869
 bronchitis and sinusitis 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 aesthetic for people who have 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.860
 psoriasis atopic dermatitis 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.510
 and the very dry skin what salt does 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.830
 is to use the natural hydration of the 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.810
 skin from the inside out strengthens 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.480
 also the immune system reduces 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.660
 stress exhaustion and prevents the

 children from three months to men and 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.660
 women of different ages there is a 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.790
 machine that what the generator does is 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.320
 crush the salt inject the inside of 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.240
 the micro particles very very 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.150
 little ones that are breathable so that 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.070
 reach the bottom of the lungs or 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.080
 superficial surface layers of the

 the person is during the 50 minutes 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.400
 within the saturation within the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.180
 saturation that comes here apple then 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.040
 be relaxed with a background music

 we abandoned a place as special as 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.000
 this with the skin rejuvenated the mood 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.000
 renewed a pleasant flavor sauce
