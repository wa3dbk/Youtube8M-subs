00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.120
 the fair is among the fruits of major economic interest in the world according to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.160
 with the unit of the temperate climate embrapa its production can become one of the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
 main attractions of brazil in the coming decades 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.820
 the country matters 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.140
 85 percent of the fruit of countries like Argentina jean and others 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.659
 the reimbursement of Brazil has adequate Guinea-Bissau conditions 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.710
 for the development of culture 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.720
 thinking about it the municipal city hall of santana of the deliverance 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.590
 published matter 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.260
 developed the first municipal fruit program 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.210
 all technical feasibility studies 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.270
 of the municipality for the production of fair was is we brought by technicians of the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.770
 embrapa at the time bonifÃ¡cio nakasone and cinnamon doctor 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.210
 which turned a great potential of mainly in the climatic condition 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.580
 of the region to be a major producer of 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.860
 we brought 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.229
 several cultivars normalized on Monday of which some adaptations 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.250
 was not possible due to the weather 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 He is the manager. He started it. 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.220
 made in several 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.600
 to experiments on various types of soil and climate and general conditions 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.880
 exhibitions of roderick in a series of factors there so that we make a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.170
 beginning of the summit we can mention that the threat made with a suite is a fruit 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.410
 that you have been walking 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.090
 very well I understand production and acceptance by the vultures 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.610
 by the kind of deceased film accuracy in their favor 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.280
 here we have some others too 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.700
 forget the important change of the act so the are caetano did not rain not 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.690
 we can see a plant that with excellent opportunity 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.320
 as a result of 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.699
 annoyed by the producer 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.579
 this year as has been the case with other 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:18.019
 a year despite the opportunity said excellent 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.709
 production with regard to the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.889
 the commercial part is very compromised 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.949
 everybody knows we have 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:31.439
 passed by very serious problems until s only rain very high temperatures 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.699
 we can travel 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.369
 fruits being damaged 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:41.679
 season - insects it is difficult to control pest control then begins to 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:42.479
 seem 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.669
 in this program the problem 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:50.159
 Whose brand gives fruit in consequence dodo show 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.250
 the entire family property on April 24 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.740
 eight hectares where the main income is fruit production with 13 such 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.879
 destined for 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.120
 in the eighth year of production it is possible to analyze the potential and 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.399
 obstacles of culture 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.799
 first place 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.999
 the biggest difficulty we are finding 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:16.139
 it's the question 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.879
 roads 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.079
 because it is a plant is a 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.930
 it is a perishable fruit 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.049
 delicate 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.469
 you have to take the utmost care for the transportation 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.159
 other difficulties is 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.129
 it is the question of 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.629
 only missing helinho that this year was the poet is near 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.330
 the rain did not stop us working 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.830
 no no let no other law make what should and could have been done 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:48.470
 Another obstacle is the market because it is not accustomed to the format 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.599
 consumption of varieties 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.739
 in relation to the points 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.039
 positive 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.449
 heikki 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.359
 is a very productive plant 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.219
 an 'extraordinary taste' 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.949
 a fruit became a singer this occurring 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.069
 it remained 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.379
 photo reproduction also her 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.699
 it produces 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.069
 very well 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.790
 some experiences have already been 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.379
 dp a tree produce 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.009
 one hundred and a few pounds 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.789
 1 but seeing the age calculation of 20 tons 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.720
 in three entities we can reach a conclusion 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.410
 in productivity in smaller area the use of the fair 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.669
 This is very interesting for who 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:33.339
 is small
