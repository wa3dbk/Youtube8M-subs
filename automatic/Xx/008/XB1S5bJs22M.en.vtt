00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.979
 then how nice is the weather at 60 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:08.080
 minutes waiting on the field 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.209
 very tasty I have to say I have 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.660
 road and looked forward to for the first again 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.190
 minutes and when the time comes 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.960
 yes you can also best describe it 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.760
 but I was rather delighted to just 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.350
 we really want to play a real game 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.060
 getting used to after nine months without a competition 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.320
 yes that certainly 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.570
 Of course I do n't always have two weeks 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.060
 trained but this is quite different 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.949
 then a real match and also 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.169
 today noticed that this is indeed quite 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.610
 get used to him he is glad that 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.690
 hug that minute that can make because 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.089
 I need it 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.710
 how many second actually go well 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.800
 for me the most important thing is me 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.019
 minutes in the bony make and and and that 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.699
 happened today and surprisingly me 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.129
 therefore not too much sticking 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.199
 I have to make myself now and hopefully understand 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.969
 also join you at the first 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.050
 You also feel selection too 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.420
 I can imagine playing football 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.510
 which you just have not been feeling 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.979
 yes yes yes but that sure and then it 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.690
 come back to the first question then is 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.530
 it's nice to really have a game 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.759
 play what goes on somewhere late and each other 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.280
 it is the promise I am still 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.020
 very happy to 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 play my real game how are you going 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.650
 then to 60 minutes of the field 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.299
 Anne broken or not well I have to be his side 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.340
 quite heavy legs 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.750
 I have always got through well 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.729
 training and last week also 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.820
 tests that also point you in and out 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.330
 then you will see that the match 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.380
 play otherwise is rarely play long 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.180
 has been injured then the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.280
 competition also different and and in that 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.220
 phase I am now but I notice that I 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.560
 i i have to feel better and better and better 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.700
 to work to my real fitness will also 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.049
 never before experienced that you were nine 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.160
 months no feeding I have 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.130
 football so you don't know how long 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.350
 that takes you to be truly fit again 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.210
 no ok look exactly for that matter 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.140
 I do n't really have a reference no but me 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.360
 I feel that it was good it is 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.729
 not yet but he must be of course 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.110
 but I do notice that the last thing is one 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.970
 I think with new week or two 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.950
 I'm Feyenoord and that's what I like 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.860
 involves a lot of steps and for 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.810
 me personally it is now make me 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 my own fat time to work and to 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.830
 it the trainer as difficult as possible 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.510
 you have created a recurring suze 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.950
 few duels have to miss it looks now 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.049
 what kind of feyenoord have you seen 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.180
 is your impression 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.310
 well it's one 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.670
 results have been positive and me 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.950
 think it is important at this stage 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.209
 when the past and look was so 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.130
 it is not always the same size but you come 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.209
 what fino for one thing 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.769
 think enough said about that 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.690
 between the goals may not of the but 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.820
 what i also said at the start is that i 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.459
 certainly potential in half to one 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.350
 to turn at the top and there 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.650
 I stay with you see a lot and a lot 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.300
 difference with two ago for example 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.820
 yes of course there are 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.110
 It is the day for almost 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.780
 impossible to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.320
 teams from years back together 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.630
 compare 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.310
 and so I actually do that and they are 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.830
 also not quite few i love me 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.560
 mainly concerned with what is now one 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.480
 what I have said before that 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.620
 material so good enough to be at the top 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.360
 to turn 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.440
 when you really add yourself to it 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.720
 connect first or something for that 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.100
 dog technical snap an idiot 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.840
 well i think there is a dialogue 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.120
 going to do is in 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.910
 today I have taken another step towards 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.800
 my and my fit out and then we will 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.940
 the actually in consultation with the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.190
 technical staff indeed 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.030
 view when I go again 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.320
 can connect 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.750
 yes but you dare not say or 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.240
 vitesse whether that is already feasible 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.920
 no yes look extra money must also be one 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.120
 consultation 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.560
 I am glad that I can do today 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.430
 able to play and for the rest I want 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.430
 cannot go too far ahead
