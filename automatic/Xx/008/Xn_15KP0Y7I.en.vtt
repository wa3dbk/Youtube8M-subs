00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.179 
for instance I had to go in and lay down
highlighting<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.930> hair<00:01:43.189> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
highlighting all that hair and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
highlighting all that hair and
individually<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.060> stipple<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.570> hair<00:01:45.810> in

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
individually kind of stipple the hair in

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.069 
individually kind of stipple the hair in
if<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.950> got<00:01:47.159> lazy<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.850> de<00:01:48.090> Santa<00:01:48.420> whatever<00:01:48.810> it

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
if I got lazy and de Santa whatever it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.289 
if I got lazy and de Santa whatever it
just<00:01:49.170> only<00:01:49.439> added<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> few<00:01:50.189> highlights<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
just only added a few highlights it

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
just only added a few highlights it
really<00:01:51.840> which<00:01:52.200> showed<00:01:52.500> there<00:01:53.040> would<00:01:53.189> have

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
really which showed there would have

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
really which showed there would have
showed<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> end<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:55.140> result

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
showed up at the end and the result

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.490 
showed up at the end and the result
would<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.799> been<00:01:55.979> nearly<00:01:56.430> as<00:01:56.670> nice<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.500> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
would have been nearly as nice so you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.719 
would have been nearly as nice so you
know<00:01:58.649> when<00:01:58.860> you're<00:01:58.979> laying<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.310> color<00:01:59.549> like

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
know when you're laying a color like

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.459 
know when you're laying a color like
widen<00:02:00.180> you're<00:02:00.299> doing<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> big<00:02:00.810> piece<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
widen you're doing a big piece like this

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
widen you're doing a big piece like this
it's<00:02:02.130> important<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> rush<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> piece

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
it's important not to rush to the piece

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.870 
it's important not to rush to the piece
not<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> only<00:02:04.200> put<00:02:04.619> detail<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
whole piece and the second is just as

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.210 
whole piece and the second is just as
important<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.989> third<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:19.770> important

the fourth and every foundation must

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.210 
the fourth and every foundation must
must<00:02:23.550> be<00:02:23.730> laid<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.709> good<00:02:25.709> as<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> lay<00:02:26.069> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
must be laid as good as you lay the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.699 
must be laid as good as you lay the
first<00:02:26.400> one<00:02:26.670> because<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.360> final<00:02:27.780> result<00:02:28.140> it's

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
first one because the final result it's

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.250 
first one because the final result it's
gonna<00:02:28.920> show<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.400> final<00:02:29.670> result<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.050> it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
gonna show in the final result and so it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.229 
gonna show in the final result and so it
doesn't<00:02:31.440> help<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.739> be<00:02:31.950> lazy<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.610> gotta<00:02:33.000> stay

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239
