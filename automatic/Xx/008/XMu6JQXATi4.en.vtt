00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
thaddeus his response was something

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.810 
thaddeus his response was something
along<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.500> lines<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.979> we've<00:02:02.250> already<00:02:02.549> had

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
along the lines of we've already had

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
along the lines of we've already had
that<00:02:03.030> before<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:04.079> wouldn't<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:04.439> fit<00:02:04.799> into

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that before it wouldn't really fit into

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.889 
that before it wouldn't really fit into
the<00:02:05.219> style<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.969> fast-paced<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.869> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the style the fast-paced is a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.050 
the style the fast-paced is a
battlefield<00:02:07.380> hardline<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.670> map<00:02:08.849> just

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
battlefield hardline and the map just

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.270 
battlefield hardline and the map just
would<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.509> work<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.379> does<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.560> bf3<00:02:11.009> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
would not work out as it does in bf3 and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.830 
would not work out as it does in bf3 and
bf4

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
bf4

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.290 
bf4
and<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.170> being<00:02:13.700> understandable<00:02:14.700> completely

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and that being understandable completely

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.630 
and that being understandable completely
I've<00:02:15.510> decided<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.260> recommend<00:02:16.680> another<00:02:17.310> map

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I've decided to recommend another map

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.699 
I've decided to recommend another map
and<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> tweeted<00:02:18.690> at<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.230> he<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.470> saying

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
and so I tweeted at that he is saying

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.800 
and so I tweeted at that he is saying
well<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.370> understand<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.180> Metro<00:02:21.599> has<00:02:21.660> been

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
well I understand that Metro has been

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.420 
well I understand that Metro has been
done<00:02:22.019> before<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.769> probably<00:02:22.980> wouldn't<00:02:23.280> fit

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
done before and it probably wouldn't fit

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.830 
done before and it probably wouldn't fit
in<00:02:23.459> but<00:02:23.790> what<00:02:23.910> about<00:02:24.090> something<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.569> no

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
in but what about something like no

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.380 
in but what about something like no
shark<00:02:25.140> canals<00:02:25.530> or<00:02:25.800> grand<00:02:26.099> bazaar<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.849> then

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
shark canals or grand bazaar and then

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.420 
shark canals or grand bazaar and then
after<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.780> tweeted<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.290> at<00:02:28.500> him<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.860> really<00:02:29.160> was

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
after I tweeted that at him I really was

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.070 
after I tweeted that at him I really was
expecting<00:02:29.910> no<00:02:30.090> response<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.690> all<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.870> just

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
expecting no response at all I just

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.119 
expecting no response at all I just
thought<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.410> would<00:02:31.470> be<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> good<00:02:31.769> idea<00:02:31.830> for

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
thought it would be a good idea for

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.490 
thought it would be a good idea for
people<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.700> think<00:02:32.970> about<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.450> let<00:02:33.510> sink<00:02:34.260> in

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
people to think about and let sink in

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.900 
people to think about and let sink in
and<00:02:34.739> he<00:02:34.890> responded<00:02:35.250> almost<00:02:35.670> immediately

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
and he responded almost immediately

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.570 
and he responded almost immediately
saying<00:02:36.599> what<00:02:37.470> would<00:02:37.560> be<00:02:37.650> some<00:02:37.830> good<00:02:38.010> maps<00:02:38.310> if

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
saying what would be some good maps if

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.640 
saying what would be some good maps if
we<00:02:38.730> were<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.150> bring<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.599> into<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> American

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
we were to bring that into the American

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.830 
we were to bring that into the American
Los<00:02:40.860> Angeles<00:02:41.430> Florida<00:02:41.910> type<00:02:42.150> theme<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.750> then

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
Los Angeles Florida type theme and then

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.660 
Los Angeles Florida type theme and then
he<00:02:42.930> started<00:02:43.230> suggesting<00:02:43.410> some<00:02:44.069> names<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.519> his

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
he started suggesting some names of his

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.600 
he started suggesting some names of his
own<00:02:44.940> for<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> no-show<00:02:46.319> canals<00:02:46.709> type<00:02:47.010> map<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
own for a no-show canals type map and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.309 
own for a no-show canals type map and
they<00:02:47.910> weren't<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.360> joking<00:02:48.870> names<00:02:49.110> there

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
they weren't just joking names there

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.960 
they weren't just joking names there
were<00:02:49.380> actual<00:02:49.769> serious<00:02:50.250> names<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.819> could

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
were actual serious names that could

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.839 
were actual serious names that could
make<00:02:51.209> sense<00:02:51.540> for<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.750> map<00:02:51.989> like<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.530> so

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
make sense for a map like that so

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.949 
make sense for a map like that so
obviously<00:02:53.849> he<00:02:54.060> was<00:02:54.180> taking<00:02:54.569> my<00:02:54.690> tweet

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
obviously he was taking my tweet

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.690 
obviously he was taking my tweet
seriously<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.739> he<00:02:55.799> wasn't<00:02:55.980> taking<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.610> as

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
seriously and he wasn't taking it as

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.030 
seriously and he wasn't taking it as
just<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.060> joke<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.599> I<00:02:58.349> thought<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.860> was<00:02:59.010> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
just a joke and I thought that was a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.979 
just a joke and I thought that was a
very<00:02:59.280> good<00:02:59.610> idea<00:02:59.819> like<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.420> thought<00:03:00.629> that<00:03:00.840> he

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
very good idea like I thought that he

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.809 
very good idea like I thought that he
was<00:03:01.079> actually<00:03:01.620> reading<00:03:01.890> my<00:03:02.160> tweet<00:03:02.430> for<00:03:02.670> what

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
was actually reading my tweet for what

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.119 
was actually reading my tweet for what
it<00:03:02.910> was<00:03:03.150> an<00:03:03.590> understanding<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.799> would<00:03:04.980> be

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
it was an understanding that it would be

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.759 
it was an understanding that it would be
nice<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.670> see<00:03:05.700> these<00:03:05.970> maps<00:03:06.299> come<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.410> future

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
nice to see these maps come in a future

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.039 
nice to see these maps come in a future
DLC<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.459> how<00:03:08.610> they<00:03:08.760> could<00:03:09.030> potentially<00:03:09.750> fit

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
DLC and how they could potentially fit

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.890 
DLC and how they could potentially fit
into<00:03:10.459> battlefield<00:03:11.459> hardline<00:03:11.879> if<00:03:12.090> carried<00:03:12.750> out

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
into battlefield hardline if carried out

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.319 
into battlefield hardline if carried out
properly<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:14.040> started<00:03:14.940> thinking<00:03:15.269> about

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
properly so I started thinking about

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.569 
properly so I started thinking about
ways<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.750> we<00:03:16.110> can<00:03:16.290> actually<00:03:16.709> see<00:03:16.889> these<00:03:17.190> maps

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
ways that we can actually see these maps

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.460 
ways that we can actually see these maps
come<00:03:17.910> into<00:03:18.329> battlefield<00:03:18.750> hardline<00:03:19.079> how<00:03:19.290> they

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
come into battlefield hardline how they

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.650 
come into battlefield hardline how they
would<00:03:19.590> fit<00:03:19.889> and<00:03:20.160> when<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:20.940> was<00:03:21.090> looking<00:03:21.420> at<00:03:21.480> no

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
would fit and when I was looking at no

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.110 
would fit and when I was looking at no
shark<00:03:21.930> canals<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.500> decided<00:03:22.829> well<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.400> lot<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
shark canals I decided well a lot of the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.270 
shark canals I decided well a lot of the
story<00:03:24.540> mode<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.019> campaign<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.680> maps<00:03:25.889> in

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
story mode and campaign and maps in

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.910 
story mode and campaign and maps in
battlefield<00:03:26.819> hardline<00:03:27.180> take<00:03:27.480> place<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:28.049> Los

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
battlefield hardline take place in Los

Angeles or in Florida or somewhere

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.479 
Angeles or in Florida or somewhere
around<00:03:31.230> those<00:03:31.620> areas<00:03:31.650> where<00:03:32.130> there<00:03:32.370> are

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
around those areas where there are

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.240 
around those areas where there are
beaches<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.120> water<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.720> obviously<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:34.920> areas

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
like that there are shipment harbors

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.440 
like that there are shipment harbors
very<00:03:37.859> similar<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.489> likes<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.970> no<00:03:39.180> shark

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
very similar to the likes of no shark

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.990 
very similar to the likes of no shark
canals<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:40.109> they<00:03:40.560> could<00:03:40.739> easily<00:03:40.980> base<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
canals that they could easily base the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.129 
canals that they could easily base the
map<00:03:42.180> off<00:03:42.419> of<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.980> could<00:03:44.130> easily<00:03:44.310> take<00:03:44.669> a

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
map off of so that could easily take a

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.319 
map off of so that could easily take a
shipment<00:03:46.139> Harbor<00:03:46.560> from<00:03:46.799> Los<00:03:47.040> Angeles<00:03:47.700> or<00:03:47.910> from

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
shipment Harbor from Los Angeles or from

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.110 
shipment Harbor from Los Angeles or from
Florida<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.019> then<00:03:49.500> kind<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:49.919> redesign<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.970> and

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
Florida and then kind of redesign it and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.240 
Florida and then kind of redesign it and
redesign<00:03:51.599> the<00:03:51.750> layout<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.650> in<00:03:52.799> order<00:03:53.069> to

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
redesign the layout of it in order to

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.580 
redesign the layout of it in order to
resemble<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.269> no<00:03:54.630> shock<00:03:54.870> canals<00:03:55.290> and

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
resemble that of no shock canals and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.949 
resemble that of no shock canals and
then<00:03:56.160> we<00:03:56.340> would<00:03:56.489> have<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.910> basic<00:03:57.450> no<00:03:57.690> shark

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
then we would have a basic no shark

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.349 
then we would have a basic no shark
canals<00:03:58.349> map<00:03:58.620> for<00:03:59.220> battlefield<00:03:59.669> hardline<00:04:00.120> and

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
canals map for battlefield hardline and

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.569 
canals map for battlefield hardline and
I<00:04:00.419> can<00:04:00.780> honestly<00:04:00.810> see<00:04:01.440> no<00:04:01.650> way<00:04:01.919> that<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.340> map

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
I can honestly see no way that that map

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.879 
I can honestly see no way that that map
would<00:04:02.940> not<00:04:03.180> work<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.750> battlefield<00:04:04.530> hardline<00:04:04.859> I

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
would not work in battlefield hardline I

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.440 
would not work in battlefield hardline I
think<00:04:05.190> people<00:04:05.310> would<00:04:05.549> love<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:05.970> there<00:04:06.389> have

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
think people would love it there have

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.180 
think people would love it there have
been<00:04:06.569> all<00:04:06.780> kinds<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:07.260> crime<00:04:07.590> movies<00:04:07.950> in<00:04:08.099> the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
been all kinds of crime movies in the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.220 
been all kinds of crime movies in the
past<00:04:08.430> where<00:04:08.730> people<00:04:09.030> have<00:04:09.209> broken<00:04:09.900> into

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
past where people have broken into

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.099 
past where people have broken into
Harbor<00:04:10.859> bays<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.370> then<00:04:11.940> stolen<00:04:12.359> things<00:04:12.750> from

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
Harbor bays and then stolen things from

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.659 
Harbor bays and then stolen things from
the<00:04:13.230> massive<00:04:13.650> shipping<00:04:13.980> container<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.549> they

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
the massive shipping container so they

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.520 
the massive shipping container so they
could<00:04:14.819> easily<00:04:15.120> make<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.840> game<00:04:16.019> modes<00:04:16.289> make

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
could easily make the game modes make

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.740 
could easily make the game modes make
sense<00:04:16.889> on<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.190> map<00:04:17.849> like<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.599> would

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
sense on a map like that and it would

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.289 
sense on a map like that and it would
all<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.229> would<00:04:19.380> just<00:04:19.620> be<00:04:20.010> awesome<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.820> general

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
all it would just be awesome in general

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.630 
all it would just be awesome in general

Chinese<00:04:33.600> market<00:04:33.930> have<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.410> similar<00:04:34.740> layout<00:04:35.280> to

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
Chinese market have a similar layout to

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.879 
Chinese market have a similar layout to
that<00:04:35.669> of<00:04:35.850> Grand<00:04:36.120> Bazaar<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:37.080> could<00:04:37.290> easily<00:04:37.530> be

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
that of Grand Bazaar it could easily be

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.680 
that of Grand Bazaar it could easily be
done<00:04:38.070> that<00:04:38.340> could<00:04:38.460> easily<00:04:38.729> make<00:04:39.030> some<00:04:39.240> amazing

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
done that could easily make some amazing

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.140 
done that could easily make some amazing
maps<00:04:39.930> by<00:04:40.229> doing<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.490> think<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.880> lot<00:04:41.910> of

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
maps by doing so and I think a lot of

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.270 
maps by doing so and I think a lot of
people<00:04:42.270> who<00:04:42.780> at<00:04:42.990> this<00:04:43.199> point<00:04:43.320> in<00:04:43.620> time<00:04:43.830> are<00:04:43.889> not

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
people who at this point in time are not

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.460 
people who at this point in time are not
very<00:04:44.639> keen<00:04:45.150> on<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.630> thought<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:45.870> battlefield

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
very keen on the thought of battlefield

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.620 
very keen on the thought of battlefield
hardline<00:04:46.949> would<00:04:47.820> give<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.210> a<00:04:48.270> second<00:04:48.600> chance

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
hardline would give it a second chance

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.510 
hardline would give it a second chance
they'd<00:04:49.139> see<00:04:49.350> some<00:04:49.560> old-school<00:04:49.979> maps<00:04:50.370> from

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
they'd see some old-school maps from

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.520 
they'd see some old-school maps from
battlefield<00:04:51.030> 3<00:04:51.270> in<00:04:51.389> battle<00:04:51.660> food<00:04:51.780> for<00:04:52.050> that

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
battlefield 3 in battle food for that

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.740 
battlefield 3 in battle food for that
they<00:04:52.740> might<00:04:52.949> have<00:04:53.070> loved<00:04:53.540> remastered<00:04:54.540> and

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
they might have loved remastered and

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.990 
they might have loved remastered and
reinvented<00:04:55.680> in<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.979> cops<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.460> robbers<00:04:56.790> theme

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
reinvented in the cops and robbers theme

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000 
reinvented in the cops and robbers theme
of<00:04:57.150> battlefield<00:04:57.540> hardline<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.199> potentially

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
of battlefield hardline and potentially

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.860 
of battlefield hardline and potentially
pick<00:04:59.220> up<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.520> game<00:04:59.729> and<00:04:59.970> end<00:05:00.120> up<00:05:00.270> liking<00:05:00.539> it

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
pick up the game and end up liking it

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.390 
pick up the game and end up liking it
and<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.139> think<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.919> that<00:05:02.070> would<00:05:02.160> be<00:05:02.220> an

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
and I think that that would be an

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.070 
and I think that that would be an
awesome<00:05:02.610> selling<00:05:03.240> point<00:05:03.510> for<00:05:03.570> battlefield

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
awesome selling point for battlefield

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.320 
awesome selling point for battlefield
hardline<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.590> game<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:04.889> already<00:05:05.130> having<00:05:06.090> so

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
hardline the game is already having so

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.629 
hardline the game is already having so
much<00:05:06.479> success<00:05:06.690> as<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.320> is<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.830> it's<00:05:08.280> already

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
much success as it is and it's already

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.850 
much success as it is and it's already
working<00:05:08.940> great<00:05:09.479> if<00:05:09.750> they<00:05:10.169> were<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:10.410> bring<00:05:10.650> in

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
working great if they were to bring in

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.370 
working great if they were to bring in
some<00:05:11.130> maps<00:05:11.400> for<00:05:11.789> those<00:05:11.990> battlefield<00:05:12.990> fans

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
some maps for those battlefield fans

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.990 
some maps for those battlefield fans
that<00:05:13.949> have<00:05:14.100> been<00:05:14.250> playing<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.639> for<00:05:14.669> a<00:05:14.820> long

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
that have been playing it for a long

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190

these bigger maps with more vehicles

these bigger maps with more vehicles
just<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.639> one<00:05:23.910> DLC<00:05:24.510> or<00:05:24.539> something<00:05:25.020> or<00:05:25.139> is<00:05:25.229> a
