00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.950
 Minecraft on command block 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.019

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.970
 and here is this team allows us 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.100
 make unusual signs and you ask 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.199
 what is its unusual here here 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.840
 written to give out diamonds and if we click 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.679
 on it, right-click you will hear 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.910
 distinctive click sound this nameplate 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.369
 will disappear and we will appear in the inventory 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.560

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.780
 more here samand spelled garden 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.640
 block and here are the coordinates of these 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.620
 bedroom nameplate coordinates above 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.560
 command block I think everyone knows it 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.790
 further here maynkavt villus that is it 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.130
 this plate itself and the wolf will spawn 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.500
 that is, it will be remembered exactly on 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.750
 the wall further here goes the four and it 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.150
 denotes where it will be at 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.380
 us either here where it is either 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.050
 here here here on the sides 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.990
 its where i stand four denote a 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.360
 that she is a trio here is a two 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.270
 here and units this here here on 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.700
 blocks and replace means what if 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.280
 here there will be a block instead 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.740
 labels it click on the button then 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.570
 this label will replace this one this block 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.270
 disappear and let's take this one 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.030
 the most important team and so we went to 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.580
 the most important team and here and figure 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.470
 Alex 2 is written, that is, it 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.780
 The second line gave: 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.840
 and in quotes here we have written again 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.700
 same curly brace here and 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.130
 opposite slash and this hear will 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.830
 always register when will 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.960
 some word stand out quotes something 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.390
 have we go opposite slash 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.850
 Further quotation is the word which in 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.050
 quotes is again 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.850
 opposite hear and again quotes 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.250
 I will not pay them any further 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.620
 attention as it will be spelled out 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.049
 almost everywhere why is it to 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.140
 the command was fully executed if not 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.100
 will then the command will not work further 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.549
 we have a team 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.799
 action as well as quotes away goes c: 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.539
 quotes and written word wounds 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:14.010
 commands again in quotes further , and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.890
 here the value goes to scrap again: 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.920
 and here comes the team here goes the usual 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.430
 slash again in quotes and place 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.290
 all random click i have this sound 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.750
 which we hear when clicking on this 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.230
 nameplate and here doggy i mean this 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.569
 the sound will hear everything and goes on 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.840
 again here's the opposite 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.810
 hear the quote and then we go again 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.159
 same closing brace here too 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.069
 goes, and then goes the text and that is it 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.709
 we have the word that is a 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.079
 the second line that is this first this 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.889
 there was a team that performed gave 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.900
 text and in quotes: and here again in 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.209
 quotes the word that we will have 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.629
 written on the second line is me 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.239
 issue further we have a comma 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.329
 text 3 that is for the team all 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.180
 the event response is repeated here 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.750
 there is this label will respond to 1 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.540
 cry 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.690
 and these commands will be executed 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.750
 alternately here is an action and everything repeats 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.470
 like the previous team i.e. 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.900
 second line and further here again 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.440
 shaft and here only changes 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.889
 team and here team blog site and this 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.430
 the block spun air that is this air 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:40.290
 team with us and removes this tablet and 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.440
 next we have the text and here is the diamond 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.590
 written and then goes the last line 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.859
 here again clicks and action wounds 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.949
 teams in general and here is the next team 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:56.579
 gif doggy p daimon ie this one 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:59.400
 the team gives us a diamond and here you are 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.819
 you can see there is no text that is 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.790
 you can observe is not written here 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.280
 text on the fourth line 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.009
 but the team still runs well and 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.409
 let me show you how this team 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:16.750
 prescribed to make it clearer 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.910
 I will write it on the example of the first line 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.230
 and to do this we must highlight 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.680
 here is this team 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.140
 text 2 that is the second line we are here 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.240
 Here we select everything and follow who does not know 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.390
 how to do this we hold down shift 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.440
 we get to any place and clamp 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.420
 arrow right or left and we have to 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.470
 copy this yes this one 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.170
 comma and press kontrol 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.360
 further back to the front and this one 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.330
 here's a brace we need to remove 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.630
 here we put a comma and before the comma we 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.000
 should insert this command and further 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.930
 instead of issuing we write any text on 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.140
 the first line for example i will write here 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.500
 test and further we change the command here and 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.200
 plays out a for example on any other self 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.210
 I will change to again the command where 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.190
 and here I have prescribed gif dog piracy 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.640
 that is, we will be given 1 com 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:22.360
 Then again, we take and return 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.320
 ahead and here are the places and text 2 we put 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.979
 text 1 and here we must put 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.370
 brace 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:32.140
 click finish click on the button and 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.510
 gaga see us appears here 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:38.350
 inscription test and when you click on this 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:41.530
 here's a tablet nose issued a simple diamond 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.460
 and this sign is removed accompanying 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:48.430
 and sound and further to apply this 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.770
 team in the future to build 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.930
 Any cards on the passage and put 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.240
 such plates we just clamp the control 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.100
 and click on the mouse wheel as you 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.880
 see in my inventory appeared 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.490
 sign we can put them here 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.830
 and when you click on the plate like me to you 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.180
 showed earlier we issued a diamond in 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.820
 can you build some kind of map on 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.880
 passage for example pan tight these 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.990
 plaques of some places and this player 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.150
 must find all these signs and then in 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.790
 the end will stand for example a funnel in 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.580
 which you should throw diamonds and if 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.160
 you found all the diamonds then you won 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.110
 either you can make some kind of prize that is 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.090
 it is limited to all yours 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.490
 fantasy for example, you can break only 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.920
 for example, which is 6 and for wool 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.290
 is this tablet and a player like me already 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.840
 said earlier must find all the signs and 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.670
 at the end throw for example a diamond or 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.370
 redstone or what you put there and in 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.860
 funnel and then some breeze will be given and 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.560
 that's all i think you liked this 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.660
