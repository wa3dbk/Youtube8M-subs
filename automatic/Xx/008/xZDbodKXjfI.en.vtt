the time on it checklist manifesto shows
us<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:23.960> power<00:00:24.140> of<00:00:24.380> using<00:00:24.529> checklist<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:25.279> break

thus<00:00:30.410> we<00:00:30.560> can<00:00:30.679> automate<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.369> redundant<00:00:31.789> tasks
