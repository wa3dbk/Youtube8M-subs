00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.039 

we're<00:00:01.290> getting<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.829> stage<00:00:02.280> in<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.669> trip

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:03.049 
we're getting to the stage in the trip

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.420 
we're getting to the stage in the trip
where<00:00:04.049> we're<00:00:04.290> starting<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.890> get<00:00:05.040> familiar

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
where we're starting to get familiar

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.480 
where we're starting to get familiar
with<00:00:05.580> our<00:00:05.910> oxygen<00:00:06.779> systems<00:00:07.319> people<00:00:08.069> have<00:00:08.220> lots

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
with our oxygen systems people have lots

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.180 
with our oxygen systems people have lots
of<00:00:08.929> misconceptions<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.080> find<00:00:10.380> about<00:00:10.620> how

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
of misconceptions I find about how

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.700 
of misconceptions I find about how
oxygen<00:00:11.670> helps<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.540> how<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.809> doesn't<00:00:13.200> help<00:00:13.440> I

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
oxygen helps and how it doesn't help I

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.519 
oxygen helps and how it doesn't help I
think<00:00:14.670> people<00:00:14.969> back<00:00:15.299> home<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.320> mind

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
think people back home have it in mind

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.950 
think people back home have it in mind
sometimes<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.760> put<00:00:18.000> oxygen<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.660> and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
sometimes that you put oxygen on and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.769 
sometimes that you put oxygen on and
it's<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:20.250> bringing<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:21.000> down<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> beach

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it's like bringing you down to the beach

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.179 
it's like bringing you down to the beach
it<00:00:22.650> certainly<00:00:23.420> helps<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.019> doesn't<00:00:25.189> bring

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
it certainly helps but it doesn't bring

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.839 
it certainly helps but it doesn't bring
it<00:00:26.340> down<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.849> some<00:00:27.150> easy<00:00:27.510> equivalent<00:00:28.439> height

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
it down to some easy equivalent height

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.030 
it down to some easy equivalent height
oxygen<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.029> awkward<00:00:30.689> as<00:00:30.900> anything<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.830> have

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
oxygen is awkward as anything to have

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.880 
oxygen is awkward as anything to have
this<00:00:32.250> mask<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:33.059> which<00:00:33.780> affects<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.800> ability

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
this mask on which affects your ability

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.620 
this mask on which affects your ability
to<00:00:35.430> see<00:00:35.640> where<00:00:35.790> you're<00:00:35.910> putting<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.239> feet

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to see where you're putting your feet

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.850 
to see where you're putting your feet
why<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.710> use<00:00:37.739> oxygen<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.899> well<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.140> won't

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
why do we use oxygen then well I won't

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.500 
why do we use oxygen then well I won't
be<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> first<00:00:41.340> person<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.000> said<00:00:42.270> this

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
be the first person to have said this

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.010 
be the first person to have said this
but<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.770> your<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.280> car<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.629> runs

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
but you know your your car it runs

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.830 
but you know your your car it runs
without<00:00:46.289> oil<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.030> runs<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.329> lot<00:00:48.480> farther

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
without oil but it runs a lot farther

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
without oil but it runs a lot farther
and<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> lot<00:00:49.469> better<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:50.370> oil<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:52.520> it's<00:00:53.520> it's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
and a lot better with oil so it's it's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.410 
and a lot better with oil so it's it's
similar<00:00:54.710> one<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.250> great<00:00:56.460> benefits<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
similar one of the great benefits on a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.290 
similar one of the great benefits on a
mountain<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:59.730> keeps<00:01:00.090> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
mountain like this one is it keeps you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.020 
mountain like this one is it keeps you
warmer<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:02.309> don't<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:02.910> that's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
warmer and I don't think that's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.740 
warmer and I don't think that's
appreciated<00:01:03.480> enough<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> bad<00:01:05.220> job<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
appreciated enough what a bad job the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.660 
appreciated enough what a bad job the
blood<00:01:07.020> does<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.740> keeping<00:01:08.130> your<00:01:08.280> extremities

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
blood does at keeping your extremities

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.590 
blood does at keeping your extremities
warm<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:09.900> fingers<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.380> toes<00:01:11.299> oxygen<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.540> a

warm your fingers and toes oxygen is a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.340 
warm your fingers and toes oxygen is a
huge<00:01:13.320> help<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.070> way<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:15.180> helps<00:01:15.420> with<00:01:16.170> your

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
huge help that way it helps with your

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.160 
huge help that way it helps with your
decision-making<00:01:17.009> process<00:01:17.930> not<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.049> be

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
decision-making process not to be

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.280 
decision-making process not to be
getting<00:01:19.530> oxygen<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.310> brain<00:01:20.930> he's<00:01:21.930> too

getting oxygen to your brain he's too

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.499 
getting oxygen to your brain he's too
much<00:01:22.710> better<00:01:23.040> job<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.400> thinking<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
much better job of thinking that

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.859 
much better job of thinking that
shouldn't<00:01:24.900> come<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.110> too<00:01:25.409> much<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.830> surprise

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
shouldn't come as too much of a surprise

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.679 
shouldn't come as too much of a surprise
before<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> summit<00:01:28.350> bid<00:01:29.210> one<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> things

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that will do since I'm trying to guide

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.690 
that will do since I'm trying to guide
is<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.780> practice<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.500> oxygen<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.430> place

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
is will practice with oxygen the place

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.480 
is will practice with oxygen the place
that<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.090> normally<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:38.070> side<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.430> the

the summit bit there is going to be a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
lot of learning we're going to turn it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.200 
lot of learning we're going to turn it
