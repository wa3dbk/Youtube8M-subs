00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 before starting a little warning they 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.020
 I say that they had to update my pc to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.700
 a more modern version which means 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 that I've lost my files again and 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.320
 renders what I think would explain the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.360
 fact that he is no longer a mutant and if 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.460
 they wonder why I just do not 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.609
 Other renders of mutant gives me laziness 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.830
 so simple what I also believe that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.390
 would explain that my assistants 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 nor are they mutants of 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.250
 now on but good for 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.840
 make up for that I came up with the great 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.870
 idea that ling ling was my avatar 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.489
 secondary hello youtube friends no 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.050

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.649

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.649
 rwe video 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.560
 I see it and I do not think so I have reached the goal 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:04.080
 that everything that intends to reach 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.360
 a goal to which I thought never come 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.710
 a goal that marks my beginning of what 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.510
 whole newbie to what whole 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.730
 professional 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.470
 a goal that I still can not believe that 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.470
 meet and that goal is 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.259

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.470
 I have a thousand subscribers and I still can not 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.350
 believe until I think it will give me a strike 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.410
 low cardiac you need attention 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.290

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.700
 during this year 2012 and beginning of 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.560
 2013 I'm too excited to know there's 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.259
 thousand people around the world to whom 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.479

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.179
 too easy to make laugh hahaha 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.150
 but I can only do this so 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.070
 when it was already in the 970 subscribers 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.530
 I started thinking about a special for 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.450
 thank you for this great achievement but as 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.550
 my damn brain began to fail in 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.320
 those moments do not occur to me 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.020
 nothing better than just making one 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.420
 questions section 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.670

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.370
 done this but well my brain is like 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.040

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.450

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.820
 original to carry the simple ones 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.090

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.670

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.440

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.750
 questions they have to ask in the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.910
 comments on this video if they ask 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.670
 in another video on the channel or by message 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.890

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.440
