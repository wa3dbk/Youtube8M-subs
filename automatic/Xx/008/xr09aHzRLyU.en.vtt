 Hello dear today I bid you 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.700
 Welcome back to one 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.320
 outfit diary by tuner 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.650
 or is it just a single one 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.710
 outfit yes and you can see that they are 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.220
 dressed all in pink today 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.130
 she has from maxi mohr this on eur or 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.570
 I want you to know this year too 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.849
 not as you would call it 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.249
 that's just such a short on the man 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.060
 in the middle can knot can make 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:39.980
 there are these pink frogs on it and 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.560
 fittingly, she wears a sun hat 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.410
 and I personally think so 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.950
 beware very cute indeed 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.100
 this is of course from maxi mohr 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.710
 Wearing sure bracelet shows major and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.040
 Although that is the jazz pearl magic 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.120
 Dear Jesse also has a youtube channel 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.550
 and I link this all to mine 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.890
 infobox we bought that and there 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.900
 Since then she is wearing her clothes 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.950
 These bracelets themselves and I think 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.899
 she is super cute 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.560
 yes and jona contributes to a few more 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:15.979
 Simply socks health my 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.859
 maus that's her outfit what she is 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.569
 stop wearing it when we're out in the 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.759
 sun or just warm 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.399
 Temperatures are around noon or 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.399
 in the afternoon time she really wears 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.729
 only that but never 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:35.420
 is missing is such a light puncto 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.369
 from eden and as you know we love 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.439
 These brands I use only and 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.200
 but these jewelry cloths and indeed 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.939
 that this model towels are the stop 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.789
 so very big, I think they are 80 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.149
 cm x 80 cm and you can see that already can 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.590
 then you also use great about them 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.569
 to cover it up a bit and still 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.459
 to protect a bit from the sun and 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.579
 she knows where it is just totally years 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.990
 around and yes she has somehow easy 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.719
 I like the feeling in the stroller 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.159
 For example, we have something for you too 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.079
 we always have such cloths in it 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.990
 lie and as I said I love the 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.700
 simply the quality is great and yes that 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.860
 So then everything is what we are so 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.480
 have hot temperatures and now 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.410
 but I'll show you in connection 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.030
 the same 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.700
 what we wear because we are so in the morning 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.840
 whole songs or until late in the evening 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.730
 outside we are there where it is with us 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.780
 really fresh and she needs it 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.560
 definitely something to drÃ¼berziehen yes 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.560
 and that's her overall you 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.600
 wears when we are at something cooler 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.880
 Temperatures outside are so in the evening 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.800
 or mix in the morning I think 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.780
 it's just really that's it 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.330
 cools down extremely fast then someday 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.560
 where you sit in the evening like times 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.680
 longer outside if it's so nice now 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.130
 and then the baby will be natural 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.560
 dressed appropriately and this overall 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.670
 Here is the Danish brand U Bahn 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.140
 I do not know if we could do it 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.600
 In any case, that's what you know 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.430
 most typical motive what extent has so 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.410
 this elephant printed here and so 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.630
 the poor of the babys then the russian of 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.850
 Elephant I think that's super sweet too 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.530
 his hood is just orange gray 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.830
 striped are even for guys in 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.300
 green gray striped such reserves 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.980
 Of course you can be great at them 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.330
 simply close with zipper 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.980
 and I think the really cute and the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.170
 is also such a very thin terry 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.420
 fabric therefore I think that just for 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.190
 the summer days and something really good 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.590
 suitable as he is now really 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.480
 nothing for a cold day but for the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.850
 in any case this season 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.920
 absolutely great and I think sees 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.230
 just totally cute with the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.959
 stripes and with the elephant is just 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.880
 something special not everyone has and 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.640
 Jonah obviously also finds him completely 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.100
 really great and we would have it then 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.720
 I already finished her outfit 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.220
 hope you've liked their content 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.910
 again a little insight into ours 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.230
 hook up the wardrobe now 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.850
 Let's go and then I hope that we 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.830
 see us again next time 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.940
 and we say goodbye to you 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.940
