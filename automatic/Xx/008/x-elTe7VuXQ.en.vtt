mah<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.180> great<00:03:23.330> for<00:03:23.450> heavy<00:03:23.780> vaping<00:03:24.320> comes

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
mah this is great for heavy vaping comes

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.130 
mah this is great for heavy vaping comes
with<00:03:25.310> its<00:03:25.459> own<00:03:25.580> atomizer

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.020 

and<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.770> comes<00:03:31.920> with<00:03:32.069> some<00:03:32.310> standard<00:03:32.790> tank

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
and it comes with some standard tank

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.500 
and it comes with some standard tank
parts<00:03:33.620> as<00:03:34.620> well<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:35.459> each<00:03:35.610> kit<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:38.510> two

parts as well in each kit and two
batteries<00:03:39.990> with<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.560> you'll<00:03:40.709> never<00:03:40.830> be

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
batteries with that so you'll never be

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.000 
batteries with that so you'll never be
left<00:03:41.250> without<00:03:41.400> one<00:03:41.700> just<00:03:41.970> like<00:03:42.120> all<00:03:42.300> our<00:03:42.480> kids

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
left without one just like all our kids

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.400 
left without one just like all our kids
we<00:03:44.010> then<00:03:44.160> move<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:45.180> indulgence<00:03:45.540> which

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
we then move on to the indulgence which

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.780 
we then move on to the indulgence which
is<00:03:46.590> our<00:03:46.740> largest<00:03:47.150> model<00:03:48.150> in<00:03:48.390> terms<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.720> size

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
is our largest model in terms of size

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.180 
is our largest model in terms of size
the<00:03:50.790> batteries<00:03:51.240> you<00:03:51.660> get<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.709> truth<00:03:53.010> than

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
the batteries you get to that truth than

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.510 
the batteries you get to that truth than
1000<00:03:53.820> mah<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:55.230> they're<00:03:55.590> inserted<00:03:56.040> into<00:03:56.220> this

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
1000 mah and they're inserted into this

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.420 
1000 mah and they're inserted into this
device<00:03:56.940> here<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.930> two<00:04:01.250> batteries<00:04:02.250> that

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
device here so the two batteries that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.780 
device here so the two batteries that
are<00:04:02.459> 1000<00:04:03.150> mah<00:04:03.570> each<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.230> mean<00:04:04.560> amount<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.250> 1000

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
are 1000 mah each I mean amount to 1000

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.640 
are 1000 mah each I mean amount to 1000
mah<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.450> battery<00:04:06.810> capacity<00:04:07.320> which<00:04:07.500> is

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
mah of battery capacity which is

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.270 
mah of battery capacity which is
obviously<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.130> lot<00:04:08.780> these<00:04:09.780> are<00:04:09.989> six<00:04:10.230> bolt<00:04:10.590> as

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
obviously a lot these are six bolt as

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.479 
obviously a lot these are six bolt as
well<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.900> we<00:04:13.170> only<00:04:13.290> stock<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:14.040> six<00:04:14.250> fault

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
well so we only stock the six fault

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.690 
well so we only stock the six fault
model<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.810> then<00:04:16.200> come<00:04:16.440> with<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.620> high<00:04:17.459> voltage

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
model and then come with a high voltage

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.960 
model and then come with a high voltage
analyzer<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.840> low<00:04:18.989> resistance<00:04:19.500> analyzer

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970
