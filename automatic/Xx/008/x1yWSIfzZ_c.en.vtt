00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
was also told by you not to have things

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.170 
was also told by you not to have things
other<00:01:08.740> buildings<00:01:09.159> touching<00:01:09.549> other<00:01:09.670> buildings

other buildings touching other buildings

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.670 
other buildings touching other buildings
because<00:01:10.479> that<00:01:10.689> would<00:01:10.869> be<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.020> very<00:01:11.320> bad<00:01:11.619> thing

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
because that would be a very bad thing

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.020 
because that would be a very bad thing
indeed<00:01:12.130> apparently<00:01:12.549> there's<00:01:12.700> some<00:01:12.759> sort<00:01:12.939> of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
indeed apparently there's some sort of

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.060 
indeed apparently there's some sort of
splash<00:01:13.329> damage<00:01:13.539> that<00:01:13.840> goes<00:01:13.990> on<00:01:14.170> there<00:01:14.380> so<00:01:14.860> that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
splash damage that goes on there so that

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.410 
splash damage that goes on there so that
was<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.219> really<00:01:15.369> good<00:01:15.520> bit<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.670> advice<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.359> what

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
was a really good bit of advice and what

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.940 
was a really good bit of advice and what
I've<00:01:16.539> done<00:01:16.659> here<00:01:16.719> as<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.049> can<00:01:17.079> see<00:01:17.170> is<00:01:17.590> I've

I've done here as you can see is I've
made<00:01:18.130> sure<00:01:18.159> that<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.549> headquarters<00:01:19.229> have

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229

up this way and kind of up around like
that<00:01:53.950> but<00:01:54.159> as<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.369> say<00:01:54.670> there<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.270> cover<00:01:55.570> there

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
that but as I say there is cover there

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.959 
that but as I say there is cover there
and<00:01:56.069> obviously<00:01:57.069> this<00:01:57.280> it's<00:01:57.609> not<00:01:57.700> going<00:01:57.880> to

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
and obviously this it's not going to

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.819 
and obviously this it's not going to
happen<00:01:58.030> on<00:01:58.179> this<00:01:58.329> side<00:01:58.569> there's<00:01:58.840> plenty<00:01:59.799> of

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
happen on this side there's plenty of

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.739 
happen on this side there's plenty of
cover<00:02:00.159> up<00:02:00.369> here<00:02:00.579> to<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.600> other<00:02:01.719> things

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
cover up here to one of the other things

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.050 
cover up here to one of the other things
I<00:02:01.990> really<00:02:02.140> like<00:02:02.380> about<00:02:02.439> this<00:02:03.399> setup<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.999> it

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
I really like about this setup and it

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.309 
I really like about this setup and it
has<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.390> did<00:02:04.539> take<00:02:04.689> me<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.810> little<00:02:04.929> while<00:02:05.049> to

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
has it did take me a little while to

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.080 
has it did take me a little while to
actually<00:02:05.380> get<00:02:05.649> figured<00:02:05.859> out<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.159> put<00:02:06.909> in

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
actually get figured out is I put in

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.469 
actually get figured out is I put in
these<00:02:07.420> mines<00:02:08.050> here

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
these mines here

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.540 
these mines here
that's<00:02:10.140> kind<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.619> my<00:02:10.769> last<00:02:11.039> defense

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
that's kind of like my last defense

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.490 
that's kind of like my last defense
really<00:02:11.790> same<00:02:12.239> goes<00:02:12.599> with<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.930> mall<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.319> am

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
really same goes with the mall so am

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
really same goes with the mall so am
with<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.799> cannon<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.310> cannon<00:02:15.090> obviously

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
with the cannon that cannon obviously

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.270 
with the cannon that cannon obviously
needs<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.629> be<00:02:15.690> leveled<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.260> little<00:02:16.470> bit<00:02:16.650> but

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
needs to be leveled up a little bit but

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.770 
needs to be leveled up a little bit but
you<00:02:17.700> know<00:02:17.790> those<00:02:17.970> mines<00:02:18.209> will<00:02:18.390> hopefully<00:02:18.540> take

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
you know those mines will hopefully take

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.839 
you know those mines will hopefully take
out<00:02:18.930> any<00:02:19.110> little<00:02:19.560> peons<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.220> get<00:02:20.370> too<00:02:20.580> close

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
out any little peons that get too close

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.940 
out any little peons that get too close
to<00:02:21.299> my<00:02:21.900> base<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.349> really<00:02:22.560> happy<00:02:22.739> with<00:02:22.860> that

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
to my base and really happy with that

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.850 
to my base and really happy with that
one<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> things<00:02:23.430> I'm<00:02:23.640> less<00:02:23.940> happy<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.510> is

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
one of the things I'm less happy with is

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.119 
one of the things I'm less happy with is
how<00:02:25.860> I'm<00:02:26.220> doing<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:27.000> wood<00:02:27.299> resources

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
how I'm doing for wood resources

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.869 
how I'm doing for wood resources
currently<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.160> don't<00:02:29.400> actually<00:02:29.549> have<00:02:29.849> a

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
currently I don't actually have a

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.789 
currently I don't actually have a
resource<00:02:30.330> base<00:02:30.599> which<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.870> really<00:02:31.290> really

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
resource base which is really really

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.380 
resource base which is really really
frustrating<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.760> let's<00:02:32.910> go<00:02:32.970> into<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.180> little

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
frustrating so let's go into a little

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.759 
frustrating so let's go into a little
battle<00:02:33.780> see<00:02:34.260> if<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.860> can<00:02:35.959> see<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.049> we<00:02:37.079> can<00:02:37.379> go

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
battle see if we can see if we can go

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.350 
battle see if we can see if we can go
ahead<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.129> get<00:02:38.459> ourselves<00:02:38.579> more<00:02:38.970> resources

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
ahead and get ourselves more resources

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.119 
ahead and get ourselves more resources
this<00:02:39.540> might<00:02:39.750> be<00:02:39.870> useful<00:02:40.019> we<00:02:40.409> can<00:02:40.560> scout<00:02:40.920> this

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
this might be useful we can scout this

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.839 
this might be useful we can scout this
resource<00:02:41.549> base<00:02:41.819> for<00:02:42.260> they've<00:02:43.260> got<00:02:43.410> stone<00:02:43.860> and

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
resource base for they've got stone and

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.449 
resource base for they've got stone and
I'm<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.569> give<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.810> quick<00:02:45.930> attack<00:02:46.459> I'm

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
I'm going to give it a quick attack I'm

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.250

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
these things out but I might actually

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.280 
these things out but I might actually
have<00:03:33.459> one<00:03:33.579> here<00:03:33.879> rather<00:03:34.120> excitingly<00:03:34.959> that's

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290
