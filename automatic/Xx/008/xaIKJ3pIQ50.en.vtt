00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.650 
of fish are dying and take them out so
when<00:02:20.400> they<00:02:20.520> die<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.030> at<00:02:21.210> night<00:02:21.420> they're

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
when they die and at night they're

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.630 
when they die and at night they're
probably<00:02:22.050> mold<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.620> when<00:02:23.100> they<00:02:23.190> mold<00:02:23.460> that

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
probably mold and when they mold that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.030 
probably mold and when they mold that
spreads<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> all<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> other<00:02:24.630> fish<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
spreads to all the other fish and that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.520 
spreads to all the other fish and that
kills<00:02:26.310> them<00:02:26.550> really<00:02:27.270> fast<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.170> even

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
kills them really fast you know even

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.470 
kills them really fast you know even
when<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.040> see<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.340> green<00:02:29.640> stuff<00:02:30.000> they<00:02:30.210> start

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
when you see that green stuff they start

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.210 
when you see that green stuff they start
forming<00:02:30.780> their<00:02:31.050> skin<00:02:31.320> they're<00:02:31.890> pretty<00:02:32.100> much

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
forming their skin they're pretty much

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.200 
forming their skin they're pretty much
dead

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
dead

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.060 
dead
you<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.660> try<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> move<00:02:34.260> into<00:02:34.410> another<00:02:34.560> tank<00:02:34.980> to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
you can try to move into another tank to

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.120 
you can try to move into another tank to
try<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.280> save<00:02:35.550> them<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:36.780> chances<00:02:37.530> are<00:02:37.830> within

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
try to save them but chances are within

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.860 
try to save them but chances are within
24<00:02:38.760> hours<00:02:38.790> they<00:02:39.209> will<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.630> dead<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:42.060> don't<00:02:42.750> have

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
24 hours they will be dead I don't have

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.280 
24 hours they will be dead I don't have
a<00:02:42.900> filter<00:02:43.200> itself<00:02:43.800> in<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.250> yet<00:02:44.490> but<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.990> do

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
a filter itself in here yet but I do

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.070 
a filter itself in here yet but I do
have<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.530> spitter<00:02:46.830> here<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.080> frog

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
have a spitter here this is a frog

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.840 
have a spitter here this is a frog
spitter<00:02:51.170> turn<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.400> see<00:02:53.700> how

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
spitter turn it on and you can see how

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.620 
spitter turn it on and you can see how
it<00:02:53.970> works<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.730> wire<00:02:56.970> running<00:02:57.209> all<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
it works I have a wire running all the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:18.110 
it works I have a wire running all the
way<00:02:57.660> down<00:02:57.959> here<00:02:58.910> into<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:16.910> probably<00:03:17.910> can't

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
way down here into this probably can't

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.530 
way down here into this probably can't
see<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.300> fish<00:03:19.190> when<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.280> water<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.640> moving

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
see the fish when the water is moving

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:39.510 
see the fish when the water is moving
like<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:23.360> this<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:36.980> coffee<00:03:37.980> plant

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520
