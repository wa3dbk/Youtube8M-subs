00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello friends today is the topic 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.299
 long-term exposure and more specifically 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.870
 how to get light trails from cars 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.870
 generated 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 we are now on the parking deck 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.619
 of icc grounds in berlin and we have 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.510
 Here's a really great one 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.369
 directly on the tv tower and below 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.690
 we have a really good one underneath 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.090
 but also in the streets 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.370
 evenings and by that we have 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.070
 extremely good pictures with not of the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.080
 cars long exposure which means 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.629
 ever long-term exposure that is so 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.040
 a bit yes not defined so me 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.870
 say long-term exposure are included 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.769
 about a second exposure if 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.330
 one reports a second long picture 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.159
 and that's exactly what you want to try today 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.199
 we have learned in the last video 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.480
 the longer you reported more blurred 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.580
 become moving objects from the front of 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.780
 camera and that's what we do 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.550
 to use today because we want this 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.870
 cars times with their traces of light 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.100
 photographing at the end you can see this 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.630
 cars themselves not anymore but only 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.520
 not yet spurt that is the white ones 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.580
 not from the front and the red lights 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.890
 from behind and this effect I want 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.659
 Show you now more exactly you can 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.680
 now the location to see the more accurate 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.700
 we actually take pictures when 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.799
 So you see in the background the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.440
 radio tower and besides we have here 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.510
 an extremely horny big crossing where I am 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.160
 from all sides the cars come and 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.350
 Accordingly, we as many as possible 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.549
 get lights 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.229
 you can see us in the background right now 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.939
 is also winning in addition so 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.970
 the good of our pictures right in the 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.920
 additionally give tension 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.119
 and therefore think that will happen 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.830
 maybe really fat results 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.049
 So we got here from now 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.460
 one from the right drive the cars from 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.369
 on the left, the cars come from the front 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.020
 the cars, the bible accordingly from 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.220
 So we really have quite a few 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.539
 nothing here in different directions 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.369
 and it will look really fat right away 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.690
 what do you really need for everything? 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.030
 long-term exposure for a natural 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.369
 a tripod so that your camera 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.800
 really give a fixed viewpoint 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.179
 can and especially if the longer 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.289
 then he can not expose any 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.600
 be a blur in it 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.940
 so here's a nice sturdy one 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.160
 tripod then I have here a 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.930
 Remote release with cable 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.000
 which is also available without cables depending on 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.580
 which would again there are from 15 Euros 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.410
 I stay with 10 euro no idea 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.390
 you can buy them in the photo shop 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.610
 and it just has the advantage i can 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.769
 now put this fund to the camera 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.120
 and can be easily accessed from further afield 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.680
 camera operate without which I can 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.650
 must touch and thus no 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.690
 shaky pictures show me otherwise 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.680
 I have a relative now 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.030
 wide-angle lens on it is also quite 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.280
 nice because then we stop more of that 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.739
 So, depending on how you get on the street 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.859
 I would like that now but I will 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.390
 here is pretty far away objectively around 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.519
 just get as much on it as possible 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.480
 comes to the settings of the picture 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.609
 you see here now i have now 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.109
 just the attitude here on it 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.950
 like photography, of course, manually 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.780
 Mode so we all three components 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.640
 the camera itself can determine 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.579
 I'm taking pictures with a blind 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.310
 8 to as much manages to get 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.750
 in the picture and six seconds so you see 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.400
 already six seconds relatively long 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.500
 illuminated and in these six seconds 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.660
 should have as many cars as possible then 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.340
 I drive the picture too long I have the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.870
 iso-cash do not know you can see 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.420
 here is not why is with me on 200 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.880
 That's the way your parents can 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.800
 what the standard iso 200 at canon users 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.630
 Is it more like iso 100 so possible 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.340
 always keep low so will have 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.880
 you the optimal quality in yours 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.520
 pictures in it 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.319
 also lost format later on then 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.239
 computer possibly the image adjustment 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.750
 still to be able to do without quality 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.670
 loses 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.450
 So always in raw format 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.450
 taking photos 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.400
 eight seconds are illuminated and we are 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.750
 now represent some are still a 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.459
 Pieces too bright so maybe power 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.069
 the whole thing a bit darker 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.540
 you see here already that we from 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.069
 the weather is good in any case 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.470
 we are here of course now 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.610
 some in there but not yet 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.750
 perfect moment 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.209
 there must be a little bit now 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.310
 when the cars start driving exactly 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.079
 The traffic light phases pay close attention to what you do 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.490
 really has as many cars on it 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.620
 So just a little bit before 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.900
 watch and then you get too 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.130
 really good results 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.750
 that was already us again 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.400
 Now go home and see the pictures 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.080
 work a little and the best 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.080
 results are still in connection 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.610
 if you liked the video and you 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.290
 have made such pictures then 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.080
 She sends me the following 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.940
 address stefan as shepherd foto bild.de 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.710
 and then I will get the best pictures 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.570
 maybe in the next video then 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.510
 involve and of course speak with 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.760
 your link to it and I will not stay 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.960
 left to say is celebrated as coach 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.160
 her thumbs up subscribed to main 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.100
 channel for more videos 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.300
 I'm really pleased about it 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.750
 everyone like me is happy about everyone 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.480
 comment 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.740
 It motivates me to continue and 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.150
 otherwise not much is left 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.240
 say as and have fun while 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.240
 try out
