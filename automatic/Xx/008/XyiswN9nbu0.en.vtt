00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.870
 very good to all welcome to the altar 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.180
 skin this time it project 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.219
 master ji and let's start by shouting 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.929
 war between the Spanish versions 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.700
 Latin and English 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.700
 precisely in the order mentioned 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.750
 the dance 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 d 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.020
 ah 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.170
 let's go to the skills 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.690
 let's start with the cuca 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.690
 the w 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.430
 Light 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.040
 and the r 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.880
 death 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.850
 the critical hits of the character 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.340
 i 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.340
 the record of recovery 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.379
 I want to make it clear that the latter 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.150
 section is a purely opinion 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.069
 personal and does not have to be relevant 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.880
 towards your opinion or your future 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.430
 purchase 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.410
 well I'm not entirely clear this 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.330
 opinion and as you can see is not 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.130
 Completely finished the corner like this 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.990
 that this opinion can not be in 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.120
 Nor can the coast be complete and 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.510
 any incomplete can not be 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.580
 complete because logically I can not 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.860
 look around the corner when you 're at 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.680
 complete, it is likely that he will return to 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.540
 record this skin to listen to all the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.610
 voices and everything new you have to 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.800
 add this skin as good if you do not 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.610
 it's short if I do not really have to 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.080
 be worth the 1350 m of the 1820 which is what 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.600
 which is supposed to be worth 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.730
 comparison of the other project is not 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.830
 a bad skin and also needed a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.770
 good is who as I have already said in 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.050
 the above but well let's see 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.020
 how they finish it if they finish it well 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.570
 will deserve those 1820 if they do not finish it 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.030
 well really it will not deserve so much money 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.570
 it will therefore deserve what the other two are worth 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.400
 thousand 350 I hope you liked it if it's 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.870
 So they do not want to give me I like to share 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.440
 comment and see you in the next 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.440
 video 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.430
