00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
four settings there's clock run history

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.530 
four settings there's clock run history

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
is kind of new to it what a unique thing

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.880 
is kind of new to it what a unique thing
about<00:02:05.120> this<00:02:05.540> watch<00:02:05.750> compared<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.500> lot<00:02:06.830> of

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
about this watch compared to a lot of

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.569 
about this watch compared to a lot of
the<00:02:07.070> garmins<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.760> that<00:02:08.659> it's<00:02:09.590> internally

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
the garmins is that it's internally

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:11.709 
the garmins is that it's internally
updated<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.180> there's<00:02:11.359> not<00:02:11.450> going<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.599> be<00:02:11.659> a

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719 
updated so there's not going to be a

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.270 
updated so there's not going to be a
second<00:02:12.049> generation<00:02:12.139> watch<00:02:12.680> you're<00:02:12.980> not<00:02:13.099> going
