00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.750
 no afternoons here we have a vision 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:13.350
 of 2012 that is that the more adult 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 will have about seven months the other 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:21.910
 has about three four and five 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.880
 Months are sisters of the same father 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.740
 with different mothers there are brothers 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.740
 arrested and there are 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.270
 there are some that are not touched but the father is 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.670
 the same as we have towards the bottom 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.670

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:00.129
 and it has very good leg very good 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.840
 the leg thighs 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.670

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.049
 little bit more 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.490
 half of the ruling that I have here of the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.040
 friend pepe 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.880
 I come from the valley 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.060
 and the truth that we have here females 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.530
 part of parents that is what I 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:34.760
 it interests me to work it then I 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:39.030
 like to put some nephew I like 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:43.200

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.930

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.560
 then go making the crosses and little to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.810
 little and trying to flirt pigeons 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.590
 to get the best performance 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.479
 possible that they say good that he could not 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.320
 bind last year but at least 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.259

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:12.150

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:15.720
 sticks with the types that they touch and that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.340

 chips we do not have at least won 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.090
 now also 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:22.549
 over time he imagines to share 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.549
