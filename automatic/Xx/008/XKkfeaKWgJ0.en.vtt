00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
I'm going to go ahead and leave it so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.520 
I'm going to go ahead and leave it so
now<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.120> have<00:01:23.360> your<00:01:23.480> two<00:01:23.540> pins<00:01:23.930> in<00:01:24.110> there<00:01:24.320> and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
now you have your two pins in there and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.420 
now you have your two pins in there and
they're<00:01:25.430> pretty<00:01:25.790> much<00:01:26.180> like<00:01:28.990> equal<00:01:30.430> or

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
they're pretty much like equal or

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.150 
they're pretty much like equal or
straight<00:01:31.730> across<00:01:31.940> from<00:01:32.210> each<00:01:32.240> other<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:34.040> what

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
straight across from each other so what

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.290 
straight across from each other so what
I<00:01:34.190> do<00:01:34.370> is<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:34.700> take<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.940> shoelace<00:01:35.510> and<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.970> put<00:01:38.180> it

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
I do is I take a shoelace and I put it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.780 
I do is I take a shoelace and I put it
right<00:01:38.770> across<00:01:39.770> where<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.100> I<00:01:40.190> would<00:01:40.490> be

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.090 

underneath<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:45.170> straight<00:01:45.440> pin<00:01:46.150> each<00:01:47.150> side

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
underneath the straight pin each side

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.650 
underneath the straight pin each side
then<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.130> tie<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.820> back<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.550> I<00:01:52.660> double

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
then I tie it in the back and I double

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.960 
then I tie it in the back and I double
wrap<00:01:53.930> it<00:01:54.200> because<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.310> won't<00:01:55.460> sort<00:01:55.880> of

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
wrap it because then it won't sort of

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.970 
wrap it because then it won't sort of
tie<00:01:56.570> back<00:01:56.780> over<00:01:57.140> itself<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.360> holds<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.480> secure

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.340 

and<00:02:04.980> it<00:02:05.340> gives<00:02:05.490> us<00:02:05.700> something<00:02:05.940> nice<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.680> thick

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
and it gives us something nice and thick

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.410 
and it gives us something nice and thick
they<00:02:10.350> hang<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.740> to<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.490> how<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.790> buckles<00:02:12.240> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
they hang on to see how that buckles it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.170 
they hang on to see how that buckles it
down<00:02:12.600> how<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.930> ties<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.320> down<00:02:13.790> really<00:02:14.790> really

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
down how it ties it down really really

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.100 
down how it ties it down really really
well

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
well

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.770 
well
and<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:17.610> holds<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.210> really<00:02:18.660> easily<00:02:19.200> then

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
and it holds it really easily then

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.730 
and it holds it really easily then
here's<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.900> straight<00:02:22.290> pin<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:24.080> put<00:02:25.080> into<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.530> so

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
here's a straight pin and put into it so

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.600 
here's a straight pin and put into it so
that<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:26.100> holds<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.730> place<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.980> couple<00:02:29.459> of

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
that it holds it in place that couple of

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.020 
that it holds it in place that couple of
them<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.820> always<00:02:30.150> best<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.170> doesn't<00:02:31.500> slip

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.210 

then<00:02:36.030> what<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.300> do<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.780> take<00:02:36.989> my<00:02:37.230> smaller

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
then what I do is I take my smaller

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.020 
then what I do is I take my smaller
