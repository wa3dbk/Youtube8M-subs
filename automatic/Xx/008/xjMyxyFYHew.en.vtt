and two of them have already came they
just<00:00:30.869> came<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.349> literally<00:00:31.920> ten<00:00:32.160> minutes<00:00:32.430> ago

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
just came like literally ten minutes ago

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.270

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and one of them that I got is completely

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400 
and one of them that I got is completely
wrong<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:36.149> not<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> ordered<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:37.020> so

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
wrong it's not what I ordered at all so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
wrong it's not what I ordered at all so
I<00:00:37.440> hope<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.700> return<00:00:39.000> them<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.510> get

the<00:00:39.780> right<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.739> probably<00:00:41.010> gonna<00:00:41.190> be

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the right one so it's probably gonna be

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.860 
the right one so it's probably gonna be
even<00:00:41.610> longer<00:00:41.789> now<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> wait<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> room

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
