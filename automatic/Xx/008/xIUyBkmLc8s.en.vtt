 First 7 will go to China and that 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.549
 it will be without the hamburger school 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.250
 then take place in hsk so in my 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.359
 club hamburger chess club 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 clubhouse and that are optimal 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.570
 premises for such a seminar is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.970
 it go that's seminar is how I 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.130
 Grandmaster was so it is almost about 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 a personal way to this title 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.880
 and what training methods I use 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.309
 I have what I consider important to just 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.520
 to get better in the shaft and it works 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.280
 not just about training alone 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 it 'll be half of that time 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.539
 make seminars especially if I am 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.489
 look at variations and calculations 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.530
 Candidates draw these two topics 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.850
 we will be discussing ourselves 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.870
 demanding tasks on the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.570
 participants wait 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.140
 On the other hand, I also want to be on the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.510
 Inside many of you stand up for business 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.580
 maybe in the known as earth 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.920
 fighter type that means I like to live 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.869
 draw and actually play almost 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 Everything looks and I think it has me very much 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.549
 Much on my way to this 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.080
 course master title and I want that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.330
 you also like to be a seminar 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.439
 convey 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.360
 when will it take place ? 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.549
 maybe say that on the 5th of july so 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.330
 now it's just under two weeks, fifth 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.220
 july 10 o'clock in the hsk chess center and 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.570
 Goes up to seven hours in total 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.930
 5 pm with 1 hour lunch break 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.049
 since I still forget that yes price is 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.380
 50 euro for hsk members and 64 euro 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.990
 For nonmembers I think that is one 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.939
 quite fair price for such a one-day 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.280
 seminar with me 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.600
 and yes I would be happy to see you there 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.700
 to welcome 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.439
 oh such an attitude is still there 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.030
 is from 1800 dwz or ilo so participant 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.979
 should at least have this eu 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.560
 because it is quite demanding 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.090
 from the tasks and there I want 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.860
 also demand the participants properly 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.620
 that's the least 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.810
 elo number is needed again everything 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.690
 so clearly on the fifth july 10 o'clock haas 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.780
 kascha ignition maybe until then completely 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.780
 Well
