a-six and a-seven a 12 then we go back

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270 
a-six and a-seven a 12 then we go back
to<00:01:18.480> the<00:01:18.600> slowest<00:01:19.260> so<00:01:19.470> let's<00:01:19.680> count<00:01:19.950> how<00:01:20.070> many

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
to the slowest so let's count how many

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.790 
to the slowest so let's count how many
of<00:01:20.520> those<00:01:20.640> faster<00:01:21.270> flaps<00:01:21.570> were<00:01:21.840> doing<00:01:22.170> okay

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
of those faster flaps were doing okay

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.450 
of those faster flaps were doing okay
this<00:01:23.280> time<00:01:23.550> I'm<00:01:23.820> gonna<00:01:24.290> not<00:01:25.290> talk<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.310> can

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.349 
that new count of one that we're going
to<00:02:48.200> go<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.530> slow<00:02:48.859> flaps<00:02:49.220> again<00:02:49.489> eight<00:02:49.730> regular

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
to go the slow flaps again eight regular

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.080 
to go the slow flaps again eight regular
flaps<00:02:50.720> take<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> look<00:02:51.890> at<00:02:52.099> it<00:02:52.129> with<00:02:52.730> me<00:02:52.880> facing

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
flaps take a look at it with me facing

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.150 
flaps take a look at it with me facing
upstage<00:02:53.630> let's<00:02:53.900> try<00:02:54.109> it<00:02:54.170> with<00:02:54.470> music<00:02:54.709> with<00:02:55.099> a

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
upstage let's try it with music with a

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:28.110 
upstage let's try it with music with a
slow<00:02:55.489> tempo<00:02:55.760> first

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.300 

hey<00:03:29.120> here's<00:03:29.659> why<00:03:29.840> it's<00:03:30.019> tricky<00:03:30.319> a<00:03:30.590> flap<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.250> too

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
hey here's why it's tricky a flap is too

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.839 
hey here's why it's tricky a flap is too
sounds<00:03:32.209> right<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.739> triplet<00:03:33.739> is<00:03:33.920> three<00:03:34.340> sounds<00:03:34.760> a

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
sounds right a triplet is three sounds a

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.589 
sounds right a triplet is three sounds a
one<00:03:35.329> and<00:03:35.599> one<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.409> two<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.010> three<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.879> up<00:03:38.359> or

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
one and one and two and three and up or

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.399 
one and one and two and three and up or
and<00:03:38.870> two<00:03:39.709> were<00:03:40.310> laying<00:03:40.549> too<00:03:41.359> sounds<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:41.989> top<00:03:42.260> of

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
and two were laying too sounds on top of

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.949 
and two were laying too sounds on top of
a<00:03:42.499> three-count<00:03:43.010> rhythm<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:43.609> what<00:03:44.450> makes<00:03:44.719> it

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
a three-count rhythm it's what makes it

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.330 
a three-count rhythm it's what makes it
what<00:03:45.739> is<00:03:45.859> called<00:03:46.150> syncopated<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.629> tricky

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
what is called syncopated it's tricky

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.890 
what is called syncopated it's tricky
you<00:03:49.340> can<00:03:49.549> either<00:03:49.669> count<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.269> or<00:03:50.449> feel<00:03:50.870> it

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
you can either count it or feel it

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.649 
you can either count it or feel it
whatever<00:03:51.439> works<00:03:51.829> for<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.519> it's<00:03:53.389> different

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
whatever works for you it's different

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.379 
whatever works for you it's different
for<00:03:53.989> every<00:03:54.260> dancer<00:03:54.790> alright<00:03:55.790> let's<00:03:56.060> try<00:03:56.120> it

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
for every dancer alright let's try it

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.390 
for every dancer alright let's try it
again<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.930> think<00:03:57.530> it'll<00:03:57.709> make<00:03:57.889> more<00:03:58.040> sense<00:03:58.099> just

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
again I think it'll make more sense just

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.970 
again I think it'll make more sense just
the<00:03:58.730> more<00:03:58.939> we<00:03:59.060> do<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.389> um<00:04:00.109> let's<00:04:00.560> try<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.799> one

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
the more we do it um let's try it one

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.619 
the more we do it um let's try it one
more<00:04:01.040> time<00:04:01.189> at<00:04:01.549> this<00:04:01.699> slower<00:04:02.060> tempo<00:04:02.480> then

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
more time at this slower tempo then

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.390 
more time at this slower tempo then
we're<00:04:02.750> going<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.900> bump<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.260> tempo<00:04:06.400> eight

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
we're going to bump the tempo eight

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:36.360 
we're going to bump the tempo eight
regular<00:04:07.969> flaps

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.380 

alright<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.790> I<00:04:38.120> told<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:38.870> this<00:04:38.990> one's<00:04:39.230> tricky

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
alright so I told you this one's tricky

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.390 
alright so I told you this one's tricky
let's<00:04:41.390> try<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.660> again<00:04:41.750> let's<00:04:42.560> bump<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:43.040> tempo

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
let's try it again let's bump that tempo

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.770 
let's try it again let's bump that tempo
up<00:04:43.550> for<00:04:43.790> those<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.180> out<00:04:44.390> there<00:04:44.420> who<00:04:44.750> are

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
up for those of you out there who are

00:04:44.780 --> 00:05:06.610 
up for those of you out there who are
getting<00:04:45.200> this<00:05:04.780> okay<00:05:05.780> let's<00:05:06.200> try<00:05:06.350> that<00:05:06.560> again

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
getting this okay let's try that again

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.360 
getting this okay let's try that again
um<00:05:07.610> I<00:05:08.200> stayed<00:05:09.200> really<00:05:09.440> relaxed<00:05:10.070> on<00:05:10.190> those

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
um I stayed really relaxed on those

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.760 
um I stayed really relaxed on those
rolling<00:05:10.730> triplet<00:05:11.150> flaps<00:05:11.660> again<00:05:12.410> all<00:05:12.620> we're

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
rolling triplet flaps again all we're

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.830 
rolling triplet flaps again all we're
doing<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.100> flaps<00:05:13.370> we're<00:05:13.760> changing<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.300> rhythm

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
doing a flaps we're changing the rhythm

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.760 
doing a flaps we're changing the rhythm
after<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.950> first<00:05:16.100> eight<00:05:17.080> stay<00:05:18.080> relaxed<00:05:18.680> and

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
after the first eight stay relaxed and

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.190 
after the first eight stay relaxed and
kind<00:05:19.400> of<00:05:19.490> have<00:05:19.580> a<00:05:19.610> bouncy<00:05:20.090> quality<00:05:20.630> to<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:20.810> last

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
kind of have a bouncy quality to it last

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.780 
kind of have a bouncy quality to it last
time<00:05:21.500> through<00:05:21.890> let's<00:05:22.280> start<00:05:22.370> on<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.670> right

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
time through let's start on the right

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:42.149 
time through let's start on the right
foot

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.989 

actually<00:05:43.159> I<00:05:43.219> do<00:05:43.309> want<00:05:43.579> to<00:05:43.639> do<00:05:43.759> it<00:05:43.819> one<00:05:43.939> more

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:43.999 
actually I do want to do it one more

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.019 
actually I do want to do it one more
time<00:05:44.119> but<00:05:44.929> i<00:05:45.469> think<00:05:45.769> the<00:05:46.009> trickiest<00:05:46.399> part<00:05:46.729> is

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:47.029 
time but i think the trickiest part is

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.839 
time but i think the trickiest part is
once<00:05:47.749> you<00:05:47.989> establish<00:05:48.889> the<00:05:49.099> rolling<00:05:49.429> triplet

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
once you establish the rolling triplet

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.729 
once you establish the rolling triplet
rhythm<00:05:50.209> is<00:05:51.429> to<00:05:52.429> then<00:05:52.699> go<00:05:53.029> back<00:05:53.329> to<00:05:53.689> the<00:05:54.349> slow

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:54.739 
rhythm is to then go back to the slow

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:56.739 
rhythm is to then go back to the slow
flaps<00:05:55.099> or<00:05:55.399> the<00:05:55.549> regular<00:05:55.999> flaps<00:05:56.239> I<00:05:56.389> think

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:56.749 
flaps or the regular flaps I think

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.539 
flaps or the regular flaps I think
that's<00:05:56.929> tricky<00:05:57.259> take<00:05:57.979> a<00:05:58.009> look<00:05:58.189> at<00:05:58.309> it<00:05:58.339> without

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:58.549 
that's tricky take a look at it without

00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:01.209 
that's tricky take a look at it without
music<00:05:58.939> here<00:05:59.899> take<00:06:00.139> a<00:06:00.169> listen<00:06:00.439> here's<00:06:01.129> the

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
music here take a listen here's the

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:04.449 
music here take a listen here's the
whole<00:06:01.489> exercise<00:06:01.999> I'm<00:06:02.569> going<00:06:02.659> to<00:06:02.809> go<00:06:02.899> slow<00:06:03.459> then

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:04.459 
whole exercise I'm going to go slow then

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:06.279 
whole exercise I'm going to go slow then
go<00:06:04.669> into<00:06:04.819> the<00:06:04.999> triplets<00:06:05.389> then<00:06:05.659> go<00:06:05.779> back<00:06:05.929> to<00:06:06.169> the

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
go into the triplets then go back to the

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:19.329 
go into the triplets then go back to the
slow<00:06:06.529> take<00:06:06.829> a<00:06:06.860> listen<00:06:17.860> so<00:06:18.860> you<00:06:18.919> have<00:06:19.069> to<00:06:19.189> keep

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:19.339 
slow take a listen so you have to keep

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:21.039 
slow take a listen so you have to keep
track<00:06:19.669> of<00:06:19.729> where<00:06:20.089> you<00:06:20.239> are<00:06:20.389> in<00:06:20.539> the<00:06:20.659> sequence

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:21.049 
track of where you are in the sequence

00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:42.749 
track of where you are in the sequence
last<00:06:21.649> time<00:06:21.949> through<00:06:22.249> guys<00:06:22.489> right<00:06:23.059> foot

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.879 

alright<00:06:43.759> i<00:06:43.789> would<00:06:44.060> consider<00:06:44.210> that<00:06:44.389> a<00:06:44.889> true

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
alright i would consider that a true

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.810 
alright i would consider that a true
intermediate<00:06:46.759> warm<00:06:47.599> up
