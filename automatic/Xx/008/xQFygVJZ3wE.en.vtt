00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.230
 greet all friends with you alexey and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.630
 my channel is about jeff clarke from china today 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.340
 we continue heading 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.449
 time-tested, and what kind of field and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.980
 We Chinese people well, that is 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.029
 I have almost half a teapot for half a year already 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.219
 unpacking can be viewed at the link 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.759
 Well, what I want to say about this 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.290
 teapot 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.840
 Well in my opinion maker firm as well Jovi 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.180
 read this is one of the most famous 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.660
 Chinese manufacturing firms 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.270
 teapot quietly branded labels all 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.940
 there is a black teapot made 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.699
 from metal 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.430
 Well, not every use kettle 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.859
 day but still every other day after two 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.699
 I use it works fine 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.840
 two modes are obtained boiling well, three 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.869
 button mode it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.610
 disabled first mode it turns out 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.610
 automatic heating i.e. the kettle is obtained 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.560
 he heats up and turns off but then 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 if it is cold it is heated again 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.650
 here you understand the second mode 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.700
 constant heating mode that is necessary 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.760
 Now to manually disable done from 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.520
 some kind of metal thin very light 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.210
 heats up fast enough my new 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.960
 ceramic teapot gets drunk a little 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.470
 faster and keeps ceramic warm too 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 better than this here as you can 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.730
 that he is hanging out and understandably what 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.580
 if the kettle is empty so that it does not turn on 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.800
 if the kettle full game is poured here 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.090
 he per liter then he is understandable 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.960
 calculates starts heating once so 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.979
 he looks like the bottom and how little 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.130
 there was nothing like that 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:14.570
 such a station is unremarkable 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.570
 usually from here 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.170
 changed the plug 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.300
 there was a chinese no adapter 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.360
 was not as Chinese as we used to 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.480
 On two such plugs, she is the 3rd in 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.489
 the city did not find such an adapter in 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.910
 China can be found in the city itself 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.380
 found I had to just stupidly cut off or 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.410
 replace with just such a regular outlet 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.290
 about the energy consumption of the unfamiliar 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.680
 consume as usual well faithful 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.750
