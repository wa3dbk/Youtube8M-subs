00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.220
 hello to geneva that if you are pr pr must submit version 3 1 points 2 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.859
 reforms also week 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.400
 so with the addition of five new blogs 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.150
 so there is an idea of ​​liliane cement and tar 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.270
 the addition of three-year-old married a bouquet of the bride in stock he varied in 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.130
 sea ​​indeed the barrier 36 dead 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.070
 show fears 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 doorous but feeling that it is always the same appointment of his coming 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.280
 gravel authors 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.880
 a few decades 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.540
 to stand up in the box the living room is embedded a drama 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.399
 you want some curves you take this morning 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.070
 these same blacks 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 put down as new women's wood or co2 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.230
 as for her to give up 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.430
 in the future m 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.719
 who 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.220
 seasonal variations 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.920
 France as in the south 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.820
 it was as if you want a back 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.190
 two variants 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.390
 gerold 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.060
 jean-pierre delannoy mayor have not disappointed 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 four women and one child is born 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.870
 finally cements 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.910
 but my job 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.480
 Never mind 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.650
 What does it give 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.370
 as proof the blocks 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.370
 cement 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.580
 and tar but this time luck is that viability can it serve 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
 finally it's in 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.570
 so this eventuality 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.050
 e after 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.000
 the delegates at the APA 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.010
 deminers is simple 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.010
 because unity 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.470
 bingo 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.730
 barriers 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.420
 so the barriers 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.709
 this one 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.669
 new building 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:12.739
 we can 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.659
 in addition the difference 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.099
 we can not see the difference between its launch 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.999
 we sent 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.899
 the break between them 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.129
 barriers 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.129
 the racing throw all smooth 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.869
 so that was for the new blocks 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:32.409
 and I'll see you soon to reduce them
