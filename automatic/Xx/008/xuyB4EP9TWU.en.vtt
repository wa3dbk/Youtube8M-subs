anything pull them out first one right
in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> middle<00:00:43.200> right<00:00:43.700> here<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.969> first<00:00:45.090> loop

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
in the middle right here your first loop

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.100 
in the middle right here your first loop
is<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.879> on<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.239> side<00:00:48.270> so

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
is going to be on the right side so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.799 
is going to be on the right side so
you'll<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.469> where<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.770> one's<00:00:49.950> coming<00:00:50.190> from

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
you'll know where that one's coming from

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.380 
you'll know where that one's coming from
but<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.860> tough<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:56.120> it<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
but this one this is a tough one it is

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:11.460 
but this one this is a tough one it is
coming<00:00:57.870> from<00:01:01.489> underneath<00:01:02.489> here

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.560 

and<00:01:12.470> coming<00:01:12.830> back<00:01:12.980> this<00:01:13.160> way

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:26.410 

yeah<00:01:19.990> that's<00:01:20.990> on<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:21.320> side<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:25.270> for<00:01:26.270> that

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
yeah that's on this side that for that

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.940 
yeah that's on this side that for that
one<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:28.070> it's<00:01:28.280> going<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:29.510> way<00:01:29.750> up<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:30.740> side

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
one and it's going this way up this side

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.920 
one and it's going this way up this side
so<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.280> right<00:01:31.430> side<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:32.000> coming<00:01:32.300> up<00:01:32.540> this<00:01:32.690> way

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
so the right side is coming up this way

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.530 
so the right side is coming up this way
so<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:34.340> pull<00:01:34.580> that<00:01:34.700> out<00:01:34.869> get<00:01:35.869> some<00:01:35.990> extra<00:01:37.540> stay

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
so you pull that out get some extra stay

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.120 
so you pull that out get some extra stay
up<00:01:38.660> out<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.020> back<00:01:41.619> keep<00:01:42.619> weaving<00:01:42.800> your<00:01:43.070> way

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
up out the back keep weaving your way

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.300 
up out the back keep weaving your way
through<00:01:44.590> then<00:01:45.590> when<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.830> can<00:01:45.950> hear<00:01:46.130> this

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
through then when you can hear this

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.550 
through then when you can hear this
where<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.580> gets<00:01:46.729> tricky<00:01:47.229> that's<00:01:48.229> tough

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
where it gets tricky that's tough

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.630 
where it gets tricky that's tough
because<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:49.130> comes<00:01:49.399> through<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:52.190> comes<00:01:52.430> in

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
because it comes through and it comes in
