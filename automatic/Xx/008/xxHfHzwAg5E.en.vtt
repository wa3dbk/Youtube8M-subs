00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.740
 at this point we move on to the last phase 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.629
 the most important phase is the police 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.710
 machine the car when it has 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.410
 finished working 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.900
 let's go to turn off the two 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.910
 baskets and let's go to sanitize a 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.130
 clean only and exclusively with 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.750
 the wine vinegar then looks for a base 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.700
 to the type of trace that one is 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.920
 informed but we go from the glass to the 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.529
 half a bottle 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.210
 if this is done 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.450
 usually every end of service each 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.329
 evening clearly much more cleaning 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.850
 fast the vinegar is treated with water 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.200
 boiling water for about half an hour did 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.690
 this we do nothing but this 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.410
 case since we are working 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.770
 manually 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.440
 let's put inside the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.570
 this pipe is fitted with the appropriate tap e 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.250
 with the help of a jug or if there 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.620
 we find near a sink 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.030
 we are going to unload the water that is found 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.250
 inside the machine 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.799
 afterwards just pass a cloth 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.100
 moist that the product we say so 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.139
 pasta is ready to be used 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.569
 we advise you not to wash the 

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:18.249
 machine with soaps also soaps for i 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.770
 dishes and various things not to risk 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:23.150
 then to leave small residues that 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.430
 then go to 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.260
 ruin the product we go to 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.770
 therefore find exclusively vinegar of 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.710
 wine that must act for at least one 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.120
 half an hour the game is done 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.590
 of course all the information that 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.960
 we have just given you the discoveries 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.590
 also on this manual precisely linked 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.430
 at this to this pasta cooker 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.740
 multifunction manual as well as giving 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.860
 main indications therefore le 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.930
 size the absorption of the machine 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.700
 which is around 3 useful kilowatts eight 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.650
 and means for passing a so kilowatts and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.080
 microwave and all others 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.110
 information necessary for the 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.770
 this manual also works as 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.080
 after all the machine to a written in 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.040
 five languages ​​therefore Italian French 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.780
 German English and Spanish as you have 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.610
 given the simplicity of the machine 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.260
 thanks also to this manual there 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.900
 allows you to make a dish 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.480
 of Italian pasta not only in 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.600
 italy but also in different places of the
