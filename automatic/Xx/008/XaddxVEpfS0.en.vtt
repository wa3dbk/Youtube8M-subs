00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
thing I notice about this diet where

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.789 
thing I notice about this diet where
they<00:01:54.020> were<00:01:54.439> doing<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:55.119> resto<00:01:56.119> blood<00:01:56.649> ok<00:01:57.649> the

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
they were doing a resto blood ok the

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.800 
they were doing a resto blood ok the
thing<00:01:57.830> with<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.250> diet<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.790> that<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.600> body

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
thing with this diet is that the body

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.859 
thing with this diet is that the body
needs<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.409> adapt<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:02.240> main<00:02:02.509> source<00:02:02.780> of

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
needs to adapt that is main source of

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.340 
needs to adapt that is main source of
energy's<00:02:03.350> fat<00:02:04.130> instead<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.820> first<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:06.200> that's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
energy's fat instead of first so that's

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.719 
energy's fat instead of first so that's
how<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.500> body<00:02:06.710> is<00:02:06.860> like<00:02:07.039> what<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.430> heck<00:02:07.580> is

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
how the body is like what the heck is

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.270
