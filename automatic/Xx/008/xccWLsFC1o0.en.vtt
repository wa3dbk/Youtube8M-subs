00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
always just give have to open in one by

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.410 
always just give have to open in one by
one<00:05:41.710> in<00:05:41.860> their<00:05:41.980> bit<00:05:42.190> slow<00:05:42.430> but<00:05:43.060> there's<00:05:43.330> a

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
one in their bit slow but there's a

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.720 
one in their bit slow but there's a
tactic<00:05:43.930> that<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:44.140> have<00:05:44.380> used<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:45.280> works<00:05:45.490> really

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
tactic that I have used it works really

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.060 
tactic that I have used it works really
well<00:05:45.910> and<00:05:46.300> most<00:05:46.870> cameras<00:05:47.350> do<00:05:47.500> allow<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:47.770> to<00:05:47.950> do

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
well and most cameras do allow you to do

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.700 
well and most cameras do allow you to do
this<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:48.700> can<00:05:48.850> shoot<00:05:49.000> raw<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.660> it<00:05:50.110> saved<00:05:50.380> in

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
this you can shoot raw and it saved in

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.280 
this you can shoot raw and it saved in
JPEG<00:05:50.770> as<00:05:51.550> well<00:05:51.790> and<00:05:52.120> you<00:05:52.540> can<00:05:52.570> say<00:05:52.900> about<00:05:52.930> the

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
JPEG as well and you can say about the

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.290 
JPEG as well and you can say about the
maximum<00:05:53.860> quality<00:05:54.040> JPEG<00:05:54.670> where<00:05:54.940> you<00:05:55.030> get<00:05:55.180> you

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
maximum quality JPEG where you get you

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.340 
maximum quality JPEG where you get you
know<00:05:55.420> if<00:05:55.510> you're<00:05:55.630> shooting<00:05:55.780> can<00:05:56.080> make<00:05:56.260> it

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
know if you're shooting can make it

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.590 
know if you're shooting can make it
pixels<00:05:56.680> you'll<00:05:56.800> get<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:56.980> 10<00:05:57.580> megapixel<00:05:57.730> jpg

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
pixels you'll get a 10 megapixel jpg

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.160 
pixels you'll get a 10 megapixel jpg
file<00:05:58.900> and<00:05:59.580> there<00:06:00.580> are<00:06:00.730> also<00:06:00.940> settings<00:06:01.720> for<00:06:01.960> raw

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.620 
file and there are also settings for raw
as<00:06:02.440> well<00:06:03.010> as<00:06:03.160> JPEG<00:06:03.640> but<00:06:03.820> you<00:06:03.910> can<00:06:04.090> have<00:06:04.450> the

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
as well as JPEG but you can have the

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.350 
as well as JPEG but you can have the
jpeg<00:06:05.110> at<00:06:05.380> like<00:06:05.770> a<00:06:05.800> 1<00:06:06.100> or<00:06:06.130> 2<00:06:06.400> megapixel<00:06:07.090> size

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
jpeg at like a 1 or 2 megapixel size

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.750 
jpeg at like a 1 or 2 megapixel size
where<00:06:08.170> it's<00:06:08.290> really<00:06:08.560> compressed<00:06:09.100> and<00:06:09.400> it

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
where it's really compressed and it

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.190 
where it's really compressed and it
works<00:06:09.940> great<00:06:10.090> because<00:06:10.540> you<00:06:10.780> have<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.050> high

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
works great because you have the high

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.230 
works great because you have the high
quality<00:06:11.440> file<00:06:11.800> but<00:06:12.250> you<00:06:12.310> have<00:06:12.400> the<00:06:12.430> tiny<00:06:12.760> jpeg

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
quality file but you have the tiny jpeg

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.870 
quality file but you have the tiny jpeg
files<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:14.230> can<00:06:14.380> quickly<00:06:14.620> run<00:06:15.460> through<00:06:15.490> them

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
files you can quickly run through them

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.550 
files you can quickly run through them
kind<00:06:16.090> of<00:06:16.120> like<00:06:16.240> thumbnails<00:06:16.780> but<00:06:17.110> they<00:06:17.320> work<00:06:17.530> a

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
kind of like thumbnails but they work a

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.660 
kind of like thumbnails but they work a
little<00:06:17.740> bit<00:06:17.920> better<00:06:18.100> a<00:06:18.250> little<00:06:18.400> bit<00:06:18.550> more

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
little bit better a little bit more

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.210 
little bit better a little bit more

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
with all those settings and you're

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.350 
with all those settings and you're
really<00:06:37.310> getting<00:06:37.760> the<00:06:37.880> most<00:06:38.000> out<00:06:38.180> of<00:06:38.240> the

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
really getting the most out of the

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.490 
really getting the most out of the
picture<00:06:38.510> and<00:06:38.630> I<00:06:38.750> just<00:06:38.870> like<00:06:39.020> playing<00:06:39.140> with<00:06:39.380> it

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
picture and I just like playing with it

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.110 
picture and I just like playing with it
and<00:06:39.590> that's<00:06:40.010> just<00:06:40.220> the<00:06:40.340> way<00:06:40.460> it<00:06:40.550> works<00:06:40.670> but

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
and that's just the way it works but

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.450 
and that's just the way it works but
sometimes<00:06:41.870> people<00:06:42.200> don't<00:06:42.560> have<00:06:42.800> the<00:06:42.950> time<00:06:43.130> to

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
sometimes people don't have the time to

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.360 
sometimes people don't have the time to
do<00:06:43.580> that<00:06:43.610> so<00:06:44.090> there's<00:06:44.780> your<00:06:44.900> choice<00:06:45.200> and<00:06:45.530> I

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370
