00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.930 
to overcome a life-threatening emergency
a<00:00:03.000> surgical<00:00:03.600> team<00:00:03.810> needs<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.440> be<00:00:04.710> calm<00:00:05.069> well

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
a surgical team needs to be calm well

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.810 
a surgical team needs to be calm well
organized<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.839> above<00:00:07.140> all<00:00:07.309> experienced<00:00:08.309> but

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
organized and above all experienced but

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.400 
organized and above all experienced but
how<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.059> theater<00:00:09.570> staff<00:00:09.780> gain<00:00:10.170> that

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
how the theater staff gain that

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.799 
how the theater staff gain that
experience<00:00:10.559> without<00:00:11.490> putting<00:00:12.030> patients<00:00:12.360> at

experience without putting patients at
risk

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
risk

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.140 
risk
like<00:00:13.889> any<00:00:14.099> good<00:00:14.250> team<00:00:14.519> they<00:00:14.969> practice<00:00:17.029> this<00:00:18.029> is

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
like any good team they practice this is

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660 
like any good team they practice this is
our<00:00:18.300> simulator<00:00:18.779> suite<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.490> room

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
our simulator suite so it's a room

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.970 
our simulator suite so it's a room
that's<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.060> mocked<00:00:21.300> up<00:00:21.510> theater<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.619> we've<00:00:22.769> got

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
that's a mocked up theater so we've got

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.830 
that's a mocked up theater so we've got
piped<00:00:23.369> gases<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.210> telethia<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> an

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
piped gases like you telethia to an

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500 
piped gases like you telethia to an
anaesthetic<00:00:25.320> machine<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.890> theater<00:00:26.849> table<00:00:27.330> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
anaesthetic machine a theater table and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.259 
anaesthetic machine a theater table and
we<00:00:28.260> basically<00:00:28.710> run<00:00:29.099> manikin<00:00:30.090> based

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
we basically run manikin based

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.659 
we basically run manikin based
simulations<00:00:31.099> some<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> things<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.579> we

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
simulations some of the things that we

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.760 
simulations some of the things that we
practice<00:00:33.030> are<00:00:33.180> quite<00:00:33.360> rare<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.410> only<00:00:34.620> way

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
practice are quite rare so the only way

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.410 
practice are quite rare so the only way
to<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.670> set<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.030> simulation

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
to do it is to set up a simulation

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450 
to do it is to set up a simulation
session<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.350> where<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.219> simulate

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
session like this where you can simulate

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.850 
session like this where you can simulate
the<00:00:38.790> effects<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.270> those<00:00:39.450> things<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the effects of those things I'm the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.799 
the effects of those things I'm the
niece<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.219> start<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.120> moment<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.600> then

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
niece to start at the moment and then

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.600 
niece to start at the moment and then
and<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.680> new<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.920> Easter's<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.309> come<00:00:44.460> in

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and the new and Easter's will come in

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.479 
and the new and Easter's will come in
and<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:45.690> hand<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:46.950> something

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and will hand over and then something

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.389 
and will hand over and then something
will<00:00:47.700> happen<00:00:47.879> later<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.070> patient

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
will happen later on and the patient

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.529 
will happen later on and the patient
will<00:00:50.489> become<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.879> wealth<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.300> they'll<00:00:51.420> have

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
will become and wealth and they'll have

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.160 
will become and wealth and they'll have
to<00:00:51.660> deal<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.789> Paul<00:00:54.059> he's<00:00:54.539> 26

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
to deal with it so this is Paul he's 26

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
to deal with it so this is Paul he's 26
he<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.399> MUA<00:00:57.289> anesthetists<00:00:58.289> quite

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
he was for an MUA anesthetists quite

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.599 
he was for an MUA anesthetists quite
often

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
often

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819 
often
handover<00:01:00.090> mid-case<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.260> important<00:01:01.770> that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
handover mid-case so it's important that

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.630 
handover mid-case so it's important that
we<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.190> manage<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.520> effectively<00:01:03.019> okay<00:01:04.019> yeah

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
we can manage it effectively okay yeah

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.060 
we can manage it effectively okay yeah
thanks<00:01:05.869> bye<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.890> critical

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
thanks bye there will be a critical

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.060 
thanks bye there will be a critical
incident<00:01:08.310> which<00:01:08.909> will<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.510> drug<00:01:09.869> reaction

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
incident which will be a drug reaction

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.990 
incident which will be a drug reaction
which<00:01:11.070> depends<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:11.850> information

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
which depends on what information

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.429 
which depends on what information
they've<00:01:12.390> got<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.720> me<00:01:12.930> whether<00:01:13.229> they've

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
they've got out of me whether they've

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.899 
they've got out of me whether they've
managed<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> information<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.820> this

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
managed to get the information that this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.850 
managed to get the information that this
patient<00:01:15.270> has<00:01:15.390> an<00:01:15.479> allergy<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.869> penicillin<00:01:15.990> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
patient has an allergy to penicillin so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.929 
patient has an allergy to penicillin so
it's<00:01:17.009> done<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.310> management<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.850> that

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
it's done of that management of that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.390 
it's done of that management of that
particular<00:01:18.360> reaction<00:01:18.799> good<00:01:19.799> absolute<00:01:20.220> box

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
particular reaction good absolute box

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
particular reaction good absolute box
and<00:01:20.549> yet

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
and yet

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
and yet
Rifton<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.220> anything<00:01:23.520> about<00:01:26.300> it<00:01:27.300> should<00:01:27.630> be

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
Rifton so anything about it should be

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.400 
Rifton so anything about it should be
caught<00:01:27.870> Mike<00:01:28.050> sure<00:01:28.620> yes

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
caught Mike sure yes

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.140 
caught Mike sure yes
Tom's<00:01:31.410> made<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.860> critical<00:01:32.220> mistake

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
Tom's made a critical mistake

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
Tom's made a critical mistake
he's<00:01:33.630> injected<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> patient<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> very

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
he's injected the patient with the very

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.200 
he's injected the patient with the very
drug<00:01:35.730> he's<00:01:35.970> meant<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> avoid<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:38.180> sure<00:01:39.180> enough

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
drug he's meant to avoid and sure enough

the simulator starts to react

00:01:41.310 --> 00:02:01.040 
the simulator starts to react
accordingly<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.820> situation<00:02:00.300> evolves<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.960> the

accordingly the situation evolves on the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.020 
accordingly the situation evolves on the
simulator<00:02:01.410> just<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.250> does<00:02:02.400> in<00:02:02.430> real<00:02:02.760> life

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030

the<00:02:03.510> numbers<00:02:04.080> on<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.260> monitor<00:02:04.590> change<00:02:04.860> just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the numbers on the monitor change just

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.620 
the numbers on the monitor change just
as<00:02:05.220> they<00:02:05.370> would<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.640> real<00:02:05.700> life<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:06.360> start

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
as they would in real life and you start

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.150 
as they would in real life and you start
to<00:02:06.750> behave<00:02:06.870> like<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.350> would<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.710> if<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.010> was

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
to behave like you would as if it was

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.710 
to behave like you would as if it was
real<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:08.910> does<00:02:09.030> compare<00:02:09.450> quite

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
real and I think it does compare quite

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.380 
real and I think it does compare quite
well<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.380> real-life<00:02:10.619> situation<00:02:11.460> this

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
well to the real-life situation this

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.540 
well to the real-life situation this
simulation<00:02:13.050> ends<00:02:13.320> with<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.860> intervention<00:02:14.100> of

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
simulation ends with the intervention of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:28.130 
simulation ends with the intervention of
a<00:02:14.670> consultant<00:02:25.580> with<00:02:26.580> filmed<00:02:27.420> during<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
a consultant with filmed during the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.530 
a consultant with filmed during the
simulation<00:02:28.440> itself<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.390> whole

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
simulation itself and then the whole

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.030 
simulation itself and then the whole
point<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> debrief<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.680> back<00:02:31.709> and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
point of the debrief is you go back and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.500 
point of the debrief is you go back and
you<00:02:32.100> watch<00:02:32.130> what<00:02:32.310> happened<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.150> see

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
you watch what happened and you can see

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.240 
you watch what happened and you can see
in<00:02:33.660> real-time<00:02:33.870> exactly<00:02:34.709> what<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:34.950> did<00:02:35.130> and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
in real-time exactly what they did and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.520 
in real-time exactly what they did and
what<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.400> said<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:36.480> allows<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.140> sort<00:02:37.470> of

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
what you said it allows you to sort of

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.350 
what you said it allows you to sort of
look<00:02:37.590> at<00:02:37.830> your<00:02:37.950> behavior<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.730> become<00:02:39.120> aware

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
look at your behavior and become aware

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.120 
look at your behavior and become aware
of<00:02:39.420> why<00:02:39.780> you've<00:02:39.959> acted<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.470> certain<00:02:40.769> way<00:02:40.980> in

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
of why you've acted in a certain way in

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.949 
of why you've acted in a certain way in
a<00:02:41.160> certain<00:02:41.190> situation<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.390> that's<00:02:42.600> not

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
a certain situation and if that's not

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.449 
a certain situation and if that's not
the<00:02:43.140> ideal<00:02:43.410> thing<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.890> look<00:02:44.160> at<00:02:44.280> why<00:02:44.430> you

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
the ideal thing to do look at why you

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.900 
the ideal thing to do look at why you
how<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.269> change<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.840> okay<00:02:46.640> how<00:02:47.640> did<00:02:47.700> you

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
how you can change it okay how did you

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.990 
how you can change it okay how did you
think<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.420> that's<00:02:48.840> handover<00:02:49.470> went<00:02:50.000> neither

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
think that that's handover went neither

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.790 
think that that's handover went neither
of<00:02:51.239> us<00:02:51.330> mentioned<00:02:51.660> drug<00:02:52.170> allergies<00:02:52.590> Ruth

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
of us mentioned drug allergies Ruth

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.530 
of us mentioned drug allergies Ruth
didn't<00:02:53.040> mention<00:02:53.310> any<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.430> didn't<00:02:53.850> ask<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.450> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
didn't mention any I didn't ask and I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.000 
didn't mention any I didn't ask and I
had<00:02:54.750> looked<00:02:54.900> at<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.230> chart<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.860> there

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
had looked at the chart and there

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.530 
had looked at the chart and there
weren't<00:02:56.160> any<00:02:56.340> mentioned<00:02:56.850> on<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> chart<00:02:57.300> that

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
weren't any mentioned on the chart that

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.840 
weren't any mentioned on the chart that
perhaps<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.989> should<00:02:58.140> have<00:02:58.320> asked<00:02:58.650> specifically

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
perhaps I should have asked specifically

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.000 
perhaps I should have asked specifically
in<00:03:01.420> light<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.660> what<00:03:01.990> happened<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.800> would<00:03:02.920> have

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
in light of what happened it would have

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.710 
in light of what happened it would have
been<00:03:03.100> an<00:03:03.190> important<00:03:03.520> thing<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.850> know<00:03:04.030> you

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
been an important thing to know you

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.310 
been an important thing to know you
certainly<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.840> was<00:03:07.960> on<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.140> checklist

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
certainly it was on the checklist

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.290 
certainly it was on the checklist
yeah<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:11.920> if<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.070> don't<00:03:12.310> feel<00:03:12.520> confident<00:03:12.940> our

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
yeah so if you don't feel confident our

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.510 
yeah so if you don't feel confident our
interests<00:03:13.600> are<00:03:13.750> kind<00:03:14.050> of<00:03:14.140> get<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.620> senior<00:03:15.400> agent

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
interests are kind of get a senior agent

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.360 
interests are kind of get a senior agent
paid<00:03:15.970> or<00:03:16.330> another<00:03:17.260> release<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.680> taste<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.130> say

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
paid or another release to taste and say

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.580 
paid or another release to taste and say
that<00:03:18.550> this<00:03:18.700> patients<00:03:19.420> got<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.840> document<00:03:20.230> of

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
that this patients got a document of

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.520 
that this patients got a document of
drug<00:03:20.770> allergy<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.310> is<00:03:21.760> my<00:03:21.910> school<00:03:25.530> when

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
drug allergy this is my school when

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.930 
drug allergy this is my school when
you're<00:03:26.680> on<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:26.800> ward<00:03:27.070> you<00:03:27.370> can<00:03:27.550> think<00:03:27.760> Mac

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
you're on the ward you can think Mac

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.670 
you're on the ward you can think Mac
right<00:03:28.450> what<00:03:28.660> did<00:03:28.780> we<00:03:28.840> do<00:03:29.050> in<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.170> simulator

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
right what did we do in the simulator

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.500 
right what did we do in the simulator
this<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.070> what<00:03:30.220> we<00:03:30.310> do<00:03:30.430> without<00:03:30.550> that<00:03:30.880> so<00:03:31.480> a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
this is what we do without that so a

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.480 
this is what we do without that so a
mind-numbing<00:03:31.870> terror<00:03:32.410> oh<00:03:32.500> my<00:03:32.950> god<00:03:33.100> someone's

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
mind-numbing terror oh my god someone's

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.160 
mind-numbing terror oh my god someone's
dying<00:03:33.760> now<00:03:34.210> I<00:03:34.240> don't<00:03:34.330> know<00:03:34.510> what<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.780> do<00:03:34.930> I

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
dying now I don't know what to do I

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.930 
dying now I don't know what to do I
think<00:03:35.680> I've<00:03:36.040> been<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:36.400> situation<00:03:36.610> before

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
think I've been in this situation before

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.320 
think I've been in this situation before
this<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:37.990> what<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.170> do
