00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
let's go ahead and load up something i

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.740 
let's go ahead and load up something i
guess<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.270> Lily's<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:39.840> huh<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.800> uh<00:00:41.750> yeah

there's<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.010> proof<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.370> there

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
there's this is just proof that there

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.520 
there's this is just proof that there
can<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.879> done<00:00:45.149> more<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.079> done<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
can be done more can be done with the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.689 
can be done more can be done with the
aim<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:49.499> should<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.739> some<00:00:50.039> inspiration

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
aim so this should be some inspiration

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
minor bugs this I mean the most fight

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.649 
minor bugs this I mean the most fight
though<00:01:05.570> everything<00:01:06.570> works<00:01:06.840> completely<00:01:07.590> good

around now they're down sets this I got

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.700 
around now they're down sets this I got
a<00:01:14.430> notebook<00:01:17.600> from<00:01:18.600> experience<00:01:19.200> there's

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
a notebook from experience there's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
a notebook from experience there's
probably<00:01:20.250> not<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> way<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.090> toggle

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
probably not going to be a way to toggle

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.170 
probably not going to be a way to toggle
it<00:01:22.820> except<00:01:23.820> maybe<00:01:24.090> through<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> hot<00:01:24.960> keen<00:01:25.229> but

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
it except maybe through a hot keen but

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.969 
it except maybe through a hot keen but
still<00:01:27.180> still<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> progress<00:01:28.710> trying<00:01:28.920> to

still still in the progress trying to
figure<00:01:29.189> out<00:01:29.219> that'll<00:01:29.579> work<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.840> just

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
figure out that'll work but this is just

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.529 
figure out that'll work but this is just
some<00:01:31.560> evidence<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.719> uh<00:01:33.719> that<00:01:35.149> it<00:01:36.149> were<00:01:36.240> that

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
some evidence that uh that it were that
