00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
avalanche already two of them at the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.199 
avalanche already two of them at the
park<00:04:05.790> one<00:04:06.090> on<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.330> way<00:04:06.450> down<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:08.000> basically<00:04:09.000> we

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
park one on the way down so basically we

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.580 
park one on the way down so basically we
were<00:04:09.299> stuck<00:04:09.569> here<00:04:09.750> all<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.620> fresh<00:04:10.950> snow<00:04:11.129> and

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
were stuck here all this fresh snow and

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.129 
were stuck here all this fresh snow and
bad<00:04:13.590> weather<00:04:13.950> just<00:04:14.700> amplified<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.630> moments

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
bad weather just amplified the moments

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.860 
bad weather just amplified the moments
that<00:04:16.350> were<00:04:16.590> good<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:18.120> think<00:04:18.299> you'll<00:04:18.600> see

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
that were good and I think you'll see

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.400 
that were good and I think you'll see
that<00:04:19.049> in<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.380> final<00:04:19.829> film<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.900> when<00:04:22.049> we<00:04:22.169> came

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
that in the final film so when we came

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.290 
that in the final film so when we came
down<00:04:22.620> from<00:04:22.889> Valhalla<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.610> we<00:04:23.760> had<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.880> couple<00:04:24.120> of

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
down from Valhalla so we had a couple of

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.190 
down from Valhalla so we had a couple of
weeks<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.990> go<00:04:25.470> through<00:04:25.680> all<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.889> footage<00:04:26.070> and

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
weeks to go through all the footage and

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.659 
weeks to go through all the footage and
check<00:04:28.200> out<00:04:28.350> what<00:04:28.500> we'd<00:04:28.650> got<00:04:28.889> in<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.400> quickly

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
check out what we'd got in it it quickly

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.879 
check out what we'd got in it it quickly
became<00:04:30.060> pretty<00:04:30.360> apparent<00:04:30.419> that<00:04:30.900> we<00:04:31.740> just

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
became pretty apparent that we just

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.280 
became pretty apparent that we just
didn't<00:04:32.190> have<00:04:32.220> enough<00:04:32.340> stuff<00:04:33.150> from<00:04:33.540> from<00:04:34.169> the

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
didn't have enough stuff from from the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.670 
didn't have enough stuff from from the
pipe<00:04:34.500> shoot<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:35.040> kitchen<00:04:35.490> horn<00:04:36.139> so<00:04:37.139> we<00:04:37.290> decided

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
pipe shoot in kitchen horn so we decided

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.780 
pipe shoot in kitchen horn so we decided
to<00:04:38.160> head<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:38.970> South<00:04:39.360> Ferry<00:04:39.570> in<00:04:39.720> Switzerland

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
to head to South Ferry in Switzerland

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.640 
to head to South Ferry in Switzerland
which<00:04:41.790> was<00:04:42.330> one<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.810> only<00:04:43.050> places<00:04:44.090> that

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
which was one of the only places that

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.159 
which was one of the only places that
around<00:04:46.650> September<00:04:47.490> had<00:04:48.060> an<00:04:48.450> Olympic<00:04:48.930> sized

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
around September had an Olympic sized

00:04:49.169 --> 00:05:26.470 
around September had an Olympic sized
halfpipe

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:40.930 

let's<00:05:27.480> write<00:05:27.720> it<00:05:27.750> again

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.000
