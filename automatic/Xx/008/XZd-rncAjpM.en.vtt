love and we try to get along with them
but<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> difference<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.920> personalities

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
but then a difference in personalities

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.789 
but then a difference in personalities
makes<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> almost<00:01:48.180> impossible<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.170> seeing

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
makes it almost impossible and seeing

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
makes it almost impossible and seeing
those<00:01:50.040> two<00:01:50.100> work<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.060> find<00:01:51.299> something

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
those two work it out and find something

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.819 
those two work it out and find something
that<00:01:51.750> ties<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:52.079> together<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.680> something

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
that ties them together was something

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
that ties them together was something
that<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.549> enjoyed<00:01:53.909> there's<00:01:54.420> even<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that I really enjoyed there's even a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.359 
that I really enjoyed there's even a
twister<00:01:55.140> -<00:01:55.290> towards<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> end<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.159> in

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
twister - towards the end that in

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.670 
twister - towards the end that in
hindsight<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:58.200> should<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.409> seen

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
hindsight I really should have seen

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.950 
hindsight I really should have seen
coming<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> mentioned<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> review<00:02:00.600> for

think that it lent itself really well to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.930 
think that it lent itself really well to
this<00:02:07.200> particular<00:02:07.530> setting<00:02:08.099> his<00:02:08.489> extreme

this particular setting his extreme

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
this particular setting his extreme
proportions<00:02:09.270> mesh<00:02:09.810> really<00:02:10.140> well<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
proportions mesh really well with the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.010 
proportions mesh really well with the
master<00:02:11.280> wrestling<00:02:11.670> theme<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.480> allows<00:02:12.780> for

master wrestling theme and it allows for

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.680 
master wrestling theme and it allows for
