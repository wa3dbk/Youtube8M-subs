00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.170
 ranking as often 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.560
 ah it's true that it's hard 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.730
 Pakistan does not know the scene 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.460
 and it's almost white as much as likely that's because the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.419
 revelation 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.129
 tardy place that do not hold them in our opinion 2010 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.800
 but it's the revelation of the year by its pugnacity this performance or 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.870
 again the times of london this one 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.019
 that the receptions of the year on sale of course we are second 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.470
 people and we showed it's value in a year before 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.470
 and it's not good 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.890
 he does not stop patrick long 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.899
 Paris intends to continue to risk he hopes in fact a benefit 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.329
 totally wasting time stopping while in any case Roman 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.110
 some wine 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.370
 for Bernard who had exceeded his own anyway 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.560
 I come it gets hot and this battle it should be debate 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.860
 the scientists have been canceled 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.410
 he then carries on 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.730
 in prey to armed gangs are there 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730
 maybe that's what's driving the rising prices in this quest 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.840
 the other car of the team cofidis always associated with the racing group 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.250
 it will pass without ever doing anything 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.610
 at the crossroads with the foursome attacked at the top of the art 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.950
 the little hill 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.140
 it's good for the future of quebec everywhere 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.380
 give it a little bit of support 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.570
 because that's not what awaits him face on 20 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.340
 we know who imposed the Jews 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.400
 because to do so enter his opinion on a project for the sale of hotel assets 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.460
 a weakening 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.080
 because it's my 5th while dimande doubts its censorship well the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.840
 performances there will be hard to win without power and Roman dumas and there he 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.550
 is 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.770
 Sunday to put pressure on background from father to son 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.000
 for the contest is open we see it or next to the count near 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.670
 thirty years before the appearance of business you to see the performance 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.390
 of the car participated in five tenths 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.410
 but also balloons based on the hague according to bernard dubois c'est timo 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.690
 Bernhard von Anhalt at this time of the race it hurts a lot 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.080
 we manage to keep the gap at a Rennes stage 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.500
 tokyo towards the armageddon steering wheel bar of the porsche rs spyder have this 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.810
 week 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.190
 good for large open accounts in several areas will not be so much 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.910
 not enough to put directly in constructors' championship in addition to 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.010
 you
