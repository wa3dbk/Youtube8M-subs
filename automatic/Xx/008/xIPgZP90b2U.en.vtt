00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:10.840
 Hello, everyone today, a new kitchen 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:14.230
 forgive the curd pie greens 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.650
 for this you need cottage cheese from me 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 this case is so grainy me here 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.670
 600 grams sour cream 400 grams 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.930
 potions naturally salt and various 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.950
 spices and 5 sheets of yours in my 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.140
 in this case 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.590
 so first we will cook 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:41.620
 stuffing for her we grind in my 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:47.320
 In this case, green onion and dill lie 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:51.400
 tailbone I cut my greens add 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:56.040
 go there and spill your cottage cheese on all this 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.040
 mix well 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.110
 it's spring already so you can 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.340
 take some spring green garlic 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.490
 eg 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.100
 it goes well with ping and so 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.979
 Now the most interesting thing is to take the form and 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.520
 grease wheat vegetable oil 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.750
 what I have already done is take a pita sheet and 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.580
 we need to tear it into pieces 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.280
 some pieces will be perfect 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.049
 totally unimportant and what we do 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.729
 the next step we start laying 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.650
 slices one tier put take sour cream 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.610
 Sour cream is better to take of course in the package and 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.119
 then it is easier 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:44.490
 so here's a bottle and goes further 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:48.310
 layer your curd greens again 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.210
 slices of pita we put this kind of cake 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.210
 In general, on a fast hand, I am waiting for guests with 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.670
 minute to minute and so decided to please 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.240
 By such a delicacy, let all come 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:10.489
 Extremely just general pita savior 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:12.110
 our course is again a layer of cottage cheese 5 pieces 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.590
 our pita bread 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.410
 we stack each other neatly 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.020
 will be or not because actually in 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.170
 As a result , these leaves will not be visible 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.280
 it will simply be puffed 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.200
 the cake will be flaky with your new need 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.200
 will be that you have sour cream left 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.000
 because the last words are yours we will 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 pour sour cream he randomly 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.530
 mercilessly as you understand this cake 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.390
 baked for a very short time I think minutes 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.660
 25 at 180 degrees and but quite enough 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.540
 your top layer is naturally better 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.630
 as it is more true that the edges were not 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.140
 too and baths can be several layers 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.100
 because sour cream is all to us this rapid 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.970
 this pie will really be like puff 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.390
 test 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.540
 so the last layer is abundantly abundantly all 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.489
 grease bag for mumps and put in 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.000
 oven at one hundred eighty two hundred 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.850
 degrees at 25 minutes as i said 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.970
 this will be enough and so this 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.579
 wonderful cake I turned he had 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.030
 very hot so we let it cool 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:32.239
 and then get out of shape and so is our 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.959
 curd cake with curd and herbs is ready 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.680
 tasty and quick dish all enjoyable 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.680
 appetite
