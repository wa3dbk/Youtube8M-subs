Batarang at and knock them all out at
once<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.300> sounds<00:00:27.630> cool

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
once that sounds cool

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.780 
once that sounds cool
yeah<00:00:28.519> but<00:00:30.619> by<00:00:31.619> far<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> best<00:00:32.489> way<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> get

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
yeah but by far the best way to get

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.549 
yeah but by far the best way to get
experience<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.540> game<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.140> getting

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
experience in this game is just getting

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.770 
experience in this game is just getting
the<00:00:34.739> longest<00:00:35.340> combos<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.120> possibly<00:00:36.300> can

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the longest combos that you possibly can

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.510 
the longest combos that you possibly can
so<00:00:38.420> yeah<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.950> decided<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.070> take<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> little<00:00:41.399> bit

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
so yeah I decided to take a little bit

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.060 
so yeah I decided to take a little bit
harder<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.989> more<00:00:43.110> experience<00:00:43.700> huh

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
harder and just get more experience huh

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.410 
harder and just get more experience huh
so<00:00:47.070> after<00:00:47.250> my<00:00:47.370> third<00:00:47.610> time<00:00:47.850> through<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> game

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so after my third time through the game

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.869 
so after my third time through the game
like<00:00:49.170> my<00:00:49.289> first<00:00:49.500> time<00:00:49.590> through<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> game<00:00:50.100> when

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
like my first time through the game when

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.150 
like my first time through the game when
I<00:00:50.910> wasn't<00:00:51.239> getting<00:00:51.600> super<00:00:51.930> long<00:00:52.110> combos<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.950 

but<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> will<00:00:56.399> probably<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> lot<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.629> than
