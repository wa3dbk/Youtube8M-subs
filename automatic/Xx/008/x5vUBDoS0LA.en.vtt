a one-off aeroplane so it's really

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.650 
a one-off aeroplane so it's really

to<00:01:56.550> put<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.630> elements<00:01:57.720> on<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> single

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
to put all the elements on a single

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.620 
to put all the elements on a single
cooling<00:01:58.830> circuit<00:01:59.270> being<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.420> power

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
cooling circuit being the power

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.780 
cooling circuit being the power
controller<00:02:01.050> motor<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:01.980> some<00:02:02.130> other<00:02:02.340> bits<00:02:02.610> are

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
controller motor and some other bits are

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.450 
controller motor and some other bits are
all<00:02:03.000> called<00:02:03.330> by<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.630> same<00:02:04.110> coolant<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.190> pump

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
all called by the same coolant and pump

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.210 
all called by the same coolant and pump
and<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.630> same<00:02:06.840> engine<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.800> expect

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and this is the same engine you expect

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.300 
and this is the same engine you expect
to<00:02:08.369> use<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.970> paint<00:02:09.539> thera<00:02:09.840> aircraft<00:02:10.590> in
