00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.450
 hello in this video let's see how 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.870
 prepare chicken sirloin chunks 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.780
 with bacon for this we need a 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.990
 ChÃ©s package of bacon 810 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.430
 chicken sirloins and clean salt and 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.700
 olive oil 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.980
 well to start we take a piece of 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.980
 chicken and we're going to start it by cutting 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.340
 with a scissors 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.450
 we do it like this in small pieces 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.350
 more or less to be able to take three pieces 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.350
 for each chicken strip 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.820
 and once you have all the chicken 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.820
 chopped what we do is 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.110
 we take a slice of bacon 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.110
 and the other one is also 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.920
 and when it is already cut we take a 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.409
 piece of bacon 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.799
 and we put them like that 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.869
 as you see the bacon and the chicken stuck and 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.890
 we are placing it until we do the same 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.890
 with all the pieces 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.500
 well once we've put all 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.880
 the pieces of chicken with bacon as you see 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.770
 Over there 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.830
 Now what we are going to do is make them 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.560
 with a frying pan 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.870
 to the strong fire we throw a little 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.680
 oil and we're going to start doing them for 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.420
 we take a spatula 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.420
 and we put the pieces of chicken 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.750
 we are putting them on the side of the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.750
 bacon face 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.410
 the game 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.980
 you can put knots 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.980
 and we put 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.820
 so first for the part of the war 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.510
 we put the lid 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.400
 and we raise the fire to 7 more or less fire 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.569
 strong so he would wait until he waited 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.579
 let all be done 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.609
 and well this is how it would finally be 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.700
 our delicious dish would now be already 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.790
 high once already fried all together 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.530
 to place on the table and serve it well 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.280
 so good that's been all in this 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.280
