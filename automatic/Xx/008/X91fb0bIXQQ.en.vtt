00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.549

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.939
 drive wheels and winter tires that that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:24.590
 is going to be simple lamborghini nova gallardo 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.590
 lp 560-4 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.510
 good if you were with us at the world 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.730
 of the automobile you remember 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.220
 maybe that made fun of this 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.590
 new gallardo ray match it was 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.670
 lousy to grow old yeah good we need 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.809
 understand also we were waiting for the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.160
 news and what we had we had 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.809
 a new healing rest the second 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.129
 restitution was disappointed it's obliged 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.620
 is we are still difficult but 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.059
 it's like that but hey 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.650
 lamborghini know how to do it they have us 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.360
 invited to come and try it then our 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.659
 judgment on the aesthetics of the car 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.080
 we were not going to stop at that we are 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.350
 come and try it then what 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.010
 change on this new gallardo 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.470
 so then that will go quickly 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.460
 two triangles in front of people on the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.140
 rear triangle side 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.030
 we can go from years 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.110
 Earlier you might say well that's 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.330
 even better than outside because 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.880
 it changes at all good know anyway 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.960
 one thing is that the old look 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.119
 of the car is always available 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.490
 on the lp570 versions called 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.960
 now edition of teknika and 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.790
 Also on two wheels versions 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.440
 motor still in the catalog 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.910
 so you have gallardo so 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.600
 different and with two looks 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.189
 different 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.320
 for the nostalgic of the old where 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.610
 she's going you can always buy good 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.950
 well, if it does not change out 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.659
 if it does not change in us what we 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.750
 would like to know if it does not change on the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.750
 road 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.079
 Ah yes 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.550
 1 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.579
 so it's going to be chambered outside we said that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.250
 will change in and that must change in 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.739
 mechanically keep his hood there 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.870
 but there's a healthier thing 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:41.540
 that the Germans do not have these 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.650
 italianity here we have a box 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.659
 ignore who's optional always and 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.069
 yes and yes she is still old 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.750
 also she too like the car and 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.730
 so we give a little jerk but 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.549
 well we do it I do not think I have 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:59.069
 accelerated once then dark as nothing 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.370
 did not change the deal always 560 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.859
 horses 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.530
 we still have 749 m of torque in fact 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.900
 we still have the same v10 5 liters 2010 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.819
 german who walks like an italian 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.849
 It's a war, the same 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.260
 that before there was we were good and 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.879
 it's still good four 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.900
 drive wheels we do not feel too much 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.549
 comes from time to time or cloned he 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.500
 pull a little but still go 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.180
 final hold that it slips a I say 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.400
 frankly it's still pretty light 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.659
 power a little bit of inertia 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.950
 motor when you press 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.500
 the accelerator we would have liked someone 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.489
 who can live more by cons there ago 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.519
 the rest and we can put it on off 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.040
 norma palmyr is in rabbit skin we have 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.590
 took a little to the fluff to make 4 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.940
 it's basically the town hall 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.920
 we wonder what you do we came 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.129
 on pleasure finally science but not the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.129
 rail 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:59.440
 good bah the painful 1 152 1400 euros 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.180
 excluding taxes and especially the 6000 euros of 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.110
 malus happens what do not believe anyway 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.840
 that you have escaped the same 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.610
 now we make you a car not 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.540
 far from 200 me is what an old 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.240
 lady deserves that to see you but 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:18.450
 sorry this time there are some who work and 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.450
 yeah it's going to have rushed shreds
