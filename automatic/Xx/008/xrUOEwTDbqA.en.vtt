00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
let's go ahead and change that camera

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.500 
let's go ahead and change that camera
angle<00:00:32.619> I'm<00:00:33.280> going<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.550> roll<00:00:33.910> up<00:00:33.940> my<00:00:34.120> shorts

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
action actually can see the quad and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.920 
action actually can see the quad and
what<00:00:39.190> you're<00:00:39.280> gonna<00:00:39.370> do<00:00:39.609> is<00:00:39.850> this<00:00:40.359> can<00:00:40.600> be<00:00:40.750> done

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
what you're gonna do is this can be done

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.660 
what you're gonna do is this can be done
with<00:00:41.109> a<00:00:41.140> band<00:00:41.440> in<00:00:41.800> fact<00:00:42.129> in<00:00:42.280> physical<00:00:42.640> therapy

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
with a band in fact in physical therapy

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.569 
with a band in fact in physical therapy
you'll<00:00:43.300> see<00:00:43.570> it<00:00:43.769> mostly<00:00:44.769> done<00:00:45.070> with<00:00:45.100> a<00:00:45.280> band

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
you'll see it mostly done with a band

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.290 
you'll see it mostly done with a band
and<00:00:45.940> I<00:00:46.920> like<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.039> do<00:00:48.160> it<00:00:48.250> with<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.370> cable<00:00:48.699> because

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
and I like to do it with a cable because

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.439 
and I like to do it with a cable because
it's<00:00:49.449> more<00:00:49.690> consistent<00:00:50.079> resistance<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.789> I

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
it's more consistent resistance and I

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's more consistent resistance and I
think<00:00:53.320> it's<00:00:53.949> much<00:00:54.219> better<00:00:54.519> and<00:00:54.999> you'll<00:00:55.210> get

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
think it's much better and you'll get

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.509 
think it's much better and you'll get
quicker<00:00:57.010> results<00:00:57.550> this<00:00:57.730> way<00:00:57.940> you'll<00:00:58.839> need<00:00:59.079> a

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
quicker results this way you'll need a

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.029 
quicker results this way you'll need a
piece<00:01:00.519> that<00:01:00.550> goes<00:01:00.850> around<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:02.379> back<00:01:02.649> of<00:01:02.949> the

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
piece that goes around the back of the

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.880 
piece that goes around the back of the
knee<00:01:03.300> hopefully<00:01:04.300> it's<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.379> strap<00:01:05.860> that's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
knee hopefully it's a strap that's

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.650 
knee hopefully it's a strap that's
padded<00:01:06.960> nicely<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.650> won't<00:01:09.120> chafe<00:01:10.120> the<00:01:10.330> skin

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
padded nicely so it won't chafe the skin

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.550 
padded nicely so it won't chafe the skin
too<00:01:10.900> much<00:01:12.240> number<00:01:13.240> one<00:01:13.480> keep<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.200> heel

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
too much number one keep the heel

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.130 
too much number one keep the heel
planted<00:01:15.100> at<00:01:15.220> all<00:01:15.370> times<00:01:15.730> the<00:01:16.240> motion<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:16.960> going

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
planted at all times the motion is going

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.680 
planted at all times the motion is going
to<00:01:17.200> be<00:01:17.670> you're<00:01:18.670> gonna<00:01:18.760> be<00:01:18.880> moving<00:01:19.210> your<00:01:19.540> knee

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
to be you're gonna be moving your knee

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.380 
to be you're gonna be moving your knee
forward<00:01:20.110> but<00:01:20.710> if<00:01:20.830> your<00:01:20.980> heel<00:01:21.220> lifts<00:01:21.610> up<00:01:21.760> that's

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
forward but if your heel lifts up that's

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.180 
forward but if your heel lifts up that's
gonna<00:01:22.600> cancel<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.200> exercise<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.640> heel<00:01:25.630> down

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a psychological link right so you can if

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.840 
a psychological link right so you can if

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
which is going to be working to some

extent try and override that and put
your<00:02:20.770> fingers<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.340> there<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.810> really<00:02:23.080> focus

your fingers on there and really focus

your fingers on there and really focus
in<00:02:23.740> on<00:02:23.770> getting<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:25.540> muscle<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.080> fire<00:02:27.000> so

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
in on getting that muscle to fire so

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.990 
in on getting that muscle to fire so
it's<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.630> simple<00:02:28.780> as<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.560> would<00:02:30.310> start<00:02:30.880> out

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
it's as simple as that I would start out

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.030 
it's as simple as that I would start out
with<00:02:31.210> higher<00:02:31.480> reps<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.200> lighter<00:02:32.500> weights<00:02:32.770> to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
with higher reps and lighter weights to

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.260 
with higher reps and lighter weights to
begin<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:33.550> because<00:02:33.730> you're<00:02:33.940> trying<00:02:34.150> to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
begin with because you're trying to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.110 
begin with because you're trying to
isolate<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.590> vastus<00:02:36.340> medialis<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.000> you're

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
isolate the vastus medialis so you're

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.900 
isolate the vastus medialis so you're
looking<00:02:37.360> at<00:02:37.480> reps<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.930> anywhere<00:02:38.650> from<00:02:38.920> 15<00:02:39.880> to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
looking at reps of anywhere from 15 to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.270 
looking at reps of anywhere from 15 to
25<00:02:40.300> rep<00:02:40.720> ranges<00:02:41.170> once<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.800> get<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.100> technique

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
25 rep ranges once you get the technique

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.090 
25 rep ranges once you get the technique
down<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.180> your<00:02:43.900> endurance<00:02:44.200> built<00:02:44.620> up<00:02:44.830> in<00:02:45.010> that

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
down and your endurance built up in that

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.280 
down and your endurance built up in that
muscle<00:02:45.580> go<00:02:46.150> ahead<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.600> increase<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.080> weight

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
muscle go ahead and increase the weight

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.490 
muscle go ahead and increase the weight
so<00:02:48.250> that's<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.150> great<00:02:49.390> way<00:02:49.540> it's<00:02:50.170> one<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.410> my

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
so that's a great way it's one of my

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.050 
so that's a great way it's one of my
favorite<00:02:50.920> ways<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.100> work<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.520> vastus

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
favorite ways to work the vastus

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.400 
favorite ways to work the vastus
medialis<00:02:52.390> because<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.840> can<00:02:52.990> do<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> knee

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
medialis because you can do a knee

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.060 
medialis because you can do a knee
extension<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:55.200> isolate<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.350> but<00:02:56.590> it's<00:02:56.740> closed

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
extension and isolate it but it's closed

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.760 
extension and isolate it but it's closed
