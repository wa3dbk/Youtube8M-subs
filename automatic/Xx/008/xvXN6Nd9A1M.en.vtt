00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
I think it's because I don't do a lot of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.679 
I think it's because I don't do a lot of
social<00:00:28.890> media<00:00:29.130> stuff<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.670> people<00:00:30.599> forget

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
explosive stuff so that was crazy like
it's<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.979> morphling<00:01:29.400> die<00:01:29.579> vac<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:30.030> probably

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
it's the morphling die vac was probably

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.580 
it's the morphling die vac was probably
my<00:01:30.390> favorite<00:01:30.750> moment<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> tournament<00:01:31.560> so

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
my favorite moment of the tournament so

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.260 
my favorite moment of the tournament so
far<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.189> was<00:01:32.340> very<00:01:32.520> reminiscent<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.210> what

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
far it was very reminiscent of what

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.719 
far it was very reminiscent of what
happened<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.430> Excalibur<00:01:35.430> tinker

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
happened in the the Excalibur tinker

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.580 
happened in the the Excalibur tinker
game<00:01:35.880> against<00:01:36.119> DK<00:01:36.299> were<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.170> hero<00:01:37.409> just

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
game against DK were just one hero just

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.260 
game against DK were just one hero just
wiping<00:01:38.250> over<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> pot<00:01:38.700> although<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.180> this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
wiping over in a pot although in this

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.090 
wiping over in a pot although in this
case<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.659> was<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> lot<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.530> support<00:01:40.920> from

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
case it was with a lot of support from

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
case it was with a lot of support from
the<00:01:41.340> elder<00:01:41.549> Titan<00:01:41.820> or<00:01:41.909> they<00:01:42.240> whisper<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:42.960> a

guys<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.509> stumbled<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> bit<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.920> what

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
guys kind of stumbled a bit what what

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.679 
guys kind of stumbled a bit what what
kind<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.430> happened<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.000> think<00:01:48.210> was

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
kind of happened there do you think was

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.149 
kind of happened there do you think was
what<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.110> attribute<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> loss<00:01:49.920> there

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
what do you attribute to the loss there

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.399 
what do you attribute to the loss there
I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:50.549> our<00:01:50.820> our<00:01:51.149> drafts<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:51.689> pretty<00:01:51.930> weak<00:01:52.140> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I think our our drafts was pretty weak I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.260 
I think our our drafts was pretty weak I
mean<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.100> made<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.640> mistakes<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:54.119> as

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
mean we made a lot of mistakes like as

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.359 
mean we made a lot of mistakes like as
you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.689> they<00:01:54.780> had<00:01:54.899> no<00:01:55.049> stun<00:01:55.350> DPD<00:01:56.159> being

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
you can see they had no stun DPD being

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.380 
you can see they had no stun DPD being
thrown<00:01:56.549> under<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> bus

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
thrown under the bus

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.170 
thrown under the bus
he's<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.950> was<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> team<00:01:59.250> draft<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.729> yeah

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
he's like it was a team draft but yeah

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.359 
he's like it was a team draft but yeah
our<00:02:00.659> draft<00:02:00.899> was<00:02:01.049> weak<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.189> we<00:02:02.250> played

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
our draft was weak and I think we played

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.499 
our draft was weak and I think we played
really<00:02:02.579> poorly<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.119> could<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.360> won

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
really poorly like we could have won

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.910 
really poorly like we could have won
because<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.990> think<00:02:04.049> we're<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.500> better<00:02:04.680> team

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
because I think we're just a better team

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.520 
because I think we're just a better team
but<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:06.030> made<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> lot<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> mistakes<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
but we made a lot of mistakes for the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.979 
but we made a lot of mistakes for the
game<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.429> draft<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.390> got<00:02:09.509> thrown<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.810> mean

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
game and the draft you got thrown I mean

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.390 
game and the draft you got thrown I mean
I<00:02:10.229> was<00:02:10.379> not<00:02:10.619> expecting<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:11.099> vici<00:02:11.370> gaming

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I was not expecting a vici gaming

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
if you look at their lineup they're

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.840 
if you look at their lineup they're
trying<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.320> just<00:02:38.650> get<00:02:39.070> aggressive<00:02:39.459> early<00:02:39.730> and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
trying to just get aggressive early and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.000 
trying to just get aggressive early and
trying<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.090> fight<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.480> if<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.290> have<00:02:41.560> tinker

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
trying to fight and if we have tinker

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.930 
trying to fight and if we have tinker
off<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> good<00:02:42.459> start<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:42.850> we<00:02:42.910> have

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
off to a good start and we have

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.310 
off to a good start and we have
timbersaw<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:43.600> really<00:02:43.870> hard<00:02:44.050> for<00:02:44.080> them<00:02:44.200> to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
timbersaw it's really hard for them to

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.110 
timbersaw it's really hard for them to
take<00:02:44.500> flights<00:02:44.740> underneath<00:02:45.100> our<00:02:45.250> towers<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:46.060> we

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
take flights underneath our towers so we

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.510 
take flights underneath our towers so we
just<00:02:46.270> farmed<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.930> we<00:02:47.860> had<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.070> better<00:02:48.190> heroes

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
just farmed and we had the better heroes

the grant files I don't know if they've

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.350 
the grant files I don't know if they've
been<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:27.030> convincing<00:03:28.030> all<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.269> way

I<00:03:31.120> think<00:03:31.840> DK<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.200> definitely<00:03:32.769> our<00:03:32.950> biggest

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
I think DK is definitely our biggest

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.860 
I think DK is definitely our biggest
challenge<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.120> it's<00:03:34.420> only<00:03:34.540> fitting<00:03:34.810> that

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
challenge and it's only fitting that

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.990 
challenge and it's only fitting that
we've<00:03:35.110> played<00:03:35.530> them<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.799> finals<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.580> think

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
we've played them in the finals I think

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.660 
we've played them in the finals I think
I'm<00:03:37.720> hoping<00:03:37.989> for<00:03:38.049> a<00:03:38.530> good<00:03:38.830> series<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.489> think

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
I'm hoping for a good series and I think

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.100 
I'm hoping for a good series and I think
we<00:03:39.760> have<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> very<00:03:40.120> good<00:03:40.269> shot<00:03:40.420> at<00:03:40.510> winning<00:03:40.540> okay

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
we have a very good shot at winning okay

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.330 
we have a very good shot at winning okay
yeah<00:03:41.290> you've<00:03:41.410> lost<00:03:41.590> them<00:03:41.739> three<00:03:41.980> times<00:03:42.130> on

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
yeah you've lost them three times on

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.470 
yeah you've lost them three times on
land<00:03:42.489> before<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:42.970> can<00:03:43.060> get<00:03:43.180> some<00:03:43.299> revenge

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
land before so you can get some revenge

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.940 
land before so you can get some revenge
you<00:03:43.810> know<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.140> match<00:03:44.320> that<00:03:44.500> matters<00:03:44.769> most

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
you know the match that matters most

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.310 
you know the match that matters most
perhaps<00:03:45.340> but<00:03:46.090> what<00:03:46.870> do<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:46.989> think<00:03:47.079> is<00:03:47.230> gonna

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
perhaps but what do you think is gonna

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.750 
perhaps but what do you think is gonna
be<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.500> key<00:03:47.620> going<00:03:47.799> up<00:03:47.950> against<00:03:48.190> DK<00:03:48.370> what<00:03:48.700> do

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
be the key going up against DK what do

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.699 
be the key going up against DK what do
you<00:03:48.820> guys<00:03:48.940> need<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.360> beat<00:03:49.510> them<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.959> think

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
you guys need you to beat them I think

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.150 
you guys need you to beat them I think
the<00:03:51.100> key<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.910> get<00:03:52.690> off<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.440> good<00:03:53.799> start<00:03:54.010> in

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
the key is to get off to a good start in

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.400 
the key is to get off to a good start in
in<00:03:54.430> lanes<00:03:54.760> like<00:03:55.120> early<00:03:55.420> game<00:03:55.570> if<00:03:56.049> we<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.290> get

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
in lanes like early game if we can get

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.539 
in lanes like early game if we can get
off<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.620> early<00:03:56.799> game<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.040> think<00:03:57.220> we're<00:03:57.310> off<00:03:57.430> to

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
off the early game I think we're off to

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.550 
off the early game I think we're off to
an<00:03:57.640> even<00:03:57.940> footing<00:03:58.090> with<00:03:58.360> them<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.720> then<00:03:59.410> it's

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
an even footing with them and then it's

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.470 
an even footing with them and then it's
just<00:03:59.739> whoever<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.760> better<00:04:00.910> term<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.299> gonna

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
just whoever is the better term is gonna

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.610 
just whoever is the better term is gonna
win<00:04:01.660> okay

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620
