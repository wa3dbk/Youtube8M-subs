00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
Masters is not that great I don't think

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.439

the<00:00:22.710> format's<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.160> slow<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.090> will<00:00:24.269> give

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the format's that slow that it will give

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.420 
the format's that slow that it will give
you<00:00:24.660> enough<00:00:25.289> consistency<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.980> takes<00:00:26.189> time<00:00:26.400> to

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you enough consistency it takes time to

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.450 
you enough consistency it takes time to
build<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.210> don't<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.920> mean<00:00:29.160> yeah<00:00:29.310> it

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
build up I don't like it I mean yeah it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.330 
build up I don't like it I mean yeah it
could<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.760> really<00:00:29.970> swingy<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.289> lot<00:00:31.859> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
could be really swingy but it's a lot to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.479 
could be really swingy but it's a lot to
invest<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.420> make<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.630> may<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:33.899> worthwhile

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
invest in to make it may be worthwhile

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.549 
invest in to make it may be worthwhile
goblin<00:00:35.489> boom<00:00:35.640> keg<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.300> good<00:00:36.540> heroes<00:00:37.200> blade

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
goblin boom keg is not good heroes blade

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.350 
goblin boom keg is not good heroes blade
is<00:00:37.770> really<00:00:38.280> narrow<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.940> could<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.210> really

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
is really narrow it could be really

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
is really narrow it could be really
strong<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> lot<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.710> legendaries

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
strong if you have a lot of legendaries

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.250 
strong if you have a lot of legendaries
otherwise<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.969> wouldn't<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.510> wouldn't<00:00:42.750> waste<00:00:43.140> my

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
otherwise I wouldn't I wouldn't waste my

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.819 
otherwise I wouldn't I wouldn't waste my
time<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.680> huge<00:00:44.640> stone<00:00:44.940> retainers<00:00:45.539> I

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
time with it huge stone retainers I

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.420 
time with it huge stone retainers I
think<00:00:46.829> yeah<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.850> 3444<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.160> most<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> time

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
think yeah it's 3444 but most the time

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.990 
think yeah it's 3444 but most the time
it's<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:52.520> it's<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it's going to be it's going to be a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.090 
it's going to be it's going to be a
little<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.449> expensive<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.500> fine<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
little bit expensive it's it's fine it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
little bit expensive it's it's fine it
could<00:00:56.370> work<00:00:56.399> depending<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.420> deck

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
could work depending on the kind of deck

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.760 
could work depending on the kind of deck
if<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:57.809> running<00:00:57.899> very<00:00:58.199> aggressive<00:00:58.649> it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
if you're running very aggressive it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.529 
if you're running very aggressive it
could<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:58.949> really<00:00:59.100> strong<00:00:59.489> pilgrims<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
could be really strong pilgrims of the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.740 
could be really strong pilgrims of the
fires<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> really

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
fires kind of it kind of is really

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.590 
fires kind of it kind of is really
powerful<00:01:04.519> but<00:01:05.519> also<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:06.000> dangerous<00:01:06.420> I

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
powerful but also really dangerous I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200 
powerful but also really dangerous I
like<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.890> avoids<00:01:08.130> most<00:01:08.460> damage<00:01:08.850> removal

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
like that it avoids most damage removal

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.260 
like that it avoids most damage removal
in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> set<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:10.049> all<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.439> most<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:12.030> also

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
in the set not all but most and it also

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.300 
in the set not all but most and it also
protects<00:01:13.200> its<00:01:13.380> out<00:01:13.500> by<00:01:13.650> having<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> strike

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
protects its out by having for a strike

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.649 
protects its out by having for a strike
which<00:01:14.640> means<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> simply

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
which means it's not going to simply

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.210 
which means it's not going to simply
trade<00:01:15.900> most<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> time<00:01:16.530> it'll<00:01:16.710> kill<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
trade most of the time it'll kill and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.219 
trade most of the time it'll kill and
then<00:01:17.310> punch<00:01:17.549> through<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.060> you're<00:01:18.689> attacking

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
then punch through if you're attacking

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.160 
then punch through if you're attacking
it<00:01:19.500> seems<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:20.070> seven<00:01:20.430> mana<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.299> probably

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it seems like seven mana is probably

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.100 
it seems like seven mana is probably
necessary<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:22.920> card<00:01:23.189> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.869> don't

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
necessary for this card if you don't

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.749 
necessary for this card if you don't
have<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.290> lot<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.439> big<00:01:25.680> bombs<00:01:25.890> definitely<00:01:26.610> run

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
have a lot of big bombs definitely run

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.300 
have a lot of big bombs definitely run
this<00:01:26.909> guy<00:01:27.170> mugen's<00:01:28.170> construct<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
this guy mugen's construct I think it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.300 
this guy mugen's construct I think it
could<00:01:29.640> work<00:01:29.880> well<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:31.290> things<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
could work well with things like you

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.260 
could work well with things like you
sacrifice<00:01:32.700> creature<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.909> bolster<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
sacrifice creature to to bolster to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.850 
sacrifice creature to to bolster to
whatever<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.259> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.530> thing<00:01:37.590> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
whatever like that kind of thing it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.260 
whatever like that kind of thing it
could<00:01:38.009> work<00:01:38.220> well<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.030> four<00:01:39.240> or

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
could work well with this is for four or

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.580 
could work well with this is for four or
five<00:01:39.390> 5<00:01:39.780> 44<00:01:40.590> 45<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.430> good<00:01:41.670> anyway<00:01:42.590> but

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
five 5 44 45 which is good anyway but

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.260 
five 5 44 45 which is good anyway but
the<00:01:43.680> fact<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.890> requires<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.520> sacrifice<00:01:44.729> could

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the fact that requires a sacrifice could

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.899

you're<00:01:52.500> working<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.939> land<00:01:53.939> wise<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.659> could

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you're working with land wise you could

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.690 
you're working with land wise you could
pull<00:01:55.140> fetch<00:01:55.350> lines<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> set<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> do

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
pull fetch lines in the set so if you do

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.660 
pull fetch lines in the set so if you do
well<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:58.079> terms<00:01:58.259> of

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
well there you go in terms of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.130 
well there you go in terms of
multicolored<00:01:59.670> X<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.060> would<00:02:00.570> use<00:02:00.780> them<00:02:00.960> for

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
multicolored X I would use them for

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.580 
multicolored X I would use them for
fixing<00:02:01.670> crucible<00:02:02.670> espero<00:02:02.909> dragon<00:02:03.469> they<00:02:04.469> were

the storage lines whatever particularly

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.320 
the storage lines whatever particularly
awesome<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.890> could<00:02:08.160> work<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.879> are<00:02:09.000> running

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
awesome it could work if you are running

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.580 
awesome it could work if you are running
a<00:02:09.539> bunch<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.810> colors<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> bunch

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
a bunch of colors and you have a bunch

you<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.610> one<00:02:12.790> color<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:13.750> could<00:02:13.959> be

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
you of one color so it could be

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.509 
you of one color so it could be

functional that way otherwise it's

they're<00:02:21.580> great<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.180> then<00:02:22.599> basic<00:02:22.989> lines<00:02:23.170> well

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
they're great and then basic lines well

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.470 
they're great and then basic lines well

fairy dragon there's not much to say if
you<00:02:32.319> or<00:02:32.470> don't<00:02:32.709> run<00:02:32.950> him<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.400> limited<00:02:33.790> you're

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
you or don't run him in limited you're

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.199 
you or don't run him in limited you're
doing<00:02:34.150> something<00:02:34.480> wrong<00:02:34.690> because<00:02:35.110> he<00:02:35.709> is<00:02:36.209> most

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
doing something wrong because he is most

doing something wrong because he is most
planeswalkers<00:02:38.019> are<00:02:38.230> automatic<00:02:39.069> includes<00:02:39.489> and

planeswalkers are automatic includes and

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.000 
planeswalkers are automatic includes and
he<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.120> most<00:02:40.269> flexible<00:02:40.750> powerhouse<00:02:41.290> card

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
he is the most flexible powerhouse card

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.539 
he is the most flexible powerhouse card
you<00:02:42.220> can<00:02:42.400> probably<00:02:42.700> get<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.599> entire<00:02:43.840> set

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
you can probably get in the entire set

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.000 
you can probably get in the entire set
so<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:45.579> would<00:02:46.090> probably<00:02:46.690> run<00:02:47.349> him<00:02:47.590> or<00:02:47.829> you're

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
so I would probably run him or you're

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.009 
so I would probably run him or you're
doing<00:02:48.190> something<00:02:48.280> wrong<00:02:48.610> he<00:02:48.940> kills<00:02:49.720> things

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
doing something wrong he kills things

through<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.489> set<00:03:12.700> hopefully<00:03:13.150> some<00:03:13.599> of<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
through the set hopefully some of the

things I mentioned will help you when
you're<00:03:15.430> working<00:03:15.940> on<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.810> were<00:03:16.930> sealed<00:03:17.230> deck

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
you're working on you were sealed deck

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.910 
you're working on you were sealed deck
this<00:03:17.950> weekend<00:03:18.370> hopefully<00:03:18.579> you'll<00:03:18.880> have<00:03:19.209> some

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
this weekend hopefully you'll have some

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.720 
this weekend hopefully you'll have some
idea<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.010> which<00:03:21.160> cards<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.700> should

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
idea of which cards you should

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.220 
idea of which cards you should
definitely<00:03:22.090> see<00:03:22.359> you're<00:03:22.480> clear<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.720> cards<00:03:23.170> you

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
definitely see you're clear of cards you

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.720 
definitely see you're clear of cards you
should<00:03:23.260> weigh<00:03:23.650> more<00:03:23.950> heavily<00:03:23.980> which<00:03:24.459> cards

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
should weigh more heavily which cards

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.180 
should weigh more heavily which cards
you<00:03:24.790> should<00:03:24.819> probably<00:03:25.329> auto<00:03:25.660> include<00:03:26.130> etc<00:03:27.130> etc
