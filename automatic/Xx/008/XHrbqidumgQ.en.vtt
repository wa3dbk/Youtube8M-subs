00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
place now I'm ready to start now when I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.069 
place now I'm ready to start now when I
work<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.739> large<00:00:41.160> bag<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.969> icing<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.690> this

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
work with a large bag of icing like this

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.470 
work with a large bag of icing like this
if<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.920> hold<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.520> decorate<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.239> from

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
if I was to hold it and decorate it from

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.470 
if I was to hold it and decorate it from
this<00:00:45.690> point<00:00:46.219> my<00:00:47.219> hand<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.090> tired

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
this point my hand would get very tired

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.360 
this point my hand would get very tired
because<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.960> really<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.680> push<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> lot<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
because I really have to push a lot to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.220 
because I really have to push a lot to
get<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.789> much<00:00:51.030> icing<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.840> through<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
get that much icing to go through the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.790 
get that much icing to go through the
tip<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.600> grab<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.230> down<00:00:55.469> where

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
tip so what I do is grab it down where

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.459 
tip so what I do is grab it down where
it's<00:00:55.949> closer<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.329> twist<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it's closer and just twist that up so it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.790 
it's closer and just twist that up so it
stays<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.969> I'm<00:01:00.120> ready<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> work<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
stays and then I'm ready to work when I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.009

star is done at a 90 degree angle with
the<00:01:12.000> tip<00:01:12.330> slightly<00:01:12.750> off<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.439> surface<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
the tip slightly off the surface and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
the tip slightly off the surface and
it's<00:01:15.270> best<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> keep<00:01:15.810> your<00:01:15.960> arms<00:01:16.320> off<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
table I'm going to squeeze the icing

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.940 
table I'm going to squeeze the icing
stop<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:21.030> pressure<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:22.229> lift<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.680> away

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
stop my pressure and then lift it away

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.060 
stop my pressure and then lift it away
and<00:01:23.189> then<00:01:23.700> we've<00:01:23.880> got<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> nice<00:01:24.360> star<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.890> can

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and then we've got a nice star you can

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.550 
and then we've got a nice star you can
actually<00:01:26.490> make<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> border<00:01:27.299> by<00:01:28.189> repeating<00:01:29.189> this

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
actually make a border by repeating this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.050 
actually make a border by repeating this
with<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> stars<00:01:32.040> close<00:01:32.549> together<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:35.030> make<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
with the stars close together and make a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.679 
with the stars close together and make a
border<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.689> would<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.079> around<00:01:37.350> your<00:01:37.890> cake

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.300 

now<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.990> mentioned<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> previous<00:01:44.100> video

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
now as I mentioned on a previous video

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.990 
now as I mentioned on a previous video
there's<00:01:44.759> many<00:01:45.119> sizes<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.140> star<00:01:46.530> tips<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.369> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
there's many sizes of star tips and I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.179 
there's many sizes of star tips and I
most<00:01:48.270> often<00:01:48.720> use<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> larger<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.950> this

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
most often use a larger one like this

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.310 
most often use a larger one like this
when<00:01:50.460> I'm<00:01:50.579> working<00:01:50.970> around<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.570> base<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
when I'm working around the base of a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.649 
when I'm working around the base of a
cake<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> top<00:01:53.759> because<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.360> me<00:01:54.479> that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
cake not at the top because to me that

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.289 
cake not at the top because to me that
feels<00:01:54.960> too<00:01:55.259> large<00:01:55.530> because<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> size<00:01:57.090> of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
feels too large because on the size of

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.819 
feels too large because on the size of
your<00:01:57.329> cake<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.990> use<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:58.710> an

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
your cake so use one that's an

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
your cake so use one that's an
appropriate<00:01:59.189> size<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.060> size<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.420> your

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
appropriate size for the size of your

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.539 
appropriate size for the size of your
cake<00:02:03.259> there's<00:02:04.259> another<00:02:04.560> technique<00:02:04.860> called<00:02:05.130> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
cake there's another technique called a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.580 
cake there's another technique called a
star<00:02:05.820> fill-in<00:02:06.360> method<00:02:06.810> where<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.110> would<00:02:07.380> make

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
star fill-in method where you would make

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.130 
star fill-in method where you would make
first<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.280> row<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.700> stars<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.420> then<00:02:09.599> your<00:02:09.750> next

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
first a row of stars and then your next

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.680 
first a row of stars and then your next
row<00:02:10.349> would<00:02:10.590> go<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.979> between

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
row would go in between

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.050 
row would go in between
the<00:02:11.840> first<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:13.040> you'd<00:02:13.160> work<00:02:13.310> between<00:02:13.820> these

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
the first so you'd work between these

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.650 
the first so you'd work between these
two<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.220> make<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.250> star<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.030> would<00:02:17.180> fill<00:02:17.510> in

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
two and make a star that would fill in

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.940 
two and make a star that would fill in
the<00:02:17.810> space<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:19.420> continue<00:02:20.420> along<00:02:21.140> working<00:02:21.560> in

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the space and continue along working in

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.750 
the space and continue along working in
between<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.640> stars<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.950> previous<00:02:25.430> row

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
between the stars of the previous row

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.670 
between the stars of the previous row
and<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:28.370> would<00:02:28.580> be<00:02:28.760> able<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.680> actually

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
and you would be able to actually

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.990 
and you would be able to actually
decorate<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.640> cake<00:02:36.010> without<00:02:37.010> having<00:02:37.490> iced<00:02:37.730> at

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
decorate a cake without having iced at

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.360 
decorate a cake without having iced at
first<00:02:38.360> because<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.080> stars<00:02:39.410> fill<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.130> and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
first because the stars fill in and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.450 
first because the stars fill in and
cover<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.970> cake<00:02:41.180> completely<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.080> thus<00:02:43.070> seal

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
cover the cake completely and thus seal

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.620 
cover the cake completely and thus seal
in<00:02:43.670> your<00:02:43.850> cake<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.760> can<00:02:46.910> even<00:02:47.150> clip<00:02:47.390> that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
in your cake you can even clip that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.590 
in your cake you can even clip that
in-between<00:02:47.810> things<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:48.920> want<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:50.390> watch
