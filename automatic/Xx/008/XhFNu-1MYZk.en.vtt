what<00:00:18.680> I<00:00:18.710> mean<00:00:18.890> I<00:00:18.920> my<00:00:19.340> hand<00:00:19.490> is<00:00:19.580> quite<00:00:19.789> strong

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
what I mean I my hand is quite strong

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.760 
what I mean I my hand is quite strong
for<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:20.330> conditions<00:00:20.779> i<00:00:20.900> have<00:00:21.020> two<00:00:21.170> dead<00:00:21.380> cards

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
for the conditions i have two dead cards

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.310 
for the conditions i have two dead cards
they're<00:00:21.920> all<00:00:22.040> wheel<00:00:22.250> cards<00:00:22.700> and<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:23.990> my<00:00:24.110> hand

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
they're all wheel cards and so my hand

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.290 
they're all wheel cards and so my hand
like<00:00:24.650> my<00:00:25.040> my<00:00:25.369> hand<00:00:25.580> strength<00:00:25.790> is<00:00:25.970> actually

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
like my my hand strength is actually

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.380 
like my my hand strength is actually
substantial<00:00:27.230> I<00:00:27.400> could<00:00:28.400> happily<00:00:28.789> cap<00:00:29.119> for

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
substantial I could happily cap for

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.089 
substantial I could happily cap for
value<00:00:29.720> yeah<00:00:29.899> and<00:00:30.169> I<00:00:30.200> think<00:00:30.259> I'd<00:00:30.619> prefer<00:00:30.680> that

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
value yeah and I think I'd prefer that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.799 
value yeah and I think I'd prefer that
on<00:00:31.430> useful<00:00:31.790> for<00:00:31.939> camping<00:00:32.239> is<00:00:32.329> especially<00:00:32.689> with

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
on useful for camping is especially with

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.900 
on useful for camping is especially with
with<00:00:33.140> with<00:00:33.260> an<00:00:33.410> ace<00:00:33.530> out<00:00:33.800> like<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.399> looks<00:00:34.700> less

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
with with an ace out like it looks less

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.160 
with with an ace out like it looks less
likely<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:35.480> have<00:00:35.570> an<00:00:35.660> ace<00:00:35.780> under<00:00:36.020> with

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
likely that you have an ace under with

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.630 
likely that you have an ace under with
an<00:00:36.260> ace<00:00:36.380> out<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.829> you've<00:00:36.920> got<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.219> five<00:00:37.399> out

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
an ace out and you've got the five out

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.880 
an ace out and you've got the five out
you're<00:00:37.910> like<00:00:38.120> super<00:00:38.630> live<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.530> like<00:00:39.710> I

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
you're like super live and I like I

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.750 
you're like super live and I like I
would<00:00:40.250> like<00:00:40.370> you<00:00:40.579> taking<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.930> initiative

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
would like you taking the initiative

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.979 
would like you taking the initiative
throughout<00:00:43.760> this<00:00:43.940> hand<00:00:44.210> if<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.510> both<00:00:44.719> catch

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
throughout this hand if you both catch

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.870 
throughout this hand if you both catch
low<00:00:45.290> you<00:00:46.070> still<00:00:46.280> have<00:00:46.400> that<00:00:46.460> fold<00:00:46.760> equity

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
low you still have that fold equity

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.520 
low you still have that fold equity
because<00:00:47.210> you're<00:00:47.540> still<00:00:47.780> betting<00:00:48.140> as<00:00:48.230> opposed

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
because you're still betting as opposed

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.200 
because you're still betting as opposed
to<00:00:48.620> calling<00:00:48.860> if<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.190> pair<00:00:49.400> up<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.000> right

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
to calling if you pair up and and right

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.960 
to calling if you pair up and and right
not<00:00:50.390> really<00:00:50.510> no<00:00:50.720> way<00:00:50.900> yes<00:00:51.140> well<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.620> I<00:00:52.400> think

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
not really no way yes well I I think

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.370 
not really no way yes well I I think
yeah<00:00:53.360> I<00:00:53.390> totally<00:00:53.870> understand<00:00:54.260> what<00:00:54.320> you're

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
yeah I totally understand what you're

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.890 
yeah I totally understand what you're
saying<00:00:54.620> but<00:00:54.790> and<00:00:55.790> i<00:00:56.120> agree<00:00:56.390> from<00:00:56.570> a<00:00:56.660> value

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
saying but and i agree from a value

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.479 
saying but and i agree from a value
perspective<00:00:57.140> like<00:00:57.950> my<00:00:58.130> hand<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:58.370> definitely

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
perspective like my hand is definitely

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.010 
perspective like my hand is definitely
worth<00:00:58.880> putting<00:00:59.090> all<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.360> money<00:00:59.510> in<00:00:59.660> here<00:00:59.870> like

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
worth putting all the money in here like

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.390 
worth putting all the money in here like
if<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.320> were<00:01:00.440> possible<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.890> shove<00:01:01.130> I<00:01:01.250> would

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
if it were possible to shove I would

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.910 
if it were possible to shove I would
shove<00:01:01.550> right<00:01:01.850> uh<00:01:01.910> I<00:01:02.900> mean<00:01:03.440> if<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:03.590> thought<00:01:03.770> I<00:01:03.800> was

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
shove right uh I mean if I thought I was

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.319 
shove right uh I mean if I thought I was
going<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.070> get<00:01:04.220> called<00:01:04.460> shoving<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.089> called<00:01:05.239> i

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
going to get called shoving it called i

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:06.249 
going to get called shoving it called i
would<00:01:05.449> definitely<00:01:05.659> show<00:01:05.810> them<00:01:05.990> get<00:01:06.110> called

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
would definitely show them get called

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.510 
would definitely show them get called
but<00:01:07.689> my<00:01:08.689> point<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.110> that<00:01:09.170> my<00:01:09.770> hand<00:01:10.009> is<00:01:10.189> so

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
but my point is that my hand is so

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.120 
but my point is that my hand is so
strong<00:01:10.939> that<00:01:11.479> i<00:01:11.540> can<00:01:11.750> actually<00:01:11.899> make<00:01:12.619> a<00:01:12.799> call

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
strong that i can actually make a call

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.609 
strong that i can actually make a call
when<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.670> brick<00:01:13.939> on<00:01:14.119> fourth<00:01:14.479> even<00:01:15.350> when<00:01:15.470> there's

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
when I brick on fourth even when there's

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.319 
when I brick on fourth even when there's
only<00:01:15.770> one<00:01:15.979> raised<00:01:16.189> in<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.460> pot<00:01:16.610> yeah<00:01:17.000> whereas

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
only one raised in the pot yeah whereas

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.239 
only one raised in the pot yeah whereas
if<00:01:17.450> I<00:01:17.540> were<00:01:17.659> 23<00:01:17.899> bet<00:01:18.139> it<00:01:18.289> then<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.770> that<00:01:19.069> call

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
if I were 23 bet it then that that call

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.129 
if I were 23 bet it then that that call
would<00:01:19.399> look<00:01:19.549> totally<00:01:19.700> automatic<00:01:20.179> and<00:01:20.539> hear

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
would look totally automatic and hear

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.929 
would look totally automatic and hear
that<00:01:21.530> my<00:01:22.009> call<00:01:22.219> actually<00:01:22.579> looks<00:01:22.789> stupid<00:01:23.319> and

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
that my call actually looks stupid and

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.190 
that my call actually looks stupid and
this<00:01:25.939> is<00:01:26.119> an<00:01:26.240> interesting<00:01:26.450> situation<00:01:26.780> I<00:01:27.170> can't

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
this is an interesting situation I can't

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.129 
this is an interesting situation I can't
raise<00:01:27.619> for<00:01:27.859> value<00:01:28.130> here<00:01:28.359> because<00:01:29.359> it's<00:01:29.539> so

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139 
raise for value here because it's so

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:33.429 
raise for value here because it's so
unlikely<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:32.240> i<00:01:32.539> mean<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:32.959> there<00:01:33.259> weren't

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
unlikely that i mean this there weren't

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.800 
unlikely that i mean this there weren't
six<00:01:33.649> is<00:01:33.799> out<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.219> it's<00:01:34.850> possible<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.389> the<00:01:35.600> six

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
six is out so it's possible that the six

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.059 
six is out so it's possible that the six
paired<00:01:36.109> him<00:01:36.289> but<00:01:36.530> i'd<00:01:36.619> have<00:01:36.709> to<00:01:36.770> put<00:01:37.039> him

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
paired him but i'd have to put him

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.389 
paired him but i'd have to put him
specifically<00:01:37.729> on<00:01:37.969> a<00:01:37.999> six<00:01:38.950> because<00:01:39.950> there<00:01:40.310> was

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
specifically on a six because there was

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.870 
specifically on a six because there was
another<00:01:40.609> five<00:01:40.909> out<00:01:41.179> and<00:01:42.249> it's<00:01:43.249> hard<00:01:43.520> for<00:01:43.729> me<00:01:43.789> to

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
another five out and it's hard for me to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.309 
another five out and it's hard for me to
give<00:01:43.999> him<00:01:44.060> credit<00:01:44.149> for<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.659> five<00:01:44.899> in<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.139> hole

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
give him credit for a five in the hole

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.679 
give him credit for a five in the hole
so<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:46.219> feel<00:01:46.579> like<00:01:46.759> now<00:01:46.939> he's<00:01:46.999> either<00:01:47.389> got<00:01:47.630> a

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
so I feel like now he's either got a

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.940 
so I feel like now he's either got a
made<00:01:47.899> six<00:01:48.310> which<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.659> have<00:01:50.659> reasonable<00:01:51.649> equity

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
made six which I have reasonable equity

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.260 
made six which I have reasonable equity
against<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.399> know<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.520> don't<00:01:52.639> like<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.090> but<00:01:53.209> I

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
against you know I don't like it but I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.219 
against you know I don't like it but I
have<00:01:53.420> some<00:01:53.779> equity<00:01:53.929> against<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.469> or<00:01:55.399> he's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
have some equity against it or he's

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.899 
have some equity against it or he's
always<00:01:57.229> got<00:01:57.349> a<00:01:57.409> pair<00:01:57.709> and<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.459> assumed<00:01:58.789> let

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
always got a pair and I just assumed let

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.219 
always got a pair and I just assumed let
him<00:01:59.029> keep<00:01:59.149> betting<00:01:59.359> his<00:01:59.539> hand<00:01:59.749> like<00:02:00.020> if<00:02:00.170> you

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
him keep betting his hand like if you

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.550 
him keep betting his hand like if you
agree<00:02:00.349> there<00:02:00.649> or<00:02:01.149> like<00:02:02.149> would<00:02:02.599> you<00:02:02.719> ever<00:02:02.869> raise

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
agree there or like would you ever raise

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.800 
agree there or like would you ever raise
away<00:02:03.979> i'm<00:02:04.099> raising<00:02:04.340> here<00:02:04.609> ok<00:02:04.939> say<00:02:05.119> it<00:02:05.149> used<00:02:05.689> to

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
away i'm raising here ok say it used to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.300 
away i'm raising here ok say it used to
be<00:02:05.929> actually<00:02:06.499> this<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:08.479> be<00:02:08.569> honest<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:09.410> spot

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
be actually this is to be honest a spot

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.670 
be actually this is to be honest a spot
this<00:02:10.580> exact<00:02:10.970> spot<00:02:11.090> if<00:02:11.690> he<00:02:11.900> catches<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.230> seven<00:02:12.590> is

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
this exact spot if he catches a seven is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.390 
this exact spot if he catches a seven is
different<00:02:13.040> i<00:02:13.819> think<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:15.860> one<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.250> those

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
different i think this is one of those

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.830 
different i think this is one of those
spots<00:02:16.610> where<00:02:16.910> i<00:02:16.940> would<00:02:17.120> justify<00:02:17.540> in<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:20.450> a

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
spots where i would justify in a in a

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.360 
spots where i would justify in a in a
pot<00:02:21.050> where<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> ton<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.590> money<00:02:21.739> wasn't<00:02:22.010> put<00:02:22.250> in

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
pot where a ton of money wasn't put in

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.309 
pot where a ton of money wasn't put in
even<00:02:22.939> even<00:02:23.269> if<00:02:23.510> there<00:02:23.780> was<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:23.959> bunch<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.230> money

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
even even if there was a bunch of money

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.070 
even even if there was a bunch of money
put<00:02:24.530> in<00:02:24.650> full

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
put in full

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.830

forestry call by the fact that i can

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.890 
forestry call by the fact that i can
probably<00:02:29.370> get<00:02:29.580> away<00:02:29.640> from<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.970> fifth<00:02:30.210> even

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
probably get away from on fifth even

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900 
probably get away from on fifth even
though<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.830> know<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.160> looks<00:02:32.190> pretty<00:02:32.580> crappy

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
though you know it looks pretty crappy

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
consideration here is it on later

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.480 
consideration here is it on later
streets<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.650> at<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.920> moment<00:02:47.010> he's<00:02:47.340> either

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
streets like at the moment he's either

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.960 
streets like at the moment he's either
got<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.700> pair<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.000> sixes<00:02:48.330> which<00:02:48.990> is<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.850> it's<00:02:50.850> a

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
got a pair of sixes which is a it's a

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.450 
got a pair of sixes which is a it's a
reasonable<00:02:51.360> possibility<00:02:51.630> ville<00:02:52.230> Ori<00:02:53.040> he

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
reasonable possibility ville Ori he

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.560 
reasonable possibility ville Ori he
could<00:02:53.610> have<00:02:53.760> conceivably<00:02:54.240> could<00:02:54.510> have

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
could have conceivably could have

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.620 
could have conceivably could have
something<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:55.080> seven<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.710> whole<00:02:56.630> he

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
something like a seven and the whole he

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.970 
something like a seven and the whole he
could<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:57.870> seen<00:02:58.080> he<00:02:58.290> could<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.590> five<00:02:58.830> in

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
could have seen he could have a five in

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.110 
could have seen he could have a five in
the<00:02:59.040> hole<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.400> could<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.670> made<00:03:00.000> him

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the hole and that could have made him

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.240 
the hole and that could have made him
excited<00:03:00.720> about<00:03:00.750> his<00:03:01.020> starting<00:03:01.710> hand<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.100> he

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
excited about his starting hand so he

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.820 
excited about his starting hand so he
could<00:03:02.400> have<00:03:02.520> something<00:03:02.730> like<00:03:02.850> 75<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.600> home

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
could have something like 75 in the home

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.710 
could have something like 75 in the home
like<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.040> think<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:05.850> reasonable<00:03:06.270> equity

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
like I think I have reasonable equity

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.690 
like I think I have reasonable equity
against<00:03:07.080> yeah<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:08.010> hands<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.340> he<00:03:08.490> could

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
against yeah the hands that he could

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.220 
against yeah the hands that he could
have<00:03:08.880> all<00:03:09.810> right<00:03:09.959> yeah<00:03:10.800> yeah<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.970> woman<00:03:12.420> it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
have all right yeah yeah the woman it

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.980 
have all right yeah yeah the woman it
appears<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.770> way<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.220> mean<00:03:14.400> right<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.360> in

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
appears that way I mean right I and in

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.010 
appears that way I mean right I and in
this<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:17.040> case<00:03:17.910> where<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.390> would<00:03:18.630> have<00:03:18.780> a

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
this is a case where I would have a

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.320 
this is a case where I would have a
no-brainer<00:03:19.650> call<00:03:20.100> down<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.880> had<00:03:21.030> inflated

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
no-brainer call down if I had inflated

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.150 
no-brainer call down if I had inflated
the<00:03:21.480> pot<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:21.840> Third<00:03:22.050> Street<00:03:22.080> like<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.070> would

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
the pot on Third Street like that would

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.610 
the pot on Third Street like that would
have<00:03:23.250> made<00:03:23.340> made<00:03:23.700> my<00:03:23.850> hand<00:03:24.060> like<00:03:24.540> kind<00:03:25.530> of

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
have made made my hand like kind of

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.610 
have made made my hand like kind of
automatic<00:03:26.180> in<00:03:27.180> those<00:03:27.840> situations<00:03:28.380> where<00:03:28.440> he

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
automatic in those situations where he

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.740 
automatic in those situations where he
actually<00:03:28.800> has<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.130> hand<00:03:29.459> has<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.030> better<00:03:30.420> hand

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
actually has the hand has a better hand

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.410 
actually has the hand has a better hand
that<00:03:31.560> makes<00:03:32.310> him<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.519> bunch<00:03:32.760> more<00:03:32.970> money<00:03:33.209> I

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.970 
planning on calling down with the 10
yeah<00:03:56.700> if<00:03:56.940> everything<00:03:57.360> bricks<00:03:57.600> out<00:03:57.750> if<00:03:58.050> I<00:03:58.410> if<00:03:58.709> he

yeah if everything bricks out if I if he

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.080 
yeah if everything bricks out if I if he
makes<00:03:59.810> if<00:04:00.810> he<00:04:00.989> pairs<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.410> six<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.550> leads<00:04:02.940> the

makes if he pairs the six and leads the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.430 
makes if he pairs the six and leads the
river<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.330> probably<00:04:03.570> have<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.900> call<00:04:04.019> with<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.230> 10

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
river I probably have to call with a 10

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.830 
river I probably have to call with a 10
yeah<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.950> agree<00:04:05.160> it's<00:04:06.120> just<00:04:06.330> even<00:04:06.570> though<00:04:06.720> the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
yeah I agree it's just even though the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.660 
yeah I agree it's just even though the
pot<00:04:06.989> is<00:04:07.110> not<00:04:07.260> necessarily<00:04:07.709> big<00:04:07.980> enough<00:04:08.190> all

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
pot is not necessarily big enough all

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.110 
pot is not necessarily big enough all
right<00:04:08.820> now<00:04:08.970> here's<00:04:09.150> no<00:04:09.630> um<00:04:10.730> I'm<00:04:11.730> actually<00:04:11.910> a

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
right now here's no um I'm actually a

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.970 
right now here's no um I'm actually a
little<00:04:12.209> bit<00:04:12.540> annoyed<00:04:12.780> if<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.320> lead<00:04:13.560> here<00:04:13.830> I

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
little bit annoyed if I lead here I

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.410 
little bit annoyed if I lead here I
because<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.489> think<00:04:14.550> this<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:14.820> an<00:04:15.030> automatic

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
because I think this is an automatic

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.270 
because I think this is an automatic
check<00:04:15.600> raise<00:04:15.840> for<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.530> same<00:04:16.769> reason<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:17.160> we

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
check raise for the same reason that we

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.560 
check raise for the same reason that we
talked<00:04:17.519> about<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.790> other<00:04:17.820> hand<00:04:18.150> for<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.359> same

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
talked about the other hand for the same

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.449 
talked about the other hand for the same
reason<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.989> like<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.560> lead<00:04:19.769> as<00:04:19.950> opposed<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.370> the

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
reason I like the lead as opposed to the

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.860 
reason I like the lead as opposed to the
check<00:04:20.669> raise<00:04:20.850> and<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.239> other<00:04:21.390> hand<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.780> the

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
check raise and the other hand is the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.480 
check raise and the other hand is the
same<00:04:22.080> reason<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.440> like<00:04:22.590> your<00:04:22.740> lead<00:04:22.919> as<00:04:23.160> opposed

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
same reason I like your lead as opposed

same reason I like your lead as opposed
to<00:04:23.520> Tucker<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.300> reason<00:04:24.690> if<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.290> were<00:04:25.440> just

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590
