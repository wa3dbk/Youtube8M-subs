00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
then that way you have a freshly new

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
then that way you have a freshly new
device<00:02:01.079> or<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> fresh<00:02:01.770> restore<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.610> then<00:02:02.820> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
device or a fresh restore and then you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.209 
device or a fresh restore and then you
can<00:02:03.090> move<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.719> jailbreak<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.530> not

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
can move on with a jailbreak and not

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.800 
can move on with a jailbreak and not
have<00:02:05.430> any<00:02:05.670> type<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> issues<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.689> my

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
have any type of issues so my

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
have any type of issues so my
recommendation<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.799> ahead<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.039> restore

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
recommendation is go ahead and restore

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.219 
recommendation is go ahead and restore
your<00:02:08.670> device<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:09.629> restore<00:02:09.989> from<00:02:10.170> backup

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229

its thing this is gonna take a couple
minutes<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.400> process<00:03:56.580> so<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:58.080> be<00:03:58.230> patient

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.940 

now<00:04:10.330> once<00:04:10.569> Taiji<00:04:11.110> has<00:04:11.290> completed<00:04:11.739> you<00:04:11.920> will

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
now once Taiji has completed you will

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.250 
now once Taiji has completed you will
notice<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:12.430> does<00:04:12.879> a<00:04:13.120> jailbreak<00:04:13.629> successful

we can go ahead and close that out and

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.360 
we can go ahead and close that out and
then<00:04:16.870> we'll<00:04:17.019> let<00:04:17.169> our<00:04:17.350> device<00:04:17.709> do<00:04:18.100> its<00:04:18.280> thing

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
then we'll let our device do its thing

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.449 
then we'll let our device do its thing
and<00:04:18.840> let<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:19.959> reboot<00:04:20.109> now<00:04:20.799> our<00:04:20.919> device<00:04:21.160> has

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
and let it reboot now our device has

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.340 
and let it reboot now our device has
gone<00:04:21.850> ahead<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.180> rebooted<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.020> we<00:04:23.110> can<00:04:23.229> go

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
gone ahead and rebooted so we can go

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.500 
gone ahead and rebooted so we can go
ahead<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.530> swipe<00:04:23.889> over<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:25.150> we<00:04:25.180> swipe
