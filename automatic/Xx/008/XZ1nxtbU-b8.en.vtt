00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:10.530
 hi to all good girls 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.300
 After many requests I'll show 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.790
 where the picture of Maria is clear to you 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.650
 alright k 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.779
 so girls when I found out that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.220
 was pregnant a year ago 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.689
 and I have a friend who is an architect and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 interior designer I like 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 So much that the brunette is as soon as I 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.960
 I discovered then I was pregnant, I went 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.300
 talk to him so we can make a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.210
 projetinho yellow card and I speak 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.750
 I never liked a room with that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.420
 baby in Chad I wanted a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.789
 very modern room that she could use 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.039
 Then when she grows up there I 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.500
 I passed all the information to Moreno 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.210
 and the brunette did the project and stayed 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 exactly the way I wanted it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.559
 so let's show you each now 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.390
 detail and explaining where 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.140
 He took to the ideas're 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.229
 What we wanted to do was the idea 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.830
 was to pick up bedroom furniture from 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.470
 baby does not have a high cost and right 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.450
 transform into something more modern because 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.340
 the baby bedroom wanting is not everything 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.909
 White does not have much choice is the white 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 so I went to a baby shop 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.130
 here andre andre even chose the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 crib and two dressers because in the bedroom I 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.560
 already had a closet and then it was 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 would practically buy to accommodate use of the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.390
 cribs in tan design to people 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.880
 We chose to do with two dressers are 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.590
 as you can see here are two 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.570
 then gives a feeling of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.040
 amplitude is not so small of proof 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.860
 it was quite something 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.380
 As I mentioned the dressers here, then the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.240
 two columns we use two models 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 equal to give this feeling of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.780
 amplitude and I sent there that the then 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.369
 in the colors that the design has chosen 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.250
 offended pink and gordon so here it is 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.340
 a handle that has the initials of Maria 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.719
 clear that follows the line of our people 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.429
 grandson is to do one thing well 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.009
 then we put the 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.340
 Initial it was done with Florence 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.769
 abc that also does this type of work 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.959
 very cool and gives another look to the 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.330
 is how you can see the two 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.549
 dressers were left with another 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.920
 lation was made in the Andes a fame 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.430
 I would beckon here on abc 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.709
 hello here then we have the exchanger 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.049
 that makes with the one that has south 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.829
 also has the navy's initials for 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.900
 mc also customized and looked very cute 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.040
 because he got the strange curds 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.799
 making a mix and also refers to my 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.450
 work that is this issue of prints 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.790
 So we tried to bring this too. 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.750
 the design of the room of the light maria then 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.870
 It was really cool. 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.549
 the mixture of potato with a stripe mixture of 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.360
 colors that we are working on 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.180
 project 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.480
 the comics also the initials of the sea 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.849
 It's clear I did with the relieve of my 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.980
 petit that I found her through the big one 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.840
 but a really nice job helped me 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.299
 choose and looked very well as well 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.690
 Gentleman did not hire very cool with 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.060
 The room was very cute, I chose a teddy bear. 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.849
 that the tide room does not have much 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.829
 is not so much a right theme that when 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.510
 makes a stroller at events stores 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.630
 question what is the theme here does not have 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.530
 very a theme I chose the colors and there 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.319
 I wanted to bring this childish part of it. 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.780
 with the cursinho is that is in the comic 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.440
 Also in the hygiene kit I go 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.269
 show you guys and in school 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.410
 It was very cool, I think. 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.859
 that was really cool 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.650
 the cradle I chose a simpler kiss 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.630
 that I was afraid to get too much 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.660
 I like the information I like that kiss 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.990
 more elaborate but I was afraid I would not 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.540
 get well too 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.540
 right there suggested I choose the dark 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.860
 simpler version and for more details 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.080
 So we put on this nap 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.050
 right here 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.850
 white fabric also there what you have 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.870
 that too how I said it 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.180
 combines with the police or the changer 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.500
 laws have been up here in pink and 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.600
 beige nÃ© 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.060
 also has the initials of Maria Claro 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.390
 for quantity this continuity in 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.230
 on the question of room customization 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.890
 huh 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:35.250
 and who are these cute little details that 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.590
 It is the courage she has the alphabet occurs 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.260

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.140
 think pink list with u think will 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.160

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.500
 fluffy and matched with everything in the room 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.850
 the cradle it does not then use still okay 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.510
 here it is still a lot 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.940
 Little girl but it looks pretty good. 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.860
 Now I'll show you the armchair. 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.050
 Who owns a photo and everybody loves it. 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.960

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.960
 It was super cool with room found 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.870

 when he suggested these colors was 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.130
 precisely because I'm the girl and with 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.240
