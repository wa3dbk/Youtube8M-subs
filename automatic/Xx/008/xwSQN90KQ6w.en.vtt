 patasca very popular in all the peru 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.680
 continuing with our recipe we are going to 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.610
 add a little oil to our 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.810
 pot that has already taken temperature 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.480
 let's add the onion and celery 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.660
 To make a watering the watering is done to 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.180
 from an oil that is not 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.080
 really hot is warm because 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.120

 that this goes up for a few minutes until 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.600
 that can take some consistency and the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.540
 Onion with celery can help 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.440
 in this process we are going to delay us a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.630
 space about two minutes to be 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.850
