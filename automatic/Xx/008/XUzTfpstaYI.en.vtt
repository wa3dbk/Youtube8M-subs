00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.060
 family farming program 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.760
 and increase the income of small 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.430
 producers improve the quality of life 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.980
 of peasant families and reduce the 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.320
 poverty in rural Colombia are 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.690
 the objectives of the agriculture program 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.560
 of the Ministry of Agriculture and 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.560
 rural development 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.650
 With this initiative we seek to support 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.170
 small peasant producers and 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.050
 rural entrepreneurs to carry out 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.840
 entrepreneurial processes if a 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.309
 community has no vocation then no 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 is going nowhere because everything is 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.820
 to the sheltered for what they want 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.320
 here we are talking about everything and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.110
 have a thought you have a 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.239
 business thinking to yourself 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.360
 we will implement financial instruments 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.950
 technological and infrastructure 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.630
 adapted to the needs of each 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.210
 region for 2014 we have allocated 550 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.310
 billion pesos to strengthen 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.710
 the peasant family through 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.180
 family farming program that 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.180
 will focus on three fundamental axes 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.390
 associativity 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.370
 providing a more solid structure and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.350
 competitively through the 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.110
 associativity we will do that so 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 jointly with peasant families 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.460
 have greater opportunities to 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.730
 access to technical assistance services 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.790
 financing and marketing is already 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.520
 much the product that we put together 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.850
 all the families associated then 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.920
 this allows us to market 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:58.030
 visualize family farming 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.869
 and the Colombian countryside and our 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.580
 partnerships as a productive company 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.000
 with the responsibility to feed the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.000
 world 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 productivity 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.680
 let's professionalize and standardize 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.409
 the productive processes of families 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.150
 peasants to increase the harvest and 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.150
 achieve high quality standards 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.870
 and marketing 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.970
 through the agriculture program 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.099
 familiar the products of our 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.700
 peasant families will reach the 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.739
 national and international markets 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.739
 working together we generate prosperity 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.719
 together we can achieve our dreams 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.499
 2014 international year of agriculture 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.499
 family
