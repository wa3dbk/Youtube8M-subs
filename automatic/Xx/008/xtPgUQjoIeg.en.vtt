I'm always looking for a new challenge

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.460 
I'm always looking for a new challenge
for<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.850> project<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.480> decided<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:07.109> see<00:00:07.290> what

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
for this project I decided to see what

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.230 
for this project I decided to see what
could<00:00:07.799> be<00:00:07.919> achieved<00:00:08.280> by<00:00:08.519> renovating<00:00:09.030> an

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
could be achieved by renovating an

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.810 
could be achieved by renovating an
average<00:00:09.870> house<00:00:10.110> entirely<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.370> elements

average house entirely with elements
from<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.150> big-box<00:00:12.540> store<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.139> think<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.920> results

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
from a big-box store I think the results

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.490 
from a big-box store I think the results
are<00:00:14.400> pretty<00:00:14.700> dramatic<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.389> I'm<00:00:15.839> pretty<00:00:16.230> sure

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
are pretty dramatic and I'm pretty sure

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.410 
are pretty dramatic and I'm pretty sure
you're<00:00:16.830> gonna<00:00:16.980> say<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.090> we're

the<00:00:53.730> cake<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.600> way<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> best<00:00:55.410> look

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the cake the way to get the best look

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.130 
the cake the way to get the best look
traditionally<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.579> been<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> casing

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
traditionally has been to use a casing

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.950 
traditionally has been to use a casing
and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:58.829> attach<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.699> back<00:01:00.030> band<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and then attach a back band to it so

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.349 
and then attach a back band to it so
it's<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.230> two-piece<00:01:01.800> installation<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it's a two-piece installation what the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
it's a two-piece installation what the
back<00:01:03.539> band<00:01:03.809> does<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.439> gives<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.799> extra

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
back band does is it gives you extra

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.330 
back band does is it gives you extra
depth<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.540> makes<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.290> moldings<00:01:08.070> have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
depth and it makes the moldings have

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.300 
depth and it makes the moldings have
greater<00:01:09.030> impact<00:01:09.500> basically<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.740> looks<00:01:11.010> like

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
greater impact basically it looks like

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.969 
greater impact basically it looks like
better<00:01:11.790> quality<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.350> always<00:01:13.560> been<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
better quality so that's always been a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
better quality so that's always been a
two-part<00:01:14.610> installation<00:01:15.270> process<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.080> look

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
two-part installation process but look

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.980 
two-part installation process but look
here's<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> way<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> now<00:01:18.240> made<00:01:18.840> out

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
here's a way you can get it now made out

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.160 
here's a way you can get it now made out
of<00:01:19.140> MDF<00:01:19.560> pre-primed<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.170> all-in-one

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
of MDF pre-primed and it's all-in-one

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.429 
of MDF pre-primed and it's all-in-one
what<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.920> means<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.490> less<00:01:24.210> Labor<00:01:24.509> half<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
what that means is less Labor half the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.039 
what that means is less Labor half the
labor<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.920> fact<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.580> believe<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> or<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.270> this

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
labor in fact and believe it or not this

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.050 
labor in fact and believe it or not this
piece<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> all-in-one<00:01:29.040> profile<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
piece with the all-in-one profile is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.679 
piece with the all-in-one profile is
less<00:01:30.720> expensive<00:01:30.930> than<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:32.369> two<00:01:32.640> pieces<00:01:32.850> put

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
less expensive than these two pieces put

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.109 
less expensive than these two pieces put
together<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.400> good<00:01:35.640> deal

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
together so it's a good deal

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.959 
together so it's a good deal
for<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> great<00:01:37.049> end<00:01:37.350> result

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.459 

getting<00:01:45.969> the<00:01:46.060> best<00:01:46.240> results<00:01:46.749> from<00:01:46.899> existing

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
getting the best results from existing

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.380 
getting the best results from existing
products<00:01:47.950> requires<00:01:48.310> thinking<00:01:48.819> a<00:01:48.909> little<00:01:49.090> bit

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
products requires thinking a little bit

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.080 
products requires thinking a little bit
outside<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:50.049> box<00:01:50.259> this<00:01:51.189> says<00:01:51.460> its<00:01:51.670> exterior

outside the box this says its exterior
plywood<00:01:52.600> siding<00:01:52.960> but<00:01:53.469> just<00:01:53.710> because<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.100> says

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
its exterior doesn't mean I have to use

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.059 
its exterior doesn't mean I have to use
it<00:01:57.189> outside<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.630> have<00:01:59.380> an<00:01:59.469> idea<00:01:59.709> for<00:01:59.950> an

decided to use these four by eight

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.750 
decided to use these four by eight
sheets<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.440> treat<00:02:26.829> them<00:02:27.040> as<00:02:27.190> though<00:02:27.489> they

were tonguing through family the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.100 
were tonguing through family the
advantage<00:02:29.950> here<00:02:30.310> is<00:02:30.519> it's<00:02:30.879> less<00:02:31.450> expensive<00:02:31.720> to

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
advantage here is it's less expensive to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.020 
advantage here is it's less expensive to
buy<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.260> sheet<00:02:32.560> goods<00:02:32.799> plus<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.519> goes<00:02:33.760> in

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
buy the sheet goods plus it goes in

buy the sheet goods plus it goes in
quickly<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:35.049> effectively<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.790> all

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
quickly and effectively so that all

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.360 
quickly and effectively so that all
works<00:02:37.510> for<00:02:37.750> me<00:02:37.870> I've<00:02:38.379> put<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:38.829> on<00:02:38.920> these<00:02:39.099> half

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
works for me I've put it on these half

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.160 
works for me I've put it on these half
walls<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.030> part<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.690> reason<00:02:40.930> why<00:02:41.049> it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
walls and part of the reason why it

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.599 
walls and part of the reason why it
makes<00:02:41.349> sense<00:02:41.470> here<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> high

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
makes sense here is this is a high

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.150 
makes sense here is this is a high
traffic<00:02:43.150> zone<00:02:43.329> drywall<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.410> get<00:02:44.650> dinged<00:02:44.950> on

the corners and scuffed and scratched

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.110 
the corners and scuffed and scratched
but<00:02:47.379> if<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.560> apply<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.859> wood<00:02:48.220> finish<00:02:48.400> over<00:02:48.880> top

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
but if you apply a wood finish over top

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.569 
but if you apply a wood finish over top
you've<00:02:49.450> got<00:02:49.690> extra<00:02:50.170> durability<00:02:50.650> when<00:02:51.459> it

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
you've got extra durability when it

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.250

comes to painting it what I'd recommend

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.259 
comes to painting it what I'd recommend
is<00:02:53.470> give<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.769> two<00:02:54.040> coats<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.430> primer<00:02:54.609> the

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
is give it two coats of primer the

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.390 
is give it two coats of primer the
fibers<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.870> wood<00:02:56.200> will<00:02:56.530> swell<00:02:56.980> up<00:02:57.190> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
fibers in the wood will swell up and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.009 
fibers in the wood will swell up and
they'll<00:02:57.549> become<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.819> little<00:02:58.030> bit<00:02:58.239> rough<00:02:58.510> don't

the<00:04:13.390> only<00:04:13.599> trick<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.140> have<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.379> make<00:04:14.470> sure

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
the only trick is you have to make sure

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.960 
the only trick is you have to make sure
that<00:04:14.859> you<00:04:14.950> choose<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.220> paper<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.670> looks<00:04:15.879> as

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
that you choose a paper that looks as

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.020 
that you choose a paper that looks as
good<00:04:16.269> vertically<00:04:17.019> as<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.739> does<00:04:18.030> horizontally

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
good vertically as it does horizontally

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.670 
good vertically as it does horizontally
because<00:04:19.419> basically<00:04:19.600> you're<00:04:20.169> putting<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.590> in

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
because basically you're putting it in

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.279 
because basically you're putting it in
sideways<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.789> any<00:04:22.090> geometric<00:04:22.810> print<00:04:23.080> will

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289

sideways so any geometric print will
work<00:04:23.560> really<00:04:23.860> well<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.520> way<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:25.360> can

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
work really well and this way you can
