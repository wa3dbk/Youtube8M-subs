00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello my friends welcome 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.670
 on my youtube channel today it works 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.980
 about a product or an unboxing about 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.969
 I definitely like it very much 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.969
 So stay tuned 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.040
 yes what we have here we have here 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.590
 small intel nook a small mini pc 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.980
 which probably works with most of them as well 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.300
 in my living room comes to use 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:47.489
 as a multimedia pc htpc then about it 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.430
 his videos can play pictures 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.559
 yes we have the model here and that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.920
 that 340 10y t h there we want it 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.199
 open up the good piece already belongs 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 when you open it comes the great intel music 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.610
 contrary is a very nice feature 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.220
 here 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.570
 then we have that once 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.880
 packaging was already open but 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.549
 These are exactly the things the old races 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.650
 are once advertising mcaffee as speaks 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.700
 you actually also coffee mcaffee 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.840
 no idea 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:30.479
 then we have a few screws here 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:34.009
 the intel oak itself holds the vesa 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.970
 and the matching screws then to this 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.970
 a little sticker 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.370
 and the power supply i had to say was here 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.180
 I'm a little disappointed 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.220
 the power supply is there but unfortunately was missing 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 the power cable which then to 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.090
 Outlet I actually had 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.910
 thought we were doing it because I had a few 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.940
 I read reviews and there was just 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.180
 inside that would be intel with this model 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.490
 that would have probably put in but with me 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.290
 it was not there yes I have now 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.520
 had some of them still at home about 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.520
 I have now made no riot 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:22.190
 because the good piece of time to the short 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.200
 dates 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.980
 this is the internet with the current one 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.420
 with the current hascherl cpu that is 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.660
 the intel core i3 40 10 o'clock at the sg 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.910
 clocked with 2 x 1.7 ghz 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:46.650
 the chipset is the grandson km 87 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.019
 there we have the intel graphics hd 4400 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.250
 meter hdmi and mini displayport 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:56.430
 connection then we have four usb 3.0 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.780
 connections and a lan connection yes 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.810
 as I said it is the 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.040
 current hasch wants this variant 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.750
 There are models in two variants 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.720
 once the normal and then there is one 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.940
 built something bigger which I here 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.630
 have the reason for the extra 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.019
 volume is that one here 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:26.010
 can install more hard disk 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:28.079
 in addition to the ssd plate and yes me 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.970
 would really recommend to everyone if 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.630
 you decide on an intel oak 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.350
 to buy 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.790
 get the bigger version yourself 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.630
 if you do not mean to do one now 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.030
 to install hard disk because 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.900
 I think that by the bigger one 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.880
 volume, of course, more air 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.650
 can circulate and I think I am 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.420
 so I'm sure now but me 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.040
 think that gets through it 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.720
 quieter too is yes what is there 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.730
 you have to say in any case 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.190
 additional components a tree 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.520
 the look is a so-called advertising that 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.260
 means he is reasonably naked 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.680
 Therefore, they definitely are 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.760
 it needs a memory 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.830
 it is recommended a small m 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.630
 to install sata ssd 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.850
 and if you still wish that wlan 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:22.760
 bluetooth module or if you need it 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.940
 you should be so at just what 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.870
 Memory affects the specifications 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.120
 from intel stop because of the use 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.070
 bit around times tens of takes like 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.080
 does not stop every memory at the 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.790
 must be a low voltage and self 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.950
 under these low voltage models there 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.930
 There are some that are not so good 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.090
 run or do not run at all 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.760
 if you want to know what I mean in my 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.350
 have built a look writes me 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.750
 short commentary then I write that 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.290
 still in addition 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.210
 with me of running properly so that 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.170
 it was for today 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.730
 I hope you liked my video 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.810
