00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
clicking sound persisted so in the last

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.790 
clicking sound persisted so in the last
ditch<00:00:35.790> effort<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.329> took<00:00:36.540> my<00:00:37.250> pocket<00:00:38.250> knife<00:00:39.800> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
I went to each individual gear tooth and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.209 
I went to each individual gear tooth and
just<00:00:45.570> gently<00:00:45.899> scraped<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> found

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
something and a half way around the gear

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.799 
something and a half way around the gear

and don't worry about taking apart your
gearbox<00:01:26.859> here<00:01:27.859> if<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.039> don't<00:01:28.189> see<00:01:28.369> anything

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
gearbox here if you don't see anything

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.289 
gearbox here if you don't see anything
take<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.780> knife<00:01:30.049> or<00:01:30.079> some<00:01:30.469> other<00:01:30.619> objects<00:01:31.310> and

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.349 
take a knife or some other objects and
just<00:01:32.600> go<00:01:32.750> through<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:33.459> tooth<00:01:34.459> by<00:01:34.729> tooth<00:01:34.789> same

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
just go through it tooth by tooth same

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.749 
just go through it tooth by tooth same
with<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.600> pinion<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.489> it's<00:01:37.489> something<00:01:37.610> it

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
with the pinion and it's something it

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.190 
with the pinion and it's something it
falls<00:01:37.909> out<00:01:38.179> you'll<00:01:38.329> know<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:39.079> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
falls out you'll know it and then the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.499 
falls out you'll know it and then the
clicking<00:01:39.530> will<00:01:39.679> cease<00:01:39.920> good<00:01:40.729> news<00:01:40.909> if<00:01:41.239> this

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
clicking will cease good news if this

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.209 
clicking will cease good news if this
does<00:01:41.750> cause<00:01:41.959> clicking<00:01:42.439> it's<00:01:42.649> a<00:01:42.709> rather<00:01:42.829> small

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
does cause clicking it's a rather small

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.819 
does cause clicking it's a rather small
object<00:01:43.780> means<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.959> your<00:01:45.079> mesh<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.560> set<00:01:45.799> very

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
object means that your mesh is set very

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.389 
object means that your mesh is set very
nice<00:01:46.429> so<00:01:47.299> that<00:01:47.450> it's<00:01:47.810> it's<00:01:48.349> loose<00:01:48.829> enough<00:01:49.159> to

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
nice so that it's it's loose enough to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.380 
nice so that it's it's loose enough to
not<00:01:49.939> be<00:01:50.149> grinding<00:01:50.750> or<00:01:50.869> binding<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:52.280> yet<00:01:53.060> it's

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
not be grinding or binding and yet it's

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.389 
not be grinding or binding and yet it's
tight<00:01:53.750> enough<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:54.200> even<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.679> small<00:01:55.129> little

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
tight enough that even a small little

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.069 
tight enough that even a small little
particle<00:01:55.849> apposite<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.390> make<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.689> clicking

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
particle apposite to make that clicking

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.069 
particle apposite to make that clicking
sound<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:57.590> that's<00:01:57.739> a<00:01:57.890> good<00:01:58.189> thing<00:01:58.549> I<00:01:58.819> guess<00:01:59.569> the

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
sound so that's a good thing I guess the

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.229 
sound so that's a good thing I guess the
clicking<00:02:00.409> is<00:02:00.500> very<00:02:00.709> annoying<00:02:01.039> in<00:02:01.879> this<00:02:02.060> case

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239 
clicking is very annoying in this case

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:03.550 
clicking is very annoying in this case
it<00:02:02.329> was<00:02:02.450> piece<00:02:02.629> of<00:02:02.750> mulch<00:02:02.959> and<00:02:03.079> that<00:02:03.229> piece<00:02:03.439> of

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
it was piece of mulch and that piece of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.609 
it was piece of mulch and that piece of
