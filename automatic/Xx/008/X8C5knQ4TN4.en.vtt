use these all the time to a little

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.080 
use these all the time to a little
paring<00:02:01.560> knives<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.130> get<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.520> groupies

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
paring knives that you get the groupies

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.350

little<00:02:03.330> uh<00:02:04.100> Teflon<00:02:05.100> coated<00:02:05.820> knives<00:02:06.060> are

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
little uh Teflon coated knives are

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.690 
little uh Teflon coated knives are
really<00:02:06.840> good<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.140> cutting<00:02:07.320> clay<00:02:07.620> because<00:02:07.800> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
really good for cutting clay because the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.649 
really good for cutting clay because the
blade<00:02:09.000> does<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.599> stick<00:02:10.019> to<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.259> clay<00:02:11.659> but

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
blade does not stick to the clay but

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.589 
blade does not stick to the clay but
they're<00:02:13.620> very<00:02:14.129> very<00:02:14.400> sharp<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.420> you're

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
they're very very sharp so if you're

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.100 
they're very very sharp so if you're
cleaning<00:02:15.870> your<00:02:16.099> knife<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.430> clay<00:02:18.060> better<00:02:18.900> be

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
cleaning your knife of clay better be

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.370 
cleaning your knife of clay better be
careful<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.849> can<00:02:21.000> cut<00:02:21.209> yourself<00:02:21.599> real

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
careful that you can cut yourself real

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.140 
careful that you can cut yourself real
easy<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.010> want<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.370> feel<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.730> just

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
easy and you want you to feel it just

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:34.910
