00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
the first application we can be taking a

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.269 
the first application we can be taking a
look<00:00:24.070> at<00:00:24.250> is<00:00:24.460> tank<00:00:25.330> hero<00:00:25.750> it's<00:00:26.439> available<00:00:26.740> free

very simple and addictive game you
actually<00:00:41.079> are<00:00:41.320> tanking<00:00:41.829> after<00:00:42.220> use<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.730> pad

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
actually are tanking after use the pad

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.619 
actually are tanking after use the pad
to<00:00:43.570> stir<00:00:43.780> it<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.650> you<00:00:44.829> just<00:00:44.980> tap<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.250> fire<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
to stir it and you just tap the fire you

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.210 
to stir it and you just tap the fire you
could<00:00:46.809> use<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.170> bounce<00:00:47.710> them<00:00:47.949> off<00:00:48.070> the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
could use it to bounce them off the

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.460 
could use it to bounce them off the
walls<00:00:48.399> and<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:48.699> just<00:00:48.850> have<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.120> try<00:00:49.329> and<00:00:49.600> blow

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
walls and you just have to try and blow

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.330 
walls and you just have to try and blow
up<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.710> other<00:00:50.860> tanks<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.739> starts<00:00:54.070> off<00:00:54.190> very

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
up the other tanks it starts off very

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.060 
up the other tanks it starts off very
simple<00:00:55.090> but<00:00:55.359> as<00:00:55.600> usual<00:00:55.899> as<00:00:56.350> you<00:00:56.500> progress<00:00:56.680> it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
simple but as usual as you progress it

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.369 
simple but as usual as you progress it
does<00:00:57.219> get<00:00:57.399> a<00:00:57.460> lot<00:00:58.000> more<00:00:58.059> Challenger<00:00:58.870> no<00:00:59.140> more

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
does get a lot more Challenger no more

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.979 
does get a lot more Challenger no more
difficult<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.030> show<00:01:01.149> you<00:01:01.210> like<00:01:01.809> one

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
difficult going to show you like one

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.560 
difficult going to show you like one
more<00:01:02.140> level<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:05.649> how<00:01:06.330> gets<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.450> little

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
more level so you how gets a little

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.180 
more level so you how gets a little
harder<00:01:07.780> I<00:01:07.929> could<00:01:08.140> use<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.500> bounce<00:01:08.800> off<00:01:08.979> to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
harder I could use it to bounce off to

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:21.950 
harder I could use it to bounce off to
war<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.490> try<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.789> kill<00:01:09.940> them<00:01:10.119> by

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.520 

super<00:01:22.799> gets<00:01:23.010> a<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.190> more<00:01:23.250> dis<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.790> tanks<00:01:24.150> now

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
super gets a lot more dis for tanks now

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.510 
super gets a lot more dis for tanks now
so<00:01:25.530> there's<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> lot<00:01:26.549> harder

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.550 

have<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.640> get<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.880> timing<00:01:34.149> right<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.719> do<00:01:35.469> it

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
have to get the timing right and do it

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.429 
have to get the timing right and do it
and<00:01:36.189> yeah<00:01:36.399> 3<00:01:36.729> 400<00:01:37.210> marketplace<00:01:37.750> go<00:01:37.960> download

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
and yeah 3 400 marketplace go download

and yeah 3 400 marketplace go download
and<00:01:38.619> go<00:01:38.829> check<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.219> out

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.300 

the<00:01:43.020> next<00:01:43.290> application<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.920> taking<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the next application can be taking a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.109 
the next application can be taking a
look<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> space<00:01:45.030> pasta<00:01:45.510> it's<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:47.119> simple

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
look at a space pasta it's a very simple

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.740 
look at a space pasta it's a very simple
application<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:50.820> basically<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> ball

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
application you basically have a ball

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you just have to try and bounce off and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.590 
you just have to try and bounce off and
break<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> blocks<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> top<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:57.299> show<00:01:57.330> you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
break the blocks at the top to show you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:09.740 
break the blocks at the top to show you
that<00:02:02.659> such<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.690> pretty<00:02:04.110> cool<00:02:04.440> game<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:08.600> as<00:02:09.600> you
