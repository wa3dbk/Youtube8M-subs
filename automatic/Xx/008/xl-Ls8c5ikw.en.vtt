00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.220 
it's not the iPhone 6 plus but you can
see<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.809> it's<00:00:15.809> completely<00:00:16.670> normal<00:00:17.670> here

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
see that it's completely normal here

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.960 
see that it's completely normal here
it's<00:00:19.230> not<00:00:19.380> any<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.520> know<00:00:20.609> there's<00:00:20.789> no

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
it's not any you know there's no

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.540 
it's not any you know there's no
deformity<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.470> completely<00:00:22.650> straight

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
deformity here it's completely straight

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.650 
deformity here it's completely straight
so<00:00:24.090> I'll<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.449> using<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.199> know<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.519> was<00:00:26.939> going

was made in my pocket and I haven't seen

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.229 
was made in my pocket and I haven't seen
any<00:00:33.719> kind<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.140> bend<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:34.829> deformity<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.700> its

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
any kind of bend or deformity in its

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.920 
any kind of bend or deformity in its
design<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.969> that's<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> case<00:00:39.690> with

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
design so but that's not the case with

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
design so but that's not the case with
the<00:00:40.050> iPhone<00:00:40.350> 6<00:00:40.559> plus<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.980> people<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> lot<00:00:42.000> a

the iPhone 6 plus so people have a lot a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.670 
the iPhone 6 plus so people have a lot a
problem<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> iPhone<00:00:42.930> 6<00:00:43.110> plus<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.500> now

problem with the iPhone 6 plus but now

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.400 
problem with the iPhone 6 plus but now
the<00:00:43.739> iPhone<00:00:44.070> 6<00:00:44.520> here<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> normal<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:46.110> has

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the iPhone 6 here the normal one it has

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.810 
the iPhone 6 here the normal one it has
no<00:00:46.590> problem<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.590> use<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
no problem if you you know use a you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.389 
no problem if you you know use a you
know<00:00:50.940> put<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.690> your<00:00:51.809> pocket<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.469> you'll

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
know put it in your pocket and you'll

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.569 
know put it in your pocket and you'll
not<00:00:53.640> Bend<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.199> hands<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.460> we

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
not Bend so what about hands so if we

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.840 
not Bend so what about hands so if we
try<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> bend<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.530> hands<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.670> will

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
try to bend it with the hands what will

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.750 
try to bend it with the hands what will
happen<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.949> I'll<00:01:01.949> try<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.760> will

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
happen so I'll try to do it so I will

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.920 
happen so I'll try to do it so I will
apply<00:01:05.970> pressure<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:07.560> these<00:01:08.010> sides<00:01:08.310> here

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
apply pressure on all these sides here

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
apply pressure on all these sides here
one<00:01:09.930> by<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.590> we'll<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.760> device

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
one by one and we'll see if the device

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.060 
one by one and we'll see if the device
bends<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.869> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.650 

so<00:01:20.610> still<00:01:21.200> no<00:01:22.200> bending<00:01:23.060> let's<00:01:24.060> try<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> apply

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
so still no bending let's try to apply

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:32.870 
so still no bending let's try to apply
pressure<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.040> side<00:01:31.700> straddle<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
pressure here this side straddle a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
pressure here this side straddle a
pressure<00:01:33.120> like<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.249 

ah<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:46.880> stable<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:49.200> is

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
ah you can see is stable it is

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.359 
ah you can see is stable it is
completely<00:01:49.770> straight

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
completely straight

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.469 
completely straight
no<00:01:51.299> deformity<00:01:52.070> let's<00:01:53.070> try<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.240> from

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
no deformity let's try to do this from

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:04.100 
no deformity let's try to do this from
this<00:01:54.630> side<00:01:54.690> here<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:03.110> it's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
this side here you can see it's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.900 
this side here you can see it's
completely<00:02:04.289> stable<00:02:04.830> so<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.130> shows<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
completely stable so so this shows you

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.190 
completely stable so so this shows you
that<00:02:09.179> iPhone<00:02:09.720> 6<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:11.600> sustain<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.930> lot

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
that iPhone 6 can you know sustain a lot

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.490 
that iPhone 6 can you know sustain a lot
of<00:02:13.459> pressure<00:02:14.459> before<00:02:15.090> actually<00:02:15.780> bending<00:02:16.230> so

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
of pressure before actually bending so

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.550 
of pressure before actually bending so
I've<00:02:17.190> applied<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.819> lot<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.450> force<00:02:18.720> in<00:02:19.110> order<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
I've applied a lot of force in order to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.280 
I've applied a lot of force in order to
you<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:19.980> bend<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.489> device<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.720> if<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.140> are

buy it to buy the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.990 
buy it to buy the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6
plus<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.989> recommend<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.069> buy<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.280> iPhone<00:02:29.550> 6

plus I recommend you to buy the iPhone 6

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.840 
plus I recommend you to buy the iPhone 6
because<00:02:30.360> iPhone<00:02:30.780> 6<00:02:30.959> plus<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.500> where<00:02:32.370> we're<00:02:32.670> in

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
because iPhone 6 plus is where we're in

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.960 
because iPhone 6 plus is where we're in
more<00:02:33.260> exposed<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.500> bending<00:02:34.890> because<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.850> know

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
more exposed to bending because you know

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.210 
more exposed to bending because you know
the<00:02:36.569> iPhone<00:02:36.660> 6<00:02:36.959> plus<00:02:37.049> can<00:02:37.350> bend<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:38.190> your

pocket so but not this is not the same

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.840 
pocket so but not this is not the same
thing<00:02:43.080> with<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.290> iPhone<00:02:43.590> 6<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:44.100> focus<00:02:44.730> on

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
thing with the iPhone 6 here focus on

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
see I've applied a lot of pressure but

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.449 
see I've applied a lot of pressure but
still<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.420> iPhone<00:02:51.630> 6<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:51.989> going<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:53.310> not

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
bending and also also apply more

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.990 
bending and also also apply more
pressure<00:02:58.680> by<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.100> know<00:02:59.340> putting<00:02:59.519> something

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
pressure by you know putting something

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.349 
pressure by you know putting something

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
it's completely normal screen is normal

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.160 
it's completely normal screen is normal
still<00:03:16.650> normal<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.519> will<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.329> more<00:03:18.600> Bend<00:03:18.870> test

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
still normal so I will do more Bend test

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.060 
still normal so I will do more Bend test
with<00:03:19.500> my<00:03:19.650> other<00:03:19.859> devices<00:03:21.470> especially<00:03:22.470> samsung
