00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.680
 in question of Spartans as only their 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.920
 friend metals 117 with a new video 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.320
 of information of the 5 well in this 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.650
 occasion I come to talk about a 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.489
 interview they did to the 343 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.680
 industries by the cvg where 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.770
 because they speak freely about 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.110
 what are your future plans for the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.480
 next delivery you 're already something 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.460
 close together with the launch of the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.190
 new generation of consoles good 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.710
 let's start we revealed a lot of data and 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.870
 among them is what happened with 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.739
 they cut it seems that we will not see it anymore 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.559
 in the 5 or in the 6 at least that's 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.710
 what they saw intendant here many of the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.470
 343 team said they were not 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.660
 according to the personal character that 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.330
 both have wanted since the first game 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.940
 but that was something important for the 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.570
 trilogy of the claimed and explore a 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.150
 little more the human side of jong 117 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.760
 good since halo 1 we have heard 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.160
 that jon always 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.620
 and a voice that has led him to take 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.410
 many of your decisions as has been 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.690
 is short not then then in this 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.570
 trilogy of the claimed want that now 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.180
 they are 117 going to take their own 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.400
 decisions without any companion or 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.770
 nothing that these decisions are the most 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.840
 humanly possible so technically 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.720
 they said that the child is going to have to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.180
 find your own way and you are going to choose 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.000
 your own decisions do not want you 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.280
 no other character interfere in what 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.340
 what am I going to do this character in some 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.580
 future so maybe they do not want to bring 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.710
 back to cortana and it's obvious that I do not 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.440
 will work with a copy guide 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.530
 cortana still I think we can see it 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.869
 in some changes or maybe flash backs 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.750
 in the other games that station has 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.700
 when facing an enemy or such 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.160
 once I just remember it very often 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.500
 but it seems that mesh cuts are not going to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.510
 have a very important role in the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.090
 next installments since the trilogy of 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.730
 claimed is focused specifically on 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.330
 what makes me think too 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.220
 the return of other characters like the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:37.290
 cat the whiskey that came out in jairo 3 odst 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.590
 color more points on Cetes like 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.750
 this booty and in some other experts 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.730
 It also makes me doubt the return 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.799
 of the good inquisitor not so much this 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.549
 character since it is very important to 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.370
 the saga but since this technology is 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.079
 more focused sexier I doubt very much that you 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.629
 give the same role to the inquisitor 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.629
 that they gave him in halo 2 or 3 for example 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.180
 they also said that a lot of what already 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.879
 had done with the universe influenced in 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.530
 what was the or 4 since they could have 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.560
 created a new story where more 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.480
 the chip will turn out to have died but not 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.420
 They decided to continue with the story of 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.359
 master chip and mainly discover 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.910
 about new things from vans like 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.859
 for example who was the didact and for 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.049
 what hates us so much besides revealing 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.840
 other secrets like the origin of the fleet 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.690
 which will be fixed in the next 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.520
 deliveries but they said today and never 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.290
 he really had the plans 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:40.380
 to create the 14 so the story of 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.720
 343 let him 4 is totally yours and bungie 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.090
 did not influence anything about the history of 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.660
 this game which they have been creating since 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.090
 2008 with the beginning of prototypes and 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.340
 a new story in fact they said that 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.500
 many of the prototypes and ideas that 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.900
 created in 2008 are going to be 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.140
 fundamental for the future of halo and 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.860
 your universe within the next 10 or 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.100
 20 years 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.620
 eye the 343 contract it seems to me that 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.959
 It is also 10 years old 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.810
 and they said that the trilogy of the claimed 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.109
 it would be developed in 10 years 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.079
 approximately and then if they 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.750
 they started working since 2008 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.629
 well surely your contract maybe 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.759
 finish in 2018 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.219
 well it's just an idea of ​​mine but the case 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.610
 is that they said they would be 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:35.849
 working on ice for 10 years or 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.280
 possibly the 20 what leaves very in 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.110
 clear that the halo universe still 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.240
 has a lot to give, many 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.490
 fans rejoice with this news because 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.719
 There has also been much talk about a 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.330
 rumor of halo 7 8 and 9 and since 343 has 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:54.449
 declared that if you are going to work with ice 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.300
 for a long time you can still 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.219
 have other games ready but that 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.530
 have nothing to do file forms 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:04.500
 and finally they ended up talking about 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.650
 spartan pge asking if there are any 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.580
 tracks apart for other 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.500
 deliveries and they said they will continue doing 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.090
 more chapters of Spartans since 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.060
 they really like to continue the 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.159
 story in this way and that also you 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.349
 they are making sure that they are taking the 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.750
 correct path and that you like it too 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.009
 to the fans not only to themselves that 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.619
 possibly styles 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.309
 fans really want to see something about 

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:34.499
 the five and the three deliveries or others 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.509
 characters in this so oops 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:38.939
 maybe it would be possible to make it happen 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.249
 they said technically I still had 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:43.649
 a lot to explore within Spartans 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:47.129
 so maybe I could see some clues 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:49.379
 of gel or five in spartans but good 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.319
 the main points of everything that 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:56.099
 declared those of 343 industries is that 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:58.169
 they will go little by little then finish 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.749
 separate from everything that a 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.749
 previously the characters and things 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:06.360
 well since in halo 3 the closure was given 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:09.839
 many characters like johnson 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.419
 343 multisport and Miss Miranda 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:15.509
 here, those of 343 want to create their 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.610
 own list of new characters and 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.360
 new stories for this new 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.849
 trilogy 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.099
 in a few words they want to change a 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.809
 little the game for the future and do it 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.000
 different from the previous deliveries 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:29.160
 they also said 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.250
 master chips will continue to be the 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.460
 main protagonist of the next 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.530
 two games and remember in hello 5 and 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.250

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.410
 many fans have given it the name of 720 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.390
 but I remind you that this is not the 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.040
 official name so far has not been 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.590
 revealed what his real name is 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.380

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.990
 alleged leaks about what is your 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.030
 code name until now but until

 Microsoft did not officially announce it 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.980
