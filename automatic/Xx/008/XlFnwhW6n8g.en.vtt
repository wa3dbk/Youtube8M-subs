 You must not violate this term 90 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.970

 Provide for this term and I 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.780
 I know that on the website of the European Commission 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.120
 there is a special calculator which 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.120
 even allows you to calculate the amount 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.070
 European Union case days 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.040
 unless of course the citizens of the Republic of Moldova 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.330
 violated all these terms violated terms 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:33.080
 stay in countries they may be 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.060

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.110
 either for a certain period I know that 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.170
 this period is up to 5 years 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.420
 but we all understand that 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.459
 the european union aims to 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.130
 border security remained 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.930
 everyone is interested in citizens 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.290
 Republic of Moldova were legally 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.510
 on the territory of the European Union not 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.299
 it will be correct to say that visa-free 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.980
 the mode to the end simplifies everything of course 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.500
 visa-free regime is provided for 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.329

 move around European territory 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.230

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.320
 phone to on the border of the case 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.150
 need could call if it 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.780
 working trip you certainly need 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.880
 be invitation hotel reservation ticket 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.180
 both ends that is such certain 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.310
 formal procedures which we all are 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.709
 observe either this trip to the sea 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.340

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.040
 as far as I know how much 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.680
 I found out the information 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.420
 official sources here the data 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.250
 documents may be required but 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.810
 may also not be required in 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.689
 depending on how clearly 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.629
 man explains his visit that is it 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:06.299
 there will be such a selective survey selective 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.099
 document requirement and delegation 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.140
 European Union then tells you 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.290
 what if by any particular 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.370
 criteria criteria a person is not

 blanks he will be given the reasons for refusal 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.320

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.130
 a person can appeal this 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.080
 case a person can turn 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.360
 Relevant Courts for
