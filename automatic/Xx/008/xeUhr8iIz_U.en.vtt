little too high you don't have to get
out<00:00:52.370> of<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.579> game<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:53.030> can<00:00:53.059> literally<00:00:53.510> drop

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
out of the game you can literally drop

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.319 
out of the game you can literally drop
it<00:00:54.469> down<00:00:54.620> it's<00:00:54.980> this<00:00:55.280> easy<00:00:55.579> it's<00:00:55.850> just<00:00:55.969> going

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
it down it's this easy it's just going

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.360 
it down it's this easy it's just going
back<00:00:56.510> forth<00:00:57.140> between<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.440> couple<00:00:57.649> menus<00:00:58.130> and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
back forth between a couple menus and

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.030 
back forth between a couple menus and
dropping<00:00:59.090> it<00:00:59.360> down<00:00:59.390> you<00:01:00.200> can<00:01:00.260> do<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:00.559> all<00:01:00.739> on

the spacer for this extra distance I
like<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.190> with<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.610> spacer<00:03:20.060> makes<00:03:20.780> for<00:03:20.959> a

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
like it with the spacer makes for a

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.680 
like it with the spacer makes for a
perfect<00:03:21.260> feel<00:03:21.820> very<00:03:22.820> nice<00:03:23.000> paddle<00:03:23.360> shifters

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
perfect feel very nice paddle shifters

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.009 
perfect feel very nice paddle shifters
not<00:03:23.900> too<00:03:24.080> small<00:03:24.350> not<00:03:24.530> too<00:03:24.590> big<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:25.900> like<00:03:26.900> the

not too small not too big I like the

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.930 
not too small not too big I like the
feel<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.410> paddle<00:03:27.709> shifters<00:03:28.100> not<00:03:28.519> Kuwait<00:03:28.820> as

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
feel the paddle shifters not Kuwait as

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.910 
feel the paddle shifters not Kuwait as
clicky<00:03:29.330> as<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.570> g27<00:03:30.019> but<00:03:30.530> they<00:03:30.620> do<00:03:30.680> have<00:03:30.860> a

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
clicky as the g27 but they do have a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.860 
clicky as the g27 but they do have a
good<00:03:31.070> feel<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.489> get<00:03:31.640> used<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:32.030> them<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.630> is

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
good feel and you get used to them it is

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.940 
good feel and you get used to them it is
actually<00:03:33.260> nice<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.470> they're<00:03:33.769> a<00:03:33.799> little

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
actually nice that they're a little

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.910 
actually nice that they're a little
quieter<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:36.140> wheel<00:03:36.290> comes<00:03:36.560> with<00:03:36.709> an<00:03:36.830> optional

it<00:03:47.510> in<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.840> get<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.170> desired<00:03:48.500> distance

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
it in you get to the desired distance

it in you get to the desired distance
and<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.280> makes<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.549> nice<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:49.940> rigid<00:03:53.440> it's<00:03:54.440> very

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
and it makes it nice and rigid it's very

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.380 
and it makes it nice and rigid it's very

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
it's obvious the sequential shifter

it's obvious the sequential shifter
isn't<00:04:01.880> as<00:04:01.970> nice<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.450> say<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.660> frecks<00:04:03.230> sequential

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739

that<00:04:06.019> bad<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:07.160> does<00:04:07.340> have<00:04:07.489> an<00:04:07.610> annoying<00:04:07.880> click

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
that bad it does have an annoying click

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.270 
that bad it does have an annoying click
sound<00:04:08.570> but<00:04:08.870> hey<00:04:09.019> for<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.350> money<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:10.040> really

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280

not<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.549> bad<00:04:10.730> it's<00:04:10.970> got<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.120> nice<00:04:11.329> feel<00:04:11.600> I'd

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
not that bad it's got a nice feel I'd

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.490 
not that bad it's got a nice feel I'd
rather<00:04:12.200> have<00:04:12.440> it<00:04:12.560> more<00:04:12.799> exact<00:04:13.220> than<00:04:13.579> be<00:04:13.940> mushy
