00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
I feel like I need to pull it to like

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.619 
I feel like I need to pull it to like
just<00:00:30.890> relax<00:00:31.310> it<00:00:31.580> a<00:00:31.609> little<00:00:31.910> bit<00:00:32.029> and<00:00:32.180> stuff<00:00:32.419> and

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
just relax it a little bit and stuff and

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.810 
just relax it a little bit and stuff and
so<00:00:33.350> many<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:33.890> were<00:00:34.010> like<00:00:34.190> no<00:00:34.460> we<00:00:34.670> actually

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
so many of you were like no we actually

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.490 
so many of you were like no we actually
love<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:35.510> I<00:00:35.570> went<00:00:35.750> back<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.079> I<00:00:36.140> looked<00:00:36.380> at

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
love it so I went back and I looked at

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.049 
love it so I went back and I looked at
it<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.739> I<00:00:36.770> was<00:00:36.860> like<00:00:37.010> wow<00:00:37.190> it<00:00:37.370> is<00:00:37.399> pretty<00:00:37.880> I

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
it and I was like wow it is pretty I

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.360 
it and I was like wow it is pretty I
think<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.780> was<00:00:39.020> just<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.530> different<00:00:40.010> look<00:00:40.160> than

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
think it was just a different look than

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.010 
think it was just a different look than
what<00:00:40.520> I<00:00:40.579> was<00:00:40.760> used<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:41.329> so<00:00:41.570> I<00:00:41.600> was<00:00:41.719> kind<00:00:41.960> of

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
what I was used to so I was kind of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.360 
what I was used to so I was kind of
self-conscious<00:00:42.620> about<00:00:42.739> it<00:00:42.980> but<00:00:43.160> then<00:00:43.340> I

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
self-conscious about it but then I

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.979 
self-conscious about it but then I
actually<00:00:43.940> looked<00:00:44.329> at<00:00:44.450> different<00:00:44.750> like<00:00:44.870> an

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
actually looked at different like an

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.660 
actually looked at different like an
outsider's<00:00:45.530> perspective<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.399> thought<00:00:46.579> it

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
outsider's perspective and I thought it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.880 
outsider's perspective and I thought it
looked<00:00:46.730> really<00:00:47.059> good<00:00:47.149> so<00:00:47.809> I<00:00:48.079> want<00:00:48.590> me<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.739> show

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
looked really good so I want me to show

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.580 
looked really good so I want me to show
you<00:00:48.950> guys<00:00:49.219> how<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:49.520> did<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:50.360> look<00:00:50.690> from<00:00:51.079> start

curling wand and this one is really

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.790 
curling wand and this one is really
awesome<00:00:58.309> because<00:00:58.610> all<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.149> do<00:00:59.329> is<00:00:59.570> you<00:01:00.559> press

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
awesome because all you do is you press

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.200 
awesome because all you do is you press
these<00:01:01.070> two<00:01:01.280> little<00:01:01.489> buttons<00:01:01.789> one<00:01:02.000> on<00:01:02.120> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
these two little buttons one on the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.420 
these two little buttons one on the
front<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.570> one<00:01:02.750> on<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.989> back<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:03.410> this<00:01:04.070> wand

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
front and one on the back and this wand

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.340 
front and one on the back and this wand
actually<00:01:05.000> pulls<00:01:05.270> off<00:01:05.509> and<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.960> have<00:01:06.049> three

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
actually pulls off and you have three

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.250 
actually pulls off and you have three
different<00:01:06.500> sizes<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:07.700> there<00:01:07.909> is<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.600> jumbo

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
different sizes so there is the jumbo

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.039 
different sizes so there is the jumbo
size<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:10.610> meteor<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.299> guess<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:11.780> could<00:01:11.960> be

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
size the meteor I guess this could be

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.289 
size the meteor I guess this could be
the<00:01:12.170> large<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.890> medium<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.820> small<00:01:14.090> which

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
the large the medium and the small which

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.609 
the large the medium and the small which
is<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.540> one<00:01:14.659> that<00:01:14.840> we<00:01:14.930> will<00:01:15.110> actually<00:01:15.500> be

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
is the one that we will actually be

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.410 
is the one that we will actually be
using<00:01:15.950> for<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.189> tutorial<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:17.240> is

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
using for this tutorial but this is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.969 
using for this tutorial but this is
really<00:01:17.720> great<00:01:17.990> especially<00:01:18.200> because<00:01:18.680> I<00:01:18.950> have

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
really great especially because I have

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.190 
really great especially because I have
been<00:01:19.280> traveling<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:19.970> much<00:01:20.030> lately<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:20.659> instead

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
been traveling so much lately so instead

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.140 
been traveling so much lately so instead
of<00:01:21.290> taking<00:01:21.710> all<00:01:21.950> different<00:01:22.369> curling<00:01:22.700> wands<00:01:23.060> I

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
of taking all different curling wands I

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.120 
of taking all different curling wands I
can<00:01:23.390> literally<00:01:23.900> just<00:01:24.140> take<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:24.530> one<00:01:24.890> base

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
can literally just take this one base

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.280 
can literally just take this one base
these<00:01:25.759> three<00:01:26.030> attachments<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:26.930> super

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
these three attachments and it's super

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.230 
these three attachments and it's super
easy<00:01:27.320> because<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:28.070> don't<00:01:28.250> have<00:01:28.369> to<00:01:28.460> have<00:01:28.580> three

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
easy because I don't have to have three

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.660 
easy because I don't have to have three
full<00:01:29.509> curling<00:01:30.409> wands<00:01:30.740> in<00:01:30.890> my<00:01:31.100> back<00:01:31.280> which<00:01:31.520> is

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
full curling wands in my back which is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.340 
full curling wands in my back which is
great<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:32.450> also<00:01:32.630> good<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.259> don't

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
great and it's also good if you don't

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.469 
great and it's also good if you don't
have<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.740> curling<00:01:34.070> wand<00:01:34.220> yet<00:01:34.700> because<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.299> gives

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
have a curling wand yet because it gives

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.030 
have a curling wand yet because it gives
you<00:01:35.720> different<00:01:35.930> sizes<00:01:36.470> that<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.680> can<00:01:36.740> play

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
you different sizes that you can play

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.800 
you different sizes that you can play
around<00:01:37.189> with<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.759> see<00:01:38.240> kind<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.540> what<00:01:38.720> you

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
around with and see kind of what you

putting<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.920> wand<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.610> hand<00:03:07.030> opposite<00:03:07.900> of

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
putting the wand in the hand opposite of

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.020 
putting the wand in the hand opposite of
the<00:03:08.560> side<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.010> hair<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.430> I'm<00:03:09.519> curling

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
the side of the hair that I'm curling

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.090 
the side of the hair that I'm curling
and<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:10.450> want<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.720> take<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.080> over<00:03:11.230> your<00:03:11.860> head

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
and you want to take it over your head

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.490 
and you want to take it over your head
so<00:03:12.700> that's<00:03:12.940> kind<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.299> my<00:03:13.360> foolproof<00:03:14.140> way<00:03:14.470> of

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
so that's kind of my foolproof way of

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.310 
so that's kind of my foolproof way of
always<00:03:14.980> using<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:16.150> curling<00:03:16.780> wand<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.110> want

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
always using the curling wand you want

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.050 
always using the curling wand you want
to<00:03:17.380> put<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.769> opposite<00:03:18.190> hand<00:03:18.400> take<00:03:18.910> it

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
to put it in the opposite hand take it

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.610 
to put it in the opposite hand take it
over<00:03:19.329> your<00:03:19.510> head<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:20.049> always<00:03:20.350> want<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
over your head and you always want the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.250 
over your head and you always want the
glove<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.040> be<00:03:21.340> on<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.760> hand<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.570> is<00:03:22.750> on<00:03:22.930> the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
glove to be on the hand that is on the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.720 
glove to be on the hand that is on the
side<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.769> hair<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.130> you're<00:03:24.250> currently

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
side of the hair that you're currently

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.670 
side of the hair that you're currently
so<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.329> might<00:03:25.510> sound<00:03:25.720> kind<00:03:26.079> of<00:03:26.140> tricky<00:03:26.500> but

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
so that might sound kind of tricky but

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.500 
so that might sound kind of tricky but
it<00:03:26.890> becomes<00:03:27.100> second-nature<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.209> super

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
it becomes second-nature and it's super

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.780 
it becomes second-nature and it's super
simple<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.350> what<00:03:29.620> I'm<00:03:29.709> doing<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:30.160> just<00:03:30.220> taking

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
simple so what I'm doing is just taking

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.819 
simple so what I'm doing is just taking
about<00:03:30.970> one-inch<00:03:31.420> sections<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.200> curling<00:03:32.739> it

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
about one-inch sections and curling it

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.920 
about one-inch sections and curling it
around<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.280> curling<00:03:33.519> wand<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.480> can<00:03:34.660> tell

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
around the curling wand and you can tell

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.890 
around the curling wand and you can tell
that<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.230> am<00:03:35.530> keeping<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.489> hair<00:03:36.790> flat<00:03:37.360> I'm<00:03:37.660> not

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
that I am keeping the hair flat I'm not

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.740 
that I am keeping the hair flat I'm not
twisting<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.650> before<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.160> twist<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.150> around<00:03:40.329> the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
twisting it before I twist it around the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.360 
twisting it before I twist it around the
curling<00:03:40.930> wand<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.709> is<00:03:41.860> going<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.220> give<00:03:42.340> us

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
curling wand this is going to give us

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.430 
curling wand this is going to give us
the<00:03:42.640> look<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.120> like<00:03:43.390> if<00:03:43.600> you<00:03:43.720> do<00:03:43.900> twist<00:03:44.260> the

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
the look that I like if you do twist the

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.770 
the look that I like if you do twist the
hair<00:03:44.650> before<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:45.910> put<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.239> around<00:03:46.390> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
hair before you put it around the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.509 
hair before you put it around the
curling<00:03:46.989> wand<00:03:47.170> it's<00:03:47.650> going<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.070> give<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.370> a

put<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.169> glove<00:04:41.379> on<00:04:41.530> because<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.979> find<00:04:42.280> that

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
put the glove on because I find that

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.520 
put the glove on because I find that
this<00:04:42.759> last<00:04:43.030> section<00:04:43.449> of<00:04:43.539> hair<00:04:43.750> is<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.110> fine<00:04:44.500> and

this last section of hair is so fine and

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.950

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
thin that it's actually hard to grip

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.510 
thin that it's actually hard to grip
