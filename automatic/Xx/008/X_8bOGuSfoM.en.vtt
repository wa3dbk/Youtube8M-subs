00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:08.170
 well we have already put the plug below 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.240
 which is where the filter is 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.190
 this one here also has a screw 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.500
 behind it too but it 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.950
 Even as the masters and that the filter 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.950
 mesh 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.099
 we do it only for one side 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.380
 then we loosened here that is the 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.120
 rod then to check the oil 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.930
 is unthreaded 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:38.110
 and we look at it let's introduce 1.4 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.610
 here we have the oil here I have a 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.340
 liter 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.090
 OK 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.090
 we introduce 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.859
 a liter 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.750
 and later 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.100
 we put 400 and we are checking up to 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.610
 level then we started the motorcycle 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.979
 we leave it for a while 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.880
 we stopped the motorcycle we left about 5 minutes and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.880
 we check the level 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.850
 now we have put 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.850
 a liter 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.860
 we put here 400 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.160
 up to 400 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.140
 and good 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.979
 we check to not overdo 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.979
 we put 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.250
 we leave you some 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.770
 approximately 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.750
 come on the stopper 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.659
 and we started the bike and we are checking 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.460
 until the level is left I leave it 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.720
 always three quarters or a little 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.720
 less than to stop it's good, it's all
