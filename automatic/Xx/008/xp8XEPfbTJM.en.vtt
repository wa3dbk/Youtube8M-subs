00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.490
 86 I'm not going to talk to you about the goal 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.690
 but that a move that almost leaves you 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.689
 outside 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.380
 it was a play that we 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.519
 we had worked germany had 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.880
 I had a free side shot in favor 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.710
 that they left one outside the area 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.710
 so that if the other team made the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.989
 law of order came that player who 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.690
 was outside the area to hit the one 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.540
 did the pain happened that the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.670
 had to go to hit that player who 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:49.750
 came running to touch me was not 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:51.640
 clear then the German comes hit me 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.939
 hit me here in the articulation of 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.309
 arm and it kills me that is to come out well 

00:00:54.939 --> 00:01:00.280
 that livianito and I turn to the devil 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.280
 then it makes an awesome pain that 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.460
 the truth 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.460
 pains now yes yes yes yes a pain 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.070
 terrible the doctor gets me out for the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.760
 side and when he goes walking I see that 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.760
 Madero does like this 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.800
 and I look at him and say that gesture so 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.800
 this we have to have it 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.060
 careful then I look at it to wood and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.910
 I tell you, doctor, does not even think about getting me out 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.810
 You saw that this is how I come from 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.480
 court 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.330
 and in the first carelessness he has 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.820
 I return to the court I go I put 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.530
 in the position that had just attacks us 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.200
 germany that will take a ball 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.780
 outside by the end of the street then 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.720
 I grab the shirt I bite it 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:52.330
 there I put my finger now hole but 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.450
 clear and there I kept playing like I'm going to 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.940
 leave a world end or crazy 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.790
 but neither crazy did not cross me in any 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.760
 moment grab and pass the line of 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.290
 cost and go to the dressing room or crazy and 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.290
 I grabbed and I kept playing and I played 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.849
 but football with feet on the shoulder 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.260
 we win by luck we win because if not 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.599
 poor Carlos they killed Carlos and 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.120
 winning but knows that but bilardo that 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:31.420
 what this why why did you leave it 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.420
 because you did not get it but it 's a global 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.720
 in a global and more with the handle that 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.700
 we had ourselves in the group to play 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.940
 seven matches is already an achievement in a 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.799
 worldwide you who played them 7 have 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.790
 to win clear if I'm going to get to 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.790
 seventh has to earn it 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.000
 final car uruguay fourth england 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.489
 be with belgium and that's it was duck 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.060
 gallareta is world champion nothing the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.030
 lifetime 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:06.030
 and each of us had enlarged 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.030
 distrustful 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.060
 but as a team we were a team 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.760
 we were we had a million points 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.680
 as ace 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.049
 a player knowing that he has the best 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.540
 of the world is a campus but not 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.829
 only depended on Maradona Maradona 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.950
 It was the best in the world but also 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.510
 you all had to do things 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.360
 so that the new selection does not equal that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.190
 now that in this world cup is messi and 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.430
 how is that how to work but before the 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.920
 head to that best one to that number one what 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.100
 you have to help too but you have to 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.310
 make you feel the best and number one 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.410
 do not 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.060
 there does not have to be any problem of 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.739
 nothing clear is 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.770
 we had number one which is the 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.200
 number one was coming beat us a clap 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.890
 he told us bold as this one showed is 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.830
 that although I broke it 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.050
 Diego said it like that and I'm going to say 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.350
 pug 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.080
 then what we have a month today yes and 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.550
 you also respected one but 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.889
 as we will not respect it if we knew 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.919
 that was the best in the world 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.740
 you understand me that was already who can be 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.270
 put on a logical parity nobody nobody by 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.020
 that but that's not only bigger 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.659
 I say thumb was the best the best known 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.550
 the most famous for the people for the 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.189
 journalists but to us it was 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.340
 one more but no more 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:41.669
 one day I tell god I'm not going to go where 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.189
 We were going to Giovinco just because I do not have 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.870
 I let you borrow a new one 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.870
 of the brand 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.979
 and when the world cup ends 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.300
 it ends world but nothing I neither crazy 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.539
 we came from europe already for 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:08.000
 to settle in Mexico we were in the 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:11.130
 Bogota airport says me without a club 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.370
 I was going through a situation with very, very 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.070
 very committed 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.430
 so I'm at the shopping mall 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.590
 Bogota airport I am in a 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.620
 stained glass looking watches 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.200
 first class watches 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.720
 then there comes diego that tells me 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.720
 that this whole band 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:42.640
 you saw that I'm looking how nice 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.680
 it could be the expensive price because it was the 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.680
 part of first level clocks 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.930
 but to stop it does not let him let leave 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.180
 let me tell you I did not leave 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.940
 we arrived at the world cup as we said 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.830
 us the afternoon before the match 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.789
 We went to the mall as we were going 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.360
 it was a world of clear people because the 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:15.460
 people knew that we were going to see 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.680
 then get to the micro to become 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.650
 to the concentration was an odyssey 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.320
 So, well, I come in. I get up. I feel 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.830
 with the teacher and over there diego 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.889
 forward horse on horse dresses for 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:34.360
 here he said here that he believes taken taken says 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:37.300
 you saw with a bag you saw 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.490
 and I tell him that 's what makes a mine 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.520
 he gave it to me for you saw half this for 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.620
 you and I tell you that mine and tells me boludo 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.349
 look at the people who want me to remember 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.810
 what mine then avoid taking me out of your 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:52.060
 taking more victim the bag grabs 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.900
 I'm going to make a watch 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.900
 you understand me 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.450
 but that was the diego I was with 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:10.320
 That was us that made us tell 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.320
 enormous
