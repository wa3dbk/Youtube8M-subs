00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.769
 product or multiplication of numbers 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.219
 natural distributive property with 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.830
 regarding addition and subtraction 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.760
 suppose we have a certain number of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.080
 coins grouped into stacks of five 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.300
 coins each and these distributed in 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.899
 groups of two three and four batteries yes 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.449
 we want to find out how many coins 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:40.079
 we have in total the calculation can 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:43.409
 be done in two different ways the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.050
 first you will be counting the number of batteries 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:50.429
 and multiplying it by the number of 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.440
 coins of each pile is two more 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:59.370
 three plus four columns of five 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.879
 coins equal to nine columns of five 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.170
 coins which gives us a total of 45 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.000
 coins another method would calculate the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.050
 number of coins of each 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.410
 group and add the partial results 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:20.700
 here we would have two stacks of five 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:24.990
 coins what are ten coins in the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.260
 second group three of five coins what 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 that would be fifteen coins and the last 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.250
 group four stacks of five coins what 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.340
 which gives us a total of 20 coins 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.340
 Now adding the partial results 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.670
 we get 45 coins as a result 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.520
 Finally we can see that through 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.540
 both methods come to the same 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.990
 result the product of the sum by the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.020
 number 5 is equal to the sum of the three 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.130
 products that are obtained by multiplying 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.410
 each adding by the number 5 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.860
 generically announced through the 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.700
 next theorem the product of a 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.050
 sum for a number equals the sum of 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.930
 the products 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.620
 that are obtained by multiplying each 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:24.000
 adding up by that number we express 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.480
 symbolically the hypothesis and the thesis to 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.750
 which we want to arrive, let's prove it 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.070
 now as follows by 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:41.390
 definition of multiplication to mabe more 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:47.070
 by n is equal to the sum of n addends 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.550
 same aa plus b plus below 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.940
 we will delete the parentheses resulting 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.840
 an expression where there are n addends 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.800
 same an add two equal know 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.680
 who add 2 c applying the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.890
 commutative if associative properties 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:13.680
 of the sum we gather all the addends 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.940
 same getting three groups of n 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.540
 sometimes times b 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:26.800
 sometimes I know that it's exactly what 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.520
 we wanted to arrive the sum of an b n more 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.320
 cn 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:36.500
 this is how we arrived at the thesis 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.620
 summarizing for the sum the product of 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.700
 a sum for a number is equal to the 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.440
 sum of the products obtained 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.490
 multiplying each summand by said 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.160
 number 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:55.550
 turn more for n is equal to 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.940
 mabe n more cn 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.030
 to the straight the product of a difference 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.720
 by a number is equal to the product of 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.200
 minute for that number minus the product 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:16.239
 from subtracting by that same number to 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:19.730
 minus b for n equals an minus bn 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.490
 finally for the algebraic sum the 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.610
 product of an algebraic sum for a 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.270
 number is the number that is obtained 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:33.050
 multiplying each term of the sum 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.340
 for that number and making the sum 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.770
 Algebraic of partial products 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:44.080
 remember that the algebraic sum is a 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.080
 succession of addition and subtraction
