00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello, welcome to Todd's kitchen. Millions of people eat in McDonald's daily life. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.759
 Now you know it can be cheaper at home. 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.879
 Everyone knows bacon and egg muffins, but the world also has sausage and egg muffins personally 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.629
 The taste is even better. Join me today to make my version of sausage and egg muffins 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.530
 Start with the bowl into the bowl where we are going to go in a half teaspoon of saints 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.470
 Half teaspoon thyme 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.490
 a quarter teaspoon of pepper 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.450
 One teaspoon of onion salt 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.240
 One teaspoon of garlic salt 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.370
 Quarter teaspoon of marjoram 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.060
 And just a little nutmeg 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.390
 Combined with agitation 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.890
 Next we will use some minced meat or ground meat. 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.720
 In the middle, make a small hole 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.160
 Then grab the first quarter 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.510
 Our combination teaspoon 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 And put its center 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.230
 And make sure you certainly have a clean hand 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.230
 Mix through 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.920
 Just until it is well combined, passed the whole meat 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.750
 Once it is mixed through 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.260
 Put it in a bowl 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.970
 Any then put them in the fridge for a few hours 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.410
 Just such herbs can inject meat 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.200
 Now I have a medium, high calorie deep fryer 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.820
 So, I want to add a couple of egg rings 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.930
 Some cooking spray oils and greases 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.450
 , grab our cake and place it in the middle 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.720
 And flattening 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.640
 The reason I use the egg ring now is that it is just constantly in all shapes evenly 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.450
 It is a demonstration tactic 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.510
 So you don't have to use the egg ring 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.120
 This makes it look much better 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.229
 So, we have to cook both sides 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.679
 And it should take about two to three minutes on the first side 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.679
 On the same second side 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:26.309
 Next, I have two muffins, toaster, so they lightly bake 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.569
 Such a top 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.569
 Just light a butter. 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.849
 Then place a piece of cheese at the bottom 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.209
 Therefore, once cooked 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.579
 Take out the egg ring 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.719
 And take them. 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.059
 Identical ring used under 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:53.059
 Just cracked eggs 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.019
 Just broke up the egg yolk a little bit 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:08.019
 Cook for about a minute or two, then turn them over and cook for a minute. 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:19.479
 We just need to put the cooked eggs on the sausage. 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.869
 And it's done. 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.999
 It is very simple and easy to do, it is cheap, then buy it and also dispense 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:31.999
 From McDonald's. But the biggest test is, is it taste like real? Let us give it a try. 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:45.139
 Do you know if I bring one, do one, and taste both of them, I really don't believe, I can tell the difference 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.879
 It is 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.629
 McDonald's 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.189
 Sausage and egg muffins, really really 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.489
 However, there are always better things to make, do you know what it is? 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.219
 When you are at home, its taste is delicious. 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:01.789
 So take this when you have a chance to show your skills. It's not what you want, every day 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:03.979
 May be once a week, once a month, there is no problem at all. 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.889
 Just make sure you burn it at the gym. As usual, under the ingredients list 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.999
 And links to my Facebook, Twitter and Google+ pages 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.949
