00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
I posted a video like this very similar

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.349 
I posted a video like this very similar
which<00:00:16.770> unfortunately<00:00:17.130> became<00:00:17.640> obsolete<00:00:17.850> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
which unfortunately became obsolete and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.290 
which unfortunately became obsolete and
that<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> reason<00:00:18.869> why<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> removed<00:00:19.949> it

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
that is the reason why I removed it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
that is the reason why I removed it
until<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.570> was<00:00:21.930> back<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.500> running<00:00:22.590> now

until it was back up and running now

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.679 
until it was back up and running now
because<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> end<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> day<00:00:24.390> YouTube

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
because at the end of the day YouTube

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.310 
because at the end of the day YouTube
videos<00:00:25.320> views<00:00:25.769> aren't<00:00:26.039> work<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.599> advice
