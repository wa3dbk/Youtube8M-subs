many<00:00:10.110> years<00:00:10.350> ago<00:00:10.470> when<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.889> first<00:00:10.950> started<00:00:11.280> this

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
many years ago when I first started this

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.690 
many years ago when I first started this
business<00:00:11.880> everything<00:00:12.840> was<00:00:13.019> hands-on<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.309> we

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
business everything was hands-on and we

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.620 
business everything was hands-on and we
created<00:00:15.800> with<00:00:16.800> our<00:00:16.950> hands<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.330> basically

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
created with our hands we have basically

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.749 
created with our hands we have basically
some<00:00:19.200> magic<00:00:19.500> markers<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.009> plastic<00:00:20.400> scissors

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
some magic markers and plastic scissors

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.550 
some magic markers and plastic scissors
and<00:00:20.970> we've<00:00:21.090> created<00:00:21.540> everything<00:00:21.989> by<00:00:22.290> using

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and we've created everything by using

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.339 
and we've created everything by using
our<00:00:22.829> hands<00:00:23.689> unfortunately<00:00:24.689> those<00:00:24.869> days<00:00:25.140> are

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
our hands unfortunately those days are

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.929 
our hands unfortunately those days are
long<00:00:25.380> gone<00:00:26.000> however<00:00:27.000> now<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:27.989> use<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.680> map

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
long gone however now we use the map

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.220 
long gone however now we use the map
computers<00:00:29.939> are<00:00:30.059> brilliant<00:00:30.390> they're<00:00:31.140> great

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
computers are brilliant they're great

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.170 
computers are brilliant they're great
them<00:00:31.470> they<00:00:31.590> work<00:00:31.829> the<00:00:32.460> trouble<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.910> when<00:00:33.090> they

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
them they work the trouble is when they

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.540 
them they work the trouble is when they
break<00:00:33.420> down<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.870> naket<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:35.250> all<00:00:35.399> those

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
break down with naket and all those

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.819 
break down with naket and all those
skills<00:00:36.059> remember<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.440> keep<00:00:37.800> them

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
skills remember them and keep them

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.279 
skills remember them and keep them
because<00:00:38.609> they're<00:00:38.760> important<00:00:39.269> of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.870> bygone

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
because they're important of the bygone

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.680 
because they're important of the bygone
years<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.859> few<00:00:41.640> months<00:00:41.789> ago<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.149> asked<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> my

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
years a few months ago I asked one of my

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.720 
years a few months ago I asked one of my
juniors<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> draw<00:00:43.620> me<00:00:43.769> a<00:00:43.800> six<00:00:44.070> inch<00:00:44.250> diameter

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
juniors to draw me a six inch diameter

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
juniors to draw me a six inch diameter
circle<00:00:44.969> half<00:00:45.839> an<00:00:46.019> hour<00:00:46.109> late<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:46.559> still<00:00:46.859> with

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
circle half an hour late now still with

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
circle half an hour late now still with
the<00:00:47.100> client<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.550> thinking<00:00:47.850> where<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.350> they

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the client I'm thinking where is it they

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959 
the client I'm thinking where is it they
said<00:00:49.530> wherever<00:00:49.679> the<00:00:49.890> problem<00:00:50.249> working<00:00:50.429> at<00:00:50.730> six

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
said wherever the problem working at six

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.520 
said wherever the problem working at six
inches<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.390> listen<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> called<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
inches and listen this is called a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
inches and listen this is called a
compass<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.519> Spang<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.089> very<00:00:54.300> quickly

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
compass and I Spang one very quickly

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.680 
compass and I Spang one very quickly
never<00:00:55.499> forget<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> compass<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.239> other<00:00:57.449> great

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
never forget the compass the other great

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
never forget the compass the other great
trick<00:00:58.019> for<00:00:58.050> me<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.309> had<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.640> draw

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
trick for me is that when we had to draw

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.470 
trick for me is that when we had to draw
ellipses<00:01:00.620> it<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.859> very<00:01:02.010> simple<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.969> used

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
ellipses it was very simple all we used

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.679 
ellipses it was very simple all we used
was<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.589> use<00:01:04.830> some<00:01:05.129> pins<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:06.799> hammer<00:01:08.570> what<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
was we use some pins a hammer what you

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.480 
was we use some pins a hammer what you
would<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.409> measure<00:01:10.649> you<00:01:11.159> would<00:01:11.340> get

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
would do you and measure you would get

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910 
would do you and measure you would get
the<00:01:11.549> length<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.149> your<00:01:12.299> lips<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.530> however<00:01:13.740> long

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the length of your lips so however long

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.870 
the length of your lips so however long
you<00:01:14.280> wanted<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.920> width<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:17.670> work

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
you wanted it the width you would work

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
you wanted it the width you would work
out<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> piece<00:01:19.829> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
out and then you would get a piece of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.230 
out and then you would get a piece of
string<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.579> you<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:21.869> your<00:01:22.110> string<00:01:23.240> tie

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
string and you would get your string tie

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.920 
string and you would get your string tie
a<00:01:24.270> string<00:01:24.719> and<00:01:25.399> then<00:01:26.399> create<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
a string and then create it so that it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.889 
a string and then create it so that it
was<00:01:28.049> half<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> diameter<00:01:29.600> what<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.719> would

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
was half of the diameter what you would

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.310 
was half of the diameter what you would
then<00:01:31.049> do<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.560> would<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:32.430> our<00:01:32.549> paper<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
then do we would get our paper or a

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.569 
then do we would get our paper or a
template<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:34.590> usually<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.219> won't<00:01:35.399> have

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
template because usually we won't have

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.969 
template because usually we won't have
these<00:01:35.729> cut<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.270> perspex<00:01:36.899> or<00:01:37.170> whatever<00:01:37.799> we

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
these cut out in perspex or whatever we

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.370 
these cut out in perspex or whatever we
were<00:01:38.100> creating<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.329> put<00:01:39.539> your<00:01:39.689> string<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
were creating you put your string on the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.760 
were creating you put your string on the
pins<00:01:40.820> then<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.090> your<00:01:42.210> pencil<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.530> put

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
pins then you get your pencil you put

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.090 
pins then you get your pencil you put
your<00:01:43.890> pencil<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:46.049> half<00:01:46.289> of<00:01:46.469> the<00:01:46.590> diameter

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
your pencil in so half of the diameter

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.560 
your pencil in so half of the diameter
and<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:48.060> start<00:01:48.329> spinning<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.729> drawing<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and you start spinning and drawing the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.690 
and you start spinning and drawing the
ellipse<00:01:52.490> very<00:01:53.490> careful<00:01:54.149> very<00:01:54.710> slowly<00:01:55.710> your

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
ellipse very careful very slowly your

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.630 
ellipse very careful very slowly your
ellipse<00:01:57.060> will<00:01:57.359> appear<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.340> you've<00:01:59.490> got

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
ellipse will appear and what you've got

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160 
ellipse will appear and what you've got
to<00:01:59.789> do<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.030> concentrate<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.929> go<00:02:01.079> around

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
to do is concentrate as you go around

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.770 
to do is concentrate as you go around
those<00:02:01.500> pins<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.880> then<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.140> come<00:02:04.320> up

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.029 

there<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.069> ellipse<00:02:09.770> obviously<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:10.890> would

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
there is your ellipse obviously we would

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.740 
there is your ellipse obviously we would
then<00:02:11.160> get<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.370> rubber<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.940> clean<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.300> up<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
then get a rubber and clean it up and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.960 
then get a rubber and clean it up and
clean<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.260> lines<00:02:13.410> but<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.490> perfect

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
clean the lines but there is a perfect

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.059 
clean the lines but there is a perfect
