it you can see it's almost even with it
on<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.250> side<00:01:27.680> this<00:01:28.680> thing's<00:01:28.920> got<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> pretty

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
on this side this thing's got a pretty

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880 
on this side this thing's got a pretty
long<00:01:29.820> cord<00:01:30.090> which<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> nice<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
long cord which is nice when you have it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.410 
long cord which is nice when you have it
on<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> truss<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.640> could<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> end<00:01:33.180> in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
on the truss it could be on the end in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.719 
on the truss it could be on the end in
the<00:01:33.509> middle<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.070> more<00:01:35.070> likely<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.640> gonna

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the middle and more likely it's gonna

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.240 
the middle and more likely it's gonna
you<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.420> reach<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.200> actual<00:01:37.590> power<00:01:38.549> supply

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
you know reach your actual power supply

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.910 
you know reach your actual power supply
it's<00:01:41.250> hard<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.729> tell<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.740> but<00:01:43.740> there's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it's hard to tell on here but there's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.990 
it's hard to tell on here but there's
actually<00:01:44.430> two<00:01:45.409> two<00:01:46.409> spots<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.850> can

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
actually two two spots on here you can

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.690 
actually two two spots on here you can
see<00:01:48.119> one<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> bottom<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> top<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
see one on the bottom on the top to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.020 
see one on the bottom on the top to
place<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.090> mount<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> bracket<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
place the mount the bracket it is

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.200 
place the mount the bracket it is
sound-activated<00:01:54.689> only<00:01:55.320> no<00:01:56.100> DMX<00:01:56.640> controllable

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
sound-activated only no DMX controllable

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
sound-activated only no DMX controllable
and<00:02:00.500> it's<00:02:01.500> similar<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.659> 250<00:02:03.659> watt<00:02:03.810> bulb<00:02:04.530> but

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and it's similar to a 250 watt bulb but

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.249 
and it's similar to a 250 watt bulb but
it<00:02:05.070> only<00:02:05.189> uses<00:02:05.460> about<00:02:05.610> 30<00:02:06.090> watts

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
it only uses about 30 watts

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
it weighs only about eight pounds

chocolate<00:02:12.569> feel<00:02:12.750> quick<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.319> see<00:02:13.410> what

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
chocolate feel quick so you can see what

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.580 
chocolate feel quick so you can see what
this<00:02:13.620> thing<00:02:13.830> looks<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:18.319> right<00:02:19.319> now<00:02:19.470> there's

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
this thing looks like right now there's

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.140 
this thing looks like right now there's
no<00:02:19.800> sound<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.670> kind<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.940> goes<00:02:21.120> through

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
no sound so it just kind of goes through

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.290 
no sound so it just kind of goes through
some<00:02:21.569> patterns<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.790> as<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.060> see

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
some patterns and that as you can see

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.559 
some patterns and that as you can see
I'll<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.870> kind<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.140> do<00:02:25.260> its<00:02:25.410> own<00:02:25.470> thing<00:02:26.569> and

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
I'll just kind of do its own thing and

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.150 
I'll just kind of do its own thing and
then<00:02:27.720> whenever<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.140> start<00:02:28.470> adding<00:02:28.680> sound<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
then whenever you start adding sound to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.080 
then whenever you start adding sound to
it<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.440> see<00:02:31.680> they<00:02:32.670> move<00:02:32.850> with<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
it as you can see they move with the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.809 
it as you can see they move with the
beat<00:02:33.800> go<00:02:34.800> ahead<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.190> turn<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.550> some<00:02:35.790> music

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
beat go ahead and turn on some music

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.430 
beat go ahead and turn on some music
here<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.569> guys<00:02:36.720> can<00:02:36.930> kind<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.170> get<00:02:37.290> an<00:02:37.380> idea

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
here so you guys can kind of get an idea

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.390 
here so you guys can kind of get an idea
I<00:02:39.050> do<00:02:40.050> realize<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.860> an<00:02:41.010> old<00:02:41.190> song

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
I do realize that this is an old song

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.040 
I do realize that this is an old song
but<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.060> when<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.239> have<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.569> CD<00:02:42.840> here

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
but this just when I have on a CD here

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.190 
but this just when I have on a CD here
and<00:02:43.350> then<00:02:43.440> grad<00:02:44.120> C<00:02:45.120> if<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.269> good<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.660> go<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.110> you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
and then grad C if I good to go so you

00:02:46.200 --> 00:03:11.610 
and then grad C if I good to go so you
guys<00:02:46.319> get<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> better<00:02:46.739> idea

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.320 

you<00:03:12.620> can<00:03:12.800> see<00:03:12.950> here<00:03:13.220> when<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:13.910> does<00:03:14.090> have<00:03:14.240> to

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
you can see here when it does have to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.590 
you can see here when it does have to
continue<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.720> space<00:03:15.080> like<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:17.420> doesn't

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
continue a space like this it doesn't

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.480 
continue a space like this it doesn't
just<00:03:17.870> keep<00:03:18.020> rotating<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:19.070> probably<00:03:19.340> makes

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
just keep rotating that probably makes

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.700 
just keep rotating that probably makes
people<00:03:19.820> dizzy<00:03:20.180> after<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.480> while<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:21.380> that's<00:03:21.530> why

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
people dizzy after a while so that's why

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.590 
people dizzy after a while so that's why
I<00:03:21.770> did<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.010> pause<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.150> know<00:03:23.240> kind<00:03:23.510> of

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
I did that pause and you know kind of

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.080 
I did that pause and you know kind of
went<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.750> advance<00:03:24.410> which<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.610> think<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.940> nice

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
went to advance which is I think a nice

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.770 
went to advance which is I think a nice
effect<00:03:30.070> sometimes<00:03:31.070> when<00:03:31.280> there's<00:03:31.780> non-stop

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
effect sometimes when there's non-stop

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.540 
effect sometimes when there's non-stop
base<00:03:33.020> it<00:03:33.350> will<00:03:33.530> actually<00:03:33.890> keep<00:03:34.070> going<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.400> one

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
base it will actually keep going to one

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.280 
base it will actually keep going to one
direction<00:03:34.760> for<00:03:35.210> a<00:03:35.240> couple<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.570> times<00:03:35.750> it'll

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
direction for a couple of times it'll

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:51.150 
direction for a couple of times it'll
stop<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.860> then<00:03:36.980> going<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.280> other<00:03:37.370> way

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160
