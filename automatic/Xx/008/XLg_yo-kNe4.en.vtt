Canadian<00:00:02.429> Geese<00:00:02.669> are<00:00:02.879> little<00:00:03.090> noisy<00:00:03.510> today

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
Canadian Geese are little noisy today

Canadian Geese are little noisy today
but<00:00:04.620> what<00:00:04.740> you're<00:00:04.890> looking<00:00:04.920> at<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.580> some<00:00:05.879> old

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
but what you're looking at is some old

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
peers from what I believe was a tie-in

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.700

this subject but I didn't I didn't know

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.000 
this subject but I didn't I didn't know
that<00:02:22.420> much<00:02:22.630> about<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:23.650> myself<00:02:24.310> but<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:24.880> is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
that much about this myself but this is

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.820 
that much about this myself but this is
old<00:02:27.010> streetcar<00:02:27.400> right<00:02:27.820> away<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:29.050> existed<00:02:29.650> it

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
old streetcar right away that existed it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.650 
old streetcar right away that existed it
turned<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.340> century<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.970> was<00:02:31.390> done<00:02:32.550> probably

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
turned the century and was done probably

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.080 
turned the century and was done probably
even<00:02:34.660> before<00:02:34.900> 1920<00:02:35.890> could<00:02:36.459> have<00:02:36.550> been<00:02:36.670> flooded

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
even before 1920 could have been flooded

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.479 
even before 1920 could have been flooded
out<00:02:37.269> here<00:02:37.600> because<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.410> right<00:02:38.590> on<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.920> water

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
out here because it's right on the water

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.860 
out here because it's right on the water
but<00:02:40.800> that's<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:42.160> put<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> comment<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.660> if<00:02:43.780> you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
but that's it put a comment on if you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.950 
but that's it put a comment on if you
know<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.019> little<00:02:44.230> bit<00:02:44.350> more<00:02:44.560> about<00:02:44.739> it
