00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:11.700
 good day horizon number 2 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:14.240
 smartphone fly iq450 quattro punished 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.020
 wisely 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:26.039
 last year's update seems like my 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.920
 nickname model horizon number one apparatus with 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:37.129
 large 5-inch screen 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:40.500
 not very large resolution of 480 by 854 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:44.120
 previous horizon I had it 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.489
 tested the review we have on the site and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.910
 despite the modest and present times 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.120
 I really liked the resolution of the device 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.050
 that is, I came to the conclusion that even so 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.719
 large crane 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:08.549
 screen with a resolution of 480 by 854 she 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.680
 quite suppose that changed by 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.680
 compared to last year's model 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.140
 standard equipment therefore and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.600
 Commented Well, that's changed 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.439
 amount of RAM was 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.439
 half a gigabyte became a full gigabyte 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.200
 changed if there was 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.310
 dual core mediatek 6577 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:45.030
 and now in this model 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:50.640
 more modern too mediatek 6580 9 s 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:56.000
 four i will take the battery stayed 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.000
 like the old 2000 milliamper hours 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.869
 camera 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:12.560
 resolution preserved at 8 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:16.220
 gothic but seemingly different 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.599
 see given crucische obviously no one 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:27.410
 opened to me completely but with all 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:30.560
 lotions so any 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:36.590

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:43.040

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:47.540

 machine as you usually do not happen of life 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:20.500
 2 seven times the size of 7 to ordinary that is 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:20.500
 large 1 2 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.190
 like a thread everywhere that is necessary here 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.150
 because its 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:41.590
 flash memory device is not very much 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:46.360
 only 4 gigabytes yes I forgot to say that 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:51.340

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:55.450
 if there was a fourth then 4.2 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:00.819

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:04.590

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.340

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.440
 conduct large detailed tests 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.020
 battery 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.970

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.970

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.290
