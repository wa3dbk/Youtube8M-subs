magazine anything bigger than 20 that
was<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> only<00:01:52.140> downfall<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.979> thing<00:01:53.159> it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
was the only downfall with this thing it

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.899 
was the only downfall with this thing it
did<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.090> random<00:01:54.750> recoil<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.740> times<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.640> man

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
did have random recoil at times but man

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.149 
did have random recoil at times but man
this<00:01:57.390> thing<00:01:57.659> would<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:57.960> mow<00:01:58.530> them<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:59.070> if

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
this thing would just mow them over if

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.249 
this thing would just mow them over if
you<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.520> them<00:01:59.700> within<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.329> first<00:02:00.540> 20<00:02:00.869> rounds

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you got them within the first 20 rounds

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.020 
you got them within the first 20 rounds
you<00:02:01.320> could<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.680> three<00:02:02.040> or<00:02:02.189> four<00:02:02.460> people<00:02:02.700> with

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
you could get three or four people with

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
you could get three or four people with
this<00:02:03.210> thing<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:04.079> what<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> remember<00:02:04.469> about

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
this thing that's what I remember about

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
this thing that's what I remember about
it<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> most<00:02:05.490> three<00:02:05.850> low<00:02:06.000> tide<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.360> decent

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it the most three low tide was decent

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.990 
it the most three low tide was decent
especially<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:07.860> an<00:02:07.920> LMG<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.729> was<00:02:08.879> an

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
especially for an LMG so that was an

the<00:02:14.130> rate<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.280> fire<00:02:14.520> was<00:02:14.760> very<00:02:15.090> very<00:02:15.480> low<00:02:16.430> 375

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
the rate of fire was very very low 375

the rate of fire was very very low 375
rounds<00:02:17.819> per<00:02:18.000> minute<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.930> remember<00:02:19.350> how

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
rounds per minute but you remember how

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.830

low the rate of fire was but the way

low the rate of fire was but the way
this<00:02:22.050> thing<00:02:22.350> sounded<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> was<00:02:23.130> intimidating

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
this thing sounded it was intimidating

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.940 
this thing sounded it was intimidating
even<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.450> video<00:02:24.750> game<00:02:24.810> when<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.800> were

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
even in a video game when you were

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.770 
even in a video game when you were
shooting<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.459> people<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.360> recoil

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
shooting at people with this the recoil

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.690 
shooting at people with this the recoil
like<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.080> said<00:02:28.260> was<00:02:28.380> very<00:02:28.440> high<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.550> was

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
like I said was very high and it was

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.550 
like I said was very high and it was
sometimes<00:02:30.120> random<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.750> penetration<00:02:31.380> was

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
sometimes random the penetration was

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.920 
sometimes random the penetration was
large<00:02:31.950> as<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.430> they<00:02:32.580> say<00:02:32.790> about<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
large as what they say about it and it

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.530 
large as what they say about it and it
was<00:02:34.050> unlocked<00:02:34.410> at<00:02:34.620> level<00:02:34.650> four<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.910> what<00:02:36.510> I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
was unlocked at level four so what I

was your favorite memory did you get a
massive<00:02:44.520> kill<00:02:44.790> fee<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.209> was<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> problem

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
massive kill fee but that was a problem

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.240 
massive kill fee but that was a problem
with<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.900> thing<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.709> couldn't<00:02:47.040> really

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
with this thing is you couldn't really

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.820 
with this thing is you couldn't really
feed<00:02:47.730> with<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.239> because<00:02:48.780> by<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.170> time<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.650> got

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
feed with it because by the time you got

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.920 
feed with it because by the time you got
through<00:02:50.250> two<00:02:50.520> or<00:02:50.700> three<00:02:50.970> guys<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.660> were<00:02:51.750> out

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
through two or three guys you were out

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.900 
through two or three guys you were out
of<00:02:52.080> ammo<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.440> probably<00:02:52.890> had<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.100> opportunity

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
of ammo you probably had the opportunity

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.030 
of ammo you probably had the opportunity
to<00:02:54.090> get<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.570> couple<00:02:54.810> more<00:02:55.019> guys<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:55.890> you'd

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
to get a couple more guys but you'd

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.860 
to get a couple more guys but you'd
either<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.610> reload<00:02:57.000> or<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.630> run

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
either have to reload or you just run

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.449 
either have to reload or you just run
out<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.019> ammo<00:02:58.350> all<00:02:58.560> together<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.280> was

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
out of ammo all together and that was

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.800 
out of ammo all together and that was
the<00:02:59.580> issue<00:02:59.730> with<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.180> thing<00:03:00.420> even<00:03:00.720> in

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
the issue with this thing even in

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.110 
the issue with this thing even in
zombies<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.980> thing<00:03:02.220> was<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:02.790> thing<00:03:02.970> was<00:03:03.090> a

zombies this thing was this thing was a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.690 
zombies this thing was this thing was a
great<00:03:03.420> gun<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.810> get<00:03:04.019> but<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.130> only<00:03:05.489> downfall

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
great gun to get but the only downfall

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.820 
great gun to get but the only downfall
was<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.600> such<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> small<00:03:07.290> ammo<00:03:07.650> capacity

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
was it was such a small ammo capacity

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.830 
was it was such a small ammo capacity
that<00:03:08.340> was<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.700> was<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.850> only<00:03:09.060> problem<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.690> had

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
that was that was the only problem I had

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.570 
that was that was the only problem I had
with<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.110> gun<00:03:10.290> otherwise<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.800> loved<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.459> it

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
with this gun otherwise I loved it it
