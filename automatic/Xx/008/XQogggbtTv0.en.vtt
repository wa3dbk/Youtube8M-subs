but<00:03:59.280> my<00:03:59.760> criticism<00:04:00.300> of<00:04:00.390> this<00:04:00.540> would<00:04:00.750> be

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
but my criticism of this would be

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.820 
but my criticism of this would be
there's<00:04:01.140> not<00:04:01.320> enough<00:04:03.200> matte<00:04:04.200> ones<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.650> there

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
there's not enough matte ones in there

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.910 
there's not enough matte ones in there
so<00:04:05.690> there's<00:04:06.690> only<00:04:06.930> those<00:04:07.080> two<00:04:07.380> but<00:04:07.560> those<00:04:07.740> are

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
so there's only those two but those are

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.500 
so there's only those two but those are
the<00:04:07.980> kind<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.280> only<00:04:08.550> matte<00:04:08.700> colors<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.090> tend<00:04:09.420> to

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
the kind of only matte colors I tend to

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.370 
the kind of only matte colors I tend to
use<00:04:09.570> anyway<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.440> love<00:04:11.160> half-baked<00:04:11.850> and
