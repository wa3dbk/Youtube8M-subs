00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.450 
carbonation can have effects on your
teeth<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.540> stuff<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.410> not<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.980> same<00:01:58.250> as

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
teeth and stuff it's not the same as

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.460 
teeth and stuff it's not the same as
water<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.300> you<00:01:59.360> definitely<00:01:59.750> need<00:02:00.050> to<00:02:00.170> drink

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
water so you definitely need to drink

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.160 
water so you definitely need to drink
your<00:02:00.620> water<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.180> like<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:02.360> said<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.630> drink<00:02:03.020> two

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
your water and like I said I drink two

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.020 
your water and like I said I drink two
or<00:02:03.260> three<00:02:03.410> gallons<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:03.950> day<00:02:03.980> now<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:04.400> I<00:02:04.970> don't

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
or three gallons a day now and I don't

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.910 
or three gallons a day now and I don't
let<00:02:05.540> any<00:02:06.500> sodas<00:02:07.160> or<00:02:08.200> Crystal<00:02:09.200> Light<00:02:09.379> packets

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
let any sodas or Crystal Light packets

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.890 
let any sodas or Crystal Light packets
or<00:02:10.069> anything<00:02:10.220> like<00:02:10.429> that

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
or anything like that

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.259 
or anything like that
make<00:02:11.900> up<00:02:12.140> for<00:02:12.170> what<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.650> water<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.129> but<00:02:13.610> the

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
make up for what the water is but the

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.899 
make up for what the water is but the
two<00:02:14.480> reasons<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.110> water<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:15.980> important

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
two reasons that water is so important

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.170 
two reasons that water is so important
that<00:02:17.269> don't<00:02:17.599> really<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:19.400> big<00:02:19.700> effects<00:02:20.030> on

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
that don't really have big effects on

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.089 
that don't really have big effects on
the<00:02:20.269> adjusted<00:02:20.720> system<00:02:21.140> but<00:02:21.349> the<00:02:21.650> first<00:02:21.860> one

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
the adjusted system but the first one

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.220 
the adjusted system but the first one
does<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.670> second<00:02:23.030> one<00:02:23.150> does<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.989> first

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
does so the second one does the first

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.020 
does so the second one does the first
one<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.769> it's<00:02:25.099> really<00:02:25.459> good<00:02:25.670> for<00:02:25.879> your

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
one is that it's really good for your

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.650 
one is that it's really good for your
immune<00:02:26.269> system<00:02:26.840> your<00:02:27.379> immune<00:02:28.370> system<00:02:28.910> but<00:02:29.180> I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
immune system your immune system but I

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.440 
immune system your immune system but I
have<00:02:30.260> not<00:02:30.440> been<00:02:30.500> sick<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.760> don't<00:02:31.879> even<00:02:32.239> need

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
have not been sick and I don't even need

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.759 
have not been sick and I don't even need
to<00:02:32.510> knock<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:32.930> wood<00:02:33.170> because<00:02:33.470> I'm<00:02:33.650> very

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
to knock on wood because I'm very

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.470 
to knock on wood because I'm very
confident<00:02:34.280> about<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:35.060> drink<00:02:35.269> so

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
confident about it because I drink so

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.860 
confident about it because I drink so
much<00:02:35.599> water<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.579> haven't<00:02:38.390> been<00:02:38.569> sick

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
much water is that I haven't been sick

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.360 
much water is that I haven't been sick
since<00:02:39.110> sixth<00:02:39.410> grade<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.829> sixth<00:02:40.099> grade<00:02:40.340> I

since sixth grade and sixth grade I

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.509 
since sixth grade and sixth grade I
missed<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.760> week<00:02:40.909> because<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:42.220> strep<00:02:43.220> throat

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
wasn't eating and that is because I

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.199 
wasn't eating and that is because I

are addicted to drugs pain pills things

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.800 
are addicted to drugs pain pills things
like<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:24.530> your<00:03:25.400> body<00:03:25.700> produces<00:03:26.090> all<00:03:26.660> these

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
like that your body produces all these

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.199 
like that your body produces all these
different<00:03:27.230> hormones<00:03:27.650> itself<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.579> when<00:03:29.120> you

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
different hormones itself and when you

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.449 
different hormones itself and when you
start<00:03:29.480> supplementing<00:03:30.230> them<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.680> if<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.310> do

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
start supplementing them and if you do

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.479 
start supplementing them and if you do
it<00:03:31.579> for<00:03:31.730> long<00:03:31.880> enough<00:03:32.239> your<00:03:32.480> body<00:03:32.599> starts

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
it for long enough your body starts

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.159 
it for long enough your body starts
basically<00:03:34.489> not<00:03:35.000> producing<00:03:35.569> it<00:03:35.690> because<00:03:36.049> it

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
basically not producing it because it

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.900 
basically not producing it because it
already<00:03:36.349> has<00:03:36.680> enough<00:03:36.980> on<00:03:37.160> its<00:03:37.340> own<00:03:37.489> from<00:03:37.700> what

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
already has enough on its own from what

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.599 
already has enough on its own from what
you're<00:03:38.120> putting<00:03:38.329> in<00:03:38.599> so<00:03:39.139> once<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:39.889> stop<00:03:40.190> your

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
you're putting in so once you stop your

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.789 
you're putting in so once you stop your
body's<00:03:40.910> already<00:03:41.120> stopped<00:03:41.540> producing<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.349> so

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
body's already stopped producing it so

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.309 
body's already stopped producing it so
you<00:03:42.889> realize<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.849> need<00:03:43.880> it<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.510> feel<00:03:45.109> the

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
you realize that you need it to feel the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.440 
you realize that you need it to feel the
same<00:03:45.560> way<00:03:45.739> or<00:03:45.769> feel<00:03:46.130> better<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.639> it's<00:03:47.180> just
