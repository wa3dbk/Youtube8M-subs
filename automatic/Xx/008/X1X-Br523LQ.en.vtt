00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.380
 easy 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.360
 Now I will demonstrate this plan on this 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.909
 snakes so you see in front of me and I 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.280
 two times the truth you turn into it and 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.890
 see I am no longer a dolphin I am already graceful 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.729
 a snake that goes and know well, that is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.329
 crawling in general so here in some more 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.090
 animals have some pluses 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.090
 if you just kill them for example 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.000
 let's kill some people but 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.920
 our need will be on our people 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.740
 subscribers will need to show why 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.630
 we do it and so here's how i see 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 turned into power and she knows how to fly I 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.030
 I learned to fly you at last 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.380
 free i am a bee i am a noble bee 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.890
 which can fly is not only possible 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.479
 turn also why with this mod with 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.399
 With this mod you can fly 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:20.870
 to swim 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:22.019
 now show swim doesn't like dolphins 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.760
 Now 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:29.909
 and still the dolphin is still good so we 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.920
 turn accidentally oh sorry it was 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:40.109
 completely by chance I want to choke 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:43.889
 under the water all I do not know what attacks me 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:46.560
 and I'm a graceful dolphin again like you 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:50.549
 see dolphins swimming speed on 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.200
 much more than the average person so 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.340

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.000

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:15.059

 but it is better to use it not only 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.849
 called mods because you can 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.430
 communicate only in a creeper 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.650
