00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.470
 Hello everyone, welcome to this new one 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.600
 video of the tactical notebook in this 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.160
 almost final position 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.470
 let's say the two players remained 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:48.140
 only with two strong pieces don ector 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.160
 and a few extra pedestrians the move touches to 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.699
 black 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.190
 we see that the black king is enough 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:58.250
 exposed to any attacks in black here 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.420
 however he decides to play woman of one 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.140
 looking for some way to pass 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:08.360
 to the example attack when to threaten 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.840
 chess on these columns that could 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.070
 somehow worried the white king 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.600
 however this maneuver is a bit slow 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.460
 because it requires at least two moves 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.820
 first just made and another one 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.979
 leads to attack in fact hardly 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.619
 from this position the black woman could 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.820
 some worry gave way 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.960
 White 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.570
 ok however after woman of a move 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.670
 it's up to white let's see if you can 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.150
 find the right combination that it 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.150
 takes the lead 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.619
 also pause the video 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.740
 ok then first of all I tell you that 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.950
 this is not a crazy combination 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.320
 although it might seem seen that 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.880
 however the black king is quite exposed 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.750
 in practice, white can make money 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.790
 heavy material material through a 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.150
 combination that uses for tactics 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.970
 called deviation that is in practice al 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.120
 white will be able to divert a piece of the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.860
 black from an important defensive function 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.690
 then managing to then capture the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.730
 piece that defended ok let's see some 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.989
 so how should the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.349
 white but first of all let's try to 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.540
 understand that this is defensive mutations 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.970
 woman's move provoked from the point of 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.640
 view of the black woman in fact before 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.459
 was in by 8 and was somehow 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.680
 defending the last white crossbar 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.519
 can actually exploit this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:56.400
 however, we try to exploit it immediately 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:58.049
 for example with tower and 8 in va a 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.390
 block all these escape routes of the 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:05.790
 black maybe even thinking about playing 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:08.130
 don h 2 practically white does not 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.500
 time because for example here in the can 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.440
 play tower fesse to block 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.510
 any chess that comes from this 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.690
 direction 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:24.359
 on the column but the white must 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.459
 be faster and faster than that 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.209
 there is already in chess and give note 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.489
 check the right move and woman move h2 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.470
 immediately forcing you checkmate they were not 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:39.440
 a little interpose nothing can only move 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.250
 to a single region move at this point 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.060
 actually you can take advantage of the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.850
 weakness leaving the black woman with 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.819
 tower 8 check even here there is a move 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.540
 alone in black stands the tower now 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.540
 let's see some 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.840
 the woman can no longer attack on 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.220
 column h because it would simply be 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.599
 firm little consolation would be possible 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.480
 capture the black tower combination of 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.989
 crazy there are no way to 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.130
 let the woman enter quickly 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:19.049
 to the attack then white can think of 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.090
 then capture the piece of draftsman 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.340
 somehow that is now attached 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.340
 from the white tower, however, it is defended from there 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.349
 there is a way to divert the black king 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.500
 to the edge of the tower a certain one is enough 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:35.110
 another appropriate check is not easy 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.700
 see this because 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.810
 the fourth check from the opposite side 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.340
 chessboard woman two checkmate 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.580
 the only check that the dealer could 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.960
 darling dawn the king attacked and black not 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.780
 can interpose the tower because 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:55.620
 nailed simply comes and will have to 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.340
 move and the desk captures the tower 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.820
 simply with another example the 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.890
 white this point easily wins 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.720
 ok for this combination is everything 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.030
 it should have been enough 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.830
 easy at least I hope to see you at 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.830
 next video bye bye
