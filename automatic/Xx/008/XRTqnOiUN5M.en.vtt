the new BlackBerry z10 both have NFC
built<00:00:24.980> in<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:25.490> they<00:00:26.480> should<00:00:26.689> be<00:00:26.720> able<00:00:27.109> to

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
built in so they should be able to

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.790 
built in so they should be able to
handle<00:00:27.920> information<00:00:28.189> transfer<00:00:29.560> let's<00:00:30.560> find

way<00:01:09.410> around<00:01:09.500> from<00:01:10.040> Nexus<00:01:10.340> 4<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:10.790> Z<00:01:11.030> 10<00:01:11.299> I'm

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
way around from Nexus 4 to Z 10 I'm

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.609 
way around from Nexus 4 to Z 10 I'm
going<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.200> open<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.799> SPN<00:01:13.220> dot-com<00:01:13.790> mobile

website<00:01:15.619> on<00:01:15.860> Nexus<00:01:16.250> 4<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.729> let<00:01:17.659> me<00:01:17.810> transfer

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
website on Nexus 4 and let me transfer

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:29.200 
website on Nexus 4 and let me transfer
the<00:01:19.040> URL<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.869> z10<00:01:21.500> just<00:01:22.430> using<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.240> NFC<00:01:28.210> Satan

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
the URL to z10 just using the NFC Satan

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.819 
the URL to z10 just using the NFC Satan
will<00:01:29.390> ask<00:01:29.600> where<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.200> want<00:01:30.409> to<00:01:30.530> open<00:01:30.590> this

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
will ask where you want to open this

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.679 
will ask where you want to open this
information<00:01:31.460> either<00:01:31.579> in<00:01:31.759> browser<00:01:32.030> or<00:01:32.390> smart

information either in browser or smart

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:40.030 
information either in browser or smart
tags<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.509> second<00:01:38.869> test<00:01:39.079> is<00:01:39.350> also

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
tags so the second test is also

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.319 
tags so the second test is also
successful<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:42.250> z10<00:01:43.250> was<00:01:43.520> able<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.000> open<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.300 
same page the Nexus 4 has opened so now
let's<00:01:49.579> try<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:50.210> picture<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:51.140> have<00:01:51.740> open<00:01:52.250> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
let's try a picture I have open a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:02.469 
let's try a picture I have open a
picture<00:01:52.610> on<00:01:52.850> Nexus<00:01:53.780> 4<00:01:54.020> Nexus<00:02:00.430> 4<00:02:01.430> has<00:02:01.670> just

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
picture on Nexus 4 Nexus 4 has just

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.470 

now<00:02:28.950> let's<00:02:29.250> try<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> other<00:02:29.700> way<00:02:30.000> around<00:02:30.120> I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
now let's try the other way around I

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.080 
now let's try the other way around I
have<00:02:30.660> opened<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.020> picture<00:02:31.350> on<00:02:31.700> z10<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.970> I'm

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
have opened a picture on z10 and I'm

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:41.090 
have opened a picture on z10 and I'm
going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.360> transfer<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.960> Nexus<00:02:34.380> 4<00:02:34.590> Nexus<00:02:40.100> 4

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
going to transfer it to Nexus 4 Nexus 4

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.370 
going to transfer it to Nexus 4 Nexus 4
has<00:02:41.400> received<00:02:42.000> another<00:02:42.300> notification<00:02:43.110> that

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.580 
has received another notification that
an<00:02:43.650> incoming<00:02:44.340> beam<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:45.000> ready<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:46.050> accepted

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
an incoming beam is ready to be accepted

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.640 
an incoming beam is ready to be accepted
just<00:02:46.830> accept<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.550> one<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:49.230> file<00:02:49.470> will

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
just accept this one and the file will

00:02:49.650 --> 00:03:08.449 
just accept this one and the file will
start<00:02:50.310> transfer

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.470 

so<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.239> last<00:03:09.420> test<00:03:09.750> was<00:03:10.019> also<00:03:10.500> successful<00:03:11.040> and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
so the last test was also successful and

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.619 
so the last test was also successful and
we<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:13.319> surely<00:03:13.950> say<00:03:14.250> now<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:14.489> NFC<00:03:15.239> works

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
we can surely say now that NFC works

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.020 
we can surely say now that NFC works
both<00:03:16.439> on<00:03:16.709> Nexus<00:03:17.219> 4<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:18.650> Blackberry<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:20.030> hope
