00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
up that one-inch as you can see the 3/8

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.650 
up that one-inch as you can see the 3/8
nipple<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:36.740> just<00:05:36.770> below<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.400> fence<00:05:37.640> piece<00:05:37.910> the

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
nipple is just below the fence piece the

nipple is just below the fence piece the
fit<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.050> gate<00:05:39.470> holder<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:39.980> that<00:05:40.040> will<00:05:40.880> that

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
fit the gate holder and that will that

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.970 
fit the gate holder and that will that
3/8<00:05:41.510> piece<00:05:41.780> of<00:05:41.930> pipe<00:05:42.080> goes<00:05:42.350> up<00:05:42.560> inside<00:05:42.920> that

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
3/8 piece of pipe goes up inside that

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.660 
3/8 piece of pipe goes up inside that
and<00:05:43.610> that's<00:05:44.390> what<00:05:44.540> starts<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:44.960> raise<00:05:45.140> it<00:05:45.380> and

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
and that's what starts to raise it and

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.450 
and that's what starts to raise it and
that's<00:05:46.670> what<00:05:46.820> we'll<00:05:47.000> start<00:05:47.240> doing<00:05:47.360> next<00:05:48.460> okay

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
I'll show you how to put the pins in as

00:06:02.600 --> 00:07:16.500 
I'll show you how to put the pins in as
we<00:06:02.780> go<00:06:02.960> up

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.510

okay<00:07:17.760> as<00:07:18.760> you<00:07:18.940> can<00:07:19.000> see<00:07:19.120> I<00:07:19.540> turned<00:07:19.720> it<00:07:20.580> you

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
okay as you can see I turned it you

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.280 
okay as you can see I turned it you
won't<00:07:21.700> be<00:07:21.880> able<00:07:22.000> to<00:07:22.180> do<00:07:22.330> that<00:07:22.510> with<00:07:22.750> a<00:07:22.780> lot<00:07:23.170> of

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 
won't be able to do that with a lot of

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.050 
won't be able to do that with a lot of
weight<00:07:23.470> on<00:07:23.500> there<00:07:23.860> but<00:07:24.400> I<00:07:24.460> did<00:07:24.640> turn<00:07:24.820> it<00:07:24.970> so

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.060 
weight on there but I did turn it so

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.460 
weight on there but I did turn it so
that<00:07:25.090> way<00:07:25.300> the<00:07:25.450> holes<00:07:25.660> are<00:07:25.870> facing<00:07:26.020> an<00:07:26.320> area

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:26.470 
that way the holes are facing an area

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.170 
that way the holes are facing an area
where<00:07:26.590> I<00:07:26.620> can<00:07:26.800> easily<00:07:26.950> put<00:07:27.310> the<00:07:27.400> bolts<00:07:27.670> in

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.020

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.030 
there we go got a jacked up as far as

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.420 
there we go got a jacked up as far as
it'll<00:07:34.180> go<00:07:34.240> and<00:07:34.390> you<00:07:34.480> can<00:07:34.600> see<00:07:34.750> the<00:07:34.870> two<00:07:35.050> pins

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
it'll go and you can see the two pins

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.610 
it'll go and you can see the two pins
two<00:07:36.430> holes<00:07:36.640> for<00:07:36.760> the<00:07:36.910> Pens

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 
two holes for the Pens

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.740 
two holes for the Pens
you<00:07:38.620> want<00:07:38.890> to<00:07:39.070> install<00:07:39.490> the<00:07:39.730> pin<00:07:40.030> on<00:07:40.300> the

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.750 
you want to install the pin on the

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.850 
you want to install the pin on the
bottom<00:07:40.960> hole<00:07:41.760> now<00:07:42.760> what<00:07:43.210> we<00:07:43.330> will<00:07:43.510> do<00:07:43.690> is<00:07:44.590> we
