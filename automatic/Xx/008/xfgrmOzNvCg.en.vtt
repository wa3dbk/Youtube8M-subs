00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.179
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.960
 found for a new video that 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.750
 would be a video 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.500
 first impressions for this little 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.900
 product from where co so c 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.650
 long-wearing lipstick that's like 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.410
 they are called unlimited red pen to 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.849
 lips they are supposed to hold eight hours 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.650
 so do not be afraid for the color 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.580
 so here it is an orange is the 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.580
 number 05 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.680
 so here they are finally supposed to hold 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.670
 eight o'clock so and I thought I saw 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.130
 I have a lot of things to do 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.360
 today 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:51.080
 that it was an opportunity to test them 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.910
 really test them in fact so 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.170
 so here I am not at all worried 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.690
 because I'm going to do sports 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.510
 so that's just put some mascara 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.980
 as long as you're too scared and so 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.270
 I 'm going to call it right away 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.600
 I have nothing at all sure but the Roma for 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.600
 Nothing 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.180
 so I think the color is great 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.180
 friendly 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.710
 the color and hop it is perennial in 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.710
 it is very pleasant to apply 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.370
 it is very very creamy it is a 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.430
 problem according to the ars that gives me 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.069
 the idea super nice 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.489
 so that's why I'll see you add 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:32.269
 on it I'm going to do some sports and 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.310
 all that and I think I'll film 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.319
 just after my shower or something 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:46.310
 like that to see a little evolution and 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:47.329
 here it begins to dry brief no I 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.410
 find you just now I you 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.620
 write how it is 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.569
 evolved and here you are 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.370
 good and in this case you are here for the 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.129
 second part of my little adventure 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.489
 with my lipstick which co so 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.750
 as you see now it's 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.519
 just a fake thing or red to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.090
 lips I just did an hour of 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.140
 sport 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.270
 I just went to the shower 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.200
 he did not move I have not called the 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.920
 done that's what's left of what 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.200
 I applied before you 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.390
 it's just gnons does I already pretend 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.220
 to have held like that I find that 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.209
 hallucinating in the shower especially because 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.180
 that I take showers at 40 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.490
 degrees so at goal level and all this 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.780
 do what and I find it huge that 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.819
 like that 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.610
 so already just to tell you a little 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.350
 at the level sensations and all that kind 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.030
 two minutes after I apply them 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:49.250
 and I felt that he was starting to dry 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.690
 actually on my lips but actually I 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.010
 I felt them dry but in fact there 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.880
 I do not feel like I have anything 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.680
 it's on the lips 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.630
 it's like I have my naked lips 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.040
 without lip balm or anything then 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.530
 maybe at the end before the end of the 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.560
 day it will attract a little I do not know 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:08.989
 I'll tell you that but for now 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.730
 go comfort level and all that is finally 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.820
 for now I'm really happy to 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.489
 this product because suddenly that's it 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.470
 did two hours there pretty much that I 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.230
 that I loved him knowing that here I am doing 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.540
 of sport all that so it's more 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.740
 not bad and I wanted to show you my 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.740
 hand and virgin 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.840
 it's a transfer was not too good 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.000
 of that so here for the moment I do not 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.490
 I 'm excited I can not wait to see how he 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.229
 will behave during their steps and 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.669
 all that I do not think I'm going 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.350
 refilmer just after my lunch 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.409
 I think the genre would film after 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.899
 my snack or something like that 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:54.069
 here I meet you in the day 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:59.389
 I'm finally back on stage day it's 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:01.129
 17:38 so that's what's left of my 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.550
 lipstick at this hour 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:07.669
 I do not know if you see from here but in 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.309
 does it barely remain a little bit a 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.229
 trace and it's on the upper lip 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:14.119
 and a little more a low but it's very 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.929
 disparate's not at all the pretty 

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:19.550
 it's really weird like 

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:21.669
 in common it remains in the end on my 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.669
 lips 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.459
 so he will not have held at all eight 

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:27.649
 hours since I had put it to 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:29.490
 9:30 this morning he was supposed to hold 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:32.740
 perfectly 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:38.670
 until 5:30 pm which was not the case 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.670
 therefore, until 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.780
 in fact I think it's after my 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:52.129
 to taste who really knows who it is 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.460
 really badly behaved we're going to say because 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.870
 that even after the meal it was still going 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.340
 even once I brushed them 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.750
 teeth after eating all that was going pretty 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.979
 close so 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.659
 so that's comfort level it's not 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.099
 too badly frankly for a red to 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.349
 lips is really by kim dries them 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.090
 lips and limits that it's me 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.110
 contract a little dry lips but 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.300
 if you know what I mean 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:20.060
 and in the end not at all we feel that 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.710
 we do not have hydrated lips but 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.830
 it's nice that they're dry actually 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.260
 that's just it 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.210
 so frankly I'm pretty 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.240
 happy because I tell myself that if I 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.289
 had handed over after the meal there he would 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.169
 perfect so 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:40.069
 so here it is frankly a very good 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:43.110
 product I think so 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:44.580
 so here I really invite you to go 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.960
 test they make glosses also in 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.059
 this range that are supposed to be more 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.520
 got too so I think I 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:52.559
 will test that too and that suddenly I 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.210
 am going to buy me back a few 

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:57.569
 themes tomorrow we spend less than 6000 months 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.909
 according to I think but this summer I think 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:03.300
 that if they are still I do not know 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:05.939
 it's a limited edition or not so I 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.770
 think this summer I would buy so 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:09.149
 that's pretty satisfying 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.270
 it was sure they would not hold 

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:15.209
 fight anyway but it's a good 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.619
 lipstick lanctot so that's it 

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:17.879
 listen and I hope the video has you 

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:19.649
 longer it changes a little 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:21.389
 do not hesitate to tell me what you 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:22.349
 have thought what I need to improve 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.180
 on two things 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:27.499
 well no that's the result of very very 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.499
 big kisses I tell you see you soon bye
