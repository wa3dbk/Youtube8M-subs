so the first page is this guy

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.080 
so the first page is this guy
galaxy-eyes<00:01:46.350> photon<00:01:46.439> dragon<00:01:46.829> made<00:01:47.670> homie<00:01:47.970> of

galaxy-eyes photon dragon made homie of
kaitou<00:01:48.720> us<00:01:49.700> pretty<00:01:50.700> much<00:01:50.759> every<00:01:51.060> rarity

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
kaitou us pretty much every rarity

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.270 
kaitou us pretty much every rarity
possible<00:01:52.040> there's<00:01:53.040> miss<00:01:53.340> Primm<00:01:53.610> right<00:01:53.790> there

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
possible there's miss Primm right there

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.569 
possible there's miss Primm right there
some<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.119> ghosts<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.549> is

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
some of that and the ghosts so this is

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.179 
some of that and the ghosts so this is
the<00:01:59.640> first<00:01:59.850> page<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.570> numbers<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.920> it

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the first page not numbers but it

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.690 
the first page not numbers but it
represents<00:02:03.180> being<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.719> number<00:02:03.869> hunter<00:02:04.700> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
represents being a number hunter so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.059 
represents being a number hunter so
let's<00:02:06.000> call<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> numbers<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> way<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
let's call the numbers so the way it

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.460 
let's call the numbers so the way it
works<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.610> every<00:02:09.179> single<00:02:09.420> slot<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:10.020> where

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
works is that every single slot is where

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.410 
works is that every single slot is where
the<00:02:10.560> number<00:02:10.830> which<00:02:11.009> should<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.150> here<00:02:12.390> is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the number which should be so here is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.110 
the number which should be so here is
one

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120
