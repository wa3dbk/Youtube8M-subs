now<00:00:17.010> go<00:00:17.220> ahead<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.640> start<00:00:18.090> working<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.900> neck

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
now go ahead and start working the neck

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.460 
now go ahead and start working the neck
the<00:00:20.279> head<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.939> brain<00:00:21.119> I'll<00:00:21.869> start<00:00:22.170> here<00:00:22.320> with

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the head the brain I'll start here with

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:33.370 
the head the brain I'll start here with
the<00:00:22.590> thumb<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.580> use<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.769> rule<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.890> three

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.810 

three<00:00:34.380> times<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:35.250> usually<00:00:35.430> get<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
three times you usually get the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.250 
three times you usually get the
stimulation<00:00:36.390> even<00:00:36.840> when<00:00:37.020> you're<00:00:37.140> doing

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
stimulation even when you're doing

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.350 
stimulation even when you're doing
massage<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> lot<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.160> times<00:00:38.370> you'll<00:00:38.579> hear<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
massage a lot of times you'll hear the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.369 
massage a lot of times you'll hear the
rule<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.690> three<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.960> even<00:00:42.960> through<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
rule of three and even through the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:01:00.670 
rule of three and even through the
fingers<00:00:43.910> we<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.030> neck<00:00:46.789> head<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:49.340> brain

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.240 

I'll<00:01:01.680> start<00:01:01.980> off<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.219> compression<00:01:04.250> and

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
I'll start off with compression and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.620 
I'll start off with compression and
usually<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> compress<00:01:08.909> especially<00:01:09.509> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
usually when I compress especially in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.389 
usually when I compress especially in
the<00:01:09.720> limbs<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:11.030> will<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.990> directly<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
the limbs I will go directly into the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.719 
the limbs I will go directly into the
tissue<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.030> I'll<00:01:15.570> also<00:01:16.070> go<00:01:17.070> towards<00:01:17.550> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
tissue and I'll also go towards the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.850 
tissue and I'll also go towards the
heart

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.600 

and<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.350> detail-oriented<00:01:26.340> if

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and you can get very detail-oriented if

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.430 
and you can get very detail-oriented if
you<00:01:26.729> want<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:29.720> I'll<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:31.050> break<00:01:31.289> it<00:01:31.410> down

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
you want to I'll just break it down

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.400 
you want to I'll just break it down
basically<00:01:32.280> into<00:01:33.289> a<00:01:34.289> extensor<00:01:35.130> carpi<00:01:36.410> extensor

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
basically into a extensor carpi extensor

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.669 
basically into a extensor carpi extensor
digitorum<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.909> those<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.390> again<00:01:39.780> lie<00:01:40.110> mainly

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
digitorum and those all again lie mainly

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.370 
digitorum and those all again lie mainly
in<00:01:40.890> between<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> radius<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.539> ulna<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.840 

just<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.619> palpate<00:01:46.920> through<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.670> when

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
just as you palpate through here when

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.990 
just as you palpate through here when
you<00:01:47.940> palpate<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.450> belly<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.840> muscle<00:01:50.000> go

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you palpate the belly the muscle go

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
you palpate the belly the muscle go
ahead<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.569> put<00:01:51.810> some<00:01:51.840> thumb<00:01:52.259> pressure<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
ahead and put some thumb pressure in and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.389 
ahead and put some thumb pressure in and
lean<00:01:53.750> after<00:01:54.750> you've<00:01:54.840> done<00:01:55.050> done<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> general

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
lean after you've done done the general

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.540 
lean after you've done done the general
compression<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.530> ahead<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.890> seek

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
compression and then go ahead and seek

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.589 
compression and then go ahead and seek
out<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.910> individual<00:02:00.569> musculature<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:02.599> work

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
out the individual musculature and work

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:10.309 
out the individual musculature and work
on<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:08.599> depending<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> client<00:02:10.200> that

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
on that depending on the client that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.760 
on that depending on the client that
you're<00:02:10.500> working<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.660> can<00:02:12.660> roll<00:02:13.319> back<00:02:13.560> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you're working on I can roll back and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
you're working on I can roll back and
forth<00:02:13.860> if<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.879> want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> use<00:02:15.270> some<00:02:15.480> strength

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
forth if I want to use some strength

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.650 
forth if I want to use some strength
maneuvers<00:02:16.470> into<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.730> hand<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.300> then

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
maneuvers into that hand and then

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
maneuvers into that hand and then
ultimately<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.379> can<00:02:19.650> always<00:02:19.890> stand<00:02:20.160> up<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
ultimately I can always stand up and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.479 
ultimately I can always stand up and
work<00:02:21.270> down<00:02:21.569> into<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> flexors<00:02:22.590> into<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
work down into the flexors into the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.199 
work down into the flexors into the
extensors<00:02:24.349> so<00:02:25.349> what<00:02:26.190> I'm<00:02:26.310> going<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.640> do<00:02:26.940> is

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
extensors so what I'm going to do is

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.110 
extensors so what I'm going to do is
just<00:02:28.050> start<00:02:28.290> by<00:02:29.420> warming<00:02:30.420> things<00:02:30.690> up<00:02:30.900> I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
just start by warming things up I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.270 
just start by warming things up I
usually<00:02:33.120> start<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.170> with<00:02:34.290> compression

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.830 

now<00:02:40.280> I'm<00:02:40.400> compressing<00:02:41.000> into<00:02:41.480> each<00:02:42.470> hand<00:02:43.840> you

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
now I'm compressing into each hand you

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.180 
now I'm compressing into each hand you
can<00:02:45.050> also<00:02:45.290> compress<00:02:47.380> for<00:02:48.380> more<00:02:48.560> information

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190
