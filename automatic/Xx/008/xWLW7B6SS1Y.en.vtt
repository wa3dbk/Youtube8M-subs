of<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.420> benefits<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:18.020> using<00:02:18.260> gas<00:02:19.000> over

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
of the benefits of using gas over

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.110 
of the benefits of using gas over
charcoal<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.170> can<00:02:21.470> control<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.700> heat

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
charcoal is you can control the heat

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.880 
charcoal is you can control the heat
that<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.480> get<00:02:23.690> out<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.080> burner<00:02:24.319> by<00:02:24.830> the

and<00:02:31.790> low<00:02:31.880> zones<00:02:32.420> here<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.989> just<00:02:33.200> do<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.470> with

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
and low zones here you just do it with

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.880 
and low zones here you just do it with
your<00:02:33.860> gas<00:02:34.420> valve<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.870> get<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.770> where

three minutes my technique is I like to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.210 
three minutes my technique is I like to
turn<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.840> down<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.380> star<00:02:57.709> or<00:02:57.739> lower

turn it down to the star or lower

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.990 
turn it down to the star or lower
position<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.150> then<00:02:59.569> close<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.170> lid<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.769> then

position and then close the lid and then
just<00:03:02.000> finish<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.420> off<00:03:02.690> turning<00:03:03.080> every<00:03:03.440> two<00:03:03.620> to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
just finish it off turning every two to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.590 
just finish it off turning every two to
three<00:03:03.799> minutes<00:03:04.340> depending<00:03:04.730> on<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.910> cut<00:03:05.569> of

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
so you can have some food going here so

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.319 
so you can have some food going here so
you<00:03:51.109> started<00:03:51.799> with<00:03:52.310> some<00:03:52.489> vegetables<00:03:53.090> just

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
you started with some vegetables just

you started with some vegetables just
searing<00:03:53.660> them<00:03:53.840> in<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.170> can<00:03:54.320> put<00:03:54.560> them<00:03:54.650> up<00:03:54.799> on

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
searing them in you can put them up on

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.240 
searing them in you can put them up on
to<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.340> warming<00:03:55.760> rack<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.950> leave<00:03:57.950> them<00:03:58.130> up

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
you take it all off at the same time and

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.840 
you take it all off at the same time and
eat<00:04:05.390> at<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.690> same<00:04:05.900> time<00:04:06.350> with<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.799> when<00:04:07.760> the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
grinding and polishing that we do we're

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.710 
grinding and polishing that we do we're
actually<00:04:15.560> join<00:04:16.100> two<00:04:16.729> pieces<00:04:16.760> of<00:04:17.209> metal

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
actually join two pieces of metal

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.349 
actually join two pieces of metal
together<00:04:18.070> but<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:19.250> can't<00:04:19.489> tell<00:04:19.820> because<00:04:20.120> of

together but you can't tell because of
how<00:04:20.630> we've<00:04:20.870> done<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.169> right<00:04:21.709> here<00:04:22.070> would<00:04:22.250> be<00:04:22.280> a

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
how we've done it right here would be a

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.600 
how we've done it right here would be a
seam<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:23.720> we're<00:04:24.500> two<00:04:24.680> pieces<00:04:25.130> went<00:04:25.400> together

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
seam that we're two pieces went together

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
seam that we're two pieces went together
but<00:04:26.419> we

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
but we

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.020 
but we
welded<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.200> which<00:04:27.440> has<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.650> raised<00:04:28.070> portion<00:04:28.910> of

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
welded it which has a raised portion of

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.330 
welded it which has a raised portion of
the<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.420> weld<00:04:29.660> material<00:04:29.870> then<00:04:30.800> we've<00:04:30.950> ground

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
the the weld material then we've ground

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.730 
the the weld material then we've ground
it<00:04:31.550> down<00:04:31.790> flush<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.690> then<00:04:32.810> we've<00:04:32.990> grained<00:04:33.500> it

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
it down flush and then we've grained it

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.860 
it down flush and then we've grained it
with<00:04:33.920> our<00:04:34.130> polishing<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.570> matches

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
with our polishing so that it matches

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.410 
with our polishing so that it matches
the<00:04:36.380> rest<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.920> grill<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.610> here<00:04:38.210> in<00:04:38.330> the

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
the rest of the grill in here in the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.600 
the rest of the grill in here in the
hood<00:04:38.570> same<00:04:39.020> thing<00:04:39.320> to<00:04:39.620> pieces<00:04:39.830> join<00:04:40.340> together

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.420 
where we've welded ground and polished
it<00:04:43.490> so<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.360> looks<00:04:44.540> very<00:04:44.690> natural<00:04:45.310> that<00:04:46.310> it

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
it so that it looks very natural that it

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.030 
it so that it looks very natural that it
was<00:04:46.550> meant<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:46.910> be<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:47.360> way<00:04:47.770> one<00:04:48.770> could<00:04:48.950> even

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
was meant to be that way one could even

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.250 
was meant to be that way one could even
say<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.490> looks<00:04:50.090> like<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.360> came<00:04:50.510> from<00:04:50.570> one<00:04:51.050> piece

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
say it looks like it came from one piece

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.760 
say it looks like it came from one piece
of<00:04:51.530> steel<00:04:51.850> it<00:04:52.850> has<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.030> drip<00:04:53.780> tray<00:04:53.810> for
