bottle it's either there or it's not and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.670 
bottle it's either there or it's not and
you<00:01:09.820> can't<00:01:10.030> really<00:01:10.300> manufacture<00:01:11.170> it<00:01:11.320> what's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
you can't really manufacture it what's

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.440 
you can't really manufacture it what's
going<00:01:11.830> on<00:01:11.920> with<00:01:12.040> your<00:01:12.190> character<00:01:12.700> because<00:01:13.330> you
