of<00:00:31.939> mainstream<00:00:32.599> products<00:00:33.200> I'm<00:00:33.350> inclined<00:00:33.710> to

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
of mainstream products I'm inclined to

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.920 
of mainstream products I'm inclined to
agree<00:00:33.950> I<00:00:34.309> mean<00:00:34.640> they're<00:00:35.270> cool<00:00:35.480> from<00:00:35.660> a<00:00:35.720> tech

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.690 
agree I mean they're cool from a tech
standpoint<00:00:36.470> but<00:00:36.649> I<00:00:36.710> can't<00:00:37.070> see<00:00:37.370> that<00:00:37.550> many

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
standpoint but I can't see that many

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.250 
standpoint but I can't see that many
people<00:00:38.090> opting<00:00:38.480> to<00:00:38.510> wear<00:00:38.810> those<00:00:38.990> things

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
people opting to wear those things

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.320 
people opting to wear those things
around<00:00:39.530> every<00:00:40.190> day<00:00:40.340> as<00:00:40.580> far<00:00:40.790> as<00:00:40.820> he<00:00:40.910> i<00:00:40.940> watch

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
his concern he didn't say too much but

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.800 
his concern he didn't say too much but
he<00:00:43.280> did<00:00:43.430> say<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:43.640> Apple<00:00:44.060> was<00:00:44.090> interested<00:00:44.720> in

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
he did say that Apple was interested in

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.110 
he did say that Apple was interested in
wearable<00:00:45.200> technology<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:46.010> is<00:00:46.700> definitely

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
wearable technology it is definitely

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.090 
wearable technology it is definitely
where<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.810> market<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:48.260> going<00:00:48.620> Tim<00:00:48.860> Cook

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
where the market is going Tim Cook

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.640 
where the market is going Tim Cook
talked<00:00:49.370> about<00:00:49.580> how<00:00:49.700> he<00:00:49.730> wears<00:00:50.240> a<00:00:50.510> Nike<00:00:51.320> Fuel

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.560 
talked about how he wears a Nike Fuel
band<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.310> that<00:00:52.430> he<00:00:52.700> thinks<00:00:53.060> that<00:00:53.120> wearable

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
band and that he thinks that wearable

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.020 
band and that he thinks that wearable
technology<00:00:54.260> is<00:00:54.320> very<00:00:54.650> very<00:00:54.980> interesting<00:00:55.820> and

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
technology is very very interesting and

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.300 
technology is very very interesting and
he<00:00:56.960> said<00:00:57.200> something<00:00:57.410> about<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.800> wrist<00:00:58.040> being

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
he said something about the wrist being

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.790 
he said something about the wrist being
more<00:00:58.520> natural<00:00:59.000> than<00:00:59.120> glasses<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.050> it

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
more natural than glasses so it

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.350 
more natural than glasses so it
definitely<00:01:01.010> seems<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:01.460> wearable<00:01:01.880> tech<00:01:02.210> is

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
definitely seems like wearable tech is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.869 
definitely seems like wearable tech is
on<00:01:02.570> Apple's<00:01:03.170> radar<00:01:03.650> as<00:01:03.860> far<00:01:04.070> as<00:01:04.159> iPhones<00:01:04.670> with

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
on Apple's radar as far as iPhones with

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.999 
on Apple's radar as far as iPhones with
bigger<00:01:05.119> screens<00:01:05.509> or<00:01:05.720> a<00:01:05.750> budget<00:01:06.409> iPhone<00:01:06.829> are

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
bigger screens or a budget iPhone are

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.770 
bigger screens or a budget iPhone are
concerned<00:01:07.400> it's<00:01:07.640> basically<00:01:08.119> everything<00:01:08.659> we

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
concerned it's basically everything we

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.590 
concerned it's basically everything we
already<00:01:09.049> know<00:01:09.310> as<00:01:10.310> far<00:01:10.579> as<00:01:10.700> big<00:01:10.909> screens<00:01:11.299> go

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
already know as far as big screens go

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.690 
already know as far as big screens go
Tim<00:01:11.869> Cook<00:01:12.109> basically<00:01:12.619> said<00:01:12.890> some<00:01:13.189> people<00:01:13.369> like

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
Tim Cook basically said some people like

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.099 
Tim Cook basically said some people like
big<00:01:13.939> screens<00:01:14.329> but<00:01:14.539> you<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.749> to<00:01:14.869> look<00:01:14.960> at<00:01:15.079> the

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
big screens but you have to look at the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:16.899 
big screens but you have to look at the
bigger<00:01:15.319> picture<00:01:15.649> where<00:01:16.039> you<00:01:16.490> know<00:01:16.609> color

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
bigger picture where you know color

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.669 
bigger picture where you know color
quality<00:01:17.210> battery<00:01:17.840> life<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:18.259> sort<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.619> thing

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
quality battery life that sort of thing

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.200 
quality battery life that sort of thing
and<00:01:19.039> taking<00:01:19.700> everything<00:01:19.909> into<00:01:20.149> consideration

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
and taking everything into consideration

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.649 
and taking everything into consideration
Tim<00:01:21.109> Cook<00:01:21.380> thinks<00:01:21.829> that<00:01:22.100> right<00:01:22.819> now<00:01:22.999> Apple's

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
Tim Cook thinks that right now Apple's

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.389 
Tim Cook thinks that right now Apple's
foreign<00:01:24.200> shredded<00:01:24.560> display<00:01:24.859> is<00:01:25.069> the<00:01:25.100> best

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
foreign shredded display is the best

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.489 
foreign shredded display is the best
screen<00:01:25.579> on<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.819> market<00:01:26.240> he<00:01:26.869> says<00:01:27.109> you<00:01:27.229> know<00:01:27.259> in

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
screen on the market he says you know in

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:28.840 
screen on the market he says you know in
a<00:01:27.560> perfect<00:01:27.590> world<00:01:28.069> where<00:01:28.310> there<00:01:28.490> were<00:01:28.639> no

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
a perfect world where there were no

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.029 
a perfect world where there were no
sacrifices<00:01:29.479> for<00:01:29.840> bigger<00:01:30.109> screens<00:01:30.499> maybe<00:01:30.920> it

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
sacrifices for bigger screens maybe it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.469 
sacrifices for bigger screens maybe it
would<00:01:31.130> be<00:01:31.249> a<00:01:31.280> different<00:01:31.369> story<00:01:31.670> but<00:01:32.060> currently

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
would be a different story but currently

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.510 
would be a different story but currently
it's<00:01:32.689> not<00:01:32.899> budget<00:01:33.380> iPhones<00:01:33.770> Apple<00:01:34.280> hasn't

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
it's not budget iPhones Apple hasn't

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.149 
it's not budget iPhones Apple hasn't
made<00:01:34.850> one<00:01:34.880> yet<00:01:35.299> i<00:01:35.509> takes<00:01:36.139> a<00:01:36.289> lot<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.799> make<00:01:36.950> sure

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
made one yet i takes a lot to make sure

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.410 
made one yet i takes a lot to make sure
