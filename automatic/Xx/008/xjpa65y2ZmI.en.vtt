Canelo Alvarez he's very hard to have to
say<00:03:46.160> obviously<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:46.700> weight<00:03:46.850> division<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.450> it

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
say obviously the weight division is it

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.830 
say obviously the weight division is it
always<00:03:48.139> is<00:03:48.769> massive<00:03:49.250> itself<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:49.819> let's<00:03:50.510> say

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
always is massive itself but let's say

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.780 
always is massive itself but let's say
at<00:03:50.959> welterweight<00:03:51.290> if<00:03:51.590> he<00:03:51.709> came<00:03:51.829> in<00:03:52.010> at<00:03:52.100> 147<00:03:52.730> you

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
at welterweight if he came in at 147 you

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.420 
at welterweight if he came in at 147 you
came<00:03:52.940> out<00:03:53.030> 147<00:03:53.690> well<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:53.959> obviously<00:03:54.829> like<00:03:55.220> to

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
came out 147 well I obviously like to

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.550 
came out 147 well I obviously like to
think<00:03:55.639> I'd<00:03:55.819> you<00:03:56.329> know<00:03:56.359> I'd<00:03:56.540> beat<00:03:57.139> him<00:03:57.350> you<00:03:57.470> know

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
when you think of the caliber of

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.410 
when you think of the caliber of
opponents<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.180> I've<00:03:59.620> watched<00:04:00.620> them<00:04:00.859> for

someone and
-<00:04:03.310> up<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.300> now<00:04:04.480> it's<00:04:04.870> been<00:04:04.930> almost<00:04:05.350> saying<00:04:05.650> that

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
- up to now it's been almost saying that

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.290 
- up to now it's been almost saying that
opting<00:04:06.130> out<00:04:06.250> without<00:04:06.430> reservoir

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300
