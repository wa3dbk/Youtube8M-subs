00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
possible here to a six point eight nine

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.330 
possible here to a six point eight nine
that's<00:03:30.500> pretty<00:03:30.980> good<00:03:31.220> for<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.489> first<00:03:31.670> attempt<00:03:32.120> I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
that's pretty good for a first attempt I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.220 
that's pretty good for a first attempt I
will<00:03:34.340> do<00:03:34.489> one<00:03:34.910> more<00:03:34.940> see<00:03:35.510> if<00:03:35.569> I<00:03:35.660> can<00:03:35.840> better<00:03:36.049> it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
will do one more see if I can better it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.349 
will do one more see if I can better it
or<00:03:36.319> not<00:03:39.790> nearly<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.530> yep<00:03:42.560> javi<00:03:42.889> is<00:03:43.040> sick<00:03:43.430> rocket

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
don't know what's going on but I will

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.870 
don't know what's going on but I will
make<00:04:41.540> sure<00:04:41.810> we<00:04:41.840> will<00:04:42.050> win<00:04:44.140> mm1<00:04:45.880> assassin

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
make sure we will win mm1 assassin

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:57.120 
make sure we will win mm1 assassin
second<00:04:50.590> come<00:04:51.590> on<00:04:51.740> two<00:04:51.920> eight<00:04:52.100> six<00:04:52.610> foot<00:04:52.880> five

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:04.540 

so<00:04:58.130> I<00:04:58.160> guess<00:04:58.640> six<00:04:59.510> turn<00:04:59.870> into<00:05:00.200> that<00:05:00.320> corner<00:05:03.550> hit

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
so I guess six turn into that corner hit

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:14.530 
so I guess six turn into that corner hit
both<00:05:04.790> curbs<00:05:07.210> mister<00:05:08.210> them<00:05:11.440> is<00:05:12.440> half<00:05:12.860> ten<00:05:13.540> then

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
both curbs mister them is half ten then

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:29.400 
both curbs mister them is half ten then
sweet<00:05:15.440> trick<00:05:17.710> 370<00:05:22.419> that<00:05:23.419> was<00:05:23.540> good<00:05:23.750> enough

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
oh six point eight nine you see what a

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:11.140 
oh six point eight nine you see what a
note<00:06:03.230> at<00:06:03.350> that<00:06:03.500> time

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.730 

so<00:06:12.150> I'm<00:06:12.300> going<00:06:12.390> to<00:06:12.480> be<00:06:12.570> using<00:06:12.990> all<00:06:13.260> my<00:06:13.530> boost<00:06:15.740> it

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
so I'm going to be using all my boost it

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.600 
so I'm going to be using all my boost it
that<00:06:17.220> was<00:06:17.460> good

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.460 

now<00:06:20.610> I'm<00:06:20.760> just<00:06:20.910> going<00:06:21.060> to<00:06:21.090> tap<00:06:21.630> the<00:06:21.810> base<00:06:21.960> of<00:06:22.290> it

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
now I'm just going to tap the base of it

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.040 
now I'm just going to tap the base of it
on<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:22.830> straight<00:06:23.210> just<00:06:24.210> get<00:06:24.450> more<00:06:24.570> bit<00:06:24.900> more

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
on the straight just get more bit more

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.530 
on the straight just get more bit more
speed<00:06:25.410> so<00:06:26.070> you<00:06:26.160> get<00:06:26.370> a<00:06:26.400> procedure<00:06:27.030> than<00:06:27.420> this

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
speed so you get a procedure than this

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.630 
speed so you get a procedure than this
with<00:06:27.750> a<00:06:27.780> little<00:06:27.990> speed<00:06:31.070> did<00:06:32.070> mess<00:06:32.250> that<00:06:32.430> up<00:06:32.460> a

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
with a little speed did mess that up a

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.510 
with a little speed did mess that up a
bit<00:06:33.260> you<00:06:34.260> can<00:06:34.290> get<00:06:34.530> a<00:06:34.590> one-minute<00:06:35.130> something

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
bit you can get a one-minute something

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:47.600 
bit you can get a one-minute something
that's<00:06:35.700> why<00:06:35.880> with<00:06:36.180> these<00:06:45.740> here's<00:06:46.740> somebody's

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
that's why with these here's somebody's

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.670 
that's why with these here's somebody's
there<00:06:47.910> to<00:06:48.090> get<00:06:48.210> water<00:06:48.420> just<00:06:49.140> see<00:06:49.320> if<00:06:49.410> I<00:06:49.470> can<00:06:49.500> do

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
there to get water just see if I can do

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.940 
there to get water just see if I can do
a<00:06:49.710> proper<00:06:49.950> cut<00:06:50.250> this<00:06:50.400> time<00:06:51.560> now<00:06:52.560> that<00:06:52.590> was<00:06:52.890> good

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:54.950 
a proper cut this time now that was good

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.570 
a proper cut this time now that was good
see<00:06:55.950> if<00:06:56.010> I<00:06:56.070> can<00:06:56.190> get<00:06:56.340> close<00:06:56.790> to<00:06:57.780> the<00:06:57.870> apex<00:06:58.580> not

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
see if I can get close to the apex not

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:08.570 
see if I can get close to the apex not
really<00:07:06.200> one<00:07:07.200> minute<00:07:07.500> point<00:07:07.740> eight<00:07:07.890> six<00:07:08.190> I'd
