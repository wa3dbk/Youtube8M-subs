how<00:02:03.390> well<00:02:03.540> he's<00:02:03.659> gonna<00:02:03.750> perform<00:02:04.020> at<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> start

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
how well he's gonna perform at the start

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.780 
how well he's gonna perform at the start
I<00:02:04.680> don't<00:02:05.040> think<00:02:05.159> he's<00:02:05.250> gonna<00:02:05.310> perform<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
I don't think he's gonna perform that

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.900 
I don't think he's gonna perform that
good<00:02:05.939> at<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> start<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.630> after<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.910> I'd

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
good at the start I think after like I'd

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.850 
good at the start I think after like I'd
say<00:02:09.090> after<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.479> two<00:02:09.629> or<00:02:09.720> three<00:02:09.750> weeks<00:02:10.229> into

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
say after like two or three weeks into

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.290 
say after like two or three weeks into
the<00:02:10.979> split<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.520> he'll<00:02:11.640> start<00:02:11.879> becoming<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
the split like he'll start becoming a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.910 
the split like he'll start becoming a
beast<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:12.989> he's<00:02:13.349> going<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> definitely

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
beast but he's going to definitely

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
beast but he's going to definitely
work<00:02:14.010> really<00:02:14.160> hard<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.819> think<00:02:15.240> he'll<00:02:15.330> be

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
work really hard and I think he'll be

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.900 
work really hard and I think he'll be
really<00:02:15.450> good<00:02:15.750> for<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> team<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.819> let's<00:02:17.819> talk

we course didn't beat sale G is a really

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.229 
we course didn't beat sale G is a really
close<00:02:25.349> series<00:02:25.770> which<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.370> really<00:02:26.760> really<00:02:27.060> hard

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
close series which is really really hard

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.600 
close series which is really really hard
to<00:02:27.330> deal<00:02:27.480> with<00:02:27.739> really<00:02:28.739> one<00:02:28.920> game<00:02:29.099> off<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.489> just

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
to deal with really one game off of just

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.300 
to deal with really one game off of just
like<00:02:29.849> making<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.270> back<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.569> LCS<00:02:30.840> and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
taking CLG spot but I think we can

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.660 
taking CLG spot but I think we can
definitely<00:02:34.890> make<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> expansion

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670

like a couple games here and there but

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.780 
like a couple games here and there but

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790

rustiness<00:04:57.150> I<00:04:57.390> feel<00:04:57.570> like<00:04:57.720> but<00:04:58.590> we<00:04:58.710> have<00:04:58.800> like

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
rustiness I feel like but we have like

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.100 
rustiness I feel like but we have like
really<00:04:59.580> good<00:04:59.880> wind<00:05:00.210> rights<00:05:00.360> against<00:05:00.630> all<00:05:00.900> the

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
really good wind rights against all the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.380 
really good wind rights against all the
teams<00:05:01.320> like<00:05:01.620> Coast<00:05:02.250> complexity<00:05:03.710> law<00:05:04.710> pro

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
teams like Coast complexity law pro

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.070 
teams like Coast complexity law pro
because<00:05:06.390> the<00:05:06.510> other<00:05:06.570> teams<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:06.960> are<00:05:07.050> playing

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
because the other teams that are playing

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.990 
because the other teams that are playing
but<00:05:08.010> we<00:05:08.190> played<00:05:08.370> like<00:05:08.520> all<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.700> other<00:05:08.820> top

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
but we played like all the other top

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.300 
but we played like all the other top
teams<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.960> we<00:05:10.290> feel<00:05:10.620> like<00:05:10.650> pretty<00:05:10.890> confident

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
teams and we feel like pretty confident

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.500 
teams and we feel like pretty confident
against<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.670> and<00:05:11.700> I<00:05:11.820> think<00:05:11.850> when<00:05:12.120> King<00:05:12.300> gets

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
against that and I think when King gets

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.580 
against that and I think when King gets
back<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:12.870> like<00:05:12.960> we<00:05:13.050> really<00:05:13.200> get<00:05:13.410> into<00:05:13.530> the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
back and like we really get into the

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.920 
back and like we really get into the
grind<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:13.950> things<00:05:14.480> we're<00:05:15.480> just<00:05:15.540> going<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.750> like

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
grind of things we're just going to like

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.060 
grind of things we're just going to like
take<00:05:16.080> we're<00:05:16.230> going<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.410> sweep<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.710> serious

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
take we're going to sweep that serious

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.770 
take we're going to sweep that serious
like<00:05:17.250> I<00:05:17.340> feel<00:05:17.490> so<00:05:17.670> I<00:05:17.820> feel<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.180> confident<00:05:18.570> like

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780
