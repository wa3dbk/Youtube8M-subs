impressions are go get the Moya round
bit<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.000> lovelier<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.540> comes<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.170> quite

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
bit the lovelier it comes to be quite

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.850 
bit the lovelier it comes to be quite
honest<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.309> terms<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.210> detail<00:00:43.079> list<00:00:43.350> look

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
honest in terms of the detail list look

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.740 
honest in terms of the detail list look
at<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> format<00:00:44.460> first<00:00:44.700> thousand<00:00:45.539> twenty

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
at the format first thousand twenty

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.440 
at the format first thousand twenty
millimeter<00:00:46.110> wings<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.760> it's<00:00:47.760> plugin<00:00:48.120> Flags

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450

you<00:00:48.629> expect<00:00:49.079> CPI<00:00:49.829> phone<00:00:50.100> which<00:00:50.309> probably

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
you expect CPI phone which probably

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.500 
you expect CPI phone which probably
expects<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.260> taking<00:00:52.890> away

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
expects so it's kind of taking away

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.670 
expects so it's kind of taking away
detracting<00:00:54.510> maybe<00:00:54.719> from<00:00:55.020> spending<00:00:55.410> six

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
detracting maybe from spending six

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.369 
detracting maybe from spending six
months<00:00:55.739> building<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
months building one but this is and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
months building one but this is and
maybe<00:00:58.920> diesel<00:00:59.370> engines<00:00:59.640> but<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> day<00:01:00.270> this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
maybe diesel engines but in the day this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.380 
maybe diesel engines but in the day this
is<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> idea<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.770> park<00:01:02.039> flyer<00:01:02.390> at

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
is the idea of this it's a park flyer at

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.280 
is the idea of this it's a park flyer at
the<00:01:03.480> end<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> day<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the end of the day you can have a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.289 
the end of the day you can have a
vintage<00:01:04.589> experience<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> minimum<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
vintage experience with a minimum of a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.420 
vintage experience with a minimum of a
hassle<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:07.530> quite<00:01:07.740> cheaply<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.250> well

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
hassle and really quite cheaply as well

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.570 
hassle and really quite cheaply as well
so<00:01:09.240> looking<00:01:09.750> around<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.070> first<00:01:11.369> thing

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
so looking around it on the first thing

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
so looking around it on the first thing
you<00:01:11.729> will<00:01:11.820> probably<00:01:12.030> notice<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.750> instance<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
