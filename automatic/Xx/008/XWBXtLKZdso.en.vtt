00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.690
 hello to all 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.150
 and today we are here with a new one 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.360
 review of the new product and how 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.650
 had announced in various social media 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.420
 especially on facebook 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.059
 new people will arrive this week 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.580
 products if you decide to send us e 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.100
 so many interesting reviews and 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.870
 of new products like this thing here 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.150
 I tell you as a preface that two have come out 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.220
 weeks ago what i am for unbox areas 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.100
 coin really remain from the 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.720
 Germany bought new sounded for the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.479
 modest sum of 385 euros without 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.400
 expeditions and we're going to open it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.760
 I've already opened it because it could n't 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.090
 wait then you always check when 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.710
 had the bubbles send us all 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.960
 the race dropped to the sense even though it was 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.290
 you guys saw perfectly well 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:32.610
 the browser gaming crew the 770 boys 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:38.330
 act the geforce gtx 7 70 the hold of the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.440
 m6 is just the twin frozr gaming because 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.620
 just the other American components 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.050
 of my computer and you will understand why if 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.540
 you already understand beautiful and it's overclock 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.710
 edition is not sold could be seen from the bed 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.820
 you want to talk a little about the specifications 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.310
 so much that I show 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.410
 this video card based on the same 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:08.930
 gtu of the gtx titan the video card more 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:13.000
 powerful of nvidia then as specifications 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:18.550
 we obviously have the pci express 3.0 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.550
 2gb of ram gddr5 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:30.260
 the core frequency is 1098 myers e 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.300
 I remember the ball well 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.050
 place here worked too own 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.200
 requena memories of the 7000 mega 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.300
 about so I am a lot of order then 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:48.860
 if so, when we can move on to 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:54.530
 opened by the child since then supports 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:03:01.310
 even the sly with dedicated 2gb likes some 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:03.050
 three age critical networks or a box 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.370
 decent then what we find 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:13.070
 inside like we have two 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.150
 cavetti do not know why 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:22.420
 power supply 1 from 3 and 1 from 61 duct e 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:26.110
 why not but because there are these cables 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.110
 long mini pros 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.159
 we'll find out why then look at you 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:40.859
 hear adapters from 6 pins to 8 pins 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:44.870
 even these six pm procession then has 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:47.069
 but there is a bit to make you smart 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.349
 see the instruction manual here 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.730
 this is also only this manual 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:56.969
 pro would be to hang no is not true 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.170
 the wide vga adapter just that the dvd 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.599
 missing pins 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.079
 already because it was used shots of 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.220
 vga for known probably so much 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.909
 use and roll will never happen 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.739
 that is not to facebook and the cd that like 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:16.519
 you know by now not use considered of 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:24.449
 box more but because there is something below 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:27.479
 fine or kids this is giant not 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:32.250
 you can understand too much and even the heavy 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:37.590
 on what the Corese wrote 1.2 kg 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:44.870
 pack is certainly over 260 100 cm long 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.870
 I'm about to take it out 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:58.830
 sticky ie boys look at is 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.819
 really really big fans 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:07.919
 they are very particular as you see in a 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:12.180
 a peeling are 80 cm 80 mm and without 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:17.069
 local cm braids bed to hear or 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.560
 even of 110 100 mm then 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:22.379
 big enough of the tram they cool well 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.180
 it will not be worth being photos where you are 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:30.960
 here you are here I know it will pump 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.979
 of ugly it will be consumed to 2 from eight the 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.680
 just to keep the consumption a little 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.560
 record of the moment I land 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.719
 in the right direction 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.849
 ok very violent this writing 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:48.629
 look with lots of stamps of 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:52.469
 timing so that I know that for 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:54.210
 one thing the guarantee 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:57.690
 all perfectly closed see perloz 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:02.960
 line should support the web 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:11.550
 so between me I know yes this is what 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:17.759
 plastic is in front look at the 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:24.889
 offshoot displayport hdmi and wired e 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:30.629
 of black wight so it is so much to be had 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:31.620
 nava is the one with the least that can be done 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:36.029
 can adapt to vga 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:39.090
 in short, it is nothing for this video card 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:41.490
 that's all we'll see in the next few 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.259
 days hoping the others will arrive 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.440
 components we have two others 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:48.590
 computer assemble them then stay 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.610
 connected because there will be many new features 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.900
 especially with regards to that with 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.720
 more 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.940
 because he will have to keep this video card 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.220
 because it is a computer with all the 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.780
 last generation components and they are 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.669
 in a few but really few in 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.889
 Italy still saw them then 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.139
 stay connected and make me like it 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:09.009
 ask questions if you want to write 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.740
 obviously the benchmark and all the 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:14.990
 novelties of this video card will be 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.650
 only available on the computer 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:23.440
 new then put a like we feel 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.440
 hello hello soon
