welcome<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.170> basics<00:00:01.949> for<00:00:02.070> beginners<00:00:02.129> and

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
welcome to basics for beginners and

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.420 
welcome to basics for beginners and
today<00:00:03.500> this<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.620> going<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.830> be<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> really<00:00:05.160> brief

today this is going to be a really brief

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.000 
today this is going to be a really brief
lesson<00:00:05.910> for<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.509> very<00:00:06.810> important<00:00:07.290> one<00:00:07.379> I'm<00:00:07.919> just

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
lesson for a very important one I'm just

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.700 
lesson for a very important one I'm just
going<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.610> go<00:00:08.730> over<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.269> string<00:00:09.570> names<00:00:09.840> you're

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
going to go over the string names you're

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.320 
going to go over the string names you're
going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.950> need<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.370> their<00:00:11.820> names<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
going to need to know their names of the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.200 
going to need to know their names of the
strings<00:00:13.370> before<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.580> progress<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
strings before you progress on to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.090 
strings before you progress on to
anything<00:00:15.420> else<00:00:15.690> really<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.650> everything

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
anything else really just so everything

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.900 
anything else really just so everything
will<00:00:17.190> make<00:00:17.369> sense

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
will make sense

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.090 
will make sense
and<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.630> really<00:00:18.930> easy<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.320> understand<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and it's really easy to understand a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.820 
and it's really easy to understand a
really<00:00:21.090> easy<00:00:21.240> thing<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.480> remember<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.260> for

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
really easy thing to remember so for

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.170 
really easy thing to remember so for
standard<00:00:23.250> tuning<00:00:23.609> we're<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> look

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
standard tuning we're just going to look

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.910 
standard tuning we're just going to look
at<00:00:24.300> standard<00:00:24.689> tuning<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.710> might

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
at standard tuning for now you might

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.490 
at standard tuning for now you might
notice<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.490> some<00:00:26.519> songs<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.930> look<00:00:28.170> at<00:00:28.349> like

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
notice on some songs if you look at like

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.880 
notice on some songs if you look at like
tablature<00:00:29.099> or<00:00:30.080> their<00:00:31.080> sheet<00:00:31.320> music

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
tablature or their sheet music

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.180 
tablature or their sheet music
the<00:00:32.369> some<00:00:32.790> guitars<00:00:33.149> some<00:00:34.079> songs<00:00:34.530> require<00:00:35.010> you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the some guitars some songs require you

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.979 
the some guitars some songs require you
to<00:00:35.219> maybe<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.180> drop<00:00:36.780> D<00:00:37.020> tuning<00:00:37.079> or<00:00:37.829> E<00:00:38.280> flat

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
to maybe have drop D tuning or E flat

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.740 
to maybe have drop D tuning or E flat
never<00:00:39.989> mind<00:00:40.200> about<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:41.570> all<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
never mind about that for now all that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.260 
never mind about that for now all that
means<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.469> simply<00:00:43.890> each<00:00:44.789> string<00:00:45.120> is

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
means is it's simply each string is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.569 
means is it's simply each string is
tuned<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.780> different<00:00:46.170> key<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:47.190> today<00:00:47.489> we're

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
tuned to a different key but today we're

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
tuned to a different key but today we're
going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> look<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:47.940> standard<00:00:48.329> tuning<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.140> for

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
going to look at standard tuning so for

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.090 
going to look at standard tuning so for
each<00:00:50.090> string<00:00:51.500> I'm<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> run

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
each string I'm just going to run

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.020 
each string I'm just going to run
through<00:00:53.280> its<00:00:53.399> name<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.680> first<00:00:56.070> string<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
through its name so the first string the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.209 
through its name so the first string the
thickest<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> lowest<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.190> E

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
thickest one and the lowest one is the E

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.240 
thickest one and the lowest one is the E
string

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
string

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.509 
string
we<00:01:01.730> should<00:01:01.940> sound<00:01:02.150> like<00:01:02.329> that<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:03.680> next<00:01:04.309> one

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
we should sound like that the next one

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.160 
we should sound like that the next one
down<00:01:04.730> is<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:06.650> a-string

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
down is the a-string

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.870 
down is the a-string
d<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:11.039> the<00:01:11.219> third<00:01:12.829> G<00:01:13.829> is<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.460> fourth

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
d is the third G is the fourth

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.880 
d is the third G is the fourth
B<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.240> 250<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:19.250> E<00:01:20.090> again<00:01:20.510> but<00:01:21.260> this<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.650> top

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
B is 250 and E again but this is the top

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.320 
B is 250 and E again but this is the top
e<00:01:22.130> it's<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:24.200> sixth<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.130> reason<00:01:26.090> why

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
e it's the sixth and the reason why

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.650 
e it's the sixth and the reason why
these<00:01:26.870> two<00:01:26.930> strings<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:28.120> top<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.540> bottom

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
these two strings the top and the bottom

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.750 
these two strings the top and the bottom
are<00:01:30.020> called<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.380> same<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:30.890> because<00:01:31.310> they<00:01:31.610> are

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
are called the same is because they are

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.920 
are called the same is because they are
both<00:01:32.030> in<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.330> key<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.660> E<00:01:33.140> if<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.530> listen

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.680 

they're<00:01:37.500> opting<00:01:38.190> their<00:01:38.730> octaves<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.510> each

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
they're opting their octaves of each

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.800 
they're opting their octaves of each
other<00:01:39.930> well<00:01:40.320> two<00:01:40.590> octaves<00:01:41.010> but<00:01:41.790> they<00:01:42.540> sound

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
other well two octaves but they sound

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.130 
other well two octaves but they sound
the<00:01:42.900> same

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the same

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.390 
the same
if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.040> remember<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.990> first<00:01:46.440> string<00:01:46.770> here

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
if you remember the first string here

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.250 
if you remember the first string here
number<00:01:48.300> one<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.810> e<00:01:51.840> string<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.520> e<00:01:53.960> 2<00:01:54.960> is

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
number one is the e string one is e 2 is

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:05.180 
number one is the e string one is e 2 is
a<00:01:56.090> three<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.360> d<00:01:59.480> fourth<00:02:00.480> is<00:02:00.780> g<00:02:01.850> v<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.000> B<00:02:03.710> 6<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
a three is d fourth is g v is B 6 is a

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.990 
a three is d fourth is g v is B 6 is a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
again so e a d g b e and if you have a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.330 
again so e a d g b e and if you have a
guitar<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.660> e<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.980> d<00:02:14.760> g<00:02:15.320> b<00:02:16.320> e<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.950> you're

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
guitar like this e a d g b e if you're

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.900 
guitar like this e a d g b e if you're
just<00:02:17.670> if<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.180> pegs<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.510> run<00:02:18.780> along<00:02:18.900> its<00:02:19.200> EAD

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
just if the pegs just run along its EAD

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.290 
just if the pegs just run along its EAD
gb<00:02:20.910> e<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:23.220> easy<00:02:23.400> enough<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> remember

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
gb e so that's easy enough to remember

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.630 
gb e so that's easy enough to remember
and<00:02:24.510> once<00:02:25.050> you've<00:02:25.200> got<00:02:25.230> two<00:02:25.590> grasps<00:02:26.100> with<00:02:26.310> that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and once you've got two grasps with that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.180 
and once you've got two grasps with that
you<00:02:27.240> will<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.630> able<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:28.020> start<00:02:28.350> with<00:02:28.709> looking

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
you will be able to start with looking
