00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 some people write about things with them 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.000
 have nothing to do with them and others 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.929
 write about very personal as well 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.920
 I did it the next morning 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.030
 ashamed of the card and not of that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.390
 this day my life forever 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.710
 would change 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.140
 I think it's probably the most personal 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.850
 movie that richie wrote as me 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.710
 He met me the first time he told me it 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.180
 his last movie would be his hand that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.410
 was a shock but i think it is over 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.779
 the same reasons in the film 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.219
 be voiced family and the time the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.270
 One should take care of them in this 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.270
 short life we have 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.649
 Let's do it again 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 Feels how important this movie is to him 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.210
 and the personal is richard brings 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.210
 so much of himself from his soul 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.629
 it was nice for me in this case 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.399
 but to write about my world in it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:07.380
 two people do not put out 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:08.909
 my world is the critical world stops 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.979
 the mirror to all of us 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.930
 the spectators can live their lives 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.830
 own feelings and everything else in it 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.990
 recognize 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.540
 that is what Roger creates through his work 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:30.060
 some things may be obvious where he is doing 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:31.710
 that's a brilliant 8 of his films 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.840
 like richard himself are full of love 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.369
 heart and generosity city ​​plans 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 can into the hearts of the people 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.060
 put he talks about the things that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.479
 most people are busy 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:53.350
 I'm so on of disinterested 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:55.780
 a life without your father his 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.000
 unconditional idealism creates this 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.049
 warmhearted lying style of his 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.520
 romantic comedies 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.890
 It's a first day and you have to 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.179
 first get used to all 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.009
 I have never had so much fun 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.720
 someone belongs to how overfed and that 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.269
 before I even met him 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.010
 economy a great working environment 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.130
 This will give you a lot of fun 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.040
 play and try out what's important 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.959
 I want to keep you in the mood there is 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.549
 no filming without worrying about everything 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.750
 will work if we do everything right 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.030
 make and make the right decisions 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.040
 but all met 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.959
 the sun is contemporaneous with each other 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.510
 was laughed a lot and economy it 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.860
 to create that joy in the set I would be 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.630
 So very sad if this really 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.810
 but his last movie would have to be me 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.810
 understand it 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.530
 Everything a question of time 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.530
 from october 17 in the cinema
