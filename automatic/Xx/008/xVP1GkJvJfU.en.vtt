one of the great things that we can do
in<00:00:14.830> processing<00:00:15.830> our<00:00:15.920> images<00:00:16.189> and<00:00:16.340> create

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
in processing our images and create

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.859 
in processing our images and create
multiple<00:00:16.730> exposures<00:00:17.270> you're<00:00:17.570> going<00:00:17.689> to<00:00:17.750> love

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
on the left is a shot that we did

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.060 
on the left is a shot that we did
multiple<00:00:22.910> exposures<00:00:23.419> in<00:00:23.630> camera<00:00:24.169> three<00:00:24.739> shots

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
multiple exposures in camera three shots

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.429 
multiple exposures in camera three shots
on<00:00:25.310> one<00:00:26.029> frame<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:27.050> can<00:00:27.169> see<00:00:27.289> what

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
on one frame and you can see what

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.259 
on one frame and you can see what
happens<00:00:27.740> we<00:00:27.859> get<00:00:28.009> this<00:00:28.160> ghosting<00:00:28.640> another<00:00:29.119> way

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
happens we get this ghosting another way

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.999 
happens we get this ghosting another way
you<00:00:29.330> can<00:00:29.480> do<00:00:29.599> multiple<00:00:29.810> exposures<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:30.589> take

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
you can do multiple exposures to take

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.729 
you can do multiple exposures to take
three<00:00:31.580> shots<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.239> combine<00:00:33.199> them<00:00:33.500> in

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
three shots and combine them in

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.290 
three shots and combine them in
Photoshop<00:00:34.370> by<00:00:34.489> taking<00:00:34.820> each<00:00:34.970> one<00:00:35.000> of<00:00:35.239> those

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
Photoshop by taking each one of those

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.689 
Photoshop by taking each one of those
images<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:35.839> placing<00:00:36.290> them<00:00:36.440> over<00:00:36.769> and<00:00:36.980> erasing

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
images and placing them over and erasing

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:38.799 
images and placing them over and erasing
people<00:00:37.970> and<00:00:38.059> getting<00:00:38.239> this<00:00:38.329> image<00:00:38.600> on<00:00:38.720> the

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
here to my eraser tool and watch this

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.119 
here to my eraser tool and watch this
this<00:00:59.629> is<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.899> this<00:01:00.170> is<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.410> most<00:01:00.590> fun<00:01:00.800> part<00:01:00.829> of

this whole process is we're going to

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.469 
this whole process is we're going to
erase<00:01:03.649> part<00:01:03.980> of<00:01:04.039> this<00:01:04.160> layer<00:01:04.399> so<00:01:05.179> we<00:01:05.210> can<00:01:05.330> see

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
erase part of this layer so we can see

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.419 
erase part of this layer so we can see
Rachel<00:01:06.110> in<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.200> background<00:01:06.619> look<00:01:06.740> at<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:06.979> so

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:07.429

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
all I've done is taken these three shots

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.200 
all I've done is taken these three shots
which<00:01:09.890> I've<00:01:10.009> done<00:01:10.190> by<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.399> way<00:01:10.580> on<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.850> tripod

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
which I've done by the way on a tripod

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.240 
which I've done by the way on a tripod
so<00:01:11.960> everything<00:01:12.410> in<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.560> background<00:01:13.070> that<00:01:13.220> you

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
so everything in the background that you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.480 
so everything in the background that you
see<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:14.000> still<00:01:14.960> sharp<00:01:15.679> the<00:01:15.920> only<00:01:16.160> thing<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.459> has

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
see is still sharp the only thing it has

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.120 
see is still sharp the only thing it has
moved<00:01:16.970> here<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.509> Rachel<00:01:18.410> now<00:01:18.590> one<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.039> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
moved here is Rachel now one of the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.320 
moved here is Rachel now one of the
things<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.399> I<00:01:19.459> can<00:01:19.640> see<00:01:19.849> already<00:01:20.209> in<00:01:20.270> the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
things that I can see already in the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.120 
things that I can see already in the
background<00:01:20.780> see<00:01:21.140> that<00:01:21.289> little<00:01:21.530> light<00:01:21.709> post<00:01:21.979> in

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
background see that little light post in

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.650 
background see that little light post in
the<00:01:22.190> background<00:01:22.610> that<00:01:23.119> means<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.539> I'm<00:01:23.630> not

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
the background that means that I'm not

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.690 
the background that means that I'm not
lining<00:01:24.200> up<00:01:24.319> exactly<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:24.890> let's<00:01:25.069> go<00:01:25.160> back<00:01:25.190> to

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
lining up exactly so let's go back to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.570 
lining up exactly so let's go back to
the<00:01:26.140> tool<00:01:27.140> there<00:01:27.410> now<00:01:27.679> see<00:01:27.979> how<00:01:28.069> it<00:01:28.160> snapped<00:01:28.399> in

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
the tool there now see how it snapped in

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.770 
the tool there now see how it snapped in
now<00:01:28.819> we're<00:01:29.000> good<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:29.239> I<00:01:29.270> just<00:01:29.509> missed<00:01:29.690> my

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
now we're good so I just missed my

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.960 
now we're good so I just missed my
target<00:01:30.050> okay<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:30.860> there's<00:01:31.130> one<00:01:31.250> shot<00:01:31.520> we're

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
target okay so there's one shot we're

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.430 
target okay so there's one shot we're
going<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.179> flatten<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.720> image<00:01:32.750> which<00:01:33.200> means

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
going to flatten the image which means

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.020 
going to flatten the image which means
I'm<00:01:33.590> simply<00:01:33.890> taking<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.250> two<00:01:34.520> layers<00:01:34.759> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
I'm simply taking the two layers and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.330 
I'm simply taking the two layers and
making<00:01:35.360> them<00:01:35.479> to<00:01:35.630> one<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.110> I'm<00:01:36.950> going<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.220> go

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
making them to one and I'm going to go

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.889 
making them to one and I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.640> close<00:01:37.849> that<00:01:38.149> now<00:01:38.660> I'm<00:01:38.720> going<00:01:38.750> to

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
ahead and close that now I'm going to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.479 
ahead and close that now I'm going to
find<00:01:39.140> my<00:01:39.289> other<00:01:39.470> image<00:01:39.800> where<00:01:40.130> Rachel's

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:40.489 
find my other image where Rachel's

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:42.520 
find my other image where Rachel's
talking<00:01:40.819> to<00:01:40.910> herself<00:01:41.060> on<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.479> other<00:01:41.630> side<00:01:41.899> and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
talking to herself on the other side and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.749 
talking to herself on the other side and
we're<00:01:42.619> going<00:01:42.739> to<00:01:42.770> repeat<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.310> same<00:01:43.489> process

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
we're going to repeat the same process

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.550 
we're going to repeat the same process
I'm<00:01:44.179> going<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.390> bring<00:01:44.509> this<00:01:44.720> in<00:01:45.020> I'm<00:01:45.349> going<00:01:45.500> to

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
I'm going to bring this in I'm going to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.589 
I'm going to bring this in I'm going to
let<00:01:45.739> it<00:01:45.860> snap<00:01:46.369> into<00:01:46.610> place<00:01:46.880> as<00:01:47.119> you<00:01:47.270> can<00:01:47.360> see

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
let it snap into place as you can see

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:50.080 
let it snap into place as you can see
there<00:01:47.810> now<00:01:48.349> ideally<00:01:49.069> I<00:01:49.369> should<00:01:49.640> have<00:01:49.759> gone<00:01:49.910> the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
there now ideally I should have gone the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.520 
there now ideally I should have gone the
other<00:01:50.179> direction<00:01:50.300> because<00:01:50.869> I<00:01:51.050> could<00:01:51.229> have<00:01:51.349> had

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
other direction because I could have had

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.109 
other direction because I could have had
both<00:01:51.800> people<00:01:52.190> in<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:52.550> I'm<00:01:52.729> just<00:01:52.849> going<00:01:53.030> to

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
both people in but I'm just going to

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.540 
both people in but I'm just going to
race<00:01:53.239> to<00:01:53.450> people<00:01:53.720> now<00:01:53.869> as<00:01:54.020> opposed<00:01:54.349> to<00:01:54.560> one<00:01:54.920> but

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
race to people now as opposed to one but

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.949 
race to people now as opposed to one but
we're<00:01:55.670> going<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.849> do<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.030> same<00:01:56.239> process<00:01:56.509> we're

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
we're going to do the same process we're

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.199 
we're going to do the same process we're
going<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.140> grab<00:01:57.379> my<00:01:57.619> eraser<00:01:58.220> tool<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.670> want<00:01:59.119> to

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
going to grab my eraser tool I want to

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.609 
going to grab my eraser tool I want to
make<00:01:59.360> my<00:01:59.569> brush<00:01:59.869> size<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.140> little<00:02:00.379> bigger

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
make my brush size a little bigger

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.290 
make my brush size a little bigger
because<00:02:00.770> I'm<00:02:00.950> erasing<00:02:01.190> two<00:02:01.550> people<00:02:01.819> now<00:02:02.000> as

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
because I'm erasing two people now as

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.059 
because I'm erasing two people now as
opposed<00:02:02.660> to<00:02:02.750> one<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.170> look<00:02:03.379> at<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.590> here<00:02:03.920> she

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
opposed to one and look at that here she

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.540 
opposed to one and look at that here she
comes

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
comes

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.960 
comes
see<00:02:05.090> how<00:02:05.149> easy<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.599> is<00:02:05.750> three<00:02:06.679> images<00:02:06.920> in<00:02:07.369> one

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
see how easy that is three images in one

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.820 
see how easy that is three images in one
you<00:02:08.209> could<00:02:08.330> do<00:02:08.420> as<00:02:08.539> many<00:02:08.899> as<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.170> wanted<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.649> do

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
you could do as many as you wanted to do

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.430 
you could do as many as you wanted to do
but<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.759> key<00:02:10.940> here<00:02:11.209> is<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.599> just<00:02:12.080> using<00:02:12.349> the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
but the key here is that just using the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.199 
but the key here is that just using the
eraser<00:02:12.739> tool<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.310> bringing<00:02:13.730> them<00:02:13.879> out<00:02:14.000> I'm

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
eraser tool and bringing them out I'm

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.270 
eraser tool and bringing them out I'm
not<00:02:14.360> getting<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.810> ghosting<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.530> get<00:02:15.770> when

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
not getting the ghosting that I get when

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.640 
not getting the ghosting that I get when
I'm<00:02:16.430> doing<00:02:16.700> an<00:02:16.790> in-camera<00:02:17.360> multiple<00:02:18.200> exposure

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
I'm doing an in-camera multiple exposure

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.830 
I'm doing an in-camera multiple exposure
that's<00:02:19.459> creating<00:02:19.879> ghost<00:02:20.090> images<00:02:20.480> over<00:02:20.689> each

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
that's creating ghost images over each

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.099 
that's creating ghost images over each
one

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
one

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.670 
one
so<00:02:21.439> just<00:02:21.680> by<00:02:21.890> erasing<00:02:22.760> erasing<00:02:23.569> erasing

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
so just by erasing erasing erasing

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.110 
so just by erasing erasing erasing
look<00:02:24.739> at<00:02:24.829> that<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.129> I've<00:02:25.280> got<00:02:25.459> three<00:02:25.670> shots<00:02:25.939> I

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
look at that now I've got three shots I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.119 
look at that now I've got three shots I
can<00:02:26.150> flatten<00:02:26.629> that<00:02:26.870> image<00:02:27.140> which<00:02:27.650> brings<00:02:27.950> all

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
can flatten that image which brings all

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.099 
can flatten that image which brings all
of<00:02:28.250> those<00:02:28.430> layers<00:02:28.609> together<00:02:28.989> diminishing<00:02:29.989> the

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
of those layers together diminishing the

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.050 
of those layers together diminishing the
size<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> file<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.489> I've<00:02:31.549> got<00:02:31.760> three

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
size of the file and I've got three

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.550 
size of the file and I've got three
shots<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.510> are<00:02:32.540> lined<00:02:32.810> up<00:02:32.930> perfectly<00:02:33.260> got
