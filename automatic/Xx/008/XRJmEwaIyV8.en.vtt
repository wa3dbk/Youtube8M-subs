00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.200
 and they will not happen again 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.440
 in principle not on my bed 2.12 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.639
 So then comes the practical 72 and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.780
 so on and now we'll take a look 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.340
 now the heart of the record if 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.170
 this will be done with the patch r 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240
 Accordingly, I adjusted aperture 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.279
 you both right one, if he the right one 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.680
 now the new set is the new one 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.470
 ekz you see that with us 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.590
 completely changed and for 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.719
 Bono is the old Sixth Bonus and that 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 5 bonus so as the fifth federal there are 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.070
 something completely new that is now 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.840
 Here's the first impression and that's the one 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 Absolutely crazy what happened here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.329
 because what you already compared in 500 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.760
 stronger and 500 vitality in the relationship 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.129
 100 percent more damage any effect 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.500
 and then the incredible 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.379
 incredible set bonus of 3000 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.559
 weapon damage over three seconds 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.510
 they would have to be explicit 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.039
 test how much the whole thing but makes 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.899
 Of course, it is very important now 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.180
 that you get a very good weapon 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.850
 and a very good weapon means 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.369
 a melting furnace or alternatively one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.460
 then do not have melting furnace energy 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.110
 every fall maximus the maximus sword 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 believes very often and is the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.880
 He is demon summoned here it is 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.320
 connected with a chain and this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.979
 progress is also very important 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.840
 damage 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.850
 and here it is very important because we are on 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.259
 new patch also ancient objects 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.390
 can have 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.369
 that the weapon was considered ancient 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.110
 Being lured that means first that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.570
 first thing he did soon in the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.030
 new patch 1 lok expensive blood splitter 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.729
 give me for channel we at 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.390
 canale just her weapons I know it 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.610
 is very expensive 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.890
 but you just have to risk it 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.259
 just the chance to have one like that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.090
 called weapon as an ancient object too 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.600
 if he gets easy today 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.100
 300 to 500 ps out and of course, 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.159
 very much more strength and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.350
 rivalries which then pushes really far 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.110
 forward so I support myself now 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.420
 getting colder in the west and with you 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.429
 then a new bandaged together 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.989
 Old arrived very well to me very much 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.730
 Also pleased about the plays basin 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.950
 of course do not answer that question 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.420
 I am very happy to ask 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.300
 and often I am also a good one 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.849
 insight into what some players are 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.660
 thinking and how many skills 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.190
 But they do not work then 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.110
 work the way they work 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.390
 and therefore I will do the whole thing 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.910
 then of course for the new patch times 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.090
 Let's pray so that we are in vogue again 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.590
 since you with a small tip for now that 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.269
 So do not drive with a performance 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.610
 exactly when the patch comes in 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.620
 his mother a few weeks, therefore 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.080
 we will set the finished work anyway 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.459
 have the shot that is quite complete 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.040
 important and just look at that 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.660
 melting furnace gets so right 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.700
 I'm glad to have a good start too 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.459
 brought new fire amoled and indeed here 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.349
 with superstition secondary effect is 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.579
 Of course, very good is also relatively good 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 We wanted to tell her I had one 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.989
 Little luck assured ten times in the 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.970
 Of the ten killed in the east, want to fire 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.170
 months this was the best under 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.079
 one more 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.819
 this arm seemed to have to be 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.900
 to roll that I was always up 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.670
 Physician play 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.620
 I would be a late one 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.660
 another video guide why physics latin 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.160
 physics rules in the field shoulder absolutely 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.769
 best beck and you have in the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.780
 secondary for each stunned opponent 11 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.060
 less harm if he then anyway 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.329
 Vacuum cleaner on the maps plays with 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.250
 baker skill then he always stood 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.049
 again the opponents and aspects high it 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.090
 affects not currently directly 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.470
 the cafÃ©s are pure but it carries the tall ones 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.389
 just gets a lot less 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.590
 harm that's just must have been 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.319
 we only see 18 million 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.540
 safety the whole thing with a unit 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.670
 which is directed on the companion 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.160
 then practically 36 million security 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.680
 but that's visually for the 40s throws 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.720
 or about it almost too little 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.370
 I'm here once it has descendants 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.769
 So be curious to get ready 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.450
 collects volt especially when he is 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.160
 again very much fortune has to bring 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.829
 This market is also more important to you 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.130
 his blue dust and the yellow that 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.290
 following the new ultra is informative 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.359
 already the new age-old items will become you 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.099
 a lot of mats cost a lot again 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.049
 gold is a bit gold shapes 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.120
 the billions no problem at all 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.280
 to crack ensures that her about it 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.430
 enough here I'm on the banks 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.540
 is something you should do here 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.910
 on the somewhere else 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.560
 you should definitely do it anyway 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.180
 came here from a few thousand pieces 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.820
 and here by barth out of the way 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.500
 so that he then without without bad 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.210
 certain things can follow as follows 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.570
 namely, in fact, and so on 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.010
 cost partly 50 or even 75 of 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.350
 So these samples as crystals 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.700
 then just melt right into the office 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.500
 You can still do that in advance 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.380
 probably do a bit too 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.970
 paragon dennison characters and meat 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.520
 characters were added up i 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.920
 not so current at 6 57 is not quite 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.770
 But you are always so high 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.220
 just enough points to distribute here 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.740
 can 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.960
 so be remain tense and we hear 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.000
 us now or once 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.320
 I'm going through it again 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.320
 I'll see you next time
