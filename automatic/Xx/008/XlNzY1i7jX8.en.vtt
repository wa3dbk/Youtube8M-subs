00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.290 
for marketing already so first of all
you<00:02:46.860> want<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.160> think<00:02:47.280> about<00:02:47.430> how<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.850> did<00:02:48.180> it

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
you want to think about how you did it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.870 
you want to think about how you did it
how<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.660> did<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.170> first<00:02:49.470> deal<00:02:49.709> what<00:02:50.520> did<00:02:50.760> it

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
how you did that first deal what did it

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.240 
how you did that first deal what did it
come<00:02:51.120> from<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.989> know<00:02:52.020> was<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.590> bandit<00:02:52.980> sign

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
come from you know was it a bandit sign

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.190 
come from you know was it a bandit sign
was<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> direct<00:02:54.600> mail<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.160> cold<00:02:56.459> calling

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
was a direct mail was it cold calling

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
was a direct mail was it cold calling
what<00:02:58.200> did<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.470> come<00:02:58.709> from

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
what did it come from

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.460 
what did it come from
so<00:02:59.640> clearly<00:02:59.940> whatever<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.720> came<00:03:00.930> from<00:03:01.200> that

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
so clearly whatever it came from that

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.520 
so clearly whatever it came from that
strategy<00:03:02.370> works<00:03:02.910> right<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:04.110> would<00:03:04.380> think

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
strategy works right so I would think

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.110 
strategy works right so I would think
about<00:03:04.709> doubling<00:03:05.430> down<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.360> strategy<00:03:06.840> and

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
about doubling down on that strategy and

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.009 
about doubling down on that strategy and
taking<00:03:09.120> at<00:03:09.300> least<00:03:09.570> half<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.350> money<00:03:10.650> and

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
taking at least half of that money and

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.420 
taking at least half of that money and
investing<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.140> back<00:03:13.470> into<00:03:13.739> your<00:03:13.980> business<00:03:14.220> so

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
in terms of wholesaling investing it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.530 
in terms of wholesaling investing it
back<00:03:17.190> into<00:03:17.400> your<00:03:17.610> business<00:03:17.820> looks<00:03:18.300> like
