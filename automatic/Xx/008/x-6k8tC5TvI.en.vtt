00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
washers one there one there and we're

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.030 
washers one there one there and we're
getting<00:02:46.490> ready<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.730> install<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.210> filters

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
getting ready to install the filters

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.000 
getting ready to install the filters
it's<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.100> wing<00:02:49.280> nut<00:02:49.720> notice<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.840> washer<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
it's a wing nut notice the washer the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.660 
it's a wing nut notice the washer the
washer<00:02:52.400> goes<00:02:52.580> on<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.290> top<00:02:54.290> side<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.490> that

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
washer goes on the top side so that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.130 
washer goes on the top side so that
whenever<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:56.000> pour<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.480> contaminated<00:02:57.020> water

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
whenever you pour the contaminated water

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.460 
whenever you pour the contaminated water
in<00:02:57.590> or<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.070> water<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:58.550> want<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.790> filter

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
in or the water that you want to filter

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.750 
in or the water that you want to filter
that<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.620> goes<00:03:00.710> against<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.160> washer<00:03:01.640> and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
that it goes against the washer and

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.580 
that it goes against the washer and
doesn't<00:03:02.540> pass<00:03:02.690> through<00:03:02.720> into<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.260> holding

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
doesn't pass through into the holding

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.470 
doesn't pass through into the holding
tank<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.100> all<00:03:04.700> we're<00:03:04.850> going<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.000> do<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.300> take

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
tank and all we're going to do is take

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:28.030 
tank and all we're going to do is take
that<00:03:05.690> wing<00:03:05.840> nut<00:03:06.050> off<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:09.700> insert<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.850> in

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:44.460 

thread<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.160> on<00:03:29.250> hand<00:03:29.580> tight<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.560> there<00:03:31.560> we<00:03:31.620> go

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.180 

now<00:03:45.470> we<00:03:45.530> have<00:03:45.830> our<00:03:46.209> two<00:03:47.209> filters<00:03:47.659> installed

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
now we have our two filters installed

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.910 
now we have our two filters installed
and<00:03:49.190> our<00:03:49.489> two<00:03:49.760> plugs<00:03:53.470> now<00:03:54.470> let's<00:03:54.650> go<00:03:54.709> ahead<00:03:54.769> and

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
and our two plugs now let's go ahead and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.149 
and our two plugs now let's go ahead and
put<00:03:55.010> our<00:03:55.099> spigot<00:03:55.519> on<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:56.769> looks<00:03:57.769> like<00:03:57.980> it's

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
put our spigot on and looks like it's

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.850 
put our spigot on and looks like it's
the<00:03:58.250> same<00:03:58.489> design<00:03:58.879> as<00:03:59.120> everything<00:03:59.540> else<00:03:59.829> got<00:04:00.829> a

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
the same design as everything else got a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:12.210 
the same design as everything else got a
good<00:04:01.099> coupler<00:04:01.780> good<00:04:02.780> washers<00:04:03.230> on<00:04:03.409> them

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:20.460 

put<00:04:13.220> one<00:04:13.370> washer<00:04:13.760> on<00:04:13.879> the<00:04:14.000> outside

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:38.860 

one<00:04:21.130> wash<00:04:21.340> on<00:04:21.610> the<00:04:21.760> inside<00:04:22.180> with<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.900> wingnut

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.040 

and<00:04:39.500> it's<00:04:39.680> designed<00:04:40.100> so<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:41.810> looks<00:04:41.990> like

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
and it's designed so that it looks like

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.470 
and it's designed so that it looks like
it's<00:04:42.350> going<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.590> get<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.710> fourth<00:04:43.100> period<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:44.300> the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
it's going to get a fourth period on the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.220 
it's going to get a fourth period on the
wing<00:04:44.660> nut<00:04:44.870> which<00:04:45.050> is<00:04:45.230> good

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.070 

and<00:04:52.800> there's<00:04:53.040> our<00:04:53.190> spigot<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.480> we<00:04:54.750> have<00:04:54.960> the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
and there's our spigot and we have the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.320 
and there's our spigot and we have the
verb<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.470> Archaea<00:04:56.010> symbol<00:04:56.490> we<00:04:57.060> have<00:04:57.210> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
verb the Archaea symbol we have the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.630 
verb the Archaea symbol we have the
