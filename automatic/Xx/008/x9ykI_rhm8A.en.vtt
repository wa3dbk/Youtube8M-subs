00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.630
 and that has made many of youtube good 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.720
 that we are with the sexy tricks of go and 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.119
 this time it's inside the map 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.380
 of drydock I hope you like it and then 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.070
 no more to say 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 we started 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.680
 for how are you seeing pomegranates and inks 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.580
 is going to be the first good because this 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.150
 place is extremely easy to do 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.710
 they just try to calculate it well and 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 you can get an easy death when 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.710
 are grabbing the ink as they can 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:59.550
 see was exactly the ink falls in this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.059
 position between the tanks and the bars 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.519
 I am going to say it and if it dies if it were the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.649
 first you can use this I have not seen 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.180
 that many do it, you have to beat yourself 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.940
 in the corner exactly pull the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.070
 grenade as you can see it bounced and that 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.740
 exactly where they throw where they grab the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.800
 ink will not see it in the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.630
 reverse perspective on how to what 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.020
 I would see if they were pulling me 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020
 pomegranate 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.100
 the grenade hits the roof and falls 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.600
 about on that side I do not know I do not know how 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.720
 will have launched but what's inside iii 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.400
 but even bushes stuck 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.980
 different form but I feel that it is 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.990
 easier to take off in the corner this 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.670
 it's another has it stick in the eye corner 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.990
 here because they can hear you when 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.270
 there is the grenade so preferably 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.310
 try to throw it away if you look but if you already 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.140
 it's a matter of time I signed it for 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.990
 who saw exactly where he is here 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.479
 by the perspective as you can see 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.430
 I kill you automatically does not let you out 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.659
 you have no choice but to walk away 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.369
 hence this is another one that is a bit weird 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.840
 or something like someone put there but 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.580
 Sometimes it helps you when you already 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.560
 they pressed they have not finished with life 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.239
 your equipment is and throw it exactly in the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.709
 corner you can point the first one to 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.200
 what do you think is that you're going to throw it 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.319
 but that's not how you can see cause a 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.209
 impact of the whole back like this 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.180
 that if tuned note to jump towards 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.090
 back you lower it because the ink is 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.370
 expand to this box and if not then 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.260
 so goes strength even get down to 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.959
 next to moria dale with throwing or something 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.140
 well but it is effective very effective 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.620
 I would say and you can not escape because as 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.560
 I tell them you Estonian and you try to treat 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.200
 you have to throw the ink and 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.540
 then they will miss you try to 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.660
 Jump back so they do not lower you 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.299
 and now the wrong places where not 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.930
 you must put on but nothing like 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.390
 you can see there you can see that he will comment but 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.860
 You can see me but it is very difficult 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.140
 see it when you're 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.320
 when you do not know what is there is very 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.020
 difficult to see because it is in the tube and 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.790
 you do not see the little light or a rayito that takes out 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.850
 the sniper when someone points so 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.630
 It is very useful but 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.090
 and that we see the inverse perspective as 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.710
 as you would see this let's say that 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.620
 we are in the boom snipes event and 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.380
 you're pointing there and you can not see the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.380
 little light of the grandmother automatically already 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.890
 I know you could download something like that but it's 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.870
 in case you did not know it, that 's very 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.150
 but well known not know if you the 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.920
 know you should not put it at all 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.020
 but not at all in this box because you 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.850
 they fly they can even do it from the 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.100
 two sides and that if they thought of a 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.990
 side could not be otherwise if it is wrong 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.730
 if you can both sides but I think that 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.380
 this side of the width is easier 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.450
 because you can point at the other one is 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.060
 pointing I could not give him news by 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.860
 his character that they had the sabah but not 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.740
 could you give him a look at the perspective 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.990
 investor and as it usually happens there 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.250
 Well, my grandmother, very easy, as you can 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.730
 see in media from the joker 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.580
 and these others but another wife is another 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.000
 where you can fly is the 'lord' 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.670
 where is it there I know you could poke 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.680
 You have flown but you will not see 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.630
 with that side you will not go green 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.460
 there stuck on the tractor as you can see 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.370
 - in the rayito or anything 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.830
 of the fly by the eye is very effective 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.470
 also if you can not fly your head 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.510
 you can even press it when 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.160
 already you lower it you life this place like 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.590
 you know it's very comfortable to blow your head 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.480
 from the box there because then you do not have 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.070
 that change the look but if not also 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.110
 it can be on the other side if you do not know 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.169
 how do you have to paste in this position 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.850
 to make you back and this walking 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.380
 there and as you can see it is there not 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.910
 you can point eye here you can not 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.350
 point because they can see less 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.450
 age you have to be more back and already 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.220
 is going to see you is going to see the sniper 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.110
 is to see the beam so it's better 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.610
 do not point and hit it exactly there 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.650
 where it is in the eye there is not going to 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.150
 see and then you can fly it with the 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.810
 ease 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.600
 very very good from this place nothing more 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.100
 let's see the perspective that 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.710
 we would take let's say we're 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.930
 pointing equal in the event in jimmy me 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.940
 has done in a public game in what 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.000
 who want them to be playing you can 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.010
 fly sela is very effective and so good 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.890
 that was all I hope you liked it if 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.620
 you want to know which map is next or 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.450
 for the map they want to see for the next 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.520
 video of this is they put you in the 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.760
 eye comments here I also wanted you 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.200
 say something I already have some clips for 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.450
 the top but needs more because 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.910
 I know there are some that are only a 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:52.100
 shot and all that I do not want to see 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:54.290
 so silly the top and if you have not 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.850
 seen that I have not answered them in the 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.090
 messages that you sent me with your clip 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.160
 this send it again because without 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.890
 I wanted to delete the messages and I could not 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.660
 copy the links sorry for that but now 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.390
 you know this they did see that I did not answer them 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.350
 the message of your top that this is in 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.140
 the top basically 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.250
 then send in the video again and that 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.810
 it was all now yes I hope there will be 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.680
 liked and see you the next video 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.680
 kids, see you later
