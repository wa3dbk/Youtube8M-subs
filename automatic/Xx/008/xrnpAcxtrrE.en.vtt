got<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.720> Genesis<00:05:38.260> out<00:05:38.470> just<00:05:38.920> before<00:05:39.310> the

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
got the Genesis out just before the

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.060 
got the Genesis out just before the
Super<00:05:39.670> Nintendo<00:05:39.820> was<00:05:40.240> released<00:05:40.570> that<00:05:41.320> period

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
Super Nintendo was released that period

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.970 
Super Nintendo was released that period
around<00:05:42.160> 1989<00:05:43.060> to<00:05:43.390> 1990<00:05:44.020> was<00:05:44.140> really<00:05:44.380> exciting

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
around 1989 to 1990 was really exciting

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.920 
around 1989 to 1990 was really exciting
because<00:05:45.130> I<00:05:45.310> think<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.670> NES<00:05:46.090> library<00:05:46.690> had

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
because I think the NES library had

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.960 
because I think the NES library had
become<00:05:47.410> pretty<00:05:47.560> stale<00:05:48.040> at<00:05:48.250> that<00:05:48.400> point<00:05:48.700> and

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
become pretty stale at that point and

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.140 
become pretty stale at that point and
the<00:05:49.510> Genesis<00:05:49.990> library<00:05:50.440> was<00:05:50.650> awesome<00:05:51.280> so<00:05:51.790> this

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
the Genesis library was awesome so this

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.690 
the Genesis library was awesome so this
game<00:05:52.390> is<00:05:52.420> a<00:05:52.600> statement<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.410> timely<00:05:54.220> statement

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
game is a statement a timely statement

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.640 
game is a statement a timely statement
that<00:05:54.850> says<00:05:55.060> look<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.510> Super<00:05:55.870> Nintendo<00:05:56.020> is

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
that says look the Super Nintendo is

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.820 
that says look the Super Nintendo is
going<00:05:57.340> to<00:05:57.790> be<00:05:57.910> super<00:05:58.320> it's<00:05:59.320> going<00:05:59.620> to<00:05:59.710> have
