00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
s3 up there and there's this breathe and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.590 
s3 up there and there's this breathe and
then<00:01:16.080> here's<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> spectre-3<00:01:17.479> remove<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
then here's the spectre-3 remove the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.230 
then here's the spectre-3 remove the
camera<00:01:18.930> from<00:01:18.960> its<00:01:19.290> back<00:01:19.500> box

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
camera from its back box

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.390 
camera from its back box
push<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.450> these<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:21.659> tabs<00:01:22.049> here<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.530> then

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
push it on these two tabs here and then

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:35.610 
push it on these two tabs here and then
you<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> pull<00:01:24.180> out

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620

our<00:03:50.570> two<00:03:50.720> primary<00:03:50.960> hard<00:03:51.470> drives<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:52.010> then<00:03:52.130> the

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
our two primary hard drives and then the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.220 
our two primary hard drives and then the
two<00:03:52.400> slave<00:03:52.730> drives<00:03:53.060> each<00:03:53.690> is<00:03:53.870> about<00:03:53.990> I<00:03:54.170> think

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
two slave drives each is about I think

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.350 
two slave drives each is about I think
250<00:03:55.070> gigs<00:03:55.340> for<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.150> total<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.600> terabyte<00:03:58.360> and

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
250 gigs for a total of a terabyte and

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.240 
250 gigs for a total of a terabyte and
here<00:03:59.840> I<00:03:59.870> think<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:00.350> can<00:04:00.380> connect<00:04:00.800> more<00:04:01.040> hard

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
here I think you can connect more hard

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.760 
here I think you can connect more hard
drives<00:04:01.490> or<00:04:01.670> something<00:04:01.940> like<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:03.470> here's

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
drives or something like that and here's

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.790 
drives or something like that and here's
where<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.010> CD<00:04:04.730> drive<00:04:04.970> goes<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.650> have<00:04:06.650> this

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
where the CD drive goes I have this

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.400 
where the CD drive goes I have this
plugged<00:04:07.190> into<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.520> CD<00:04:07.850> drive<00:04:08.320> materials<00:04:09.320> you

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
plugged into the CD drive materials you

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.949 
plugged into the CD drive materials you
have<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.530> cable<00:04:09.860> for<00:04:10.070> it<00:04:10.570> here's<00:04:11.570> your<00:04:11.720> video

a<00:04:14.750> way<00:04:14.990> to<00:04:15.050> maybe<00:04:15.560> take<00:04:15.980> two<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.220> these<00:04:16.400> and

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
a way to maybe take two of these and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.599 
a way to maybe take two of these and
make<00:04:17.720> 160<00:04:18.320> child

kind<00:04:30.110> of<00:04:30.139> stuff<00:04:30.259> so<00:04:30.379> it's<00:04:30.590> basically<00:04:30.889> like<00:04:31.009> a

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
kind of stuff so it's basically like a
