00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.960
 welcome to this new as antar and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.939
 they are finally formalized they are 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.160
 was waiting for here the remakes of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.579
 pokemon sapphire and ruby ​​named pokemon 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 alpha sapphire and ruby omega we do not 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.759
 can still say nothing about these games if 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.220
 it's just two things first 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.510
 the games are scheduled for November 2014 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.089
 in the whole world 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 and secondly heart and taste seem 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.949
 have a new shape can be a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.660
 mega evolution anecdote to the passage 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.730
 alpha and omega names were surely 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.729
 chosen because it was the basis of the names of 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.989
 code of sapphire and ruby in this new 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.790
 comments harry let's go too 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.260
 can you imagine what novelties we 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.510
 could see in these remakes of 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.170
 get busy ruby let's start 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.670
 right away number one the scenario the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.290
 trailer let think that the games 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 would have a different scenario of the games 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.130
 originals in the sense that it would be a 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.250
 new adventure 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.530
 a new story a sequel 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.420
 and well no satoru iwata president of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.850
 Nintendo confirmed that it was 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.170
 remakes 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.810
 so what can we say about 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.000
 scenario of course this will be a recovery this 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.680
 pokemon version 7 ferrer ruby ​​what is 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.120
 a bit of a shame since the proposed scenario 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.870
 by pokemon riot version were 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.060
 still music 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.650
 but well do not worry 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.070
 will surely resume pokemon stuff 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.230
 emerald 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.130
 we will surely have the combat zone of the 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.530
 third generation 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.940
 some non- relocating pokémons from 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.240
 emerald pokemon like marine 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.440
 finally azure they were catchable 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.990
 in emerald pokemon in the rhodes 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.190
 Serbian Highway 104 can also 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.260
 take over scenario elements 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.820
 unpublished in emerald pokemon like the 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.000
 attack of the mcma team in the center 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.380
 space of the acacia note that with these 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.680
 two logical we can look at juan in 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.390
 as tallano champion police but 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.400
 they are able to change slightly 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.049
 the main story since that laugh 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.460
 or whose new forms 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.530
 that's where the locals once again 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.509
 Japanese speak for us we can 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.299
 notice stop species over 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.989
 titles maybe the blue and red orbs 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.610
 but we notice that they have 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.769
 respectively the saint paul alpha and 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.180
 omega is it the same trees that 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.460
 allowed to calm pokemon 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.140
 legendary 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.520
 but with all the modifications that 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.450
 could bring to the scenario there is 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.580
 two things I want to see 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.740
 personally a fight that work there 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 against croutons 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.510
 and a rival work better since 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.980
 pokemon xd rules I feel that the worst 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.500
 rival of all time lies in the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.340
 no one from sanaa but they could 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.050
 make an effort to rework timmy 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.970
 number 2 of new mega evolution 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.640
 it's a golden opportunity to make 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.720
 new but a pokemon 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.330
 she will surely be introduced into 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.710
 history and like the meca evolution and 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.190
 of love between a trainer and his 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.860
 pokemon 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.840
 we can imagine that as in pokemon 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.400
 gold and glue d silver soulsilver the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.710
 first pokemon of our team we 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.970
 follow as our shadow 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.650
 in the meantime more info we are 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.170
 looking forward to seeing the prospective ones but 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.300
 catherine gaud and mecha lagoon but what 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.800
 that I would like most is a mecha 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.920
 metalos for the final fight against 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.570
 stephen i will get tired of the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.020
 mega to chromatic duty against but 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.500
 kkr dewar number 3 the return of 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.320
 contest 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.910
 I've never been a fan of competitions I 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.450
 I was having more fun with pokéathlon and 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.640
 poke boude 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.140
 but if he could make the competitions 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.540
 much higher as in the animate 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.910
 maybe I'll be interested in this 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.350
 is only a personal opinion 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.970
 number four the heroes one can 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.600
 expect to see price and flora with 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.460
 new clothes 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.710
 good this is not new but 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.610
 remember in gold pokemon and overflows 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.620
 silver soulsilver 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.260
 he had replaced crystal marina by 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.020
 his jackets to what did not please at all 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.700
 the world me it did not bother me but 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.100
 what would bother me is that he does 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.600
 the same thing with flora that does not 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.130
 will not annoy me to the point of not 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.010
 buy the game as the next smash 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.970
 bros fine there is no better everything but I 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.710
 would be very dissatisfied 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.480
 to get back to the clothes I 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.940
 I expect to see the personalization of 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.440
 clothes like time x and y is I am 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.420
 sure that in the lot we will be offered 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.340
 the clothes of his daughter ruby as well as 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.530
 marauding number 5 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.060
 a new coach is every remake of 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.500
 pokemon has brought a new neighborhood 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.510
 which has become a function of the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.950
 next nintendo wearable console in 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.470
 red fire is green leaf is l 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.610
 wireless adapter in gold propellants 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.220
 money this steve hours it was a 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.040
 pedometer putting sapphire alpha and rubio 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.780
 but what will it be like 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.250
 keep talking about it for a long time 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.020
 who could wait for us but for 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.910
 the moment we have nothing but we are 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.190
 happy the remakes of busy rubies 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.140
 are finally formalized and we will have them 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.729
 in just six months and we could 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.249
 to finish with the series of remakes of 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.049
 pokemon 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.399
 sorry you told me that you want to 

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:48.519
 pearl and diamond pokemon remakes 

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:50.139
 no but seriously to my eyes these are 

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:52.089
 undoubtedly the first games 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.099
 pokemon so successful mostly 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:56.259
 graphically speaking that a remake does 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.209
 would not be necessary then I do not want 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:01.089
 more see people ask remake of 

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:02.799
 pearls and diamonds never if they have a 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:05.229
 planet explodes on the other side of 

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:06.879
 the universe at best we can turn 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.519
 explore sino in the third 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:11.609
 extension of the 7th or even the eighth 

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.609
 generation 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.179
 we have to wait for the first 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.519
 images that will surely come from 

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:20.319
 next scan or 2 on 3 I invite you 

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:22.179

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.799
