loan straight away it just for the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.730 
loan straight away it just for the
simple<00:04:29.330> fact<00:04:29.389> that<00:04:29.750> he's<00:04:29.960> 16<00:04:30.349> years<00:04:30.379> of<00:04:30.620> age

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
simple fact that he's 16 years of age

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.589 
simple fact that he's 16 years of age
first<00:04:31.039> time<00:04:31.220> he<00:04:31.310> comes<00:04:31.490> back<00:04:31.639> he'll<00:04:31.849> be<00:04:31.879> 17<00:04:32.360> or

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
first time he comes back he'll be 17 or

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.719 
first time he comes back he'll be 17 or
18<00:04:32.960> not<00:04:33.259> too<00:04:33.409> sure<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.860> aging<00:04:34.159> system<00:04:34.520> works

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
18 not too sure the aging system works

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.330 
18 not too sure the aging system works
it's<00:04:35.479> kind<00:04:35.629> of<00:04:35.659> strange<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.199> there<00:04:36.379> but<00:04:37.009> anyway

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
it's kind of strange on there but anyway

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.559 
it's kind of strange on there but anyway
when<00:04:37.460> he<00:04:37.520> comes<00:04:37.669> back<00:04:37.819> to<00:04:37.939> be<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.060> high<00:04:38.210> overall

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
when he comes back to be a high overall

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.179 
when he comes back to be a high overall
so<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.110> might<00:04:39.259> as<00:04:39.319> well<00:04:39.409> obviously<00:04:39.650> stick<00:04:40.069> him

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:40.189 
so you might as well obviously stick him

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.070 
so you might as well obviously stick him

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
center backs to buy and I would

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.330 
center backs to buy and I would
recommend<00:05:23.360> company<00:05:24.169> overhauls<00:05:24.949> just<00:05:25.189> with

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
recommend company overhauls just with

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.939 
recommend company overhauls just with
simple<00:05:25.460> fat<00:05:25.789> he<00:05:25.939> does<00:05:26.090> live<00:05:26.270> 77<00:05:26.960> Sprint's

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
simple fat he does live 77 Sprint's

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.719 
simple fat he does live 77 Sprint's
teenage<00:05:28.460> strength<00:05:28.939> and<00:05:29.240> home<00:05:29.779> also<00:05:29.900> 66<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.889> 85

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.430 
teenage strength and home also 66 and 85
but<00:05:31.969> I<00:05:32.000> think<00:05:32.210> Hummels<00:05:32.539> overall<00:05:32.870> does<00:05:33.110> rise

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
but I think Hummels overall does rise

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.680 
but I think Hummels overall does rise
actually<00:05:33.979> in<00:05:34.279> the<00:05:34.669> future<00:05:34.819> but<00:05:35.180> I'll<00:05:35.539> have<00:05:35.659> to

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
actually in the future but I'll have to

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.839 
actually in the future but I'll have to
check<00:05:35.840> that<00:05:36.020> up<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.409> maybe<00:05:37.400> put<00:05:37.610> I<00:05:37.639> in<00:05:37.789> the

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
check that up and maybe put I in the

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.290 
check that up and maybe put I in the
scription<00:05:38.120> or<00:05:38.449> some<00:05:38.810> also<00:05:39.560> but<00:05:40.310> those<00:05:41.150> two

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
scription or some also but those two

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.700 
scription or some also but those two

they're<00:05:55.849> too<00:05:56.060> similar<00:05:56.300> players<00:05:56.629> because<00:05:56.900> they

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
they're too similar players because they

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.430 
they're too similar players because they
both<00:05:57.139> have<00:05:57.319> a<00:05:57.349> high<00:05:57.610> sprint<00:05:58.610> speed<00:05:59.169> so<00:06:00.169> it's<00:06:00.349> up

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
both have a high sprint speed so it's up

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.980 
both have a high sprint speed so it's up
to<00:06:00.469> you<00:06:00.650> who<00:06:00.740> you<00:06:00.830> want<00:06:00.979> to<00:06:01.009> buy<00:06:01.159> like<00:06:01.370> to<00:06:01.460> say

to you who you want to buy like to say

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.499 
to you who you want to buy like to say
he<00:06:02.990> hasn't<00:06:03.110> it's<00:06:03.319> a<00:06:03.759> acceleration<00:06:04.759> of<00:06:04.849> 91<00:06:05.330> and

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.670 
he hasn't it's a acceleration of 91 and
94<00:06:05.990> so<00:06:06.669> he's<00:06:07.669> a<00:06:07.699> 78<00:06:08.210> overall<00:06:08.629> and<00:06:08.870> he's<00:06:08.990> 81<00:06:09.379> so

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
94 so he's a 78 overall and he's 81 so

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.809 
94 so he's a 78 overall and he's 81 so

a
two<00:06:39.250> strikers<00:06:39.789> just<00:06:40.120> for<00:06:40.240> the<00:06:40.300> simple<00:06:40.539> fact

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
two strikers just for the simple fact
