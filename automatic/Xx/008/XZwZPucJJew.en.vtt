might actually be that salty but the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.890 
might actually be that salty but the
slope<00:02:24.600> will<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:25.140> make<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.190> crispy<00:02:26.900> now

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
slope will really make this crispy now

the other thing I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna<00:02:30.030> add<00:02:30.180> some<00:02:30.440> five-spice<00:02:32.300> which<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
gonna add some five-spice which is a

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:46.390 
gonna add some five-spice which is a
real<00:02:33.690> sort<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.020> Chinese<00:02:38.450> Chinese<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:41.150> mixture

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.300 

listen<00:02:47.480> it's<00:02:48.480> really<00:02:48.780> important<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.500> massage

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
listen it's really important to massage

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
this part of the process so five-spice

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:24.949 
this part of the process so five-spice
and<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.500> salt<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.819> then<00:03:09.049> boil<00:03:10.049> on<00:03:10.290> their<00:03:23.959> top
