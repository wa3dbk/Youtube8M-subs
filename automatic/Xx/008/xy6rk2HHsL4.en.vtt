disadvantages<00:00:57.600> compared<00:00:58.600> with<00:00:58.660> others<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.200> I

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
disadvantages compared with others so I

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.100 
disadvantages compared with others so I
went<00:00:59.950> was<00:01:00.100> bandolier<00:01:00.610> stopping<00:01:01.150> power<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.630> I

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
went was bandolier stopping power and I

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.280 
went was bandolier stopping power and I
think<00:01:02.920> deep<00:01:03.550> impact<00:01:03.880> with<00:01:04.210> this<00:01:04.360> class<00:01:04.629> the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
think deep impact with this class the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.190 
think deep impact with this class the
band<00:01:05.470> alia<00:01:05.740> was<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.210> him<00:01:07.359> provide<00:01:08.020> we

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
band alia was just to him provide we

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.709 
band alia was just to him provide we
made<00:01:08.530> with<00:01:08.679> more<00:01:08.890> animal<00:01:09.189> to<00:01:09.369> be<00:01:10.299> able<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.570> get

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
more kills the stopping power was

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.399 
more kills the stopping power was
obviously<00:01:12.789> for<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.240> added<00:01:13.479> Dumber<00:01:13.840> damage

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409

it's quite useful it'll it might get you

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.980 
it's quite useful it'll it might get you
just<00:02:12.730> one<00:02:12.910> kill<00:02:13.180> but<00:02:13.360> that's<00:02:13.540> one<00:02:13.720> kill

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
just one kill but that's one kill

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
so it is helpful at the end but

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.640 
so it is helpful at the end but
definitely<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.510> Phineas<00:02:20.170> Drake<00:02:20.379> is<00:02:20.469> going<00:02:20.590> to

I'll just I decided lock down the
three-story<00:03:40.989> building<00:03:41.349> on<00:03:41.439> crush<00:03:41.739> just

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729 
three-story building on crush just

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.479 
three-story building on crush just
because<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.569> is<00:03:44.139> a<00:03:44.169> high<00:03:44.530> traffic<00:03:44.799> area<00:03:45.099> at<00:03:45.400> the

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
because it is a high traffic area at the

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.050 
because it is a high traffic area at the
start<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.879> a<00:03:46.000> match<00:03:46.180> but<00:03:46.569> not<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:46.900> much<00:03:48.060> during

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
start of a match but not so much during

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.780 
start of a match but not so much during
the<00:03:49.209> match<00:03:49.419> really<00:03:49.780> but<00:03:50.169> you<00:03:50.259> can<00:03:50.530> oversee<00:03:51.220> and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
the match really but you can oversee and

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.849 
the match really but you can oversee and
you<00:03:51.879> can<00:03:52.060> look<00:03:52.180> over<00:03:52.329> be<00:03:52.599> so<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:52.930> can<00:03:53.019> protect

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
you can look over be so you can protect

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.530 
you can look over be so you can protect
both<00:03:54.310> flags<00:03:54.639> if<00:03:54.849> those<00:03:55.000> are<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.209> flags<00:03:55.419> that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
both flags if those are the flags that

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.770 
both flags if those are the flags that
you<00:03:55.629> choose<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.959> cap<00:03:56.699> now<00:03:57.699> the<00:03:58.239> three-story

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
you choose to cap now the three-story

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.770 
you choose to cap now the three-story
buildings<00:03:59.169> gives<00:03:59.409> you<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.889> high<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:01.569> height

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
buildings gives you a high the height

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.509 
buildings gives you a high the height
advantage<00:04:01.930> over<00:04:02.409> the<00:04:02.530> enemy<00:04:02.560> but<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.400> also

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
advantage over the enemy but it also

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.390 
advantage over the enemy but it also
gives<00:04:04.509> you<00:04:04.629> a<00:04:04.900> disadvantage<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:05.859> where<00:04:06.219> that

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
gives you a disadvantage and where that

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.449 
gives you a disadvantage and where that
if<00:04:06.579> you<00:04:06.729> haven't<00:04:06.939> got<00:04:07.180> claymores<00:04:07.629> on<00:04:08.099> you<00:04:09.099> will

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
if you haven't got claymores on you will

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.029 
if you haven't got claymores on you will
have<00:04:10.299> enemies<00:04:10.659> gone<00:04:10.959> both<00:04:11.409> up<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.680> stairs<00:04:11.919> and

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:12.039 
have enemies gone both up the stairs and

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.709 
have enemies gone both up the stairs and
up<00:04:12.219> the<00:04:12.340> ladders<00:04:12.669> so<00:04:13.030> that's<00:04:13.209> two<00:04:13.419> ways<00:04:13.599> you

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:13.719 
up the ladders so that's two ways you

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.990 
up the ladders so that's two ways you
have<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.930> protect<00:04:14.109> at<00:04:14.439> once<00:04:14.650> so<00:04:15.340> again<00:04:15.699> it's

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
have to protect at once so again it's

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.189 
have to protect at once so again it's
going<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.209> be<00:04:16.269> easier<00:04:16.419> if<00:04:16.630> you've<00:04:16.780> got<00:04:16.930> another

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
going to be easier if you've got another

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.909 
going to be easier if you've got another
party<00:04:18.090> before<00:04:19.090> yeah<00:04:19.269> player<00:04:19.810> present<00:04:20.259> but

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
party before yeah player present but

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.469 
party before yeah player present but
then<00:04:21.370> again<00:04:21.489> they're<00:04:22.000> gonna<00:04:22.180> steal<00:04:22.449> your

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
then again they're gonna steal your

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.800 
then again they're gonna steal your
kills<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.349> you<00:04:24.340> need<00:04:24.699> to<00:04:24.729> pay<00:04:24.940> all<00:04:25.000> these<00:04:25.270> these

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
kills so you need to pay all these these

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.210 
kills so you need to pay all these these
things<00:04:26.080> in<00:04:26.260> mind

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
things in mind

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.500 
things in mind
and<00:04:27.610> once<00:04:27.760> you've<00:04:27.880> got<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.120> balance<00:04:28.270> right

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
and once you've got the balance right

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.510 
and once you've got the balance right
you'll<00:04:29.500> be<00:04:29.560> able<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.860> get<00:04:29.950> a<00:04:29.980> kill<00:04:30.160> streak<00:04:30.280> like

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
you'll be able to get a kill streak like

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.750 
you'll be able to get a kill streak like
this<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:33.190> with<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.490> height<00:04:33.610> advantage

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
this that with the height advantage

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.050 
this that with the height advantage
you've<00:04:34.510> also<00:04:35.020> got<00:04:35.230> another<00:04:35.260> disadvantage

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
you've also got another disadvantage

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.280 
you've also got another disadvantage
once<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.180> kill<00:04:37.390> someone<00:04:37.600> they<00:04:37.810> will<00:04:37.990> watch<00:04:38.200> a

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
once you kill someone they will watch a

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.140 
once you kill someone they will watch a
kill<00:04:38.500> come<00:04:38.710> they'll<00:04:38.950> be<00:04:39.130> frustrated<00:04:39.910> and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
kill come they'll be frustrated and

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.120 
kill come they'll be frustrated and
they'll<00:04:40.630> throw<00:04:40.660> grenades<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.950> world

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
they'll throw grenades and the world

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.580 
they'll throw grenades and the world
just<00:04:42.310> rush<00:04:42.610> in<00:04:42.880> rush<00:04:43.180> in<00:04:43.420> Russia<00:04:43.660> here<00:04:43.930> so

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
just rush in rush in Russia here so

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.840 
just rush in rush in Russia here so
you're<00:04:44.890> going<00:04:44.980> to<00:04:45.040> be<00:04:45.130> on<00:04:45.250> that<00:04:45.400> extra

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
you're going to be on that extra

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.790 
you're going to be on that extra
pressure<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.450> staying<00:04:46.750> in<00:04:46.930> one<00:04:47.140> section<00:04:47.530> of

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
pressure and staying in one section of

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.320 
pressure and staying in one section of
the<00:04:47.920> map<00:04:48.070> for<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.310> entire<00:04:48.670> game<00:04:48.970> is

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
the map for the entire game is

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.300 
the map for the entire game is
definitely<00:04:50.790> dangerous<00:04:51.790> but<00:04:52.720> it<00:04:53.590> works<00:04:54.100> out

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
definitely dangerous but it works out

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.440 
definitely dangerous but it works out
sometimes<00:04:54.520> like<00:04:54.970> this<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.810> definitely<00:04:57.450> you

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
sometimes like this so definitely you

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.090 
sometimes like this so definitely you
also<00:04:58.660> want<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:58.990> make<00:04:59.140> sure<00:04:59.200> that<00:04:59.380> you<00:04:59.680> stay

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
also want to make sure that you stay

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.730 
also want to make sure that you stay
behind<00:05:00.340> cover<00:05:00.910> as<00:05:01.090> much<00:05:01.420> as<00:05:01.630> possible<00:05:01.780> you'll

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
behind cover as much as possible you'll

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.500 
behind cover as much as possible you'll
see<00:05:02.950> here<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.220> are<00:05:03.460> stay<00:05:03.730> behind<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.240> window

see here that are stay behind the window

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.510 
see here that are stay behind the window

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
my head a lot of the time because if

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.710 
my head a lot of the time because if
you've<00:05:12.040> got<00:05:12.550> mostly<00:05:12.820> body<00:05:13.090> hidden<00:05:13.390> in<00:05:13.630> the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
you've got mostly body hidden in the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.280 
you've got mostly body hidden in the
head<00:05:14.190> most<00:05:15.190> players<00:05:15.550> still<00:05:16.270> massive<00:05:16.660> TV<00:05:16.870> so

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
head most players still massive TV so

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.420 
head most players still massive TV so
there<00:05:17.410> probably<00:05:17.500> would<00:05:17.800> not<00:05:17.890> not<00:05:18.130> even<00:05:18.190> gonna

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
there probably would not not even gonna

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.070 
there probably would not not even gonna
see<00:05:18.640> your<00:05:18.790> head<00:05:18.910> but<00:05:19.270> if<00:05:19.360> they<00:05:19.510> do<00:05:19.660> they've<00:05:19.930> got

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
see your head but if they do they've got

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.400 
see your head but if they do they've got
a<00:05:20.110> hard<00:05:20.500> target<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:21.040> hit<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:22.330> Corey<00:05:23.169> players

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
a hard target a hit and Corey players

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.400 
a hard target a hit and Corey players
generally<00:05:23.680> don't<00:05:24.040> have<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.280> best<00:05:24.490> aim<00:05:25.410> you

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
generally don't have the best aim you

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.800 
generally don't have the best aim you
know<00:05:26.530> I<00:05:26.770> think<00:05:27.340> those<00:05:27.820> are<00:05:27.850> basically<00:05:28.510> the

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
know I think those are basically the

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.460 
know I think those are basically the
