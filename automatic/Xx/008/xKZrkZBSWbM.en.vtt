00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
make a paper boat and what we want to do

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.490 
make a paper boat and what we want to do
is<00:00:08.069> have<00:00:08.189> just<00:00:08.400> go<00:00:08.519> standard<00:00:09.120> a4<00:00:10.050> piece<00:00:10.320> of

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
is have just go standard a4 piece of

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.419 
is have just go standard a4 piece of
paper<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:12.799> obviously<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.950> bigger<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.280> piece

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
paper and obviously the bigger the piece

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.580 
paper and obviously the bigger the piece
of<00:00:14.610> paper<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.940> you've<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:16.199> bigger<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
of paper that you've got the bigger the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.050 
of paper that you've got the bigger the
bait<00:00:16.710> you'll<00:00:16.980> make<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.609> another<00:00:17.850> bad

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
bait you'll make but this is another bad

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.970 
bait you'll make but this is another bad
size<00:00:18.359> boat<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:20.070> fold<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.560> we've

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
size boat so we fold that the so we've

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.550 
size boat so we fold that the so we've
done<00:00:23.160> there<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:23.519> we've<00:00:23.640> gone<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.119> long

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
done there as we've gone the long

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.050 
done there as we've gone the long
longest<00:00:25.560> length<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.400> we've<00:00:26.609> thought<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
longest length and we've thought of the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.750 
longest length and we've thought of the
a4<00:00:27.390> paper<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.410> folded<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.039> however<00:00:29.460> once

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
a4 paper and we folded that however once

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.500 
a4 paper and we folded that however once
involved<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.689> half<00:00:31.309> and<00:00:32.309> we'll<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.329> this

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
involved that in half and we'll get this

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.060 
involved that in half and we'll get this
other<00:00:33.690> piece<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.380> other<00:00:34.500> side<00:00:34.800> now

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
other piece of that other side now

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.530 
other piece of that other side now
that's<00:00:35.280> become<00:00:35.610> your<00:00:35.760> longest<00:00:36.059> edge<00:00:36.239> there

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that's become your longest edge there

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.610 
that's become your longest edge there
and<00:00:36.750> fold<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.010> over<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.469> so<00:00:40.469> we've

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and fold that over like that so we've

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.490 
and fold that over like that so we've
folded<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.070> now<00:00:41.219> into<00:00:41.670> quarters<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.379> open<00:00:43.379> that

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
folded it now into quarters so open that

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.400 
folded it now into quarters so open that
back<00:00:43.680> up<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.820> we've<00:00:44.969> got<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.170> two

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
back up and so we've got the the two

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
back up and so we've got the the two
ends<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> front<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.120> get<00:00:48.300> one

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
ends there at the front and we get one

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.709 
ends there at the front and we get one
of<00:00:48.539> these<00:00:48.690> corners<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:50.239> we'll<00:00:51.239> fold<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
of these corners and we'll fold that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
of these corners and we'll fold that
over<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.620> lines<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.550> edge

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
over so it lines up there that edge

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.130 
over so it lines up there that edge
lines<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.449> Azim<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.989> you've

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
lines up with this Azim that you've

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.709 
lines up with this Azim that you've
already<00:00:58.320> folded<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.070> piece<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.430> paper

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
already folded in that piece of paper

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.209 
already folded in that piece of paper
turn<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> round<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.469> take<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.770> other<00:01:01.980> edge

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
turn it round and take that other edge

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.810 
turn it round and take that other edge
and<00:01:06.260> fold<00:01:07.260> along<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.740> edge<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.610> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and fold along that edge and see if it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
and fold along that edge and see if it
end<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> shape<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.110> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
end up with the shape like that and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.880 
end up with the shape like that and
you've<00:01:11.159> got<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:11.490> two<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:12.470> sheets<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
you've got your two little sheets at the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.280 
you've got your two little sheets at the
front<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.760> top<00:01:15.030> sheet<00:01:15.270> we'll<00:01:16.049> fold

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
front so with that top sheet we'll fold

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.030 
front so with that top sheet we'll fold
that<00:01:16.500> over

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that over

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.450 
that over
so<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.150> folding<00:01:18.570> along<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.020> edge<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.920> those

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
so it's folding along the edge of those

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.499 
so it's folding along the edge of those
two<00:01:20.729> triangles<00:01:21.330> yep<00:01:21.960> turn<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> over<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.509> we'll

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
two triangles yep turn it over and we'll

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.940 
two triangles yep turn it over and we'll
fold<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.020> back<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.759> same<00:01:27.030> spot<00:01:27.619> yep

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
fold that back the same spot yep

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.700 
fold that back the same spot yep
and<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> want<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> stop<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.530> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and if you want to stop there then that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.490 
and if you want to stop there then that
wood<00:01:31.860> becomes<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> paper<00:01:33.060> hat<00:01:33.380> but<00:01:34.380> we're

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
wood becomes like a paper hat but we're

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.840 
wood becomes like a paper hat but we're
not<00:01:34.590> gonna<00:01:34.740> stop<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.250> we're<00:01:35.430> gonna<00:01:35.549> keep

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
not gonna stop there we're gonna keep

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.600 
not gonna stop there we're gonna keep
going<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> boat<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.310> we'll<00:01:38.460> just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
going on to make a boat so we'll just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.730 
going on to make a boat so we'll just
push<00:01:38.790> those<00:01:39.060> two<00:01:39.509> ends<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
push those two ends in like that so the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.850 
push those two ends in like that so the
end<00:01:40.920> sort<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.220> touch<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.720> goes<00:01:42.930> under<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
end sort of touch so one goes under and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.819 
end sort of touch so one goes under and
one<00:01:44.040> goes<00:01:44.250> over<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.810> we'll<00:01:45.930> fold<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:46.530> so

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
one goes over and we'll fold it there so

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.190 
one goes over and we'll fold it there so
we've<00:01:46.979> become<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.540> well<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.659> either<00:01:48.780> square

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
we've become a well it's either square

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310 
we've become a well it's either square
or<00:01:49.549> it's<00:01:50.549> probably<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> diamond<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> me<00:01:51.420> now

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
or it's probably a diamond to me now

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.010 
or it's probably a diamond to me now
what<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.399> want<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.970> these<00:01:54.210> two<00:01:54.509> loose

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
what we want to do is these two loose

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.520 
what we want to do is these two loose
ends<00:01:55.290> will<00:01:56.189> fall<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.759> back

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.380 

like<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.830> so<00:02:03.040> it's<00:02:03.190> at<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.400> top<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.910> spin<00:02:04.300> it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
like that so it's at the top and spin it

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.859 
like that so it's at the top and spin it
over<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.230> along<00:02:05.800> that<00:02:06.010> center<00:02:06.310> edge<00:02:06.580> again

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.710 

yep<00:02:10.900> fold<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.410> back<00:02:11.560> up<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.920> top<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.420> we're

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
yep fold it back up the top and we're

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.110 
yep fold it back up the top and we're
left<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.350> sort<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:15.120> triangular

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
left with that sort of a triangular

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.890 
left with that sort of a triangular
shape<00:02:16.330> with<00:02:16.360> one<00:02:17.260> two<00:02:17.650> three<00:02:18.610> points<00:02:19.000> now<00:02:19.750> this

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
shape with one two three points now this

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.170 
shape with one two three points now this
is<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.170> tricky<00:02:20.470> bit<00:02:20.650> what<00:02:21.460> we<00:02:21.580> want<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.850> do<00:02:21.970> is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
is the tricky bit what we want to do is

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.020 
is the tricky bit what we want to do is
put<00:02:22.390> our<00:02:23.040> fingers<00:02:24.040> there<00:02:24.220> at<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> front<00:02:24.640> and

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
put our fingers there at the front and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.480 
put our fingers there at the front and
the<00:02:25.480> same<00:02:25.660> fingers<00:02:26.020> there<00:02:26.200> at<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.380> back<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
the same fingers there at the back and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.700 
the same fingers there at the back and
we<00:02:27.670> sort<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:27.970> pull<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.330> out<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:31.380> push<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.590> end

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
we sort of pull it out and push the end

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:42.800 
we sort of pull it out and push the end
down<00:02:33.010> like<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:36.810> yep<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:41.530> there<00:02:41.740> we<00:02:41.860> are

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
down like that yep and there we are

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.440 
down like that yep and there we are
we've<00:02:43.810> got<00:02:43.840> about<00:02:44.520> okay<00:02:45.520> let's<00:02:45.550> see<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.150> from

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
we've got about okay let's see that from

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.950 
we've got about okay let's see that from
another<00:02:46.720> angle<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:48.190> there's<00:02:48.610> our<00:02:48.960> triangle

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
another angle so there's our triangle

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.510 
another angle so there's our triangle
shape<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:50.350> we<00:02:50.440> look<00:02:50.620> underneath<00:02:50.950> we've<00:02:51.310> got

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
shape if we look underneath we've got

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.750 
shape if we look underneath we've got
this<00:02:52.500> sort<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.680> diamond<00:02:53.920> D<00:02:54.190> sort<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:54.550> shape

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
this sort of a diamond D sort of shape

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.960 
this sort of a diamond D sort of shape
hollow<00:02:55.060> diamond<00:02:55.330> shape<00:02:55.840> under<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.970> if

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
hollow diamond shape under that and if

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.850 
hollow diamond shape under that and if
we<00:02:58.060> look<00:02:58.240> from<00:02:58.420> there<00:02:58.660> then<00:02:59.050> we<00:02:59.080> start<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.590> pull

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
we look from there then we start to pull

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.800 
we look from there then we start to pull
these<00:03:00.070> two<00:03:00.400> edges<00:03:00.670> out<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.330> that

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
these two edges out like that

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.620 
these two edges out like that
yep<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.190> then<00:03:03.580> as<00:03:03.730> we<00:03:03.910> pull<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.300> out<00:03:04.420> we've<00:03:04.600> got

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
yep and then as we pull it out we've got

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.260 
yep and then as we pull it out we've got
to<00:03:04.930> sort<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.170> push<00:03:05.550> push<00:03:06.550> that<00:03:06.730> center<00:03:07.090> piece

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
to sort of push push that center piece

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.780 
to sort of push push that center piece
down<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.750> middle<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:10.410> yeah<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.860> that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
down the middle and yeah so that that

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.540 
down the middle and yeah so that that
diamond<00:03:13.239> shape<00:03:13.480> becomes<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.020> lot<00:03:14.170> less<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.709> the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
diamond shape becomes a lot less and the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.180 
diamond shape becomes a lot less and the
edges<00:03:15.850> go<00:03:16.060> up<00:03:16.180> around<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.720> make<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.110> sides<00:03:18.010> of

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
edges go up around to make the sides of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.820 
edges go up around to make the sides of
the<00:03:18.250> doulton<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:21.070> there's<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.400> type<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.090> water

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
the doulton and there's a type of water

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.470 
the doulton and there's a type of water
you<00:03:23.830> put<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:24.040> little<00:03:24.340> bit<00:03:24.550> on<00:03:24.820> top<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.270> tub

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
you put a little bit on top of the tub

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.360 
you put a little bit on top of the tub
of<00:03:25.600> water<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.730> there<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.060> floating
