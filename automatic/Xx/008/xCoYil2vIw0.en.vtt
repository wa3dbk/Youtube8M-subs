 microphone 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.929
 the upper part we have a speaker 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.409
 the bottom parts there are no connectors with 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.150
 special right side 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.450

 Chechen 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.500
 a key is recessed here 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.900
 volume control rocker 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.240
 the top is located 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.910
 she was beaten under a stub 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.570
 also find himself too 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.410
 three and a half meters expressed for 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.520

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.790
 headphone headset 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.500
 to connect 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.620
 charge device 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.880
 connector 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.650
 no left 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.950
 connectors and buttons except 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.200
 in order to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.450
 open the lid delivered 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.010
 on the back we have a module 5 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.260
 megapixel to measures flash 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.450
 and naturally 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.450
 metal rear cover 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.540
 the keys here are convex let's 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.490
 let's see how 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.260
 there is a set 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.420
 in the message 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.840
 attacker standard menu 7 n 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 and tried will dial 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 Well, so you can take 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.330
 relatively convenient 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.580
 from the fact that the keys rest 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.070
 well spaced out comfortable typing 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.530
 let's see what the minimum looks like 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.340
 means the menu 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 generally standard 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 in mid of earlier music players 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.899
 eg 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.899
 pulls down the player 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.379
 so the setting happens in general 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.499
 I understand what the player looks like 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.019
 denmark radio 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.209
 farther 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.279
 the player itself looks like this 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.279
 cameras 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.069
 joystick control 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.299
 left side minimum 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.769
 have we can choose 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.389
 various installations 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.569
 image quality resolution and so 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.029
 Further 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:54.049
 so go out 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.049
 without getting to the main screen 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:02:59.829
 can go back to the menu 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:00.979
 see which applications 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:02.359
 established 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.359
 in Kiev number and so on 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.259
 now see 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:09.959
 percentage of which switches with 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.030
 set lit it click 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.209
 left and right 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.119
 object hems 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.539
 metal cap 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.059
 so big is installed here 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.939
 battery 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.439
 in such a way we get the street 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.329
 we have 1200 communicator 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.469
 to managers 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.649
 here we have it 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.649
 SIM card slot 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.749
 and here is a little connector for 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.609
 on installation 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.829
 memory cards 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.789
 reverse action 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.909
 installing switch 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.909
 close the lid 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.609
 snaps into place 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.889
 no squeak currency 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.319
 the phone personally lies in hand 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.699
 compare 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.209
 with this version of phones 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 and it's about the same 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.169
 can also compare with the 58 norm 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.169
 we must of course telephone nevertheless 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.710
 in general phone 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:37.369
 methodical lesson
