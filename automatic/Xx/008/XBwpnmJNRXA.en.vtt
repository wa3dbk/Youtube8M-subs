00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:38.710
 hello everyone I bring a new video this 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.410
 video I want to tell you that I have not invented 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.400
 me who dresses a girl in her 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.610
 channel I'll leave your channel down there 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.600
 that you go to visit it and good it consists 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.220
 in making a design with sugar and salt 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.960
 she has sugar and salt I'm going to 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.710
 do with sugar because I liked it better 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.930
 how did she fit and well here I go to 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.629
 do I show the posts in 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.950
 rosita and it is the little thread that is there is the 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.010
 that the one who gave me and I say now 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.260
 it's time to 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.720
 to try the ones I had not tried 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.240
 and well she does the girl is that 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.530
 I 've told you what he does between humans and 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.810
 well as you know I have at the end very 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.610
 short cuts and I'm horrible 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.270
 I have to tell you that I'm recording 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.670
 from the east pileup that I did thanks 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.350
 to maite that did the support that 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.149
 taught and I copied and it 's the same and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.149
 I'm finally using it and I hope it gets 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.800
 see everything well I'm super happy and 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.670
 good start to 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.670
 and do it 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.950
 and the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:58.640
 do by myself in this part of here 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:02.650
 and of course you have to put glitter 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.650
 so that the sugar stays stuck 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.020
 or what to teach because like me that this 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.690
 I had not taught them to some I brought it 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.830
 I guess there's forgiveness for the sound I suppose 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.720
 that you would not either 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.230
 and I leave the channel for you to go there 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.380
 to see how it does not stain this a 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.440
 little but good 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.160
 now where we have thrown where we have 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.160
 applied the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.990
 the brillito 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.740
 immediately before it dries 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.740
 puts the sugar 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.410
 and when we have already put the sugar 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.940
 we started to press a little 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.940
 Let's ask for a bit of excess 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.530
 this music course I do not know if you forget 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.260
 well we go like this pressed all the time 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.260
 so that it does not fall 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.130
 we try that there are no empty gaps in 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.790
 sugar 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.410
 the fans according to how you want to do 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.620
 I think the girl does it with both 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.510
 with the output of sugar but I agree 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.210
 I know I saw it I liked it better 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.330
 sugar I do not know why I guess it's that 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.220
 maybe for a slow they are more 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.060
 thick I suppose those of sugar good I 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.060
 I saw that it felt more 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.569
 will not forgive the disaster but pulls everything 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.569
 Over there 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.079
 and good a lot of time ago with 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.640
 achieved because as I always slept 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.550
 immediately the voice you have noticed me 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.300
 surely 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.120
 and because today is almost ending in 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.360
 your studies I have to do the project 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.140
 and I'm still with the project my clear no 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.140
 I can not either 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.700
 sleep because I have to deliver them 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.700
 next month 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.050
 and well I think it's good 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.610
 it did not stick 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.610
 I put the flash to make it look 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.820
 I hope that you think it had been 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.730
 I cut the camera but I have a battery 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.330
 good that you think I like a 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.850
 mogollÃ³n how is the nail 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.290
 I have as little as it is that 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.830
 I do not look good she did 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.830
 in the entire nail 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.659
 because this was what I want to teach you 

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.500
 because the truth is that it seemed very 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.300
 curious 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.880
 and so he did 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.240
 because as I said leave the channel and 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.410
 so you can go see 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.410
 the design that she did
