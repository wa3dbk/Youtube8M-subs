00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello everyone and welcome to kitchen 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.059
 fast with these summer heats 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.680
 we need a little freshness on 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.030
 Granite and orange is the recipe 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.250
 today's direction the kitchen and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.369
 it's gone for the recipe 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.500
 we will need two glasses of water a 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.050
 glass of sugar semolina a glass of juice 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.919
 of orange that I just came from it's a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:37.400
 little bit of orange aromas 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:41.490
 we will put the water orange juice 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:45.810
 I'm going to put my sugar 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.790
 I'm going to mix and I'm going to put my 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.690
 art home 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.170
 so do not put that much 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.970
 scented enough and I'll wear in that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.680
 all at the boil for a minute 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.680
 for just dissolves the sugar 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.840
 I'm going to rid good syrup and a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 Once it's cold I'll put it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.030
 in the freezer for the whole night I 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.700
 pulled out my granite and freezer 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.890
 so I let it sit for ten 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.299
 minutes at room temperature and in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.170
 same time I put a drink at 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.829
 freezer so that it is cold 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.310
 so I'll start by scratching so 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.310
 my polish t 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.799
 so my drink and cold I'm going 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.070
 so be able to their worst then you go 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.110
 to be able to make granites with all the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.280
 citrus fruits of your choice 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.500
 so if you make a granite at 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.580
 lime do not put the csa 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.840
 inside it's going to distort the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.090
 lemon color so here I fill 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.500
 you can also put a small 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.220
 little seriousness if you make 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.590
 fruit salads 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.490
 it can be very interesting 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.490
 go to tasting 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.720
 very very good very very cool now 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.310
 it's up to you to play as for me it does not 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.630
 I have more than you will find a 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.630
 recipe even easier to 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.440
