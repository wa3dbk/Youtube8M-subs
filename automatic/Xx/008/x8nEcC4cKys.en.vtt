00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.930
 immediately after this and tell my 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.460
 assumptions what iphone 6 will be and what 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.120
 more popular notes are thinking about it 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.400
 apple 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.010
 one by one expressed their vision 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.380
 cigarette studio design and martin haek 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.290
 and haig is already known that once 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.840
 guess for 5 iphone series and studio 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.760
 secret assumptions are made 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.710
 mainly based on rumors and so 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.420
 at the moment there are 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.670
 Two concepts that I'm with you 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.010
 I will be pleased to present the proposal 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.560
 studios secret future ha watches lei 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.210
 current display size and upgrade 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.640
 will happen the whole body 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.800
 the front panel of the device should be 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.170
 keep your old look agro will not 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.989
 canted by analogy with the recent news 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.950
 ipad and thanks to this concept was 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.950
 named iphone 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.320
 and here is the presentation martin h I'm about 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.090
 what will be the next apple gadget 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.520
 different and you and studios 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.710
 the designer assumes that the future 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.360
 the smartphone will increase the display and in 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.700
 his concept he stretched it 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.490
 up to almost 5 inches diagonal and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.350
 besides the concept hayko is missing 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.659
 touch di on the front panel 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.850
 as well as the home button separate attention 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.539
 attracts and the back of this 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.450
 concept 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.990
 aluminum smooth and made in one 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.720
 color 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.030
 color is gold and what do you expect from 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.950
 iphone 6 which option attracts you 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.560
 write more about this comment 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.390
 and here we have already listened to two concepts and 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.390
 I suggest you go to the third 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.320
 and here is the third concept presented 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.930
 Italian designers and studies at 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.130
 solution design studio presented 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.200
 concept iphone 6 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.030
 He's on the idea of ​​the authors addition to 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.000
 fingerprint scanner tachadi 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.070
 will get a sensor for authentication 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.290
 user using the retina 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.850
 the scanner will be built into the camera 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.950
 located on the front 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.810
 enclosures above the display using 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.190
 unique scanner can not only 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.290
 unlock smartphone 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.330
 at a glance but make purchases 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.670
 applications and digital content in 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.890
 online stores log in to 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.560
 portals and services and make payment 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.930
 using bank cards, I note that this 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.420
 one of the most reliable to date 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.030
 We are interested in the day of data protection 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.610
 rosary eyes like i'm fingerprint 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.680
 unique and even fake it and cheat 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.870
 the scanner is much more difficult also 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.510
 conceptual iphone 6 is equipped 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.390
 huge edge-to-edge display of 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.770
 main stereo camera with flash 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.530
 my technical parameters are not 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.400
 clarified add that the concept is very 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.170
 futuristic 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.090
 and raving about it will delight us with something 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.490
 similar to the coming years 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.530
 but samsung as if by design 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.980
 add a retina scanner next 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.900
 flagship galaxy s5 which announcement is scheduled 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.120
 for the first half of next year 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.430
 it seems to me that it is time to finish with these 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.820
 concepts and express your point of view 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.750
 I am sure that the new iphone 6 will be 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:40.440
 enlarged display new design tachadi 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.410
 and maybe a retina scanner to everyone 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.810
 bye to my channel and good luck 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.530
 in thinking what will be next 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.530
