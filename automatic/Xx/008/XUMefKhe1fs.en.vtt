00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.700 
like buy snacks out of if they're on a
retailer<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.150> I've<00:01:06.240> used<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.570> quite<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.750> lot<00:01:06.840> my

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
retailer and I've used it quite a lot my

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.929 
retailer and I've used it quite a lot my
retail<00:01:07.950> apps<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.250> I've<00:01:08.310> never<00:01:08.430> used<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
residential lot and I guess that's

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.399

live<00:01:42.420> their<00:01:42.479> day-to-day<00:01:42.750> lives<00:01:42.960> might<00:01:43.470> be

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
live their day-to-day lives might be

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.560 
live their day-to-day lives might be
kind<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.829> boring<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> guys<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.390> much

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
kind of boring for you guys I have much

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
kind of boring for you guys I have much
to<00:01:45.600> say<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.369> interesting

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
to say and you know would be interesting

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.480 
to say and you know would be interesting
to<00:01:48.180> kind<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.689> mix<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> think<00:01:50.369> of

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
to kind of just mix it up and think of

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.120 
to kind of just mix it up and think of
some<00:01:50.640> storylines<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.110> play<00:01:52.619> out<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
some storylines that we can play out and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.569 
some storylines that we can play out and
I<00:01:53.460> thought<00:01:53.939> maybe<00:01:54.829> we<00:01:55.829> could<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.430> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
I thought maybe we could have it so that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.819 
I thought maybe we could have it so that
all<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> sims<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.110> come<00:01:58.259> live<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> dorm

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
all the sims that come live in the dorm

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.440 
all the sims that come live in the dorm
after<00:01:59.040> you've<00:01:59.189> made<00:01:59.310> all<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> sims<00:01:59.729> they<00:02:00.299> come

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
after you've made all the sims they come

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.840 
after you've made all the sims they come
live<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.780> dorm<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.350> each<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:02.219> has<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
live in the dorm and each one has to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.670 
live in the dorm and each one has to
like<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.420> don't<00:02:03.840> know<00:02:03.960> maybe<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680

if<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.230> film<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.860> I'm<00:02:23.190> definitely

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
if I film it on that I'm definitely

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
if I film it on that I'm definitely
gonna<00:02:24.180> lie<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:25.860> don't<00:02:26.340> know<00:02:26.430> I'm<00:02:26.700> interested

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
gonna lie it I don't know I'm interested

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.170 
gonna lie it I don't know I'm interested
to<00:02:27.630> see<00:02:27.930> what<00:02:28.200> could<00:02:28.380> actually<00:02:28.620> happen<00:02:29.180> if

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
to see what could actually happen if

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.000 
to see what could actually happen if
they<00:02:30.390> did<00:02:30.630> move<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.140> then<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.590> think<00:02:31.890> we<00:02:31.980> should

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
they did move in then I think we should

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.430 
they did move in then I think we should
have<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.730> each<00:02:32.940> sim<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.960> comes<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
have it so that each sim that comes to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.470 
have it so that each sim that comes to
live<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.800> each<00:02:34.980> each<00:02:35.730> time<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> new

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
live like each each time have a new

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.720 
live like each each time have a new
pupil<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.730> fifty-thousand-dollar

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
pupil it's like a fifty-thousand-dollar

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.660 
pupil it's like a fifty-thousand-dollar
tuition<00:02:39.600> for<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> whole<00:02:40.080> stay<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.460> means

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
tuition for the whole stay so that means

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.130 
tuition for the whole stay so that means
that<00:02:41.790> there'll<00:02:42.120> be<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.240> lot<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.450> money<00:02:42.570> just<00:02:42.990> in

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
that there'll be a lot of money just in

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.540 
that there'll be a lot of money just in
the<00:02:43.260> budget<00:02:43.620> obviously<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.130> won't<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.400> to

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
the budget obviously you won't have to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.640 
the budget obviously you won't have to
just<00:02:44.760> buy<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:44.940> when<00:02:45.180> RA<00:02:45.960> obviously<00:02:46.410> doesn't

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
just buy it when RA obviously doesn't

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.260 
just buy it when RA obviously doesn't

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
know about that um yeah so back to what

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.550 
know about that um yeah so back to what
we<00:03:35.520> would<00:03:35.640> do<00:03:35.760> i'm<00:03:36.120> actually<00:03:36.390> just<00:03:36.750> changing

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
we would do i'm actually just changing

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.410 
we would do i'm actually just changing
up<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.770> seats<00:03:38.010> around<00:03:38.520> here<00:03:39.000> because<00:03:39.270> i<00:03:39.300> think

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
up the seats around here because i think

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.930 
up the seats around here because i think
it<00:03:39.630> looks<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.840> bit<00:03:39.930> nicer<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.500> have<00:03:40.620> cut<00:03:41.610> cushy

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
it looks a bit nicer to have cut cushy

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.400 
it looks a bit nicer to have cut cushy
seats<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.540> obviously<00:03:42.810> when<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.020> walk<00:03:43.140> into<00:03:43.320> a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
seats and obviously when you walk into a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.410 
seats and obviously when you walk into a
dorm<00:03:43.650> building<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.100> usually<00:03:44.970> like<00:03:45.209> a

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
dorm building this usually like a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.590 
dorm building this usually like a
seating<00:03:45.870> area<00:03:45.989> or<00:03:46.320> lobby<00:03:46.560> area<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:48.060> would<00:03:48.239> make

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
seating area or lobby area it would make

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.320 
seating area or lobby area it would make
sense<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.989> have<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.290> desk<00:03:49.709> but<00:03:50.100> i'm<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.270> going

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.479 
sense to have a desk but i'm not going
to<00:03:51.780> put<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.380> desk<00:03:52.709> there<00:03:53.040> um<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:54.360> don't<00:03:55.200> know
