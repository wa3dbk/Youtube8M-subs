00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.240
 you can be 30 centimeters tall 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.489
 or even less and look at the world 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.710
 absolutely sure from top to bottom 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.040
 of one's condition as beings 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.070
 superiors and can be presumptuous 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.129
 proud and self- confident and turn out to be it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.589
 himself tremendously likeable 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.879
 it seems incredible but it can or at least 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.879
 he can 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.260
 the dachshund is the dog most 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.710
 curious and particular that nature is 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.050
 man have ever managed to produce it is 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.760
 a man on all fours or maybe a 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.650
 hound I saw the distorting mirror 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.050
 of a boat 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.270
 one thing is certain when it is encountered 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.270
 one is impossible to hold back a smile 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.730
 he certainly doesn't feel like a club with 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.000
 those paws reduced to minimum terms 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.620
 it moves as if the world belonged to it 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.050
 in his gaze is the pride of a 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.540
 dog who knows what he wants 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.760
 feels important is that it does not consider the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.030
 short stature a handicap but a 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.460
 great functional value is right 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.080
 if it were not a cap it could not 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.290
 do his job so well 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.880
 he knows it and boasts this seems to you 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.530
 a lawn with cut grass 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.320
 very low 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 mistake is a real junta in which we can 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.550
 disappear completely and this is one 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.320
 shoe or an impervious upright one 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.080
 dachshund puppy especially if of 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.209
 dwarf or cunningham dachshund really is 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.890
 small in the most literal sense of the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.540
 term 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.970
 the main problem is that of not 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.090
 to beat them luckily is a dog 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.290
 incredibly robust with excellent hardening 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.840
 the little road accident 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.209
 obviously unintentional will not take them away 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.600
 never a good mood to come back 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.600
 to the charge 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.150
 there are three different types of dachshunds 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.160
 there are also standard nano and cunningham 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.700
 three different types of short veil cloak 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.700
 long 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.260
 the dachshund and a tan dog or one 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.480
 heart of a lion willing to see its face 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.710
 face to face with fierce adversaries who 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.890
 often much larger 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.840
 in practice, never expect a dog 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.600
 quiet to park on the cushions 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.820
 he parked there is at most for 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.660
 five minutes unless there is 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.050
 something interesting on tv the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.280
 bassotto is a dog in constant motion 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.740
 will run and jump back and forth 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.770
 reaching unthinkable speeds for a 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.230
 low shot as he will also try 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.570
 climb harder will slip everywhere and 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.210
 challenging any attempt to limit them 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.730
 actions and will destroy systematically 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.530
 with great satisfaction any 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.730
 small object that he can 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.730
 represent a prey 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.510
 the dachshund is a hunter and must 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.190
 live as such 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.900
 obviously we are free of 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.640
 hate hunting but it's not fair 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.950
 distort character and attitudes 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.880
 of a dog to follow our ideals 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:47.270
 therefore a compromise must be found 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.100
 the dachshund has a strong character more 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.220
 strong perhaps than most 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.620
 humans when they don't want to do a thing for 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.780
 example going on a leash will resist 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.510
 by any means 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.120
 on the other hand when he wants something 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.820
 wants with fierce determination and does 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.190
 the impossible to achieve it can 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.380
 groped with sweet eyes that 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.110
 they do so particularly well 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.420
 that almost impossible to resist but can 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.660
 try also to use strong or 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.280
 resort to burglary 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.020
 the person of a certain age who does not go out 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.510
 almost never at home and who wants the 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.360
 couch puppy might think that 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.430
 the dachshund is perfect for her mistake 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.580
 a dachshund who does not exercise 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.840
 get fat and this harms the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.610
 his health 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.160
 besides it can become neurotic and 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.530
 biting because it accumulates stress and 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.280
 energies without ever getting in the way of 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.560
 vent the dachshund in short is a dog 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.450
 a thousand times in just a few 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.450
 seconds can be transformed by doctor 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.400
 jekyll and mister hyde and vice versa 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.270
 it is a world of pride of humor 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:01.460
 of courage and love is a world of 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.280
 elves and goblins seen from below 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.440
 but able to give us that atmosphere back 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.100
 potato and surreal that we thought we had 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.360
 lost 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.360
 along with fairy tales
