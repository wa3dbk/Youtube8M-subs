00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and it just went rag rag for me but

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.349 
and it just went rag rag for me but
that's<00:00:59.039> okay<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.399> mean<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.910> lot<00:01:00.210> more

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
that's okay I mean a lot more

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.650 
that's okay I mean a lot more
tournaments<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> come<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> hopefully<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.100> can

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
tournaments to come and hopefully we can

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.810 
tournaments to come and hopefully we can
multiply<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.260> few<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.769> times<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.280> think

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
multiply this a few more times I think

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
multiply this a few more times I think
that<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.090> said<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.810> fourth<00:01:07.220> WSOP

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that you said this is your fourth WSOP

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.130 
that you said this is your fourth WSOP
event<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:09.270> you've<00:01:09.390> entered<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.990> your

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
event that you've entered and your

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.109 
event that you've entered and your
second<00:01:10.470> cache<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.220> satellite<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.760> into<00:01:12.000> this

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
second cache you satellite it into this

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
second cache you satellite it into this
so<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.630> pretty<00:01:12.780> good<00:01:13.049> you're<00:01:13.320> rolling<00:01:13.920> on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
so it's pretty good you're rolling on

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.469 
so it's pretty good you're rolling on
fifty<00:01:14.310> percent<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:14.790> not<00:01:14.939> many<00:01:15.030> people<00:01:15.360> can

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
fifty percent there not many people can

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
fifty percent there not many people can
say<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.689> yeah<00:01:16.560> well<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.159> maintain

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
say that yeah well if I can maintain

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.100 
say that yeah well if I can maintain
fifty<00:01:18.030> percent<00:01:18.330> i<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.780> two<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.049> three

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
fifty percent i think in two or three

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.240 
fifty percent i think in two or three
years<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:19.740> you're<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> hear<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
years from now you're going to hear a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
years from now you're going to hear a
little<00:01:20.369> more<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:20.880> me<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.210> 50<00:01:22.080> per<00:01:22.170> cents<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
little more from me but 50 per cents a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.649 
little more from me but 50 per cents a
little<00:01:22.710> unrealistic<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
little unrealistic it's what you have to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.270 
little unrealistic it's what you have to
do<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.960> when<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.170> actually<00:01:25.200> get<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.890> ten<00:01:26.130> or

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
do is when you actually get in ten or

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.740 
do is when you actually get in ten or
fifteen<00:01:26.610> percent<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> cash<00:01:27.450> big

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
fifteen percent you have to cash big

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.899 
fifteen percent you have to cash big
like<00:01:28.020> I'll<00:01:28.470> take<00:01:28.680> forty<00:01:29.040> four<00:01:29.189> thousand<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
like I'll take forty four thousand and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.260 
like I'll take forty four thousand and
we're<00:01:30.780> off<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.110> tunica<00:01:31.700> perfect<00:01:32.700> well<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.119> will

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
we're off to tunica perfect well we will
