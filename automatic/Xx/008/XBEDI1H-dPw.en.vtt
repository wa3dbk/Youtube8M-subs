00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:25.130

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.949
 Yes 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:47.909

 First of all, the course is like this and it's a start 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:02.420
 It is rounding around, and it is landing two by landing 123 bullets . 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:08.540
 So it's right before this down 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.740
 There is a lot of coverage in the same newspaper, and it is small so it is full of course width. 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.170

 What is the red atomic tune, but it looks like you're looking around for a bit faster 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.480
 Because it was not 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:18.739
