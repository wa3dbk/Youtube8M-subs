you're gonna enter those last five

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.639 
you're gonna enter those last five
numbers<00:01:49.310> in<00:01:49.340> there<00:01:50.140> then<00:01:51.140> you're<00:01:51.289> gonna<00:01:51.410> write

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
numbers in there then you're gonna write

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.700 
numbers in there then you're gonna write
in<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:51.920> verification<00:01:52.310> code<00:01:53.410> so<00:01:54.410> you<00:01:54.470> just

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
in the verification code so you just

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.710 
in the verification code so you just
write<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.100> what's<00:01:55.340> shown<00:01:55.610> there<00:01:55.850> on<00:01:56.030> yours<00:01:56.300> and
