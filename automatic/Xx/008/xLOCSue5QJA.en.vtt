use<00:01:37.500> those<00:01:37.860> traps<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.549> these<00:01:38.880> straps<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.329> a

use those traps so these straps have a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.580 
use those traps so these straps have a

little bit of history behind them I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620 
little bit of history behind them I

traps<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.259> these<00:01:46.380> traps<00:01:46.710> were<00:01:46.890> pretty

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
traps now these traps were pretty

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
wide area if you were under the trap the

wide area if you were under the trap the
odds<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> escaping<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.590> time<00:01:55.890> were<00:01:56.250> slim

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
odds of you escaping in time were slim

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
odds of you escaping in time were slim
to<00:01:57.090> none<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.110> could<00:01:58.259> actually<00:01:58.380> use<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
to none and you could actually use it to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830 
to none and you could actually use it to
kill<00:01:59.310> people<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.909> grief<00:02:00.180> which<00:02:00.420> was<00:02:00.630> pretty

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
kill people in grief which was pretty

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.539 
kill people in grief which was pretty
interesting<00:02:01.290> I've<00:02:01.740> seen<00:02:02.009> some<00:02:02.189> excellent

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

grief together on mob of the dead

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.740 
grief together on mob of the dead
because<00:02:05.579> he<00:02:05.640> knows<00:02:05.969> how<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> use<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.600> gas

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
because he knows how to use the gas

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.630 
because he knows how to use the gas
tribe<00:02:07.140> strategically<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.190> could<00:02:08.340> also<00:02:08.459> get

tribe strategically it could also get

tribe strategically it could also get
pretty<00:02:08.849> interesting<00:02:09.239> because<00:02:09.360> when<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> pull

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
pretty interesting because when you pull

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.640 
pretty interesting because when you pull
the<00:02:10.050> chat<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.619> may<00:02:10.770> actually<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.160> you

the fourth greatest trap of all time has
to<00:02:18.970> be<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.780> five<00:02:20.340> electric<00:02:21.340> barriers<00:02:22.180> now

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
to be the five electric barriers now

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.089 
to be the five electric barriers now
here's<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.930> thing<00:02:23.140> about<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.439> five<00:02:23.650> electric

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
here's the thing about the five electric

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.740 
here's the thing about the five electric
barriers<00:02:24.519> they're<00:02:24.790> just<00:02:24.819> like<00:02:25.150> regular<00:02:25.329> old

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
barriers they're just like regular old

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.420 
barriers they're just like regular old
electric<00:02:26.230> barriers<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:26.769> fact<00:02:26.980> they<00:02:27.129> may<00:02:27.280> not

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
electric barriers in fact they may not

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.580 
electric barriers in fact they may not
even<00:02:27.610> be<00:02:27.760> as<00:02:28.030> effective<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.870> other<00:02:29.109> electric

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
even be as effective as other electric

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.720 
even be as effective as other electric
bear<00:02:29.739> guess<00:02:29.980> because<00:02:30.189> you<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.489> funnel

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
bear guess because you have to funnel

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.360 
bear guess because you have to funnel
the<00:02:30.970> zombies<00:02:31.629> into<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.290> metal<00:02:32.560> detectors<00:02:33.129> and

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the zombies into the metal detectors and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.920 
the zombies into the metal detectors and
they're<00:02:33.519> not<00:02:33.670> really<00:02:33.849> in<00:02:34.180> very<00:02:34.420> opportune

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
they're not really in very opportune

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.479 
they're not really in very opportune
locations<00:02:35.530> but<00:02:35.680> what<00:02:35.859> I<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.069> about<00:02:36.099> them<00:02:36.400> is

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
locations but what I like about them is

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.399 
locations but what I like about them is
the<00:02:36.609> fact<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:36.849> we<00:02:37.000> have<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.299> build<00:02:37.599> them<00:02:37.930> this

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
the fact that we have to build them this

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.259 
the fact that we have to build them this
is<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.859> first<00:02:39.129> time<00:02:39.400> we've<00:02:39.640> ever<00:02:39.879> seen<00:02:40.209> a

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
is the first time we've ever seen a

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.179 
is the first time we've ever seen a

buildable in zombies not many people
know<00:02:42.400> about<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.760> traps<00:02:42.970> because<00:02:43.390> they<00:02:43.599> don't

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
know about the traps because they don't

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.240 
know about the traps because they don't
know<00:02:43.930> where<00:02:44.109> the<00:02:44.260> parts<00:02:44.560> are<00:02:44.709> located<00:02:45.159> you

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
know where the parts are located you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.849 
know where the parts are located you
actually<00:02:45.700> have<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.120> grab<00:02:46.389> the<00:02:46.959> levers<00:02:47.349> there's

you put them on the trap you can

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.690 
you put them on the trap you can
activate<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.739> trap<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:53.980> use<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:54.489> kill
