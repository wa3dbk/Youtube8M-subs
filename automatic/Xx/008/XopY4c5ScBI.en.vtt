00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
and we see pc a 1001 here with the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.680 
and we see pc a 1001 here with the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.880 
windows seven multi-touch tablet USB
ports<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.259> side

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:14.890 
ports on the side

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.770 
ports on the side
nothing<00:00:15.700> on<00:00:15.820> another<00:00:16.030> side<00:00:16.300> nothing<00:00:16.660> on<00:00:16.750> the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
nothing on another side nothing on the

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.280 
nothing on another side nothing on the
bottom<00:00:17.490> power<00:00:18.490> button<00:00:18.940> microphone<00:00:19.540> and<00:00:19.810> so<00:00:20.020> on

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
bottom power button microphone and so on

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.950 
bottom power button microphone and so on
actually<00:00:20.770> we<00:00:20.890> have<00:00:21.100> a<00:00:21.420> Primus<00:00:22.420> pen<00:00:22.630> here<00:00:22.930> I

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
actually we have a Primus pen here I

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.340 
actually we have a Primus pen here I
believe<00:00:23.200> so<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:25.090> this<00:00:25.390> is<00:00:25.420> actually<00:00:25.869> quite

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
believe so so this is actually quite

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.870 
believe so so this is actually quite
different<00:00:27.010> than<00:00:27.100> others<00:00:27.400> because<00:00:27.520> this<00:00:27.760> is

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
different than others because this is

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.050 
different than others because this is
capacitive<00:00:28.420> screen<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:30.310> this<00:00:30.490> kind<00:00:30.820> of<00:00:30.880> some

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
capacitive screen with this kind of some

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.290 
capacitive screen with this kind of some
kind<00:00:31.180> of<00:00:31.300> capacitive<00:00:32.400> stylus<00:00:33.400> I<00:00:33.940> don't<00:00:34.150> know

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
kind of capacitive stylus I don't know

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.340 
kind of capacitive stylus I don't know
but<00:00:34.600> it's<00:00:35.530> good<00:00:35.710> to<00:00:35.829> have<00:00:35.890> options<00:00:36.130> so<00:00:37.350> Intel

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
but it's good to have options so Intel

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.330 
but it's good to have options so Intel
in<00:00:39.840> 455<00:00:41.760> cpu<00:00:42.760> on<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.060> tablet<00:00:43.510> so<00:00:44.100> that's<00:00:45.100> a

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
in 455 cpu on the tablet so that's a

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.319 
in 455 cpu on the tablet so that's a
pool<00:00:45.970> of<00:00:46.000> available<00:00:46.270> options<00:00:47.020> for<00:00:47.340> TPS<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.760> 3g

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
pool of available options for TPS and 3g

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.229 
pool of available options for TPS and 3g
too<00:00:49.629> so<00:00:49.930> that's<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.379> nice<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.100> see<00:00:51.280> but<00:00:51.520> doesn't

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
too so that's a nice to see but doesn't

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.819 
too so that's a nice to see but doesn't
all<00:00:52.390> they<00:00:52.570> have<00:00:52.719> plenty<00:00:53.079> of<00:00:53.170> other<00:00:53.379> tablets

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
all they have plenty of other tablets

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.040 
all they have plenty of other tablets
too<00:00:53.980> so<00:00:54.250> this<00:00:54.519> is<00:00:54.730> another<00:00:55.269> version<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.840> it

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
too so this is another version of it

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.299 
too so this is another version of it
again<00:00:56.820> small<00:00:57.820> differences<00:00:58.480> but<00:00:58.780> still<00:00:59.309> some

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
again small differences but still some

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.280 
again small differences but still some
there<00:01:00.340> is<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.760> ethernet<00:01:01.629> at<00:01:01.870> least

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
there is a ethernet at least

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.560 
there is a ethernet at least
that<00:01:03.890> really<00:01:04.220> looks<00:01:04.340> the<00:01:04.700> same<00:01:04.879> but<00:01:04.940> it<00:01:05.390> has<00:01:05.540> a

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
that really looks the same but it has a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.630 
that really looks the same but it has a
as<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.050> different<00:01:06.560> feeling<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:06.980> math<00:01:07.190> feeling

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
as a different feeling and math feeling

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.800 
as a different feeling and math feeling
on<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.970> on<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.570> device<00:01:09.140> oh<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.890> eca

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
on the on the device oh this is the eca

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.870 
on the on the device oh this is the eca
1001<00:01:11.810> H<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:14.650> there<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:15.860> have<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.100> specs<00:01:16.580> 10

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
1001 H so there you have the specs 10

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.100 
1001 H so there you have the specs 10
inch<00:01:17.060> screen<00:01:18.700> 1024<00:01:19.700> x<00:01:19.970> 600<00:01:20.480> and<00:01:20.810> then<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.050> next

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
inch screen 1024 x 600 and then the next

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.219 
inch screen 1024 x 600 and then the next
one<00:01:21.760> smaller<00:01:22.760> one<00:01:23.030> with<00:01:23.240> Android<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:25.190> think

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
one smaller one with Android and I think

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.350 
one smaller one with Android and I think
we<00:01:27.229> have<00:01:27.260> a<00:01:27.470> buck<00:01:27.740> back<00:01:28.220> button<00:01:28.640> here<00:01:28.940> menu

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
we have a buck back button here menu

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.200 
we have a buck back button here menu
