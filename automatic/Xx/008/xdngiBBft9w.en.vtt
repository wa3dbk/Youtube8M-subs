00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.980
 For four years there is the skoda yeti 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.050
 so far he has over 260,000 times 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.450
 sold now gets the first one 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.280
 generation rather first facelift the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.760
 It will easily become two 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.680
 versions give the important thing for a button 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.660
 here in the offroad variant is this 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.000
 if you press it all systems are 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.160
 set off-road and we go 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.029
 now into the terrain and test something 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.029
 yeti where can 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.210
 first task the water passage no 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.219
 problem for the yeti with a 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.829
 Ground clearance of 18 and one 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.839
 Water depth of 30 cm are also 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.379
 mature swallows do not sit 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.379
 obstacle 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.870
 we test the strongest diesel of the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 engine range of the two-liter tdi is with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.879
 permanent four- wheel drive and six-speed 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.500
 dsg gear equipped and makes 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.899
 125 kw 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.810
 he reaches his top speed 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.909
 at 197 km / h and consumes loud 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.909
 manufacturer 63 liters 100 kilometers 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.340
 In this country suv mostly stay on the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.110
 the road is the more amazing you are 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.490
 true can if you go into the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.159
 terrain allows slopes of 60% 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.320
 masters the yeti up is the 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.030
 Offroad mode activates the car 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.770
 without the driver in 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.080
 stepping down the slope 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.310
 just direct and if necessary 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.310
 He has to slow down a bit himself 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.110
 who can often be on slopes 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.110
 request a supporting mountain 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.509
 so much for the offroad variant because there is 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:05.789
 yes, finally, a second im 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:07.500
 bunde yeti city calls itself the chic one 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.679
 City variant with the kind of 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.250
 painted fingernails city mountains 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.250
 work gloves comes 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.740
 most striking difference at the front 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.400
 is the honeycomb structure of the lower one 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.400
 air intake 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.310
 and where the outdoor model with at the rear 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.800
 Plastic robust demonstrates demonstrates 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.400
 this version also from the back 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.400
 elegant side 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.550
 our customers prefer partly the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.580
 Elegant sees the variant and the same 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.260
 There are customers prefer the more robust 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.730
 Variant the yeti author 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
 Technically, both variants are the same 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.240
 we have the same engines and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.530
 gearboxes and they are equally tall 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.180
 there are no differences 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.100
 we assume that the city 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.320
 Variation will be slightly more popular 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.720
 About 60 percent will be the city 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.730
 choose variant 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.530
 we are moving to the city version and 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.040
 promote the smallest petrol with 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.040
 drove down 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.660
 it is switched over a manual 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.930
 six speed transmission 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.700
 but it also gives him the ride with dsg 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.500
 with the yeti in the offroad is railing 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.050
 really impressed what the dare then 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.599
 in hengen is now performing in the city 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.489
 version on the way equipped with the 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.230
 smallest and most economical engine in 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.330
 Unfortunately, there is no off this model 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.519
 road button that is the model you 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.160
 really hung up on the city of the 77th 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.110
 kw strong 1.2 liter gasoline should be 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.130
 on average with six liters on 100 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.110
 kilometers are enough 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.590
 our model with medium equipment 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.410
 costs in Germany just under 21,800 euros 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.900
 in the basic version is the smallest 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.660
 yetis city gasoline but already for under 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.269
 19,000 euros available and that's exactly what 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.400
 the recipe of success with him to one 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.040
 comparatively cheap price gets 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.640
 a practical suv with lots of space 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.640
 and good technology 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.510
 new is the holder of the safety vests 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.359
 among the seats is the yeti 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.220
 as the first skoda model optional with 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.220
 equipped with a rear view camera 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.170
 the back seat is spacious and exists 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.170
 from three sitting alone 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.539
 in the luggage compartment provide various nets 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.210
 and keep systems for order and 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.460
 cleanliness a simple attack and the 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.060
 middle seat will be with the armrest 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.060
 drinks holders 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.349
 that was my yeti adventure for houses 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.970
 I drove both 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.610
 technically they differ yes 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.229
 not so doll but outwardly and there must 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.750
 i like the offroad 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.220
 Variation a tick better 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.169
 Price does not make it so big 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.190
 difference about 200 euros in the 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.349
 base model 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.699
 I would say that to myself 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.699
 offroad variant can
