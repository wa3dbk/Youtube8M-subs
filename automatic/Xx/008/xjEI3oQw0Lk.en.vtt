00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.570
 we 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.830
 a fan to go 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 after the great success that ninja had 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.039
 gaiden fronts together soft convinced to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.480
 techno that he made a version of 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.579
 ninja gaiden for your console the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.430
 legendary and xinjiang best known in 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.899
 these lands like turbo graphics 16 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.949
 curiously this game pictures few of 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.170
 homex that were made in that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.640
 generation since at that time it was 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.960
 normal that when a game was multi 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.000
 console will finish completely 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.440
 different you just have to see the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 different than gailland line in is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.110
 compared to the master system by 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.110
 put an example 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 stories 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.950
 everything starts when you abuse online 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.540
 descendant of the dragon clan and a 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.880
 letter where his father tells him he's going in 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.409
 way to his last duel in that letter to 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.689
 his father tells him that in case his 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.250
 destiny be not return take the legendary 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.830
 sword of the dragon and go to visit the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.630
 archaeologist xvi he lives in america and there 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.000
 you will find answers of his death and 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.259
 As the search progresses the river goes 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.939
 giving account of his father a new 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.100
 killed by a simple project 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.990
 cantina no no no was not killed by 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.579
 try to have a mysterious group that 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.200
 tries to seize the territory of 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.200
 Ancient ruins in the Amazon 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.580
 and the play 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.260
 the example of this game contains 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.150
 values ​​and frame blades completely 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.620
 new so certain brincos the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.060
 parks will not be able to measure them 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.800
 so that the lens so 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.840
 adapt to the new obligor will carry 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.940
 some time in that deliver accounts 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.330
 with different abilities since giving a 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.890
 mighty saber scalar walls throwing 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.830
 stars made with toys and joy 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.690
 throwing Australian stars attack in 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.600
 the air with double saber launch a 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.880
 little game that also cover you with balls 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.800
 fireballs 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.420
 the bosses in this installment also suffer 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.100
 some change of values ​​so it is 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.290
 possible that certain tactics are no longer 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.300
 as effective as the version of nes if 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.300
 you will no longer be able to kill heads of 3 blows 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.380
 graphics and music the quality of the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.910
 graphics is quite good levels 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.340
 are detailed in such a way 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.750
 that feels novel, it should be mentioned 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.100
 that despite looking good there are some 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.050
 scenarios that gave such a change 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.450
 they were trying to sponsor the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.950
 Ghostbusters as we can see by 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.540
 true the only thing that did not change 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.670
 unfortunate techno were the parties 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.980
 castros as and extreme and not bad with the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.420
 that counts this game we have them 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.980
 displays were the things that most 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.540
 they recorded from outside make since the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.480
 animations are better defined 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.670
 have more frame rate and have more 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.590
 colour 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.450
 where is the game that there is terribly 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.040
 it's the musical question because if 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.660
 we compare with the version of nes that 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.400
 has one of the best are three that 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.540
 have done in video games 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.700
 this game contains a soundtrack 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.930
 pretty monotonous and empty 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.930
 check the difference 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.920
 i 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.110
 do not 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.550
 one 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.550
 woman 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.350
 conclusion 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.960
 to be able to see our 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.700
 dear river and the beautiful in the I do 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.620
 that it's worth getting this remedy 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.150
 currently it is only possible to get them 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.190
 by ebay or buying the game by the 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.050
 Japanese Virtual Console uy know each other 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.060
 for the stupid regionalization of 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.500
 nintendo consoles if anyone knows 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.390

 amaze the fans of the version of 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.540
 because although the values ​​and the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.680
 music are somewhat different the details 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.170
 in the gameplay scenario are 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.400
 quite acceptable you have to accept it 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.200
 then it's not as legendary as the 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.970
 better but currently this legacy 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.950
