00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
changed in the last oh let's say

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.920 
changed in the last oh let's say
conservatively<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:14.180> 250,000<00:03:15.180> years<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.780> why

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
conservatively a 250,000 years so why

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.450 
conservatively a 250,000 years so why
don't<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.200> have<00:03:16.410> cell<00:03:16.650> phones<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.070> satellite

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460
