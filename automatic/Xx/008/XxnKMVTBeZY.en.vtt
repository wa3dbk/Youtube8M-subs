00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.480
 as much as for all boys 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.639
 finally we island mister frank e 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.929
 this is the black ops 3 trailer for 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.549
 copyright reasons as they have 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 used a very popular song 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.750
 certainly covered by copyright that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.609
 careful black of rolling stones 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 we decided not to show you how 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.789
 usual the trailer here but we have 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 loaded both facebook and on dailymotion 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.170
 however you will find every link for the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.519
 viewing of the trailer in Italian in 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.619
 descriptions so maybe you go to 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.850
 see what then come back here to see 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.270
 trailer analysis 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.879
 so much for a confirmed start 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.820
 in short, a futuristic setting with 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.879
 these advanced evolved soldiers who have 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.370
 presumably these literally 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.559
 arms and legs implanted by new ones 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.539
 so they are not just exoskeletons 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.660
 let's say as we saw on advanced 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.579
 adword stops right arms and limbs 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.350
 in short, genetically modified in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.399
 these images we can see how it is 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.930
 can shoot even underwater and that 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.040
 arms as you see that you change 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.500
 precisely because they manage to change 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.610
 form and become in turn in the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.960
 turrets 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 then we have the control and that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.210
 what looks like a swarm in short 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.560
 reduced version and therefore probably 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 it could also be one of the past 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.860
 tricks present in the multiplayer return 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.110
 even the knife and other weapons that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.180
 has probably already seen in other calls 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.860
 of duty so it seems the k 12 must 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.829
 advanced warfare or even a hood 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.049
 simple 47 to note the boys the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.170
 movement system this skill 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.159
 there will definitely be superhuman 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.350
 possibility to have gods 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.810
 equally superhuman movements such as 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.360
 this means that it will be a call 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.100
 of duty more or less similar advanced 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.280
 warfare in the sense that there will be this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.729
 component of jumps just ran up 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.500
 double jump buildings anyway jump 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.890
 much higher and bus both in the air and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.110
 then 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.370
 even on the ground with this sort of 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.960
 slipped and even if what it is 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.420
 interesting to say that the movement 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.700
 it does not seem that of the vans 2 still 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.510
 it seems more than titan fall thing 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.980
 which among other things also the same 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.860
 trier developers who said 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.700
 in short, I have been inspired by it 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.989
 inspired by your titan folk and advanced 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.000
 warfare and I must say you see with these 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.980
 movements will be practicing impossible 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.090
 to lower ourselves and it will be useless to lower 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.860
 the weapon in the sense that any 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.330
 movement you will do, you will always have it 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.670
 same full control of the weapon 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.680
 so double jump you can shoot 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.170
 underwater you can shoot a slip 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.180
 shoot you can do anything for 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.670
 shoot while you do anything 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.610
 so a trailer that actually doesn't 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.850
 reveals more than many things but precisely 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.950
 it thickens especially related to the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.660
 as for the campaign 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.480
 dante for multiplayer calls 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.950
 we will have to wait also come 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.739
 dispelled doubts regarding the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.620
 availability of the beta on the various 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.630
 console as it comes explicitly 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.329
 said it will be available for both 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.240
 playstation 4 that xbox one is for PC but 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:17.140
 is thus confirmed 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.500
 exclusivity we say on the consoles next 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.620
 January 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.780
 but now cures in short not the old gen 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.910
 so there will be no playstation 3 e 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.050
 not even on xbox 360 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.990
 at the end of the teaser is shown a 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.590
 small fragment of zombies but really 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:40.030
 a 22 second video of practically that 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.740
 from which little is clearly shown 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.000
 reservations have been opened by 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.290
 now you can book both online from 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.650
 sites like amazon or others that obviously 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.750
 in physical beta sales outlets that do not 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.790
 we still know when it will be available but 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.770
 we know that during los angeles e3 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.110
 a build will be available to play 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.070
 so even the dance tour will state 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.810
 available only from colony onwards 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.010
 in this case we will have the availability 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:15.010
 to play with it since June for those who will be a 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.570
 los angeles and for everyone else 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.950
 in short, there won't be but I think there is 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.170
 it will be a way of instead of seeing videos 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.940
 of gameplay but I think that precisely for 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.800
 that date will have already been revealed 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.490
 also something about the 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.350
 multiplayer 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.650
 anyway this was all for this 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.020
 analysis let us know your opinions 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.170
 below in the comments and I would like to say 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.680
 know what you think if you are happy 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:41.500
 whether or not this tell me they 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.390
 proposed this new title then a 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.110
 greeting from mister frank and see you with 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.110
 an upcoming video
