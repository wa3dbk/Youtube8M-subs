hear it catch on and catch off it's a
little<00:01:29.350> bit<00:01:29.620> slower<00:01:29.890> than<00:01:29.950> nikon's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
little bit slower than nikon's

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.780 
little bit slower than nikon's
but<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:31.240> does<00:01:31.420> work<00:01:31.690> very<00:01:32.140> well<00:01:32.260> um

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
but it does work very well um

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.140 
but it does work very well um
they<00:01:34.420> say<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.720> kind<00:01:34.960> that's<00:01:35.350> camera<00:01:35.740> oh<00:01:36.150> we

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
they say the kind that's camera oh we

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.170 
they say the kind that's camera oh we
got<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.690> know<00:01:38.080> basic<00:01:38.560> switches<00:01:38.920> auto<00:01:39.790> focus

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
got you know basic switches auto focus

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.680 
got you know basic switches auto focus
and<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.560> OS<00:01:41.860> um<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:43.030> dose<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.360> manual

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
and the OS um this dose of a manual

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.560 
and the OS um this dose of a manual
override<00:01:43.930> give<00:01:44.530> them<00:01:44.650> when<00:01:44.800> you're<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:45.570> auto

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
override give them when you're in auto

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.800 
override give them when you're in auto
focus<00:01:46.960> does<00:01:47.320> work<00:01:47.560> like<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:48.120> lock<00:01:49.120> switch<00:01:49.270> it

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
focus does work like that lock switch it

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.120 
focus does work like that lock switch it
does<00:01:50.050> actually<00:01:50.320> come<00:01:50.590> in<00:01:50.680> handy<00:01:50.920> when<00:01:51.040> you

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
does actually come in handy when you

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
does actually come in handy when you
first<00:01:51.340> get<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:52.240> um<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:54.340> quite<00:01:54.820> tight

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
first get it it's um it's quite tight

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.570 
first get it it's um it's quite tight
but<00:01:56.140> I've<00:01:56.229> had<00:01:56.380> this<00:01:56.470> for<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.710> couple<00:01:57.250> months

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
but I've had this for a couple months

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.820 
but I've had this for a couple months
now<00:01:57.760> and<00:01:58.120> it's<00:01:58.810> loosened<00:01:59.260> up<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.440> little<00:01:59.470> bit

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
now and it's loosened up a little bit

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.820 
now and it's loosened up a little bit
and<00:02:00.610> when<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.479> pull<00:02:01.720> it<00:02:01.810> out<00:02:01.870> of<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.080> bag<00:02:02.229> I'd

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
and when I pull it out of the bag I'd

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.969 
and when I pull it out of the bag I'd
like<00:02:03.010> to<00:02:03.160> have<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.490> switch<00:02:03.790> because<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.240> will

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
like to have that switch because it will

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.560 
like to have that switch because it will
slide<00:02:05.979> off<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:06.430> I've<00:02:06.940> heard<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.180> lot<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.360> people

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
slide off so I've heard a lot of people

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.090 
slide off so I've heard a lot of people
saying<00:02:07.750> however<00:02:07.900> it's<00:02:08.140> really<00:02:08.470> stiff<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:08.950> does

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
saying however it's really stiff it does

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.699 
saying however it's really stiff it does
loosen<00:02:09.459> up<00:02:09.580> quite<00:02:09.940> nicely

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.270
