00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.320 

in<00:00:00.829> this<00:00:01.829> lesson<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.429> want<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.700> discuss<00:00:03.090> the

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
in this lesson I want to discuss the

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.170 
in this lesson I want to discuss the
veins<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.200> upper<00:00:04.770> extremity<00:00:05.609> now<00:00:05.879> this

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
veins of the upper extremity now this

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.210 
veins of the upper extremity now this
can<00:00:06.359> be<00:00:06.450> quite<00:00:06.600> difficult<00:00:06.960> for<00:00:07.379> most<00:00:07.560> anatomy

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
can be quite difficult for most anatomy

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.680 
can be quite difficult for most anatomy
and<00:00:08.340> physiology<00:00:08.429> students<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
and physiology students of the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.589 
and physiology students of the
introductory<00:00:10.050> level<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.820> if<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:11.940> color<00:00:12.240> code

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
introductory level and if we color code

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.780 
introductory level and if we color code
it<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.929> makes<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.349> lot<00:00:13.590> easier<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:14.250> see<00:00:14.519> now

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
it it makes it a lot easier to see now

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.040 
it it makes it a lot easier to see now
with<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> iPad<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.199> 1<00:00:16.590> 2<00:00:16.920> 3<00:00:16.949> 4<00:00:17.789> 5<00:00:18.180> 6<00:00:18.600> 7

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
with the iPad I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.150 
with the iPad I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
colors<00:00:19.939> we<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.270> more<00:00:22.109> veins<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:22.859> really

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
colors we have more veins and we really

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.019 
colors we have more veins and we really
need<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.269> color<00:00:24.600> 4<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.849> it<00:00:26.849> will

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
need that we have color 4 so it will

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.019 
need that we have color 4 so it will
take<00:00:27.330> us<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.720> little<00:00:27.960> bit<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.650> effort<00:00:29.340> try<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
take us a little bit of effort try to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.049 
take us a little bit of effort try to
get<00:00:30.300> some<00:00:30.630> things<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.460> will<00:00:32.940> begin

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
get some things on here now I will begin

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.049 
get some things on here now I will begin
with<00:00:33.480> blue<00:00:34.309> as<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.520> come<00:00:35.730> off<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
with blue as we come off the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.889 
with blue as we come off the
brachiocephalic<00:00:36.829> vein<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:38.730> form<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
brachiocephalic vein we form a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.930 
brachiocephalic vein we form a
subclavian<00:00:40.680> vein<00:00:41.219> I'm<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> draw<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
subclavian vein I'm going to draw the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.990 
subclavian vein I'm going to draw the
subclavian<00:00:42.840> vein<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.559> now<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> subclavian

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
subclavian vein in now the subclavian

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.299 
subclavian vein in now the subclavian
vein<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:45.989> come<00:00:46.200> all<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> way<00:00:46.530> down<00:00:46.860> into<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
vein will come all the way down into the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.720 
vein will come all the way down into the
axilla<00:00:48.500> where<00:00:49.500> I'm<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.920> stop<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.460> there

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
axilla where I'm going to stop it there

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.150 
axilla where I'm going to stop it there
and<00:00:51.180> I'm<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> become<00:00:52.079> another<00:00:52.770> vein

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and I'm going to become another vein

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
and I'm going to become another vein
it's<00:00:53.489> gonna<00:00:53.670> take<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> change<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.539> name<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it's gonna take a change in name the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.369 
it's gonna take a change in name the
axillary<00:00:55.920> vein<00:00:56.360> now<00:00:57.360> we'll<00:00:57.660> stop<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.170> with

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
axillary vein now we'll stop there with

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.720 
axillary vein now we'll stop there with
axillary<00:00:58.890> vein<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.260> coming<00:01:01.260> off<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
axillary vein and coming off of

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.390 
axillary vein and coming off of
subclavian<00:01:02.730> red<00:01:03.359> I'm<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> draw<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.830> vein

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
subclavian red I'm going to draw a vein

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.429 
subclavian red I'm going to draw a vein
called<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> cephalic<00:01:06.240> vein<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
called the cephalic vein now the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.320 
called the cephalic vein now the
cephalic<00:01:07.860> vein<00:01:08.220> will<00:01:08.460> come<00:01:08.670> off<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> little

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
cephalic vein will come off a little

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600 
cephalic vein will come off a little
higher<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.290> we're<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> take<00:01:11.280> him

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
higher up and we're going to take him

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.719 
higher up and we're going to take him
all<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:11.970> way<00:01:12.570> down<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.860> arm<00:01:15.110> now<00:01:16.549> that<00:01:17.549> will

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
all the way down the arm now that will

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.760 
all the way down the arm now that will
be<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.090> easy<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.780> us<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:19.140> once<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.560> come

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
be pretty easy for us now once we come

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.590 
be pretty easy for us now once we come
off<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.009> axillary<00:01:20.820> vein<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
off the axillary vein we have a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.010 
off the axillary vein we have a
bifurcation<00:01:22.340> now<00:01:23.340> I'm<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> use<00:01:24.509> purple

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
bifurcation now I'm going to use purple

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.219 
bifurcation now I'm going to use purple
and<00:01:25.530> I'm<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> come<00:01:26.759> off<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.420> basilic

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and I'm going to come off with a basilic

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.399 
and I'm going to come off with a basilic
vein<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:29.070> gonna<00:01:29.369> stay<00:01:29.820> mostly<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:31.200> on

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
vein it's gonna stay mostly a here on

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.080 
vein it's gonna stay mostly a here on
the<00:01:31.590> medial<00:01:32.100> side<00:01:32.750> now<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.409> far<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.759> good

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the medial side now so far so good

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.620 
the medial side now so far so good
now<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.409> bifurcation<00:01:37.759> of<00:01:38.759> where<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
now at the bifurcation of where the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.010 
now at the bifurcation of where the
axillary<00:01:40.200> vein<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.770> green<00:01:41.869> become<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
axillary vein and green become the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.399 
axillary vein and green become the
basilic<00:01:43.680> I'm<00:01:43.950> gonna<00:01:44.520> form<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.420> blood<00:01:45.659> vessel<00:01:45.899> in

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
basilic I'm gonna form a blood vessel in

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
basilic I'm gonna form a blood vessel in
orange<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:47.700> gonna<00:01:47.880> draw<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.360> orange<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
orange I'm gonna draw it in orange and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.859 
orange I'm gonna draw it in orange and
this<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.200> brachial<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.939> that's<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.750> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
this is brachial so that's kind of go in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.300 
this is brachial so that's kind of go in
here<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.790> accentuate<00:01:53.790> these<00:01:54.240> vessels<00:01:55.310> so

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
here and accentuate these vessels so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.429 
here and accentuate these vessels so
that<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.759> see<00:01:57.329> them<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:58.020> more

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that we can see them a little more

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.050 
that we can see them a little more
clearly<00:01:59.130> and<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.649> axillary<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
clearly and so here is axillary and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:13.420 
clearly and so here is axillary and
green<00:02:06.439> subclavian<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.829> blue<00:02:10.580> and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
green subclavian and blue and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.759 
green subclavian and blue and
we<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:14.090> cephalic<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:18.650> red

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
we have cephalic in red

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.780 
we have cephalic in red
now<00:02:22.659> so<00:02:23.659> far<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.290> good<00:02:24.500> not<00:02:24.799> bad<00:02:25.069> at<00:02:25.310> all

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
now so far so good not bad at all

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
now so far so good not bad at all
now<00:02:26.510> what<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.349> want<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.650> do<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.519> when<00:02:29.329> we<00:02:29.510> came

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
now what we want to do is when we came

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.679 
now what we want to do is when we came
off<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.530> produce<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.250> brachial<00:02:31.760> vein<00:02:31.790> off<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
off to produce the brachial vein off the

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.720 
off to produce the brachial vein off the
bifurcation<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.709> axillary<00:02:34.340> where<00:02:34.640> we

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
bifurcation of the axillary where we

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.940 
bifurcation of the axillary where we
came<00:02:34.939> to<00:02:35.150> silat<00:02:35.540> more<00:02:35.720> medial<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.379> then<00:02:36.739> in

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
came to silat more medial and then in

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.280 
came to silat more medial and then in
midline<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.459> brachial<00:02:38.180> vein<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.870> that's<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
midline the brachial vein and that's the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.160 
midline the brachial vein and that's the
orange<00:02:39.709> one<00:02:39.920> we're<00:02:40.670> then<00:02:41.060> going<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.629> bifurcate

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
orange one we're then going to bifurcate

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.460 
orange one we're then going to bifurcate
this<00:02:42.620> guy<00:02:42.859> now<00:02:43.579> in<00:02:43.970> this<00:02:44.299> case<00:02:44.599> I<00:02:44.840> usually<00:02:45.290> like

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
this guy now in this case I usually like

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.129 
this guy now in this case I usually like
to<00:02:45.590> use<00:02:45.650> at<00:02:46.010> least<00:02:46.069> two<00:02:46.340> colors<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.180> blue<00:02:47.420> but

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
to use at least two colors of blue but

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.839 
to use at least two colors of blue but
we're<00:02:48.290> going<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.769> use<00:02:48.980> blue<00:02:49.400> again

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
we're going to have to use blue again

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.849 
we're going to have to use blue again
because<00:02:50.299> we<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.659> limitation<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:51.440> can't<00:02:51.680> use

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
because we have a limitation I can't use

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.770 
because we have a limitation I can't use
black<00:02:52.280> because<00:02:53.030> black<00:02:53.060> won't<00:02:53.540> show<00:02:53.750> up

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
black because black won't show up

against this guy but we're going to

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.599 
against this guy but we're going to
branch<00:02:56.090> off<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.829> we're<00:02:57.980> gonna<00:02:58.069> have<00:02:58.430> one

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
branch off and we're gonna have one

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.649 
branch off and we're gonna have one
owner<00:03:01.609> vein<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:03.909> then<00:03:04.909> the<00:03:05.030> other<00:03:05.299> one

go<00:03:44.569> through<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.340> cephalic<00:03:46.340> vein<00:03:46.879> to<00:03:47.780> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
go through the cephalic vein to the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.189 
go through the cephalic vein to the
basilic<00:03:48.590> vein<00:03:48.620> right<00:03:49.400> across<00:03:49.669> my<00:03:50.030> elbow<00:03:50.629> here

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
basilic vein right across my elbow here

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.830 
basilic vein right across my elbow here
and<00:03:51.379> I'm<00:03:51.859> gonna<00:03:52.069> become<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:53.379> median<00:03:54.430> cubital

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
and I'm gonna become the median cubital

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.039 
and I'm gonna become the median cubital
vein<00:03:58.299> median<00:03:59.299> cubital<00:03:59.979> and<00:04:01.419> this<00:04:02.419> is<00:04:02.659> about<00:04:02.870> as

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
vein median cubital and this is about as

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.140 
vein median cubital and this is about as
clear<00:04:03.379> as<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.680> can<00:04:03.859> draw<00:04:04.099> on<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.370> iPad<00:04:04.879> but<00:04:05.090> I

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
clear as I can draw on the iPad but I

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.030 
clear as I can draw on the iPad but I
hope<00:04:05.389> this<00:04:05.659> helps<00:04:06.079> you<00:04:06.139> guys<00:04:06.349> and<00:04:06.650> seeing
