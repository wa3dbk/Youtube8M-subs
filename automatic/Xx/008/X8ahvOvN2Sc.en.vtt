00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello guys 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.599
 Welcome to another video of the world of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.620
 Electrical this video or run away rather 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.360
 time electricity 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.250
 although in the end everything is 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.289
 related to the same theme that I 'm going 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 talk a little about saving water and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.029
 the work that has been done here in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.890
 institution that is work is where I 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.600
 I give my electricity classes 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 work has been done here in relation to 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.349
 water saving is done collecting 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.809
 rainwater in the gutters here 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.930
 building was then installed these two 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.329
 water boxes of one of 6 and another of 500 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 lines totaling 1,500 liters 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.760
 people can capture and to this building 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.850
 It's Freddy country that we're here. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.010
 this ensures considerable savings 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.140
 of water from the moment that people 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.870
 is using all this water to do 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.570
 the whole cleaning party is for me passion 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.350
 to be able to clean the bathrooms to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 download 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.430
 we have achieved an economy 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.619
 considerably save water 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.020
 it is also a species 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.390
 with saving of electric energy that we 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.000
 our entire energy matrix accounts for 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 based on the rivers a good part of it is 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.460
 based on laughs more than 70% there then the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.860
 people have a reservoir with the level 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.590
 down it is very bad for our our 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.540
 electricity system also does not think 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.210
 It's worth it to make an effort 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.030
 and with regard to the economy no longer people 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
 here is a process or a paw 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.990
 adaptation yet because this is what the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.880
 people did as test for the first 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.320
 waters for the first rains 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.360
 we will build a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.820
 structure to be able to 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.340
 these boxes and also expand this 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.369
 capture system and it is for this box 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.590
 out of 500 we made a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.390
 a tap to be able to be washed tug 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.880
 on the top of the building and this other 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.390
 the box we have a system with a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.460
 and there is all this height that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.909
 ensures adequate pressure to make 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.999
 the washing 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:09.420
 our active there working girls 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:09.420
 in monica save water from amazon 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.739
 Thank God 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.099
 then with this capture system 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.480
 water, we can guarantee a good 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.480
 water saving 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.580
 then what will benefit us all 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.000
 we have strength that has to be collective is 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.629
 done by everyone there, so we do not die 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.280
 no water 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.160
 another measure that was also taken 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.620
 with respect to water saving was the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.810
 reduction of the level in the discharge boxes 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.890
 so when do we say box lid 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.910
 discharge 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.560
 You'll see that we 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.319
 regulated supports the water is well below that it is 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.359
 here would be the maximum water level or 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.349
 with only one adjustment that in the float 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.799
 of the water tank 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.590
 we save practically one 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.750
 liter free half of water is like bathroom 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.480
 is most commonly used to urinate 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.500
 then only the water flow is already 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.420
 enough 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.609
 and then we have a saving title in 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.299
 first in approximately every 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.769
 discharge of this box is what the environment is like 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.620
 school of a very high turnover 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.930
 then each escape a pint and a half does 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.120
 a big difference 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.769
 still in relation to the personal toilets 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.870
 another economy that was made 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.180
 change was made was the exchange for 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.400
 put a pressure record on the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.519
 expression regions in the urinal 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.500
 ensures that the water that is used 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.700
 at least it has a return spring 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.310
 so when you press 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.799
 she does not spill water in the past 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.470
 was that record system then 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.260
 sometimes I have registered 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.959
 person forgets the open scheme is this 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.209
 caused a large amount of water 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.480
 which is dispensed daily so a 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.760
 Another measure was the exchange of 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.709
 of victories the record of pressure that 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.200
 it was not usual in all bathrooms 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.740
 between us made the exchange of us all 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.930
 taps and urinals 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.530
 we put this faucet down and the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.720
 even with the taps 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.060
 washbasins exchange was not performed 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.090
 taps from the washbasins to the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.010
 faucet pressure is also a fashion 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.380
 return water then 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.840
 does not run the risk of leaving this water 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.910
 been switched on all the time so that was a 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.650
 another measure that was taken with respect to 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.720
 water saving 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.940
 then personal attitudes were 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.920
 taken here at school, among others 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.360
 things will change all the 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.010
 faucet to decrease the 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.740
 tap constraints 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.750
 So that's what you got there. It's an activity. 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.330
 very nice and also made a 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.220
 table that is filled daily with 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.980
 the water reading is a water reading 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.350
 here it is done every day for the 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.610
 our own control and awareness 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.800
 So when you see that one day 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.290
 spent more water we try to decrease 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.640
 the other day to make up and do 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.550
 that economy 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.980
 our goal was at least 30% we have 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.140
 achieved here in school an economy 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.600
 approximately 35 percent and in the 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.700
 last 12 months we started doing 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.470
 this work does not have a whole 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.450
 issue of awareness has also been 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.840
 some that we work within the 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.250
 and in each class are the people 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.350
 work council 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.440
 we bring the chart make a dash 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.330
 The graph of water consumption is there to 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.580
 also be able to bring knowledge and 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.740
 make a separate awareness so that 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.660
 this is also passed on within 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.010
 home for each student 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.930
 So this is a job that the school 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.730
 is doing here that I think is 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.550
 very positive it's worth the people 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:44.360
 think of this term or the economy of 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.800
 water to be a future thing and to be 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.800
 a constant thing 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.750
 so I think it's a very 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.030
 valid then I think it is worth us 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.980
 home think of us is a video one 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.930
 little out of electricity 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.520
 ok but I think there is a concentration that 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.720
 We have a home, and when people 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.250
 saves water 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.740
 we are also preserving the 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.670
 our hydroelectric plants and this 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.650
 it is a kind of economy 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.270
 since the end of the day is because this 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.890
 people greatly lowered the level of 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.080
 reservoir electric power will stay 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.700
 increasingly expensive and will get more and more 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.950
 more complicated 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.850
 then the tip and the staff of the world 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.770
 electric is not 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.170
 the attitudes that we put into 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.970
 practice here at school in social action 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.960
 that is an organization that does not 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.000
 governmental 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.190
 the school depends on the help of the students 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.040
 for all courses that are free 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.810
 The student pays nothing to keep the 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.990
 school working this kind of attitude 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.900
 water saving is not an economic 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.460
 that too right here helps keep 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.470
 school running 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.750
 not only for the maintenance of the school but 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.060
 maintenance of all of our 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.970
 net ecology all our system i that 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.330
 we depend on changing fast video gives a 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.860
 to enjoy with sharing fosters is who 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.810
 to leave in comments 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.340
 other tips for saving water 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.090
 people can even implement in the 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.310
 school 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.990
 It's worth dropping and then we're going 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.390
 working on it and much 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.570
 Thank you guys and until the next video 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.570
 there
