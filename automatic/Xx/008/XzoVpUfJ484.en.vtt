boom<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.399> they<00:00:53.789> had<00:00:53.940> another<00:00:54.590> one<00:00:55.590> before<00:00:55.770> see

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
if they say we strike oil and so I'm

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.299 
if they say we strike oil and so I'm
assuming<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.730> gonna<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.600> third

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
assuming that's gonna be the third

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.850 
assuming that's gonna be the third
resource<00:01:02.420> kind<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.870> clash<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> clans

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
resource kind of like in clash of clans

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
resource kind of like in clash of clans
that<00:01:05.070> had<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.309> dark<00:01:05.549> elixir<00:01:06.049> that's<00:01:07.049> like

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that had like dark elixir that's like

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
that had like dark elixir that's like
that<00:01:07.320> third<00:01:07.530> resource<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.460> had<00:01:08.640> so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that third resource that they had so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.940 
that third resource that they had so
we're<00:01:09.570> gonna<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.869> oil<00:01:10.170> apparently<00:01:10.650> which

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
we're gonna have oil apparently which

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.399 
we're gonna have oil apparently which
makes<00:01:11.189> sense

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
makes sense

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
makes sense
let's<00:01:13.409> see<00:01:13.650> people<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.189> saying<00:01:14.729> Gatling<00:01:15.509> gun

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I thought was get lingo might see it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.010 
I thought was get lingo might see it
because<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> look<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.960> like

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
because if you look right here it's like

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.719 
because if you look right here it's like
a<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.409> tripod<00:01:19.830> thing<00:01:20.040> kind<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.400> holding

a little a tripod thing kind of holding

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.090 
a little a tripod thing kind of holding
it<00:01:20.850> up

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
it up

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.399 
it up
it<00:01:23.100> says<00:01:23.280> rapid<00:01:24.000> fire<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:25.229> know<00:01:25.320> if

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it says rapid fire so I don't know if

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.690 
it says rapid fire so I don't know if
it's<00:01:25.500> gonna<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.680> similar<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.400> heavy

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
it's gonna be similar to like a heavy

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.600 
it's gonna be similar to like a heavy
and<00:01:26.850> boom<00:01:27.119> beach<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.369> where<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.460> has

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.749 
that before the generals are currently
like<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.530> wonder<00:01:44.220> how<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.640> gonna

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
like that so I wonder how this is gonna

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.569 
like that so I wonder how this is gonna
work<00:01:45.000> because<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.829> don't<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.340> gonna<00:01:47.460> be

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
work because I don't think it's gonna be

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.429 
work because I don't think it's gonna be
high<00:01:47.759> attack<00:01:48.090> low<00:01:48.630> health<00:01:48.930> because<00:01:49.409> we

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
high attack low health because we

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.850 
high attack low health because we
already<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> ballista<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> I

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
already have a ballista for that I

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.050 
already have a ballista for that I
really<00:01:52.860> wonder<00:01:53.070> what<00:01:53.159> its<00:01:53.310> gonna<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.490> because

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
really wonder what its gonna be because

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
really wonder what its gonna be because
I<00:01:54.329> feel<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.409> already<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.860> many<00:01:55.950> kind

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I feel like we already have so many kind

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.310 
I feel like we already have so many kind
of<00:01:56.310> troop<00:01:56.490> combinations<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.810> lot<00:01:58.200> of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
of troop combinations or like a lot of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.660 
of troop combinations or like a lot of
troops<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.740> kind<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.040> taking<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.520> don't

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
troops are kind of taking so I don't

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.100 
troops are kind of taking so I don't
know<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.939> gonna<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> unique<00:02:00.479> one<00:02:00.960> or

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
know this is gonna be a unique one or

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.950 
know this is gonna be a unique one or
not<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.939> gonna<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.210> somewhat

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
not and so this is gonna be somewhat

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
not and so this is gonna be somewhat
interesting<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.590> wonder<00:02:04.860> if<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> Industrial

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
