similar thing but there's no way to be

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.190 
similar thing but there's no way to be

avoid<00:02:20.500> offending<00:02:20.709> anybody<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.910> seems

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
avoid offending anybody and it seems

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.789 
avoid offending anybody and it seems
like<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.269> pretty<00:02:22.450> good<00:02:22.660> change<00:02:22.989> before<00:02:23.530> we

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
like a pretty good change before we

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.199

religious<00:05:00.110> concerns<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:04.130> final<00:05:04.460> controversy

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
religious concerns the final controversy

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.730 
religious concerns the final controversy
in<00:05:05.180> this<00:05:05.330> video<00:05:05.660> is<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:05.930> change<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.530> Fire

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
in this video is to change the Fire

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.310 
in this video is to change the Fire
Temple<00:05:06.770> theme<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.580> operate<00:05:07.970> out<00:05:08.090> of<00:05:08.120> time<00:05:08.360> the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
Temple theme and operate out of time the

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.690 
Temple theme and operate out of time the
reason<00:05:09.620> for<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.830> change<00:05:09.860> is<00:05:10.280> because<00:05:10.580> the

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
reason for the change is because the

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.430 
reason for the change is because the
theme<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.090> temple<00:05:11.390> featured<00:05:11.690> a<00:05:11.780> sample<00:05:12.229> of<00:05:12.320> an

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
theme the temple featured a sample of an

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.650 
theme the temple featured a sample of an
Islamic<00:05:12.590> prayer<00:05:13.070> in<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.250> background<00:05:13.700> this<00:05:14.419> to

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
Islamic prayer in the background this to

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.420 
Islamic prayer in the background this to
me<00:05:14.840> is<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.110> most<00:05:15.380> interesting<00:05:15.680> adjustment<00:05:16.370> to

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
me is the most interesting adjustment to

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.090 
me is the most interesting adjustment to
the<00:05:16.460> game<00:05:16.669> for<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:16.970> variety<00:05:17.150> of<00:05:17.360> reasons<00:05:17.450> mostly

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
the game for a variety of reasons mostly

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.620 
the game for a variety of reasons mostly
as<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.160> kid<00:05:19.669> growing<00:05:19.940> up<00:05:20.030> with<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.300> cartridge

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
as a kid growing up with the cartridge

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.510 
as a kid growing up with the cartridge
that<00:05:20.660> had<00:05:20.990> this<00:05:21.169> I<00:05:21.350> was<00:05:21.560> genuinely<00:05:21.950> creeped

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
that had this I was genuinely creeped

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.490 
that had this I was genuinely creeped
out<00:05:22.669> by<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:22.910> chanting<00:05:23.330> in<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.450> background<00:05:23.960> it

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
out by the chanting in the background it

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.560 
out by the chanting in the background it
added<00:05:24.740> such<00:05:25.040> an<00:05:25.160> ominous<00:05:25.700> feel<00:05:25.970> of<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.210> temple

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
added such an ominous feel of the temple

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.409 
added such an ominous feel of the temple
and<00:05:26.720> really<00:05:27.110> made<00:05:27.290> the<00:05:27.410> game<00:05:27.560> more<00:05:27.620> engaging

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
and really made the game more engaging

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.430 
and really made the game more engaging
unfortunately<00:05:29.419> like<00:05:29.810> most<00:05:29.990> of<00:05:30.200> the<00:05:30.290> changes

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
unfortunately like most of the changes

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.469 
unfortunately like most of the changes
