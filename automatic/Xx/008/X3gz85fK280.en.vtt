Cream<00:00:10.260> Sandwich<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.860> let's<00:00:11.099> build<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
Cream Sandwich so let's build the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.759

platform<00:00:11.730> no<00:00:12.660> word<00:00:12.809> yet<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:12.990> exactly<00:00:13.170> who's

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
platform no word yet on exactly who's

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.530 
platform no word yet on exactly who's
going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.009> get<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.280> but<00:00:14.460> most<00:00:14.790> likely<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.120> CDMA

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
going to get it but most likely a CDMA

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.960 
going to get it but most likely a CDMA
care<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.109> whether<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.500> Sprint<00:00:17.310> Verizon<00:00:17.369> or

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
care so whether it be Sprint Verizon or

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.580 
care so whether it be Sprint Verizon or
the<00:00:18.150> host<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.660> prepaid<00:00:19.050> networks<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.560> there

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the host the prepaid networks out there

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.349 
the host the prepaid networks out there
so<00:00:20.310> we're<00:00:20.400> gonna<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> quick<00:00:20.789> hands-on<00:00:21.210> look

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
so we're gonna do a quick hands-on look

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.029 
so we're gonna do a quick hands-on look
at<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> sky<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.769> first<00:00:22.920> thing<00:00:23.010> that

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
at the sky so the first thing that

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.710 
at the sky so the first thing that
stands<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:23.670> Kyocera<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
stands out with Kyocera is that it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
stands out with Kyocera is that it

plasticy<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.630> response<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.199> good<00:00:31.439> enough<00:00:31.679> but

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
plasticy the response is good enough but

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.490 
plasticy the response is good enough but
you<00:00:32.340> know<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.180> layout<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you know the layout it's a little bit a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.440 
you know the layout it's a little bit a
little<00:00:34.590> bit<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.399> cram<00:00:35.640> side<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
little bit on the cram side you have the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
little bit on the cram side you have the
numbers<00:00:36.750> implemented<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.800> top<00:00:38.040> row<00:00:38.280> of

numbers implemented with the top row of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.639 
numbers implemented with the top row of
buttons<00:00:38.690> but<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.780> least<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.379> have

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
Android buttons you could tell they're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.090 
Android buttons you could tell they're
specifically<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.590> Ice<00:01:25.799> Cream<00:01:26.070> Sandwich

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
specifically for Ice Cream Sandwich

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100 
specifically for Ice Cream Sandwich
they're<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.210> implements<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> they're<00:01:28.020> not

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
they're not implements it they're not

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.510 
they're not implements it they're not
integrated<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.650> platform<00:01:29.220> they're<00:01:29.369> dead

integrated to the platform they're dead

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.950 
integrated to the platform they're dead
they're<00:01:29.820> separate<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.689> one

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
they're separate here so you have one

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
they're separate here so you have one
for<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> menu<00:01:31.439> button<00:01:31.799> at<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> bottom<00:01:32.189> there

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
for a menu button at the bottom there
