00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.840
 celery 1 onion a clove of garlic 1 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.570
 carrot leek is a branch of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.399
 thyme and a bay leaf for the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.239
 material we will need to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.760
 ramekins of a paring knife 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.490
 economical of a salad bowl a pan of a 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.290
 Chinese and a cutting board the 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.910
 first step is to peel all 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.350
 vegetables to avoid contaminating the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.140
 board I take a small ramekin 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:01.740
 where I will put all the peelings 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:04.010
 I start with the union then the 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.010
 clove garlic 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.790
 so I will now peel the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.790
 celery branch 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.560
 I peeled the stem to be able after 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 eat it but obviously we do not interfere 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.600
 leaves 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.600
 now I'm going to peel the carrots 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.900
 so now I'm going to peel and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.740
 wash the leek to do this you 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.740
 cut the green part 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.850
 legault you take it like this you 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.560
 sell it in all its length 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.970
 I just peeled the leek every 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.500
 other vegetables were washed 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.250
 previously because inside 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.720
 they are clean 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.790
 on the other hand, the leek is in the dining room 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:00.190
 inside it first needs the bottom and 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.979
 then wash the vegetables are all 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:10.119
 now wash and peel, let's go 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:12.970
 cut out because anyway 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.400
 the broth and a cold water 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.140
 I add all the vegetables as and when 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.670
 measure of who are cut now I 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:29.769
 add the onion I just cut it 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:31.570
 in 4 and now that all vegetables 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.120
 are cut and put in the pan 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.430
 we will be able to start cooking for 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.390
 that we will put it on fire add 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.390
 water at height 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.260
 so here we put our vegetables 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.270
 water up to height now is going to wear 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.010
 to boil as soon as it boils 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.630
 lower the fire for it to be 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.090
 shudder and let it cook for 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.459
