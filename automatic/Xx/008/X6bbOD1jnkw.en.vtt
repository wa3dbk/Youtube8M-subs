00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello again youtube people in the 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.230
 previous video we saw how to create a 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.139
 system image and save it in a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.300
 partition in the case that windows 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.480
 have a serious error we can recover 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.490
 our system in this video we will see 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.100
 how to recover the system from the copy 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.900
 of security in this case we will do it without 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.590
 use the installation disc 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.510
 windows 8.1 as you all know the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.300
 new computers already bring windows 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.989
 installed so the manufacturer does not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.960
 provides the installation disk 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.960
 we started we went to configuration 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.700
 change pc settings 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.700
 update and recover 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.350
 we go into recovery we choose home 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.390
 advanced as we want 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.680
 recover the system from the image 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.680
 previously created 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.980
 we went to solve problems 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.980
 we give in advanced options 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 we go into image recovery of the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.070
 system 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.759
 here we click on our name 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.950
 if when you start your computer you have 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.860
 put a password you must put it 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.320
 here 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.250
 I do not have a password on him 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.250
 I give in continue 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.620
 as you can see automatically and I 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.690
 found the backup in the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.900
 which shows me the location where it is 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.300
 saved 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.180
 It also shows the date when it was created 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.290
 the system image 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.450
 and finally the name 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.299
 we give in following 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.810
 we give in following finally we give in 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.810
 Finalize 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.209
 here we say yes 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.069
 now we only hope that the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.069
 restoration process of the copy 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.930
 finished the process we hope that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.930
 windows restart 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.390
 once rebooted windows we will have 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.459
 our system recovered and in the same 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.180
 been that when we created our image 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.180
 of the system 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.370
 good friends this was all for this 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.959

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.959
