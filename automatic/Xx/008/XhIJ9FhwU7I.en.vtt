00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.350
 hello that such good morning good I'll 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.570
 try to make a video of a job 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.349
 that we started with the students in class 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.180
 which is a cubist composition 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.830
 photographic good to boot I'll 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:24.930
 start a file of 20 centimeters by 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:29.970
 20 centimeters and 300 pixels per inch 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.390
 ok if we are going to give this canvas color 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.340
 black let's start taking 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.400
 different cuts of these three 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.140
 photographs of the same model I will 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:49.530
 start making cuts d 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.110
 from this photo my file to have 18 x 18 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.270
 centimeters I'm going to make one more cut or 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.440
 least to place four squares of 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:05.019
 four centimeters yes 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.710
 4x4 300 and I'm going to select just one 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.550
 small part 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.800
 d 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:17.740
 the mouth to the king trim controls for 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.730
 select control is to copy I have 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.730
 here hit me 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.880
 very square 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.420
 I will select to return to it 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.820
 picture now I'm going to take the story and I'm going 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.080
 to return 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.620
 a couple of steps before the cut I'm going to 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.410
 make a new cut now I'm going to 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.410
 select simply put 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.860
 nose 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.500
 selected control to be built I go back 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.860
 to the canvas and I paste a second part 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.320
 of victims 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.150
 very well I'll go back to the image and I'll 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.060
 to select 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.640
 good a step back 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.640
 and I will select for example 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.970
 the ear 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.340
 the mouth and stick 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.080
 I forgot to copy control to control c in 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.640
 what I see with control b 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.640
 indicated this 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.840
 around here I'll always have to line it up 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.550
 I'm going to go to another image and I'm going to 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.550
 select now for example 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.090
 a part of the event 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.940
 controlled control can copy 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.500
 in pego 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.500
 contreras select this image 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.210
 over here I'll go back to photography 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.800
 back before the cut and I'm going to 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.800
 select an example of the image 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 simply 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.010
 an eye 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.130
 and I'm repeating but this eye 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.130
 here 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.910
 up here 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.910
 I go back to this image and I go back to 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.910
 select 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.540
 and it 's a cut that you have now 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.890
 in this part 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.990
 but 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.200
 and another image for the idea is to go 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.000
 making cuts 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.000
 and selecting 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.999
 small parts 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.999
 because not all cuts were equal 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.850
 here and I continue 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.560
 with some other photo always 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.850
 retreating 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.850
 for example 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.230
 is here 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.360
 here 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.360
 yes 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:28.790
 of the third image 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.790
 I'm going to select the nose 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.810
 I try not all rectangles 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.910
 I forgot to approach a little 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.910
 yes the year 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:52.250
 selection a little ship 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.250
 Copy and paste 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.070
 then the idea is to go forming 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:04.829
 the face with different photographs and 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.829
 different pieces 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:11.379
 well after a while we created the 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.939
 rest of those in the layers we have 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.239
 selected the three images 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:18.639
 different parts 

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:23.559
 and we have here the conformation of 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:27.639
 our image with a lot of cuts 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:31.589
 of different photographs and we try to 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:35.939
 form if a face trying to follow 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.939
 one way the alignment of 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.879
 the traits 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.360
 we leave here this I'm just going to 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:45.789
 take away the 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.849
 the background visualization that I'm going to 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:53.830
 combined to handle all this with 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:57.300
 the layer combine visible 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:01.600
 and what I'm going to do is locate this 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:05.370
 within the selected layer and the bottom 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.849
 for example and could line 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:11.689
 in the middle 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:16.999
 vertical and on the good horizon 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:18.830
 I just leave here the work if there 

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:21.649
 a line that in rule could remain 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.300
 well let it work as well 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:27.220
 it would be 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.220
 would combine the layer has been completed 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.350
 and ready the work of vilc√∫n
