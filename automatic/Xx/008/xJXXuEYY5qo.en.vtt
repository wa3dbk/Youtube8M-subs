kinds of greens in the wintertime with

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.770 
kinds of greens in the wintertime with
no<00:02:12.170> problem<00:02:12.910> alright<00:02:13.910> I'm<00:02:14.090> going<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.420> try<00:02:14.750> to

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
no problem alright I'm going to try to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.500 
no problem alright I'm going to try to
do<00:02:15.049> about<00:02:15.200> half<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.190> then<00:02:16.519> by<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.209> way

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
do about half of this then by the way

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.550 
do about half of this then by the way
all<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.319> is<00:02:19.060> only<00:02:20.060> about<00:02:20.480> half<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:21.230> big

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
all of this is only about half this big

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.339 
all of this is only about half this big
bag<00:02:21.890> because<00:02:22.489> they<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.910> absolutely<00:02:23.599> cram<00:02:24.140> it

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
bag because they just absolutely cram it

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.460 
bag because they just absolutely cram it
in<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.489> think<00:02:25.790> it's<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.299> our<00:02:26.780> local<00:02:27.110> store<00:02:27.440> I

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
in and I think it's in our local store I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.979 
in and I think it's in our local store I
think<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.799> like<00:02:27.980> 238<00:02:28.940> for<00:02:29.329> this<00:02:29.480> great<00:02:29.780> big

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
think it's like 238 for this great big

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.970 
think it's like 238 for this great big
bag<00:02:30.430> which<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.670> great<00:02:32.360> prize<00:02:32.840> alright<00:02:33.799> I'm

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
bag which is a great prize alright I'm

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.890 
bag which is a great prize alright I'm
going<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.190> probably<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:34.579> to<00:02:34.790> use<00:02:34.819> my<00:02:35.269> tamper

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
going to probably have to use my tamper

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.830 
going to probably have to use my tamper
so<00:02:36.109> I'm<00:02:36.170> going<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.379> go<00:02:36.530> ahead<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.890> put<00:02:37.069> that<00:02:37.340> in

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
so I'm going to go ahead and put that in

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.319 
so I'm going to go ahead and put that in
and<00:02:38.840> I'm<00:02:38.930> going<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.400> hopefully<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.670> won't<00:02:41.180> have

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
and I'm going to hopefully I won't have

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.690 
and I'm going to hopefully I won't have
to<00:02:41.660> add<00:02:41.810> too<00:02:42.170> much<00:02:42.349> water<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.859> let's<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.489> see

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
to add too much water so let's just see

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.910 
to add too much water so let's just see
maybe<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.269> cup<00:02:45.049> in<00:02:45.470> there<00:02:46.120> it's<00:02:47.120> about<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.389> cup

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
maybe a cup in there it's about a cup

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.610 
maybe a cup in there it's about a cup
hopefully<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.130> will<00:02:49.459> work<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:51.230> we're<00:02:51.440> gonna

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
hopefully this will work so we're gonna

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:48.460 
hopefully this will work so we're gonna
find<00:02:51.950> out<00:02:54.280> temporary<00:02:55.959> terminal

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.009 

all<00:03:49.470> right<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:49.830> think<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.400> were<00:03:52.700> really<00:03:54.019> there

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
all right I think it were really there

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.039 
all right I think it were really there
you<00:03:55.170> my<00:03:55.319> dogs<00:03:56.090> they<00:03:57.090> can't<00:03:57.390> ever<00:03:57.629> let<00:03:57.870> me

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
you my dogs they can't ever let me

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.369 
you my dogs they can't ever let me
record<00:03:58.409> a<00:03:58.530> video<00:03:58.650> without<00:03:59.069> trying<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.760> bark

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
record a video without trying to bark

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.899 
record a video without trying to bark
alright<00:04:01.379> so<00:04:01.739> we're<00:04:01.920> going<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.159> see<00:04:02.459> how<00:04:02.670> this

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
alright so we're going to see how this

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:09.050 
alright so we're going to see how this
works<00:04:03.659> so<00:04:05.870> see<00:04:06.870> how<00:04:06.989> thick<00:04:07.319> it<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.060> of

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
works so see how thick it is and of

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.930 
works so see how thick it is and of
course<00:04:09.330> once<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:10.760> use<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:13.190> body<00:04:14.190> mix<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:14.760> make

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
course once I use the body mix to make

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.050 
course once I use the body mix to make
the<00:04:15.090> smoothies<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.139> morning<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:17.940> know

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
the smoothies in the morning it you know

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.659 
the smoothies in the morning it you know
ground<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.660> up<00:04:18.780> even<00:04:19.109> more<00:04:19.370> but<00:04:20.370> I'm<00:04:20.489> just

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
ground it up even more but I'm just

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.210 
ground it up even more but I'm just
looking<00:04:21.180> for<00:04:21.449> the<00:04:21.570> convenience<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.830> might

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
looking for the convenience so I might

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.980 
looking for the convenience so I might
have<00:04:26.250> gotten<00:04:26.580> too<00:04:26.820> much<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.330> there<00:04:27.600> let's<00:04:27.900> see

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.990 

for<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.110> rest<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.500> this<00:04:34.650> in<00:04:34.919> this<00:04:35.070> one

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.090 

okay<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.210> need<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.870> pour<00:04:43.080> some<00:04:43.380> of<00:04:43.410> that<00:04:43.680> one

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
okay I need to pour some of that one

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.540 
okay I need to pour some of that one
into<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.610> one<00:04:44.910> so<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:46.620> don't<00:04:46.890> know<00:04:47.100> how<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.310> do

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
into this one so I don't know how to do

00:04:47.550 --> 00:05:01.070 
into this one so I don't know how to do
that<00:04:47.760> quite<00:04:57.200> pretty<00:04:58.200> well<00:04:59.720> alright<00:05:00.720> so<00:05:01.020> I'm

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
that quite pretty well alright so I'm

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.810 
that quite pretty well alright so I'm
going<00:05:01.290> to<00:05:01.320> spread<00:05:01.800> this<00:05:02.040> out<00:05:02.340> in<00:05:02.580> there<00:05:02.790> a

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
going to spread this out in there a

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:16.339 
going to spread this out in there a
little<00:05:03.150> bit<00:05:03.330> not<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.200> get<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.380> spoon<00:05:04.710> hold<00:05:05.070> on

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.879 

turn<00:05:17.349> down<00:05:17.530> so<00:05:17.740> you<00:05:17.889> can<00:05:18.099> see<00:05:18.930> so<00:05:19.930> just<00:05:19.960> spread

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
turn down so you can see so just spread

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.129 
turn down so you can see so just spread
this<00:05:21.130> out<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.400> little<00:05:21.699> more<00:05:21.940> evenly<00:05:23.099> Chris<00:05:24.099> well

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
this out a little more evenly Chris well

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:33.870 
this out a little more evenly Chris well
sort<00:05:26.139> of<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.289> learning<00:05:26.620> experience<00:05:27.030> here<00:05:28.030> I<00:05:32.880> got

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
sort of a learning experience here I got

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.510 
sort of a learning experience here I got
a<00:05:33.910> little<00:05:34.180> bit<00:05:34.389> on<00:05:34.509> the<00:05:34.690> side<00:05:35.020> there<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:36.310> wipe

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
a little bit on the side there to wipe

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.129 
a little bit on the side there to wipe
that<00:05:36.789> off<00:05:36.849> but<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.330> think<00:05:37.599> this<00:05:37.720> is<00:05:37.930> going<00:05:38.080> to

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
that off but I think this is going to

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.279 
that off but I think this is going to
work<00:05:38.229> so<00:05:38.800> I'm<00:05:38.949> guessing<00:05:39.580> in<00:05:39.759> a<00:05:40.479> smoothie<00:05:41.050> and

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
work so I'm guessing in a smoothie and

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.529 
work so I'm guessing in a smoothie and
the<00:05:41.440> mornings<00:05:41.919> I<00:05:42.310> would<00:05:42.849> probably<00:05:43.240> want<00:05:43.419> to

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
the mornings I would probably want to

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.550 
the mornings I would probably want to
use<00:05:43.599> about<00:05:44.080> four<00:05:44.650> of<00:05:45.039> these<00:05:45.960> little<00:05:46.960> cubes<00:05:47.319> so

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
use about four of these little cubes so

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.020 
use about four of these little cubes so
I'm<00:05:47.650> going<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:47.889> go<00:05:48.039> ahead<00:05:48.099> and<00:05:48.370> freeze<00:05:48.699> this

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
I'm going to go ahead and freeze this

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.420 
I'm going to go ahead and freeze this
and<00:05:49.389> after<00:05:50.110> it's<00:05:50.229> completely<00:05:50.680> present<00:05:51.069> I'll

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
and after it's completely present I'll

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.980 
and after it's completely present I'll
be<00:05:51.550> putting<00:05:51.880> it<00:05:52.000> in<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.150> little<00:05:52.389> plastic<00:05:52.659> bag
