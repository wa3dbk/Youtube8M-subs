00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.709 

in<00:00:09.200> this<00:00:10.200> timeline<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.950> use<00:00:11.400> bcc<00:00:11.730> velocity

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
in this timeline of use bcc velocity

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
in this timeline of use bcc velocity
remap<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.469> slow<00:00:13.830> down<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.309> mountain<00:00:14.820> biker

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
remap to slow down this mountain biker

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.750 
remap to slow down this mountain biker
right<00:00:15.660> there<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.289> then<00:00:16.980> he<00:00:17.220> resumes<00:00:17.520> his

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
right there and then he resumes his

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.450 
right there and then he resumes his
normal<00:00:18.150> speed<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.590> velocity<00:00:19.710> remap

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
normal speed so the velocity remap

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.370 
normal speed so the velocity remap
filter<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.060> different<00:00:21.600> from<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.930> optical

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
filter is different from the optical

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.029 
filter is different from the optical
flow<00:00:22.850> filter<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.119> couple<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.570> ways<00:00:24.859> if<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.920> go

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
flow filter in a couple of ways if I go

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.790 
flow filter in a couple of ways if I go
into<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.340> new<00:00:26.849> timeline<00:00:27.199> it'll<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.320> easier<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
into a new timeline it'll be easier to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
into a new timeline it'll be easier to
show<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.010> while<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> recreate<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.390> effect<00:00:30.710> so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
show you while I recreate the effect so

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
show you while I recreate the effect so
here's<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> source<00:00:32.340> footage<00:00:32.579> playing<00:00:33.120> at

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
here's the source footage playing at

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.569 
here's the source footage playing at
regular<00:00:33.750> speed<00:00:34.190> unlike<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.219> previous

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
regular speed unlike the previous

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.330 
regular speed unlike the previous
footage<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:36.630> shot<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.140> 24<00:00:37.890> frames<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
footage this was shot at 24 frames a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.420 
footage this was shot at 24 frames a
second<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.570> regular<00:00:40.140> shutter<00:00:40.890> speed<00:00:41.219> so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
second with a regular shutter speed so

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.760 
second with a regular shutter speed so
you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.850> all<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.030> motion<00:00:42.540> blur<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.960> this

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
you can see all the motion blur in this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.090 
you can see all the motion blur in this
shot<00:00:44.070> those<00:00:45.000> two<00:00:45.030> things<00:00:45.480> make<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.379> less

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
shot those two things make this a less

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
shot those two things make this a less
than<00:00:47.129> ideal<00:00:47.399> candidate<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:48.180> optical<00:00:48.750> flow<00:00:48.930> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
than ideal candidate for optical flow to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.380 
than ideal candidate for optical flow to
begin<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.129> also<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.910> fact<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
begin with but also the fact that the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.689 
begin with but also the fact that the
camera<00:00:51.809> angle<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.379> constantly<00:00:52.890> changing<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
camera angle is constantly changing and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.029 
camera angle is constantly changing and
the<00:00:54.629> foreground<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.199> background<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:55.770> both

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the foreground and background are both

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.299 
the foreground and background are both
moving<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.820> different<00:00:57.030> directions<00:00:58.309> creating

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
moving in different directions creating

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.910 
moving in different directions creating
new<00:00:59.640> frames<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.180> between<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.809> these<00:01:01.199> spots

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
new frames in between all these spots

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
new frames in between all these spots
would<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.399> look<00:01:02.609> good<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:03.840> why<00:01:04.140> i'm

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
would not look good so that's why i'm

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.030 
would not look good so that's why i'm
going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:04.979> velocity<00:01:05.489> remap<00:01:05.850> instead

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
going to use velocity remap instead

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.590 
going to use velocity remap instead
velocity<00:01:08.040> remap<00:01:08.430> doesn't<00:01:08.790> create<00:01:09.030> new<00:01:09.270> frames

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
velocity remap doesn't create new frames

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
velocity remap doesn't create new frames
it<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:09.990> uses<00:01:10.140> frame<00:01:10.619> blending<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.610> means

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it just uses frame blending which means

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.630 
it just uses frame blending which means
it's<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.090> lot<00:01:12.240> faster<00:01:12.510> than<00:01:13.020> optical<00:01:13.409> flow<00:01:13.740> for

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it's a lot faster than optical flow for

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.080 
it's a lot faster than optical flow for
example<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.119> i<00:01:15.240> set<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.689> velocity<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:17.040> 30

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.550 

notice<00:01:21.090> how<00:01:21.330> quickly<00:01:21.600> i<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.110> scrub<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
notice how quickly i can just scrub the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.820 
notice how quickly i can just scrub the
timeline<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> nice<00:01:23.520> update<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.830> this

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
timeline and get a nice update here this

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.410 
timeline and get a nice update here this
is<00:01:25.979> another<00:01:26.189> filter<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.119> apply<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
is another filter that you can apply to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.950 
is another filter that you can apply to
a<00:01:27.689> filler<00:01:28.259> track<00:01:28.729> above<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:30.150> timeline<00:01:30.630> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
a filler track above your timeline so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.830 
a filler track above your timeline so
let's<00:01:31.829> show<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.460> how<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> again<00:01:35.840> so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
let's show you how to do that again so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.660 
let's show you how to do that again so
to<00:01:36.960> make<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.310> sure<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
to make use of it just make sure you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.749 
to make use of it just make sure you
change<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.210> source<00:01:39.509> layer<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:41.159> group

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
change the source layer in the group

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.139 
change the source layer in the group
here<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.450> first<00:01:42.869> below<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:44.700> case<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
here so first below in this case and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.289 
here so first below in this case and
then<00:01:45.270> I'm<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.540> set<00:01:46.790> okay<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.180> going

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
then I'm all set okay so what I'm going

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.990 
then I'm all set okay so what I'm going
to<00:01:48.360> do<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.780> slow<00:01:49.140> him<00:01:49.380> down<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:50.369> after<00:01:50.640> he

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to do is slow him down just after he

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.719 
to do is slow him down just after he
comes<00:01:51.270> around<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.869> tree<00:01:52.259> I'm<00:01:53.250> gonna<00:01:53.369> add<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
comes around this tree I'm gonna add a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.120 
comes around this tree I'm gonna add a
velocity<00:01:54.450> keyframe<00:01:54.899> there<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:55.979> be

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
velocity keyframe there this will be

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.149 
velocity keyframe there this will be
where<00:01:56.340> he's<00:01:56.520> slow<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:58.170> he<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.829> speed

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
where he's slow and then he will speed

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.030 
where he's slow and then he will speed
back<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.369> again<00:01:59.759> at<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> end<00:02:00.619> maybe<00:02:01.619> create

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
back up again at the end maybe create

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
back up again at the end maybe create
another<00:02:02.369> keyframe<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> middle<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
another keyframe in the middle here to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.920 
another keyframe in the middle here to
keep<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.009> slowness<00:02:05.310> going<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.850> bit<00:02:05.969> longer<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
keep the slowness going a bit longer so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.279 
keep the slowness going a bit longer so
let's<00:02:07.079> make<00:02:07.259> him<00:02:07.500> down<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.009> 30<00:02:08.989> it's<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.110> very

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
let's make him down to 30 it's a very

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.050 
let's make him down to 30 it's a very
short<00:02:10.649> clip<00:02:10.950> so

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
short clip so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.860 
short clip so
he's<00:02:12.239> not<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.660> slow<00:02:12.930> for<00:02:12.959> too<00:02:13.290> long

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
he's not going to be slow for too long

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.270 
he's not going to be slow for too long
now<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.230> look<00:02:16.319> at<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.680> frames<00:02:16.950> where<00:02:17.160> he

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
now if we look at the frames where he

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.040 
now if we look at the frames where he
slowed<00:02:17.550> down<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.120> see<00:02:18.150> frame<00:02:18.750> blending

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
slowed down you can see frame blending

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.130 
slowed down you can see frame blending
going<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.069> that's<00:02:20.510> what<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.569> mean<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.020> not

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
going on and that's what I mean it's not

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.050 
going on and that's what I mean it's not
creating<00:02:22.560> new<00:02:22.739> frames<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.580> blending

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
creating new frames it's just blending

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.870 
creating new frames it's just blending
the<00:02:24.480> first<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.260> next<00:02:25.500> frame<00:02:25.770> now<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:26.760> you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the first and next frame now if you

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.910 
the first and next frame now if you
increase<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.540> temporal<00:02:27.959> blur<00:02:28.110> amount<00:02:28.230> you

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
increase the temporal blur amount you

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.820 
increase the temporal blur amount you
can<00:02:29.069> pull<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.459> more<00:02:29.760> frames<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.569> this<00:02:31.349> case<00:02:31.590> it

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
can pull in more frames in this case it

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.620 
can pull in more frames in this case it
gives<00:02:31.920> us<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.250> very<00:02:32.430> kind<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.330> blurry

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
gives us a very kind of blurry

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.770 
gives us a very kind of blurry
disoriented<00:02:34.500> look<00:02:34.709> or<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.880> can<00:02:36.090> turn<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.630> way

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
disoriented look or you can turn it way

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.360 
disoriented look or you can turn it way
down<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.590> nothing<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.260> case<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.890> would

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
down to nothing so in this case I would

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.479 
down to nothing so in this case I would
say<00:02:41.640> like<00:02:41.880> around<00:02:42.269> point<00:02:42.930> six<00:02:43.319> or<00:02:43.590> less<00:02:44.100> looks

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
say like around point six or less looks

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.210 
say like around point six or less looks
fine<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.900> can<00:02:46.049> also<00:02:46.170> change<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.860> frame

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
fine but you can also change the frame

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.240 
fine but you can also change the frame
blending<00:02:47.489> mode<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.720> here<00:02:49.470> let's<00:02:49.890> say<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.069> want

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
blending mode so here let's say I want

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.850 
blending mode so here let's say I want

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
to go fast opaque this gives equal

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.300 
to go fast opaque this gives equal

power<00:03:13.230> positive<00:03:14.010> works<00:03:14.430> well<00:03:14.700> on<00:03:14.940> clips<00:03:15.780> that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
power positive works well on clips that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.130 
power positive works well on clips that
have<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.200> lot<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.380> dark<00:03:16.739> in<00:03:16.980> them<00:03:17.420> boost<00:03:18.420> power

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440

particular<00:03:22.620> clip<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.459> think<00:03:23.670> looks<00:03:23.850> better

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
particular clip I think looks better

with<00:03:24.239> boost<00:03:24.510> power<00:03:24.720> negative<00:03:25.280> it's<00:03:26.280> not<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.489> lot

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
with boost power negative it's not a lot

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.840 
with boost power negative it's not a lot

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850

if<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.060> scrub<00:03:30.569> through<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:32.010> see<00:03:32.190> how<00:03:32.340> it

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
if I scrub through I can see how it

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.569 
if I scrub through I can see how it
looks<00:03:36.470> another<00:03:37.470> option<00:03:37.739> in<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.190> filter<00:03:38.430> is

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
looks another option in this filter is

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.300 
looks another option in this filter is
the<00:03:39.030> graph<00:03:39.239> mode<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.319> graph<00:03:40.530> basically

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
the graph mode and the graph basically

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.580 
the graph mode and the graph basically
just<00:03:41.519> shows<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.150> speed<00:03:42.480> over<00:03:42.810> time<00:03:43.109> so

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
just shows you the speed over time so

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.650 
just shows you the speed over time so
this<00:03:43.769> shows<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.150> speed<00:03:45.389> is<00:03:45.510> going

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
this shows you that the speed is going

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.289 
this shows you that the speed is going
along<00:03:45.870> at<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.440> hundred<00:03:46.829> percent<00:03:47.010> there<00:03:47.489> then<00:03:48.150> it

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
along at a hundred percent there then it

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.449 
along at a hundred percent there then it
slows<00:03:48.660> down<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.079> bit<00:03:49.290> here<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:50.040> blue<00:03:50.220> line<00:03:50.430> is

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
slows down a bit here the blue line is

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.180 
slows down a bit here the blue line is
where<00:03:50.819> I'm<00:03:50.940> currently<00:03:51.480> parked<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:53.069> it

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
where I'm currently parked and then it

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.000 
where I'm currently parked and then it
speeds<00:03:53.459> up<00:03:53.579> again<00:03:53.850> towards<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.359> end<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.950> if

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
speeds up again towards the end so if

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.069 
speeds up again towards the end so if
you<00:03:56.100> want<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.370> visual<00:03:56.880> representation<00:03:57.359> of<00:03:57.930> how

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
you want a visual representation of how

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.220 
you want a visual representation of how
your<00:03:58.350> speed<00:03:58.920> is<00:03:58.950> changing<00:03:59.579> this<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.019> graph

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
your speed is changing this is the graph

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.729 
your speed is changing this is the graph
mode<00:04:01.530> for<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:03.019> don't<00:04:04.019> we<00:04:04.230> need<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.530> right<00:04:04.680> now

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.449 
mode for that don't we need it right now
and<00:04:05.220> that's<00:04:05.940> all<00:04:06.090> there<00:04:06.209> was<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.389> it<00:04:06.620> so<00:04:07.620> those
