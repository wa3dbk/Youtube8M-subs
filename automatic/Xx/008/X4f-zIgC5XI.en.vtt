00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
doesn't actually open because basically

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.890 
doesn't actually open because basically
that<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> ceiling<00:01:14.880> used<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.630> more

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
that the ceiling used to go like up more

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690 
that the ceiling used to go like up more
than<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> guys<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> actually

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
than that and now the guys do I actually

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.280 
than that and now the guys do I actually
get<00:01:17.939> stuck<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.450> he<00:01:18.540> goes<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.689> try<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.110> touch

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
get stuck when he goes to try and touch

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
get stuck when he goes to try and touch
the<00:01:19.409> ceiling<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.009> technically<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.090> door

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the ceiling so technically the door

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.749 
the ceiling so technically the door
doesn't<00:01:21.390> actually<00:01:21.600> work<00:01:21.900> anymore<00:01:22.229> um<00:01:22.759> there

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
doesn't actually work anymore um there
