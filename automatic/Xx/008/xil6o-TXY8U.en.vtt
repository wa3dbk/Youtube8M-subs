complex<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.280> understand<00:03:59.729> in<00:03:59.879> one<00:04:00.060> viewing<00:04:00.479> one

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
complex to understand in one viewing one

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.659 
complex to understand in one viewing one
showing<00:04:00.959> or<00:04:01.319> ten<00:04:01.530> showings<00:04:02.009> I<00:04:02.220> don't<00:04:02.400> think

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
showing or ten showings I don't think

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.740 
showing or ten showings I don't think
you'll<00:04:02.819> ever<00:04:03.199> quite<00:04:04.199> understand<00:04:05.009> it

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
you'll ever quite understand it

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.530 
you'll ever quite understand it
and<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:06.290> think<00:04:07.280> Christopher<00:04:07.640> Nolan<00:04:08.090> is<00:04:08.240> playing

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
and I think Christopher Nolan is playing

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.630 
and I think Christopher Nolan is playing
one<00:04:08.960> hell<00:04:09.230> of<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:10.570> trick<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:12.740> audience<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.550> don't

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
one hell of a trick the audience I don't

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.850 
one hell of a trick the audience I don't
think<00:04:14.000> it's<00:04:14.120> a<00:04:14.150> mainstream<00:04:14.630> movie<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:15.170> really

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
think it's a mainstream movie I really

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.949 
think it's a mainstream movie I really
don't<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.280> think<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:16.970> that's<00:04:17.420> going<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.810> get<00:04:17.930> a

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
don't I think that that's going to get a

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.509 
don't I think that that's going to get a
little<00:04:18.350> backlash<00:04:18.530> because<00:04:18.980> of<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.340> like

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
little backlash because of that like

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.039 
little backlash because of that like
some<00:04:19.700> people<00:04:19.940> go<00:04:20.090> in<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.269> they'll<00:04:20.480> be<00:04:20.600> totally

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
some people go in and they'll be totally

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.960 
some people go in and they'll be totally
confused<00:04:21.200> so<00:04:22.160> it's<00:04:22.310> you're<00:04:22.460> gonna<00:04:22.610> get<00:04:22.730> a<00:04:22.790> lot

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
confused so it's you're gonna get a lot

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.460 
confused so it's you're gonna get a lot
of<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:23.240> anybody<00:04:23.690> that's<00:04:23.900> seen<00:04:24.050> any<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.350> his

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
of that anybody that's seen any of his

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.620 
of that anybody that's seen any of his
other<00:04:24.740> films<00:04:25.160> they're<00:04:25.760> really<00:04:26.060> gonna<00:04:26.180> like<00:04:26.450> it

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
other films they're really gonna like it

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.230 
other films they're really gonna like it
I<00:04:26.810> think<00:04:26.870> it's<00:04:27.230> gonna<00:04:27.380> be<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> cult<00:04:27.920> classic

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
I think it's gonna be a cult classic

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.610 
I think it's gonna be a cult classic
many<00:04:29.240> people<00:04:29.660> are<00:04:29.750> not<00:04:29.900> going<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.140> understand

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
many people are not going to understand

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.440 
many people are not going to understand
it<00:04:30.770> in<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.980> first<00:04:31.190> showing<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.730> they're

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
it in the first showing and they're

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.910

gonna<00:04:32.540> have<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:32.780> come<00:04:33.020> back<00:04:33.200> two<00:04:33.620> or<00:04:33.650> three

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
gonna have to come back two or three

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.650 
gonna have to come back two or three
times<00:04:34.160> could<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.670> understand<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.420> in<00:04:35.480> one

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660

times could you understand it in one
showing<00:04:35.960> no<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.620> think<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:37.070> have<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.340> see<00:04:37.490> it

hands in terms of seeing at multiple
times<00:04:58.390> at<00:04:59.390> full<00:04:59.750> price<00:05:00.050> but<00:05:00.410> I<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.560> might<00:05:01.430> go

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
times at full price but I I might go

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.060 
times at full price but I I might go
back<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.870> look<00:05:03.020> through<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.320> on<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.500> DVD<00:05:03.680> at

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
back and look through it on a DVD at

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.290 
back and look through it on a DVD at
some<00:05:04.280> point<00:05:04.490> from<00:05:04.730> a<00:05:04.820> writer's<00:05:05.180> perspective

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
some point from a writer's perspective

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.440 
some point from a writer's perspective
is<00:05:06.040> bananas<00:05:07.040> what<00:05:07.280> he<00:05:07.370> did<00:05:07.550> it's<00:05:08.120> not<00:05:08.240> really

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
is bananas what he did it's not really

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.600 
is bananas what he did it's not really
like<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.630> popcorn<00:05:08.930> movie<00:05:09.500> but<00:05:10.070> it's<00:05:10.190> definitely

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
like a popcorn movie but it's definitely

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.100 
like a popcorn movie but it's definitely
still<00:05:11.030> a<00:05:11.060> movie<00:05:11.210> that<00:05:11.419> you<00:05:11.479> could<00:05:11.660> go<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:11.810> see

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
still a movie that you could go and see

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.990 
still a movie that you could go and see
one<00:05:12.350> of<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.560> best<00:05:12.800> things<00:05:13.130> about<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.640> movie

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
one of the best things about the movie

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.280 
one of the best things about the movie
was<00:05:14.390> just<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.560> hear<00:05:15.979> Edith<00:05:16.580> PS<00:05:17.020> singing<00:05:18.020> once

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
was just to hear Edith PS singing once

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.870 
was just to hear Edith PS singing once
again<00:05:18.650> in<00:05:18.890> bits<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:19.340> pieces

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
again in bits and pieces

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.810 
again in bits and pieces
ah<00:05:20.060> finally<00:05:20.960> something<00:05:21.590> human<00:05:22.040> I<00:05:22.220> think<00:05:22.490> the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
ah finally something human I think the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.460 
ah finally something human I think the
emotional<00:05:23.240> component<00:05:23.390> of<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:23.930> felt<00:05:24.260> a<00:05:24.380> little

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
emotional component of it felt a little

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.920 
emotional component of it felt a little
force<00:05:24.860> I<00:05:25.130> mean<00:05:25.820> it<00:05:26.060> worked<00:05:26.360> but<00:05:26.570> it<00:05:26.720> didn't

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
force I mean it worked but it didn't

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.810 
force I mean it worked but it didn't
feel<00:05:27.110> completely<00:05:27.680> into<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.250> movie<00:05:28.610> I<00:05:28.760> think

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
feel completely into the movie I think

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.810 
feel completely into the movie I think
it<00:05:29.210> was<00:05:29.830> trying<00:05:30.830> to<00:05:30.950> do<00:05:31.070> Tom<00:05:31.280> so<00:05:31.520> many<00:05:31.669> things

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
it was trying to do Tom so many things

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.000 
it was trying to do Tom so many things
at<00:05:32.000> once<00:05:32.180> that<00:05:32.570> it<00:05:32.780> didn't<00:05:33.110> do<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.830> really

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010
