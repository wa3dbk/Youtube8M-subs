00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.259
 so him we're going to go into 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.049
 direct service and you will show us to 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.599
 use of the kind 2 and we 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.050
 make green beans in persillade 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.420
 so here we go I'm trying 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.240
 to heat the pan so there I 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.140
 add a little olive oil 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.179
 classical 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.170
 once my boredom of books will be 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:32.270
 hot 2 so I'm going to add but 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.690
 my green beans that I have 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.820
 previously thawed ok that's fine 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.680
 allow to save 50% of the time so 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.610
 it's important so we can do it 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.750
 it's the ideal 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.330
 but we can also use it 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.640
 directly to -18 so you do not have 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.710
 need to cook the product nor to the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.450
 steam nor the English before moving on to 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.840
 direct harmonization use 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.340
 direct 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.910
 so here I 'm going to add the beans 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:00.860
 green so I'm baking me beans 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.070
 green in olive oil 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.190
 I add cfg previously 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 weighing since one to add in have 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.050
 between 6 and 8 grams of fine salt or kilos 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.050
 vegetables 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.200
 so here I 'm going to re-implement the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.240
 produced for three to four minutes 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.860
 and I will add of course my 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.160
 persillade so aie aie aie 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:38.820
 persie so here I go back my 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:42.750
 go with my green beans and so there 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.479
 we will get perfectly perfectly 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.920
 cooked luc I notice that there is no 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.050
 back made with the product 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.120
 and yes as it is so a product 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.890
 minutes so 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.160
 the product is already cooked uncle at 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.620
 vegetable vegetables disappeared during the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.870
 manufacturing process which allows 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.960
 so to the restorers to have a 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.630
 produced with 100% yield him that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.690
 I am amazed at the excellent performance of the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.580
 product and yes there again the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.830
 process minutes allows us to have 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.800
 this maintenance and control of 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.960
 cooking green beans and you can 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.910
 also notice the superb 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.800
 color of a green bean really 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.800
 green beans out of the garden
