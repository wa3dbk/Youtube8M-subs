00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.070
 in a new demonstration of the 505 lumia 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.170
 let's talk about two issues of 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.810
 productivity that interests the 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.530
 smartphone users the first one is the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.200
 office theme 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.150
 there is no other telephone where 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.250
 find such a deep integration 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.560
 with the office as in a Nokia phone 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.510
 with windows phone the first thing I have 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.690
 it is a system of notes that is called 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.570
 onenote that allows me to save notes 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.750
 only text but also with voice 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.400
 and image and additional to that I have the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 traditional software that can 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.350
 find in other devices that are 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.629
 word excel and power point but overcoming 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.700
 that and on productivity issues too 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.280
 I have the ability to synchronize my 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.100
 phone with my skydive cloud with my 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.230
 office 365 service or with the product 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.700
 corporate sharepoint all this 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.590
 integration again they will not 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.409
 find on another phone that is not a 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.210
 nokia lumia with windows phone the second 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.050
 productivity tool that we're going to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.350
 see today 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.070
 is the possibility of using my 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.770
 phone as a gps even if I'm 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.970
 outside of a data network or I'm not 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.760
 connected to wifi this gps system what 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.420
 what allows me to do is locate my 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.850
 exact location with coordinates 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.220
 longitude latitude and so on and then plot 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 a route between the place where I am 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.190
 and the place to which I am going assisted by 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.500
 a voice that will tell me if I should take 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.440
 left to right continue on 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.020
 road or other the only thing you need 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.540
 do when you purchase your line 505 is the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.810
 first time I entered this application 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:03.060
 go to this menu and then say manage 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.060
 maps in settings or settings 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.369
 and add the maps of the country where 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.310
 I want to do my gps navigation 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.709
 after that I can enjoy my 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.720
 gps service again I insist without 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.390
 need to be connected to a network 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.930
 of operator data or a system 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.930
 Wifi
