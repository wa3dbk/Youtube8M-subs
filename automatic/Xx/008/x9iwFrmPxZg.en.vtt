couple of days in terms of overreaction
the<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.099> biggest<00:02:43.540> overreaction<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.659> any

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
the the biggest overreaction of any

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.199 
the the biggest overreaction of any
situation<00:02:45.650> you've<00:02:45.859> been<00:02:46.069> in<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.639> a<00:02:46.700> national

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
situation you've been in on a national

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.199 
situation you've been in on a national
scale<00:02:47.680> well<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.709> think<00:02:48.859> if<00:02:49.099> you<00:02:49.159> take<00:02:49.340> ESPN<00:02:50.030> out

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
scale well I think if you take ESPN out

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.030 
scale well I think if you take ESPN out
of<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.359> mix<00:02:50.599> then<00:02:51.230> yeah<00:02:51.439> I<00:02:51.470> think<00:02:51.590> it's<00:02:51.919> an

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
of the mix then yeah I think it's an

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.979 
of the mix then yeah I think it's an
overreaction<00:02:52.579> now<00:02:52.879> especially<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.840> know

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
overreaction now especially you know

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.750 
overreaction now especially you know
