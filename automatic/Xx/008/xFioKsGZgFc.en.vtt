00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.900
 a very striking complement we are going to 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:08.660
 lose the fear of how to compute a 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.410
 no and only came to chile 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.000
 Hello everybody 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.680
 today we are going to talk about getting sick 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.420
 sure it happened to you 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.490
 but is that sometimes you bought a 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.490
 complement our accessories 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.500
 very special specials with a lot 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.760
 the majors ferocious animal majors 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.890
 until you do it because the 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.570
 supplements or the salt of life then 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.240
 you find that the add-on 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.810
 has too much presence 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.030
 presence and is to ask how I combine it 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.560
 this is a tricky subject for example 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.560
 today we are going to use two complements 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.270
 or that does not go unnoticed 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.270
 that nothing is happening either 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.040
 to combine complements of this type 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.010
 who have their 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.290
 we have different options we can 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.540
 prefer to 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.570
 give prominence to the accessories 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.000
 or we can choose to lower the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.520
 protagonism of the complete 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.480
 let's see different examples so that 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.400
 see how we can do it 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.040
 let's start by giving it a neutral background 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.360
 to our add-on using one 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.450
 only of the complete ones 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.240
 with the 26 I give a fund to 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.740
 complement that highlights you has all the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.280
 leadership 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.000
 a colour 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.770
 but the bag in this case stands out 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.770
 here we could choose 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.950
 for complementing the image perhaps 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.610
 for giving him a little more joy but 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.380
 we would leave it 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.570
 however if we want to use also 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.820
 the booties at the same time we would continue with 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.860
 this neutral fund but we will remove it 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.030
 the handkerchief that equalized we recharged 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.080
 too 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.490
 this has I have 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.490
 in expert 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.460
 he is friends with my 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.670
 another option to combine this type of 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.970
 complements is to go towards the colors 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.490
 who have those complexes 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.830
 if you are we exploit the vocabularies a 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.460
 little with the background this case chosen 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.990
 earth colors ocher colors so that 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.160
 the complements we have in this 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.240
 case not stand out so much 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.800
 the image is much softer than the case 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.420
 previous in which they contrasted with my 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.020
 background 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.020
 here it is about 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.090
 and here is my third option that I have 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.090
 done I kept a color 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.069
 that is related to the complement 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.340
 but then it uses two colors 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.680
 complementary in this case the blues 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.680
 and also being a lenin what he does is 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.019
 take more seriously the complement what 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.150
 becomes something much more sporting 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.550
 so you can use it perfectly 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.770
 we have gone from a more formal look to 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.180
 say it in some way in which he 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.090
 the supplement had all the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.670
 protagonism to this that is much more 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.260
 casual much to the sport that takes away 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.880
 importance to the complement but 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.020
 complement is still there 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.020
 see the complement is 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.610
 but we combine it in different ways 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.830
 and happens we have meaning completely 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.380
 liz inside 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.380
 to encourage yourself to have add-ons yes 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.640
 the malitos but also to have 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.640
 add-ons we would call
