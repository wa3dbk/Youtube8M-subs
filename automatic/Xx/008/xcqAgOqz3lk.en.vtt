00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 thanks for the interview you're a man 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.660
 of challenges you will succeed real machinery 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.970
 yes I think it's the mentality is the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.230
 desire and those are also the reasons why 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.960
 which I signed with the team 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.730
 villarreal I'm not going to give a good 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 jump europe to be able to be in a good 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.400
 team like the villarreal and power 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 ascend with them is not a team 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.789
 important and you have to return it to the place 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.289
 where I was and the goal is to succeed 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.660
 succeed staff 20 other boats and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.310
 group to succeed not so much personal 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.470
 as a group always in football or what 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.539
 individual goes to the team I do not think that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.040
 it must be that very important and the truth 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.540
 that at the moment I'm going with many 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.370
 eager to help the team to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.870
 ascend and that my career is going very 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.309
 well do not have many minutes and be a 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 very constant player in europe the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.540
 objectives that fixes my first goal well 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.730
 is to have an important regularity not 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.250
 have many minutes on the computer and the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.320
 goal is not mine and the team's 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.559
 villarreal directive the rise of the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.840
 team and means a little bit for new not a 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.760
 new team a new league new challenges 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.469
 no no no no that the truth that very happy 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 and very excited about this new challenge 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.329
 I hope I can already have my encounter with 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.070
 my teammates with the team and power 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.570
 already have my first game I'm not very 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 happy I think I'm a good time 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.890
 holistic and I hope I can show it in 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.100
 europe more for the consecration of javier 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.060
 aquino as a footballer if I go for a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.930
 very important consecration in me 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.790
 career is not going to be a player 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 important to be a player that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.390
 excel and be a good level in 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.430
 europe and what do you expect as 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.780
 imagine that it will be the league or very 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.920
 competitive and anticipated talk with 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.930
 some of my classmates who has had 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.000
 the opportunity to play there they tell me that 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140
 it's a very difficult league also not very 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.729
 competitive and that will serve me 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.070
 very much you think you play in europe 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.720
 will help you to reach the World Cup if 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.090
 can be is not a goal also to 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.160
 medium term no to the global I think that by 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.410
 Now my goal is to be clear 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.030
 in villarreal and have many minutes and 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.320
 I hope that if that can give me enough 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.670
 to be able to aspire to reach the world 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.880
 you have a lot to gain and nothing to lose 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.500
 and a lot to gain not much experience 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.259
 maturity as a player and above all 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 touch me in europe not that that can 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.250
 be very important for my fourth 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.860
 I race the match yesterday as a lobbyist 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.050
 complicated match that the team attracts 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.220
 the jamaica team came for good and 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.350
 I think I think it was a match 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.450
 not good for us a little bad for 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.040
 us and we went up to do well the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.170
 things and I think we should learn a lot 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.180
 tiebreaker you think they're going to trust I had 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.680
 that will classify no problem yes 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.970
 I think the tie is difficult 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.830
 but I trust that the selection must 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.810
 should qualify I think in the moments 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.480
 difficult when you see the equipment not in 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.860
 the easy moments I think that in the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.690
 moments of victory everything is very easy 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.580
 no people are all with 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.140
 us but good at the time 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.030
 difficult when you see the team yesterday 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.040
 you would live to the support that supports 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.600
 the bad moments are the best that support 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.870
 I believe that people have all their 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.910
 right to do what you want in the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.650
 stadium goodbye pay a ticket for a 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.930
 show and I think that nothing else would be 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.610
 my opinion the man once in 2014 in the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.380
 global if we hope that yes first to 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.420
 God now we go to one hundred percent of 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.520
 what is the villarreal and we'll see in 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.010
 2014 that you imagine in a next year 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.990
 facing Messi-Christian if I wait 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.209
 soon to make the jump together with the team 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.370
 to the first division not very happy and 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.840
 very grateful for the signing that I 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.730
 I had with the Villarreal and hopefully 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.900
 together we can achieve the goal so 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.900
 important thank you very much
