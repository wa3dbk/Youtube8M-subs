that's<00:01:00.030> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> cool<00:01:00.390> about<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.899> dx11

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that's kind of cool about the dx11

that's kind of cool about the dx11
shader<00:01:01.890> plugin<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> natively<00:01:03.090> handles<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
shader plugin is it natively handles the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
maya light hookups for you so it gives

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.670 
maya light hookups for you so it gives
you<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> very<00:01:06.240> native<00:01:06.659> feeling<00:01:07.229> workflow

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680

shaders<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.460> means<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.210> go

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
shaders so what that means is if I go

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
shaders so what that means is if I go
ahead<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.570> hit<00:01:12.750> something<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.320> 5<00:01:13.619> key<00:01:13.890> in

native<00:01:49.950> Maya<00:01:50.159> working<00:01:50.490> experience<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.149> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
native Maya working experience so if I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
native Maya working experience so if I
start<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> push<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.079> light<00:01:52.259> around<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.649> you

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
start to push this light around here you

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
start to push this light around here you
can<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.640> Maya<00:01:53.939> native<00:01:54.329> shaders

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
can see that the Maya native shaders

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.389 
can see that the Maya native shaders
that<00:01:54.990> are<00:01:55.229> basically<00:01:55.649> doing<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> background

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that are basically doing the background

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
that are basically doing the background
and<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.060> director<00:01:57.420> Lex<00:01:57.600> 11<00:01:58.259> shader<00:01:58.469> that's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and the director Lex 11 shader that's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
and the director Lex 11 shader that's
doing<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> character<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.670> behave<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.509> very

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
doing the character all behave in a very

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.109 
doing the character all behave in a very
similar<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.710> let's<00:02:02.610> go<00:02:02.729> ahead<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.969> start

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
similar way so let's go ahead and start

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
similar way so let's go ahead and start
to<00:02:03.240> turn<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.930> other<00:02:04.079> features<00:02:04.619> in

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to turn on some of the other features in

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.039 
to turn on some of the other features in
this<00:02:05.130> Maya<00:02:05.670> 'über<00:02:05.909> shader<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.509> start<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> dial

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
this Maya 'über shader to start to dial

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.330 
this Maya 'über shader to start to dial
in<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> look<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.680> character<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.099> little

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
in the look of this character a little

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040 
in the look of this character a little
bit<00:02:08.429> better<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> couple<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> things<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
bit better so a couple of things that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.360 
bit better so a couple of things that
are<00:02:10.229> worth<00:02:10.440> mentioning<00:02:10.830> right<00:02:10.979> off<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> bat

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
are worth mentioning right off the bat

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.920 
are worth mentioning right off the bat
the<00:02:11.700> technique<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.239> we're<00:02:12.360> using<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.810> has

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the technique that we're using it has

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
the technique that we're using it has
tessellation<00:02:13.470> turned

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
tessellation turned

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.290 
tessellation turned
what<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.550> means<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.970> we're<00:02:15.150> actually

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
what that means is we're actually

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.839 
what that means is we're actually
testing<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.140> character<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.890> GPU<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.760> if

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
testing this character on the GPU so if

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.740 
testing this character on the GPU so if
I<00:02:17.910> start<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.209> do<00:02:18.360> something<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.720> a

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
I start to do something like a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.240 
I start to do something like a
displacement<00:02:19.170> map<00:02:19.349> we're<00:02:19.739> gonna<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> nice

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
displacement map we're gonna have a nice

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.130 
displacement map we're gonna have a nice
high<00:02:20.580> poly<00:02:20.910> count<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.629> can<00:02:21.780> be<00:02:21.870> captured

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
high poly count that can be captured

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.470 
high poly count that can be captured
that<00:02:22.920> hardware<00:02:23.400> tessellation<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.090> really

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that hardware tessellation is really

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.990 
that hardware tessellation is really
really<00:02:24.720> cool<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:24.959> fast<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.220> obviously

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
really cool and fast so obviously

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.759 
really cool and fast so obviously
there's<00:02:27.239> lots<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.660> control<00:02:28.080> inside<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.500> super

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
there's lots of control inside the super

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.140 
there's lots of control inside the super
shader<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.190> expand<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.640> whole<00:02:29.790> list<00:02:30.030> it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
shader if I expand the whole list it

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.309 
shader if I expand the whole list it
gets<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.360> little<00:02:30.480> unwieldy<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.080> we're<00:02:31.200> just

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
gets a little unwieldy so we're just

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.229 
gets a little unwieldy so we're just
going<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.470> dial<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.130> few<00:02:32.430> key<00:02:32.640> specifics

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
going to dial in on a few key specifics

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.030 
going to dial in on a few key specifics
obviously<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.230> do<00:02:34.319> simple<00:02:34.620> rim<00:02:34.830> lighting

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
obviously we can do simple rim lighting

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.860 
obviously we can do simple rim lighting
on<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.340> shader<00:02:35.580> built<00:02:35.849> in<00:02:36.090> what<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:36.630> want<00:02:36.810> to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
on that shader built in what we want to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.210 
on that shader built in what we want to
do<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.260> example<00:02:37.590> start<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.069> get<00:02:38.190> a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
do for this example start to get a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.339 
do for this example start to get a
little<00:02:38.340> bit<00:02:38.550> more<00:02:38.670> relief<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.720> our<00:02:39.750> characters

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
little bit more relief to our characters

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.589 
little bit more relief to our characters
so<00:02:40.500> we're<00:02:40.620> gonna<00:02:40.709> do<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.099> with<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:42.030> normal<00:02:42.299> map

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
so we're gonna do that with a normal map

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.880 
so we're gonna do that with a normal map
so<00:02:42.780> we're<00:02:42.900> gonna<00:02:42.989> go<00:02:43.110> ahead<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.470> first

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
so we're gonna go ahead and just first

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.320 
so we're gonna go ahead and just first
turn<00:02:44.129> on<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.340> normal<00:02:44.849> map<00:02:45.000> we'll<00:02:45.120> kind<00:02:45.269> of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
turn on the normal map we'll kind of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.910 
turn on the normal map we'll kind of
spin<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:45.989> character<00:02:46.349> around<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.830> you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
spin this character around here and you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.589 
spin this character around here and you
can<00:02:47.040> see<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:47.280> soon<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:47.970> crank<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.299> normal

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
can see as soon as I crank that normal

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.699 
can see as soon as I crank that normal
map<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:49.049> got<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> nice<00:02:49.349> little<00:02:49.590> bit<00:02:49.680> of

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
map on we got a nice little bit of

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.140 
map on we got a nice little bit of
detail<00:02:50.040> happening<00:02:50.400> there<00:02:50.549> but<00:02:50.910> we're<00:02:51.030> really

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
detail happening there but we're really

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.910 
detail happening there but we're really
not<00:02:51.269> getting<00:02:51.510> any<00:02:51.840> bump<00:02:52.170> or<00:02:52.319> we're<00:02:52.799> not

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
not getting any bump or we're not

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.740 
not getting any bump or we're not
getting<00:02:53.130> even<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> displacement<00:02:53.760> happening<00:02:54.360> so

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
getting even a displacement happening so

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.539 
getting even a displacement happening so
let's<00:02:54.900> go<00:02:54.989> ahead<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.230> turn<00:02:55.410> on<00:02:55.620> our<00:02:55.920> vector

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
let's go ahead and turn on our vector

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.800 
let's go ahead and turn on our vector
displacement<00:02:56.940> map<00:02:57.329> now<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:57.660> worth

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
displacement map now it's worth

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.509 
displacement map now it's worth
mentioning<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.349> these<00:02:58.500> are<00:02:58.709> tangent<00:02:59.370> based

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
mentioning that these are tangent based

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.830 
mentioning that these are tangent based
vector<00:02:59.790> displacement<00:03:00.239> maps<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.510> came<00:03:00.720> out

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
vector displacement maps that came out

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.420 
vector displacement maps that came out
of<00:03:00.870> Mudbox<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.739> they<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:02.010> do<00:03:02.130> things<00:03:02.310> like

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
of Mudbox so they can do things like

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.009 
of Mudbox so they can do things like
under<00:03:02.790> cuts<00:03:02.970> as<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.180> start<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.510> increase<00:03:03.810> this

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
under cuts as I start to increase this

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.809 
under cuts as I start to increase this
displacement<00:03:04.440> height<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.459> see<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.730> we

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
displacement height you can see that we

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.789 
displacement height you can see that we
get<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.090> really<00:03:06.329> nice<00:03:06.660> sort<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:06.989> belly<00:03:07.500> fat

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
get that really nice sort of belly fat

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.410 
get that really nice sort of belly fat
happening<00:03:08.220> on<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.430> lizard<00:03:08.760> we<00:03:09.180> get<00:03:09.329> these

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
happening on this lizard we get these

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.759 
happening on this lizard we get these
little<00:03:09.630> bumps<00:03:09.810> sort<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.170> happening<00:03:10.530> here<00:03:10.680> and

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
little bumps sort of happening here and

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.319 
little bumps sort of happening here and
again<00:03:10.950> that's<00:03:11.099> all<00:03:11.310> based<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:11.880> vector

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
again that's all based on that vector

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.630 
again that's all based on that vector
displacement<00:03:12.840> map<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:14.130> let's<00:03:14.280> go<00:03:14.370> ahead<00:03:14.459> and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
displacement map so let's go ahead and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.460 
displacement map so let's go ahead and
play<00:03:14.760> around<00:03:14.880> with<00:03:15.060> our<00:03:15.299> diffuse<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.230> looks<00:03:16.410> a

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
play around with our diffuse it looks a

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.349 
play around with our diffuse it looks a
little<00:03:16.620> bit<00:03:16.799> harsh<00:03:17.579> right<00:03:17.910> now<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.239> we're

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
little bit harsh right now so we're

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.420 
little bit harsh right now so we're
gonna<00:03:18.420> use<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.930> softened<00:03:19.560> diffuse<00:03:19.889> for<00:03:20.100> skin

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
gonna use the softened diffuse for skin

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.069 
gonna use the softened diffuse for skin
and<00:03:20.609> what<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.120> does<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.569> sort<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.810> pushes

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
and what that does is it sort of pushes

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.559 
and what that does is it sort of pushes
the<00:03:22.470> transition<00:03:23.130> effect<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.609> what's<00:03:24.299> in

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
the transition effect of what's in

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.690 
the transition effect of what's in
shadow<00:03:24.870> versus<00:03:25.319> what's<00:03:25.530> not<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.920> shadow<00:03:26.190> to

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
shadow versus what's not in shadow to

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.309 
shadow versus what's not in shadow to
kind<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:26.970> soften<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.480> overall<00:03:27.840> effect<00:03:28.139> of

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
kind of soften the overall effect of

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.960 
kind of soften the overall effect of
that<00:03:28.560> skin<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.130> we'll<00:03:29.250> kind<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.489> turn<00:03:29.940> that

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
that skin so we'll kind of turn that

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.490 
that skin so we'll kind of turn that
switch<00:03:30.389> on<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.720> as<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.930> can<00:03:31.019> see<00:03:31.170> as<00:03:31.260> soon<00:03:31.410> as

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
switch on and as you can see as soon as

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.229 
switch on and as you can see as soon as
I<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.829> we<00:03:31.950> get<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.100> nice<00:03:32.700> kind<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:33.030> soft

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
I do that we get a nice kind of soft

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.090 
I do that we get a nice kind of soft
effect<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.200> watch<00:03:34.650> right<00:03:34.829> here<00:03:35.010> in

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
effect to that and watch right here in

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.770 
effect to that and watch right here in
the<00:03:35.190> arm<00:03:35.340> as<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.579> start<00:03:35.819> to<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.329> sort<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.569> area

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
the arm as I start to this sort of area

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.240 
the arm as I start to this sort of area
that's<00:03:36.959> directly<00:03:37.410> illuminated<00:03:37.920> versus<00:03:38.190> the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
that's directly illuminated versus the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.680 
that's directly illuminated versus the
area<00:03:38.459> that's<00:03:38.549> not<00:03:38.760> directly<00:03:39.150> limited<00:03:39.569> as<00:03:39.630> I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
area that's not directly limited as I

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.930 
area that's not directly limited as I
start<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.019> push<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.410> soft<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.100> fuse<00:03:41.310> value<00:03:41.700> you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
start to push this soft a fuse value you

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.580 
start to push this soft a fuse value you
you<00:03:42.269> can<00:03:42.389> see<00:03:42.510> we<00:03:42.600> get<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:42.810> nice<00:03:43.079> smooth

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
you can see we get this nice smooth

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.830 
you can see we get this nice smooth
transition<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.370> shadow<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.299> non<00:03:45.450> shadow

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
transition of shadow to non shadow

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.990 
transition of shadow to non shadow
transition<00:03:46.829> happening<00:03:47.250> let's<00:03:47.670> go<00:03:47.760> ahead<00:03:47.819> give

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
transition happening let's go ahead give

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.220 
transition happening let's go ahead give
this<00:03:48.120> guy<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.269> little<00:03:48.420> bit<00:03:48.569> more<00:03:48.720> ambient<00:03:49.139> light

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
this guy a little bit more ambient light

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.569 
this guy a little bit more ambient light
on<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.410> top<00:03:49.620> side<00:03:49.889> there<00:03:50.160> we'll<00:03:50.310> kind<00:03:50.519> of

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
on the top side there we'll kind of

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.050 
on the top side there we'll kind of
darken<00:03:51.000> up<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:52.230> bottom<00:03:52.530> side<00:03:52.709> slightly<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:54.000> it

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
darken up the bottom side slightly so it

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.460 
darken up the bottom side slightly so it
looks<00:03:54.209> pretty<00:03:54.389> good<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.200> next<00:03:55.230> thing

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
looks pretty good so the next thing

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.110 
looks pretty good so the next thing
we're<00:03:55.590> gonna<00:03:55.680> look<00:03:55.829> at<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.220> some<00:03:56.700> improvements

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
we're gonna look at is some improvements

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.370 
we're gonna look at is some improvements
that<00:03:57.150> we<00:03:57.299> can<00:03:57.329> make<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.810> our<00:03:57.840> specularity

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
that we can make to our specularity

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.050 
that we can make to our specularity
model<00:03:58.859> right<00:03:59.069> now<00:03:59.220> we<00:03:59.280> basically<00:03:59.549> are<00:03:59.819> just

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
model right now we basically are just

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.030 
model right now we basically are just
using<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.420> Phong<00:04:00.900> model<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.620> characters

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
using a Phong model on that characters

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.309 
using a Phong model on that characters
specularity<00:04:02.849> so<00:04:03.150> if<00:04:03.209> we<00:04:03.299> scroll<00:04:03.930> down<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.230> the

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
specularity so if we scroll down to the

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.680 
specularity so if we scroll down to the
spec<00:04:04.650> settings<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:05.549> this<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.880> we<00:04:05.970> turn<00:04:06.540> on

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
spec settings for this and we turn on

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.199 
spec settings for this and we turn on
use<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.109> map<00:04:07.319> that<00:04:07.739> kind<00:04:08.160> of<00:04:08.340> makes<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.000> look<00:04:09.120> a

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
use the map that kind of makes it look a

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.699 
use the map that kind of makes it look a
little<00:04:09.359> bit<00:04:09.599> better<00:04:09.750> but<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.049> want<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.470> have<00:04:10.680> a

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
little bit better but I want to have a

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.710 
little bit better but I want to have a
little<00:04:10.919> bit<00:04:11.010> harsher<00:04:11.639> specularity<00:04:12.359> coming

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
little bit harsher specularity coming

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.330 
little bit harsher specularity coming
across<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.019> glancing<00:04:13.590> angled<00:04:13.859> that<00:04:14.010> kind<00:04:14.280> of

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
across that glancing angled that kind of

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.379 
across that glancing angled that kind of
bright<00:04:14.609> light<00:04:14.760> that's<00:04:14.910> coming<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.269> from

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
bright light that's coming in from

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.900 
bright light that's coming in from
outside<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:16.289> if<00:04:16.349> we<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.590> switch<00:04:16.769> our<00:04:17.099> use

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
outside so if we just switch our use

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.400 
outside so if we just switch our use
spec<00:04:18.269> for<00:04:18.510> skin<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.930> can<00:04:19.079> see<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.260> we<00:04:19.320> get

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
spec for skin you can see that we get

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.409 
spec for skin you can see that we get
this<00:04:19.530> really<00:04:20.039> nice<00:04:20.220> realistic<00:04:20.940> looking

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
this really nice realistic looking

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.940 
this really nice realistic looking
specularity<00:04:21.900> model<00:04:22.349> across<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.740> back<00:04:22.919> of

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
specularity model across the back of

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.230 
specularity model across the back of
that<00:04:23.190> character<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.610> then<00:04:23.729> obviously<00:04:23.849> as<00:04:24.150> I

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
that character and then obviously as I

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.940 
that character and then obviously as I
transition<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.900> front<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.169> this<00:04:25.260> guy<00:04:25.409> it's

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
transition to the front of this guy it's

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.650 
transition to the front of this guy it's
gonna<00:04:26.070> have<00:04:26.220> this<00:04:26.280> very<00:04:26.729> kind<00:04:27.210> of

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
gonna have this very kind of

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.710 
gonna have this very kind of
soft<00:04:27.960> angelic<00:04:28.500> look<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:29.040> our<00:04:29.160> character<00:04:29.720> so

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
soft angelic look to our character so

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.610 
soft angelic look to our character so
the<00:04:30.810> next<00:04:30.960> thing<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.110> we<00:04:31.230> want<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.410> look<00:04:31.470> at

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
the next thing that we want to look at

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.650 
the next thing that we want to look at
really<00:04:31.860> quickly<00:04:32.160> as<00:04:32.250> translucence<00:04:33.060> what<00:04:33.510> kind

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
really quickly as translucence what kind

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.970 
really quickly as translucence what kind
of<00:04:33.690> scroll<00:04:34.020> down<00:04:34.200> here<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.470> bottom<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.920> the

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
of scroll down here to the bottom of the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.370 
of scroll down here to the bottom of the
list<00:04:35.220> here<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:36.030> translucence<00:04:36.630> works<00:04:36.870> pretty

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
list here so translucence works pretty

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.930 
list here so translucence works pretty
pretty<00:04:37.740> well<00:04:37.920> if<00:04:38.130> we<00:04:38.250> go<00:04:38.370> ahead<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.610> turn<00:04:38.730> this

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
pretty well if we go ahead and turn this

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.760 
pretty well if we go ahead and turn this
guy<00:04:39.030> on<00:04:39.150> anywhere<00:04:39.690> we<00:04:39.810> get<00:04:39.960> any<00:04:40.080> backlighting

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
guy on anywhere we get any backlighting

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.870 
guy on anywhere we get any backlighting
and<00:04:40.890> you<00:04:41.190> can<00:04:41.310> see<00:04:41.430> anywhere<00:04:41.670> there's<00:04:41.820> a

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
and you can see anywhere there's a

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.520 
and you can see anywhere there's a
directional<00:04:42.420> or<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:42.660> point<00:04:42.990> light<00:04:43.140> or<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.290> spot

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
directional or a point light or a spot

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.690 
directional or a point light or a spot
light<00:04:43.710> that's<00:04:44.070> sort<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.370> behind<00:04:44.580> the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
light that's sort of behind the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
light that's sort of behind the
character<00:04:45.060> we<00:04:45.180> started<00:04:45.420> to<00:04:45.480> get<00:04:45.570> this

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
character we started to get this

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.660 
character we started to get this
translucent<00:04:46.220> obviously<00:04:47.220> I've<00:04:47.340> got<00:04:47.520> the

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
translucent obviously I've got the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.520 
translucent obviously I've got the
default<00:04:48.210> settings<00:04:48.510> are<00:04:48.600> he<00:04:49.170> looks<00:04:49.380> like<00:04:49.470> a

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
default settings are he looks like a

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.530 
default settings are he looks like a
jelly<00:04:49.800> bean<00:04:49.980> so<00:04:50.190> let's<00:04:50.370> sort<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.610> dial<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.420> in

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
jelly bean so let's sort of dial this in

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.640 
jelly bean so let's sort of dial this in
a<00:04:51.630> little<00:04:51.810> bit<00:04:51.930> more<00:04:52.110> let's<00:04:52.260> go<00:04:52.380> ahead<00:04:52.440> just

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
a little bit more let's go ahead just

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.900 
a little bit more let's go ahead just
give<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.980> little<00:04:53.100> bit<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.310> translucency

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
give that a little bit of translucency

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.540 
give that a little bit of translucency
distortion<00:04:54.630> there<00:04:54.810> maybe<00:04:55.380> drop<00:04:56.070> that<00:04:56.280> power

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
distortion there maybe drop that power

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.430 
distortion there maybe drop that power
down<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:56.850> little<00:04:57.210> bit<00:04:57.390> or<00:04:57.540> put<00:04:57.570> shot<00:04:57.930> power<00:04:58.110> up

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
down a little bit or put shot power up

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.350 
down a little bit or put shot power up
we<00:04:58.890> can<00:04:59.010> also<00:04:59.130> use<00:04:59.370> maps<00:04:59.760> so<00:05:00.000> I've<00:05:00.090> went<00:05:00.270> ahead

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
we can also use maps so I've went ahead

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.030 
we can also use maps so I've went ahead
and<00:05:00.540> painted<00:05:00.690> another<00:05:01.080> map<00:05:01.290> in<00:05:01.500> Mudbox<00:05:01.680> it

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
and painted another map in Mudbox it

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.320 
and painted another map in Mudbox it
sort<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.220> just<00:05:02.370> makes<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.670> years<00:05:02.970> a<00:05:03.060> little<00:05:03.240> bit

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
sort of just makes it years a little bit

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.820 
sort of just makes it years a little bit
more<00:05:03.480> translucent<00:05:03.900> than<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.470> rest<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.740> the

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
more translucent than the rest of the

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.710 
more translucent than the rest of the
character<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.370> sort<00:05:05.880> of<00:05:05.910> spines<00:05:06.240> across<00:05:06.570> the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
character and sort of spines across the

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.060 
character and sort of spines across the
back<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:06.930> little<00:05:07.170> bit<00:05:07.290> of<00:05:07.380> translucent<00:05:07.680> in<00:05:07.980> the

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
back a little bit of translucent in the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.070 
back a little bit of translucent in the
face<00:05:08.280> so<00:05:08.520> if<00:05:08.820> we<00:05:08.910> turn<00:05:09.090> on<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.300> use<00:05:09.510> map<00:05:09.810> and

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
face so if we turn on that use map and

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.900 
face so if we turn on that use map and
I'll<00:05:10.380> just<00:05:10.620> overdrive<00:05:11.160> this<00:05:11.430> just<00:05:11.610> so<00:05:11.670> you<00:05:11.730> can

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
I'll just overdrive this just so you can

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.980 
I'll just overdrive this just so you can
really<00:05:12.180> see<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.480> effect<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:12.930> that

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
really see the effect of that

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.570 
really see the effect of that
translucent<00:05:13.560> sort<00:05:14.010> of<00:05:14.070> coming<00:05:14.340> through<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
translucent sort of coming through the

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.760 
translucent sort of coming through the
character's<00:05:14.970> ears<00:05:15.240> here<00:05:15.510> maybe<00:05:16.110> drop<00:05:16.620> that

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
character's ears here maybe drop that

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.350 
character's ears here maybe drop that
distortion<00:05:17.250> down<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.400> little<00:05:17.580> bit<00:05:17.730> more<00:05:17.910> you

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
distortion down a little bit more you

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.700 
distortion down a little bit more you
can<00:05:18.390> see<00:05:18.600> that<00:05:18.720> we<00:05:18.810> get<00:05:18.930> this<00:05:19.080> really<00:05:19.530> nice

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
can see that we get this really nice

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.500 
can see that we get this really nice
effect<00:05:20.310> obviously<00:05:20.790> if<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:20.970> turn<00:05:21.120> this<00:05:21.240> on<00:05:21.450> and

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
effect obviously if I turn this on and

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.090 
effect obviously if I turn this on and
off<00:05:21.690> you<00:05:21.900> can<00:05:22.050> see<00:05:22.170> the<00:05:22.200> contribution<00:05:22.650> of<00:05:22.980> that

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
off you can see the contribution of that

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.970 
off you can see the contribution of that
translucence<00:05:23.760> model<00:05:24.120> to<00:05:24.600> our<00:05:24.780> character<00:05:25.260> so

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
translucence model to our character so

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.890 
translucence model to our character so
those<00:05:26.130> are<00:05:26.280> just<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.550> few<00:05:26.580> examples<00:05:27.360> of<00:05:27.570> the

those are just a few examples of the

those are just a few examples of the
