00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
like they had some energy to move

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.470 
like they had some energy to move
forward<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.309> frustrated<00:00:36.000> because

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
forward but very frustrated because

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.260 
forward but very frustrated because
again<00:00:37.350> feeling<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.829> people<00:00:38.610> were<00:00:38.730> betraying

again feeling like people were betraying
them<00:00:39.570> even<00:00:39.899> though<00:00:39.989> things<00:00:40.230> might<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.649> moved

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
them even though things might have moved

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.209 
them even though things might have moved
very<00:00:41.160> little<00:00:41.550> bit<00:00:42.200> wasn't<00:00:43.200> enough<00:00:43.440> they

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
very little bit wasn't enough they

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.340 
very little bit wasn't enough they
wanted<00:00:44.610> more<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.180> wanted<00:00:45.450> things<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.870> get

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
wanted more they wanted things to get

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.490 
wanted more they wanted things to get
better<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.510> things<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.660> healthier<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.200> feel

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
better and things are healthier and feel

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.490 
better and things are healthier and feel
better<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.840> know<00:00:51.840> everybody<00:00:52.289> was

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
better but you know everybody was

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
better but you know everybody was
worried<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> not<00:00:53.340> sure<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> future

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
worried and not sure what the future

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.099 
worried and not sure what the future
holds<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.640> hoping<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.940> March<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:58.020> know

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
holds and hoping that in March you know

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.200 
holds and hoping that in March you know
because<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> season<00:00:59.010> changes<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.640> March<00:00:59.879> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
because the season changes in March that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.579 
because the season changes in March that
you<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:02.270> spring<00:01:03.350> approaches<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you know that as spring approaches that

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.969 
you know that as spring approaches that
things<00:01:05.159> will<00:01:05.369> begin<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:07.470> feel<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.830> they

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
things will begin to to feel that they

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.600 
things will begin to to feel that they
can<00:01:08.010> move<00:01:08.820> forward<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.950> do

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
can move forward and that what you do

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.320 
can move forward and that what you do
will<00:01:12.570> make<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> difference<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:14.760> way<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> turns

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
will make a difference the way it turns

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.960 
will make a difference the way it turns
out<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.930> March<00:01:16.790> we<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.530> first

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
out in March we see that in the first

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.870 
out in March we see that in the first
part<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> month<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.810> till<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.470> 12th

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
part of the month up till about the 12th

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.219 
part of the month up till about the 12th
there's<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:25.280> possibility<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.759> an<00:01:27.479> explosion<00:01:28.110> of

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
there's a possibility of an explosion of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630 
there's a possibility of an explosion of
some<00:01:28.470> kind<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.950> your<00:01:29.070> life<00:01:29.310> that's

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
some kind in your life that's

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.749 
some kind in your life that's
destructive<00:01:30.350> if<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.710> try<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> take<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.670> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
destructive if you try to take all this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.520 
destructive if you try to take all this
energy<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.360> you've<00:01:33.509> been<00:01:33.689> building<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
energy that you've been building up and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.170 
energy that you've been building up and
just<00:01:35.630> make<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.930> big<00:01:37.490> motion<00:01:38.490> or<00:01:38.640> movement<00:01:38.670> or

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
just make one big motion or movement or

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.980 
just make one big motion or movement or
decision<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.840> at<00:01:40.140> once<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.479> making<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
decision all at once and making it in a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.380 
decision all at once and making it in a
way<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.979> emotions<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:44.850> using

way with your emotions and not using
your<00:01:45.509> head<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.930> not<00:01:46.110> doing<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.920> slow

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
your head and not doing it in a slow

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.010 
your head and not doing it in a slow
thoughtful<00:01:49.110> reasonable<00:01:49.740> manner<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.840> if<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
thoughtful reasonable manner and if the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.749 
thoughtful reasonable manner and if the
ego<00:01:52.470> gets<00:01:52.500> too<00:01:53.009> much<00:01:53.189> involved<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:56.009> ego<00:01:56.490> is

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
ego gets too much involved the ego is

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.679 
ego gets too much involved the ego is
going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.329> cause<00:01:57.600> an<00:01:57.899> explosion<00:01:59.149> if<00:02:00.799> one<00:02:01.799> is

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
going to cause an explosion if one is

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.200 
going to cause an explosion if one is
humble<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.899> industrious<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.210> purposeful

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
humble and industrious and purposeful

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.570 
humble and industrious and purposeful
and<00:02:07.160> organized<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:09.179> plays<00:02:09.509> well<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:09.959> others

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
and organized and plays well with others

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.309 
and organized and plays well with others
then<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.060> pressure<00:02:12.390> will<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.780> let<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
then the pressure will be let out a

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.690 
then the pressure will be let out a
little

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
little

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.210 
little
time<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.690> turns<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.230> destructive<00:02:15.860> energy

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
time and it turns a destructive energy

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.009 
time and it turns a destructive energy
into<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.550> constructive<00:02:17.209> energy<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.870> only

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
into a constructive energy the only

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.449 
into a constructive energy the only
difference<00:02:18.410> between<00:02:18.530> destructive<00:02:19.310> and

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
difference between destructive and

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.720 
difference between destructive and
constructive<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:20.769> how<00:02:21.769> much<00:02:22.069> energy<00:02:22.459> is

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
constructive is how much energy is

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.720 
constructive is how much energy is
coming<00:02:23.180> out<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.980> what<00:02:25.190> way<00:02:25.310> you're<00:02:25.459> using

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
coming out and in what way you're using

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.790 
coming out and in what way you're using
