00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.969
 by critics as they are I am clearer not 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.320
 I've seen a new option we 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.090
 we found minecraft ultra sky wars and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.669
 a girl some found that is 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.640
 that and good is basically sky wars but 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:30.059
 that are ultra mega epic of their games or 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.160
 they are mega epics and we say and good 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:35.219
 we are here in the survival lobby 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.379
 wood and let them pardon the ip in 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.260
 description and good are teaching them 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.030
 because some people already know that no no 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.969
 I know why but they do not know how to register 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.760
 servers the premium so this is what 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.649
 premium and the truth can enter all 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.649
 people who want 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.770
 Let's see 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.750
 we will see first on the compass 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.240
 can enter is that same but good 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.690
 I'm stupid and I'm wrong about the first one 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.710
 we will give the bar register your password 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.400
 for example hello hello we give you enter and 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.400
 now he will ask you 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.840
 clear perfect now that has been all the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.299
 truth is recording good we will give to 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.430

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.870

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.840

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.490
 starting we have all these kits that the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.710
 they are really fine but the bad 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.870
 luck is that we can not need to be 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.470
 or something like that 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.240

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.130
 well if we give it back we can no longer 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.290
 change it like a crack but nothing 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.390
 we have the option of being able to take that 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.150
 to change the color of our video and 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.450
