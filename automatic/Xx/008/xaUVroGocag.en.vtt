00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.580
 get a discount 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.430
 as soon as I got out of the car and noticed 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.810
 that under my nose appeared the effect of steam 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.020
 departing from the mouth 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.480
 I made sure that my calculations were correct I 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.060
 successfully returned to that point in time where 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.669
 began his acquaintance with the world of the military 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.600
 crafts anger lich king 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.699
 you are just in time a5 you wait how are you 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.510
 I learned that I would be one such as I 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.640
 shrewd 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.730
 I remember you wore a hat from this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.800
 additions in the days of the flaming legion 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.290
 it's just ridiculous I don't understand what you mean 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.520
 you are a time traveler too yes 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.559
 it's true I got a bun, I watched 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.480
 do you have to tell you 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.820
 something shouldn't have flown into it 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.340
 addition why not because exactly 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.440
 then you started playing if two of your copies 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.830
 will meet then all 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.530
 space-time continuum 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.160
 broken okay it's not proven 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 science 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.690

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 everything is so epic could that seriously yes 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.830
 it could happen to everyone okay we 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.470
 must move so that he does not notice us 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.320
 well then we set off through these 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.750
 great lands of nostalgia for those searches 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.150
 people with whom you could potryndet 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.229
 death greet you ex 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.140

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.610
