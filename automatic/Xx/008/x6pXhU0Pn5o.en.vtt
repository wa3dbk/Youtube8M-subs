00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.700
 Hi everyone, today I present to you one 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.380
 garlic sauce as you can see me 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.270
 I got a nice booking for quite a while 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.100
 fresh adio and this is a sauce chi 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.470
 it can be spread on bread on 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.310
 really good bruschetta good good 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.670
 the characteristic of this sauce is 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.420
 that we will get it by cooking the garlic on 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.120
 oven with aromas and the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.850
 main or positive feature of 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.870
 this sauce is that it doesn't leave a bad one 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.200
 breath 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.530
 yo's main problem is that 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.260
 however it gives problems with halitosis e 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.600
 product to warn but it is so in this 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.780
 case this sauce is delicious and not 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.670
 leave no problem then the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 first thing we need to do is clean the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.500
 for I have here a baking sheet with paper 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.570
 you can see the oven here and us now 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.170
 let's go to adapt radio is really 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.310
 simple and quick to do then 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:19.130
 we cut the upper part into this 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.289
 so we want to study the whole part 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.310
 external we are only fresh more 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:29.979
 neighbor holding the whole head together 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.979
 of the year here it is and we put it in line 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.789
 we hope so here is my whole year 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.330
 it is ready as you can see some 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:41.209
 clove has broken off it doesn't matter 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.810
 so now I'm going to put here a 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.810
 bit of bb 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.100

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:17.570

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:19.730
 perfect olive add some malt and 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.400
 you can use the malt you prefer 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.040
 I took this recipe as a starting point for 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:32.150
 this recipe is a recipe I have 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:35.030
 found online while a bit of malt for 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:43.250

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:45.830
 false that it will be very good perfect put 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.480
 I put some fresh rosemary on top 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.739
 this way of bay leaves e 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.739
 covers with tinfoil 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:03.610
 your good so live does not 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.030

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.030
 minutes 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.959

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.680
 really very very simple look 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.140
 practically I take the mirror and it 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.569
 I drop into one 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:33.099
 little bowl look is really easy 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:36.519
 this is easy and very easy and soft 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:39.160

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.220

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.610
 bruschetta tonight with this sauce mi 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.160
 then I'll put some pictures at the end 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.110
 so I proceed to the end once 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.700
 done all this work by one 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:01.650
 mixed with the sauce and if necessary a 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.650
 just salt and pepper 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.470
 and just a climax is the clove is 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.170
 become so soft to be already 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.449
 a cream 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.030
 I opted for coverage with cast 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.650
 with tinfoil because I already had it 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.210
 obviously tried making this recipe 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.770
 it was the first time she had burnt me 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.560
 a singed piece of garlic a little bit 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:37.100
 instead I prefer it to remain so beautiful 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:43.310
 nice soft and without burns then 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:46.039
 I continue then this is the sauce that 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.720
 I just got the garlic 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.280
 this is the mixing of the slices 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.900
 what remains of the usurper 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.370
 to garlic and now I show you 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.419
 the application practically I go 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.490
 to spread it inside a focaccia 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.400

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.620

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.910
 link practically I take mine 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.650
 killer and spal but it is as I said it can 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.510
 be used both on bruschetta 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.490
 which inserted as a filling in a slice 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.900
 of focaccia or bread or of what 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:26.449
