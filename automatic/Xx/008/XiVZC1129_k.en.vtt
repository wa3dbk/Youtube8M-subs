modes on at the rear and the difficulty
level<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.590> this<00:00:54.739> is<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.070> 1<00:00:55.730> but<00:00:56.149> let's<00:00:56.870> open<00:00:57.110> this

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
level on this is a 1 but let's open this

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.620 
level on this is a 1 but let's open this
up<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:57.800> see<00:00:57.920> exactly<00:00:58.430> what<00:00:59.210> they<00:00:59.360> look<00:00:59.390> like

and what they can do so here they are
Optimus<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.250> Predaking<00:01:05.239> now<00:01:05.390> each<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.869> these

so<00:01:09.439> that<00:01:09.619> is<00:01:09.950> your<00:01:10.310> dimensions<00:01:11.060> for<00:01:11.390> these

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
so that is your dimensions for these

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.109 
so that is your dimensions for these

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
which is enough to take those weapons

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.669 
which is enough to take those weapons
and<00:02:07.189> keep<00:02:07.340> them<00:02:07.520> nice<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:08.119> secure<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:08.899> it's

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
and keep them nice and secure so it's

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.819 
and keep them nice and secure so it's
just<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:10.039> quick<00:02:10.340> spin<00:02:10.789> of<00:02:11.030> Optimus<00:02:11.569> in<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.409> robot

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
just a quick spin of Optimus in a robot

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.610 
just a quick spin of Optimus in a robot
mode<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.849> course<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:15.079> will<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.590> a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
mode and then of course we will have a

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.309 
mode and then of course we will have a
look<00:02:15.799> at<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.670> evil<00:02:17.239> Predaking

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
look at the evil Predaking

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.520 
look at the evil Predaking
solar<00:02:18.620> spring<00:02:18.950> Predaking<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.170> normal

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
solar spring Predaking in is it normal

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.640 
solar spring Predaking in is it normal
robot<00:02:21.800> mode<00:02:22.520> we<00:02:22.849> do<00:02:23.090> also<00:02:23.420> get<00:02:23.870> some<00:02:24.170> weaponry

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
robot mode we do also get some weaponry

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.880 
robot mode we do also get some weaponry
we

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
we

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.450 
we
this<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:26.330> one<00:02:26.569> has<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.860> flicker

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
this and this one has the flicker

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.440 
this and this one has the flicker
missile<00:02:29.000> as<00:02:29.300> well<00:02:29.600> which<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.410> can<00:02:30.980> as<00:02:31.520> Optimus

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
missile as well which you can as Optimus

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.440 
missile as well which you can as Optimus
you<00:02:33.080> can<00:02:33.290> activate<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.220> by<00:02:34.550> just<00:02:35.150> pushing

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
you can activate that by just pushing

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.870 
you can activate that by just pushing
the<00:02:35.750> back<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.350> then<00:02:37.069> that<00:02:37.100> will<00:02:37.490> call<00:02:37.730> my

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
the back and then that will call my

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.990 
the back and then that will call my
flipping<00:02:38.540> elf<00:02:38.780> flicking<00:02:39.290> out<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.730> is

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
well does make this figure stand out

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.130 
well does make this figure stand out
very<00:03:10.130> nicely<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.880> can<00:03:10.940> move<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.420> leg<00:03:11.630> at<00:03:12.080> the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
top and after the ANU jaunt as well we

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.110 
top and after the ANU jaunt as well we
get<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.900> wings<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.310> ridge<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.670> sprawling

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
get the wings to the ridge of sprawling

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.410 
get the wings to the ridge of sprawling
goats<00:03:17.450> giving<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.680> really<00:03:19.040> cool<00:03:19.430> effects

goats giving it that really cool effects
so<00:03:20.630> let's<00:03:21.050> convert<00:03:21.709> both<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.370> these<00:03:22.550> names<00:03:22.880> see

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
so let's convert both of these names see

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.110 
so let's convert both of these names see
what<00:03:23.900> they<00:03:24.080> look<00:03:24.320> like<00:03:24.350> in<00:03:24.830> their<00:03:25.459> alternate

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
what they look like in their alternate

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.580 
what they look like in their alternate
modes<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:27.700> here<00:03:28.700> they<00:03:29.030> are<00:03:29.329> both<00:03:29.690> converted

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
modes and here they are both converted

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.640 
modes and here they are both converted
let's<00:03:30.860> start<00:03:31.220> by<00:03:31.430> looking<00:03:31.850> at<00:03:32.720> Optimus

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
let's start by looking at Optimus

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.460 
let's start by looking at Optimus
looking<00:03:34.130> extremely<00:03:34.489> meaty<00:03:34.940> there<00:03:35.299> in<00:03:35.660> his

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
looking extremely meaty there in his

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.009 
looking extremely meaty there in his
vehicle<00:03:37.010> form<00:03:37.820> we<00:03:38.090> do<00:03:38.239> have<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.570> six<00:03:38.810> wheels

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
vehicle form we do have the six wheels

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.350 
vehicle form we do have the six wheels
now<00:03:39.260> converted<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.070> bottom<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:41.120> can

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
now converted to the bottom so you can

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.660 
now converted to the bottom so you can
use<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:41.780> as<00:03:42.079> a<00:03:42.290> fully<00:03:42.620> functional<00:03:43.160> play<00:03:43.400> toy

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
use that as a fully functional play toy

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.350 
use that as a fully functional play toy
and<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.540> weaponry<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.290> now<00:03:45.560> clipped<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:47.209> the

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
and the weaponry is now clipped to the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.270 
and the weaponry is now clipped to the
side<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.989> then<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.650> rear<00:03:48.860> we<00:03:48.980> have<00:03:49.010> this

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
side and then to the rear we have this

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.870 
side and then to the rear we have this
silver<00:03:49.940> enclosure<00:03:50.660> which<00:03:51.530> does<00:03:51.860> set<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.670> rear

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
silver enclosure which does set the rear

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.660 
silver enclosure which does set the rear
of<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.239> vehicle<00:03:53.420> off<00:03:53.750> very<00:03:54.680> nicely<00:03:54.950> but<00:03:55.489> there

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
of the vehicle off very nicely but there

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.180 
of the vehicle off very nicely but there
you<00:03:55.760> go<00:03:55.880> at<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.180> these<00:03:56.510> are<00:03:56.660> Optimus<00:03:57.170> I<00:03:57.470> think

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
you go at that these are Optimus I think

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.910 
you go at that these are Optimus I think
extremely<00:03:58.459> mean<00:03:58.970> from<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.329> front<00:03:59.780> now<00:04:00.380> on<00:04:00.620> to

cool<00:04:03.650> is<00:04:03.950> that

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
cool is that

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.600 
cool is that
doesn't<00:04:05.000> sit<00:04:05.209> very<00:04:05.600> well<00:04:05.780> on<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.320> legs<00:04:06.610> the
