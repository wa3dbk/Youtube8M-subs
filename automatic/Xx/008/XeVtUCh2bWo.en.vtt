00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
the desired value as you can see these

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.770 
the desired value as you can see these
long<00:03:23.569> wires<00:03:24.910> they<00:03:25.910> actually<00:03:26.329> carries<00:03:26.690> a

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
long wires they actually carries a

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
current from the controller board to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.569 
current from the controller board to
these<00:03:28.549> offset<00:03:29.150> circuits<00:03:30.459> essentially<00:03:31.459> the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
these offset circuits essentially the

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.789 
these offset circuits essentially the
offset<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:31.940> given<00:03:32.329> to<00:03:32.420> detect<00:03:32.840> negative

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
offset is given to detect negative

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.830 
offset is given to detect negative
current<00:03:34.040> as<00:03:34.160> well<00:03:34.370> as<00:03:35.120> peace<00:03:35.420> or<00:03:35.569> cannot

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
current as well as peace or cannot

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.640 
current as well as peace or cannot
detect<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.410> amplify<00:03:36.829> negative<00:03:37.220> currents<00:03:38.650> so

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
detect and amplify negative currents so

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.550 
detect and amplify negative currents so
that's<00:03:40.190> about<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.790> harder<00:03:41.180> let<00:03:42.079> us<00:03:42.170> move<00:03:42.349> with

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
that's about the harder let us move with

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:52.180 
that's about the harder let us move with
the<00:03:42.650> demonstration

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.960 

so<00:03:53.190> here<00:03:53.849> is<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.120> motor<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.220> see<00:03:56.610> some

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
so here is the motor you can see some

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.530 
so here is the motor you can see some
scrap<00:03:57.780> around<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.500> have<00:03:58.830> done<00:03:58.860> something

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
scrap around it I have done something

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.960 
scrap around it I have done something
some<00:04:00.540> tape<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.110> some<00:04:01.470> paper<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:02.489> make<00:04:02.520> sure

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
some tape and some paper to make sure

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.880 
some tape and some paper to make sure
you<00:04:03.209> can<00:04:03.420> give<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.959> motor<00:04:04.140> spinning<00:04:04.470> actually

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
you can give the motor spinning actually

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.150 
you can give the motor spinning actually
and<00:04:05.540> then<00:04:06.540> these<00:04:06.840> are<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.140> test<00:04:07.380> points<00:04:07.800> from

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
and then these are the test points from

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.979 
and then these are the test points from
where<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.400> take<00:04:08.730> out<00:04:08.910> few<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.510> variables

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
where I take out few of the variables

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.650 
where I take out few of the variables

inside p sock three how to the Oslo
scope<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:13.830> can<00:04:14.010> view<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.370> waveforms

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
scope so that you can view the waveforms

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.409 
scope so that you can view the waveforms
as<00:04:14.970> well<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.980> is<00:04:17.130> how<00:04:17.310> it's<00:04:17.549> connected<00:04:18.030> to

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
as well so this is how it's connected to

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.140 
as well so this is how it's connected to
the<00:04:19.459> otoscope<00:04:20.459> DSO<00:04:22.550> so<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.940> can<00:04:24.120> view

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.120 
sure the speed pot is at minimum speed
so<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.870> motor<00:04:34.080> doesn't<00:04:34.169> give<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.680> jerk<00:04:34.979> or

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
so that the motor doesn't give a jerk or

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.840 
so that the motor doesn't give a jerk or
this<00:04:35.280> beginning<00:04:36.229> i'm<00:04:37.229> using<00:04:37.620> switch<00:04:38.160> one<00:04:38.520> in

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
this beginning i'm using switch one in

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.879 
this beginning i'm using switch one in
this<00:04:39.150> case<00:04:39.419> for<00:04:39.780> start<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.200> stop<00:04:40.380> operation

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
this case for start and stop operation

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.070 
this case for start and stop operation
you<00:04:41.040> can<00:04:41.190> use<00:04:41.340> switch<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.820> also<00:04:42.210> just<00:04:42.870> make

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
you can use switch to also just make

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.800 
you can use switch to also just make
sure<00:04:43.290> that<00:04:43.530> correct<00:04:43.830> switch<00:04:44.040> is<00:04:44.160> connected<00:04:44.810> so

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
sure that correct switch is connected so

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.810 
sure that correct switch is connected so
here<00:04:46.350> we<00:04:46.500> go

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.000 

that's<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.750> reset<00:04:52.080> button<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:52.590> can<00:04:52.770> use<00:04:52.980> it

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
that's the reset button you can use it

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.190 
that's the reset button you can use it
to<00:04:53.340> start<00:04:53.940> in<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.180> emergency<00:04:54.480> cases<00:04:54.810> at<00:04:55.050> all

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
to start in the emergency cases at all

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.810 
to start in the emergency cases at all
so<00:04:55.920> here<00:04:56.460> it's<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:57.510> motors<00:04:57.860> started<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.610> i<00:04:59.730> am

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
so here it's the motors started and i am

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:07.780 
so here it's the motors started and i am
just<00:05:00.000> raising<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.720> speed<00:05:00.960> slowly<00:05:02.900> let's<00:05:03.900> see

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:15.160 

and<00:05:08.790> here<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:10.470> can<00:05:10.620> see<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.950> motor<00:05:11.160> spinning

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.820 

its<00:05:16.170> spinning<00:05:16.350> good<00:05:16.920> and<00:05:17.750> this<00:05:18.750> shows<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.050> PWM

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
its spinning good and this shows the PWM

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.630 
its spinning good and this shows the PWM
duty<00:05:20.460> cycles<00:05:24.800> those<00:05:25.800> duty<00:05:26.190> cycles<00:05:26.490> are

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
duty cycles those duty cycles are

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.160 
duty cycles those duty cycles are
essentially<00:05:27.630> differential<00:05:28.230> sinusoids<00:05:30.170> you

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
essentially differential sinusoids you

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.360 
essentially differential sinusoids you
can<00:05:31.320> see<00:05:31.560> both<00:05:33.140> the<00:05:34.140> frequency<00:05:34.860> of<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:35.130> duty

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
can see both the frequency of the duty

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.160 
can see both the frequency of the duty
cycle<00:05:35.460> is<00:05:35.610> nothing<00:05:35.940> but<00:05:36.090> electrical<00:05:36.630> hurts<00:05:36.960> of

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
cycle is nothing but electrical hurts of

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.300 
cycle is nothing but electrical hurts of
the<00:05:37.410> motor<00:05:37.620> speed<00:05:39.980> electrical<00:05:40.980> hurts<00:05:41.160> is

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
the motor speed electrical hurts is

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.710 
the motor speed electrical hurts is
nothing<00:05:41.610> but<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.910> rate<00:05:42.060> at<00:05:42.270> which<00:05:42.300> some<00:05:42.570> water

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
nothing but the rate at which some water

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.720 
nothing but the rate at which some water
is<00:05:42.870> being<00:05:43.020> commentated<00:05:43.620> in<00:05:44.100> this<00:05:44.310> case<00:05:44.520> we<00:05:44.670> are

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
is being commentated in this case we are

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.270 
is being commentated in this case we are
using<00:05:44.790> eight<00:05:45.150> pole<00:05:45.390> motor<00:05:45.540> so<00:05:46.280> it's

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
using eight pole motor so it's

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.050 
using eight pole motor so it's
essentially<00:05:48.890> 144<00:05:49.890> times<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.430> mechanical

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
essentially 144 times the mechanical

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.650 
essentially 144 times the mechanical
speed<00:05:51.300> or<00:05:51.690> 14<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.290> electrical<00:05:52.770> mechanical

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
speed or 14 the electrical mechanical

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.510 
speed or 14 the electrical mechanical
time<00:05:54.660> period<00:05:55.020> so<00:05:55.620> you<00:05:55.680> can<00:05:55.920> see<00:05:56.100> the<00:05:56.340> motor

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
time period so you can see the motor

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.270 
time period so you can see the motor
spinning<00:05:56.880> faster<00:05:57.390> I<00:05:57.770> don't<00:05:58.770> know<00:05:58.860> how<00:05:59.010> clear

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
spinning faster I don't know how clear

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.610 
spinning faster I don't know how clear
it<00:05:59.400> is<00:05:59.430> but<00:05:59.910> I<00:06:00.180> think<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:01.080> Oslo<00:06:01.410> scope

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
it is but I think the Oslo scope

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.490 
it is but I think the Oslo scope
waveform<00:06:02.010> should<00:06:02.220> look<00:06:02.490> better<00:06:02.730> yeah<00:06:03.510> you<00:06:04.350> can

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
waveform should look better yeah you can

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.890 
waveform should look better yeah you can
see<00:06:04.650> the<00:06:04.770> frequency<00:06:05.190> change<00:06:05.430> now<00:06:06.360> I<00:06:06.390> will

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
see the frequency change now I will

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.860 
see the frequency change now I will
gradually<00:06:07.500> vary<00:06:08.100> the<00:06:08.310> speed<00:06:08.460> you<00:06:09.300> can<00:06:09.480> see<00:06:09.690> how

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
gradually vary the speed you can see how

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.120 
gradually vary the speed you can see how
the<00:06:09.930> frequency<00:06:10.680> of<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:11.100> wave<00:06:11.370> form<00:06:11.820> changes

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
the frequency of the wave form changes

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:26.420 
the frequency of the wave form changes
you<00:06:14.130> can<00:06:14.280> see<00:06:14.490> i<00:06:15.260> am<00:06:16.260> just<00:06:16.470> varying<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:16.890> speed

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.900 

and<00:06:27.060> you<00:06:27.240> can<00:06:27.390> see<00:06:27.570> in<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:27.750> motor<00:06:27.960> also

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
and you can see in the motor also

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.700 
and you can see in the motor also
because<00:06:29.910> of<00:06:30.030> the<00:06:30.060> arrangement<00:06:30.540> I<00:06:30.630> did<00:06:30.840> you<00:06:31.560> can

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
because of the arrangement I did you can

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.580 
because of the arrangement I did you can
see<00:06:31.950> how<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.220> speed<00:06:32.580> changes<00:06:33.200> based<00:06:34.200> on<00:06:34.410> my

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
see how the speed changes based on my

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.530 
see how the speed changes based on my
gradual<00:06:34.980> variations<00:06:35.550> the<00:06:36.000> potentiometer<00:06:39.500> so

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
gradual variations the potentiometer so

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.600 
gradual variations the potentiometer so
that<00:06:42.540> wraps<00:06:42.900> up<00:06:43.170> this<00:06:43.890> video<00:06:44.400> demonstration

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
that wraps up this video demonstration

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.820 
that wraps up this video demonstration
so<00:06:47.610> before<00:06:48.150> I<00:06:48.180> stop<00:06:48.750> the<00:06:49.020> motor<00:06:49.230> I<00:06:49.500> should

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
so before I stop the motor I should

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.630 
so before I stop the motor I should
gradually<00:06:50.490> bring<00:06:50.790> the<00:06:50.910> speed<00:06:51.240> down<00:06:51.450> and<00:06:52.640> just

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
gradually bring the speed down and just

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.930 
gradually bring the speed down and just
bring<00:06:53.850> the<00:06:54.150> speed<00:06:54.480> slowly<00:06:55.260> 20<00:06:55.800> or<00:06:55.980> even<00:06:56.040> I<00:06:56.790> can

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
bring the speed slowly 20 or even I can

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.210 
bring the speed slowly 20 or even I can
press<00:06:57.510> the<00:06:57.660> stop<00:06:57.900> button<00:06:57.930> and<00:06:58.320> the<00:06:58.470> speed<00:06:59.070> will

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
press the stop button and the speed will

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.020 
press the stop button and the speed will
come<00:06:59.400> down<00:06:59.580> oh<00:06:59.760> it<00:07:00.480> stopped<00:07:01.490> yeah<00:07:02.490> the<00:07:02.820> motor

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
come down oh it stopped yeah the motor

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.020 
come down oh it stopped yeah the motor
stayed<00:07:03.360> I<00:07:03.570> mean<00:07:04.200> it's<00:07:05.160> not<00:07:05.340> rotating<00:07:05.730> anything

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
stayed I mean it's not rotating anything

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.740 
stayed I mean it's not rotating anything
so<00:07:06.750> that's<00:07:07.050> it<00:07:07.170> thank<00:07:07.410> you<00:07:07.470> for<00:07:07.530> watching
