00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.060
 A curious theory about the structure of our planet circulates on the internet. 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.820
 The hypothesis, also broadcast on YouTube (ahem), proposes that, instead of living in a 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.789
 Solid planet, we live on a hollow planet, in whose center there is a sun. 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.270
 We, inhabitants of the surface, can access the inner face of the Earth through 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.220
 of two holes located at the poles that our governments conceal and censor. 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.910
 The inner face of the Earth, like the outer face, has seas, rivers, mountains, 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.300
 vegetation and animals like mammoths, even speculate with intra-terrestrial civilizations, 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.350
 with amazing technology like flying saucers. 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.940
 Is this model possible? 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.550
 Well, there's a law with two hundred years old that has something to say: The Law 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.089
 de Gauss, the first of the four laws that explain all electromagnetic phenomena. 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.429
 You will be asked: What does electromagnetism have to do with the shape of the Earth? 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.979
 You'll know right away, but let's see what Gauss's law tells us, so let's put 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.249
 analogy ON mode and let's start. 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.550
 Let's take a Willyrex with its loaded AK-47, and imagine it shooting at a 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.400
 flat surface. 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.040
 To know how the quality of your shots have been, we are going to use a physical entity 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.110
 called Flow. 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.480
 The flow is the product of the velocity of the bullet, by the area that it crosses, by a 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.250
 factor relative to the angle of incidence. 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.030
 Look: If the bullet enters perpendicular to the surface, the flow takes a maximum value; 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.590
 if it runs parallel it is 0, because it has not crossed the surface; if it goes through 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.570
 perpendicular but in the opposite direction then it reaches its minimum value and is negative; Y 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.760
 if the bullet crosses it with an inclination then the flow takes intermediate values 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.580
 to the previous ones. 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.310
 The thing gets complicated when you have to measure the flow on a curved surface. 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.270
 If Willyrex went crazy to shoot at this surface, each bullet would enter with 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.830
 different inclination at each point ... How do we calculate the flow in this situation? 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.240
 We make use of a very useful trick: we take the surface and divide it into pieces so 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.640
 small ones that are practically flat, and there we apply our flow as before. 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.120
 To finish, we add all the "mini-flows" and that total is our flow on the surface. 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.750
 Finally, what would happen to the flow if this surface were closed? 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.090
 The crucial difference is Willyrex's location, inside or outside. 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.010
 If it is inside, all the bullets will go from inside to outside, so the sum will have 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.360
 a certain value greater than zero. 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.910
 If it is out, each of the bullets will go first from the outside to the inside giving us a value 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.260
 greater than zero. 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.780
 But when the bullets come off the surface, since we have set an orientation for 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.130
 the surface, the flow at these points will be negative. 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.930
 In fact, due to geometrical reasons, these two flows cancel, giving us a total flow 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.290
 equal to zero. 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.750
 In short, if you shoot from the outside, the flow is null. 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.280
 One moment, that means that if we take a sphere and put two Willyrexes inside 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.940
 and three outside, all the shots made by those outside are not going to affect the flow 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.570
 of the sphere, because we have seen that every burst that enters and exits has zero flow, so 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.940
 that only the Willyrexes that are inside the sphere count. 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.850
 If we assume that each Willyrex always has the same firing rate, we can say that 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.240
 the flow of bullets from a closed surface is proportional only to the number of Willyrexes 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.349
 that there is within it ... Law of Gauss applied to Willyrex! 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.870
 Well, maybe this is not the best example, because this Law can only be applied to phenomena 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.290
 that change with the square of the distance, that is, if one of these bullets has traveled 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.980
 a distance X with a speed V, if it travels twice as long the speed must have been 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.340
 reduced to a quarter of the previous one. 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.270
 If this is not the case, there is NO GAUSS LAW. 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.640
 The electric field does have this property, so we can define a Law of Gauss, 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.110
 only that instead of bullets, we have field lines, and instead of Willyrexes we have charges, 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.910
 that give us more play, because we have positive and 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.069
 negative 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.941
 Now we define the flow as the value of the electric field on the surface, 

00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:53.800
 the area, by the incidence factor. 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.520
 Imagine, for example, that we put a positive charge on a closed surface 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.120
 and a negative. 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.330
 The field lines would emerge from the positive and die in the negative. 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.150
 As you can see, every field line that leaves comes back in, so the total flow is zero. 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.849
 The law of Gauss confirms it, because it says that the flow of the electric field on the surface 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.880
 is proportional to the number of charges within it: Negative charge plus positive charge, same 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.840
 to zero, which implies zero flow. 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.020
 The interesting thing is that Gauss's Law can also be applied to the gravitational field, where 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.590
 the flow of the gravitational field on a surface is proportional to the mass that is within 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.060
 it, where now the flow is the value of the gravitational field on the surface, by the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.830
 area, by the incidence factor. 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.270
 The Earth produces a gravitational field around it that attracts objects with mass 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.270
 towards itself 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.770
 Now we ask ourselves: in the hypothetical hollow Earth that some pose, what would be 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.240
 the gravitational field inside it? 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 Let's put Gauss's Law into action. 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.500
 As before, let's imagine a spherical surface the size of the supposed hole in the Earth, 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.380
 and calculate the flow here. 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.090
 By Gauss's law, since within this surface there is no mass, then the flow is ZERO. 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.940
 That the flow is zero does not imply that the field is zero ... but we can see that it does in this case. 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.930
 We assume that there are no gaps in the Poles, as it will only create an edge effect. 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.150
 And now attentive: we choose a point of the surface, the whole mass of the Earth influences 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.830
 in the gravity of that point so that. 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.810
 If we choose another point, we see that the gravity is the same as before. 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.580
 In fact, in all the points of the surface we have the same gravity, because we have a 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.950
 spherical symmetry. 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.950
 Just a moment! 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.270
 The gravity is the same everywhere, then it is not necessary to use the "mini-flows": 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.389
 you just have to multiply the field by the area of ​​the sphere, which will give us the 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:39.389
 flow. 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.200
 Since the flow is zero, or the field or area must be zero, and since the area is not zero, 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.110
 the field has to be zero, there is no gravity inside the sphere! 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.971
 There is no force that holds the water of the rivers, the seeds of the trees, nor 

00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:52.669
 to the intraterrestrials to the surface. 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.490
 Moreover, if, as this theory says, we put a Sun inside, using the Law again 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.570
 of Gauss, we could see that absolutely everything would be attracted to the Sun and maybe 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.890
 until the Earth itself. 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.350
 Then, could the Earth be hollow? 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.560
 Maybe Gauss's Law does not completely refute this model, but it does contribute to the 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.240
 list of geological and physical tests that show that the Earth is solid. 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.030
 Science, it Works, bitches! 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.650
 and if you want more science hit that subscription. 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.750
