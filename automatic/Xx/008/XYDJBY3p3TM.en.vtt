00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.709
 you miss some genre the nintendo laptop so do not suffer 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.619
 plus the genres both make a more than decent comeback with a title of 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.630
 ubisoft titled coop to appeal for nintendo ds 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.929
 history takes us to new york where a young runner illegal racing 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.380
 has the opportunity to choose between being imprisoned by this 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.500
 careers for working for a city police detective 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.430
 flame exceeds being the detective's messenger to help him solve the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.850
 more than 60 cases that open the game complicating the argued as 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.670
 let's complete the adventure 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.409
 the game can be divided into two large parts 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.049
 the missions on foot and the missions of driving in the missions on foot 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.039
 we will have nine different weapons in power and recharge speed that is 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.300
 adapt to moments 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.370
 concrete mission 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.810
 some were bidding that we have to hide between objects for 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.390
 not be seen as metal gear solid instead others were assault where 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.940
 draw we have the weapon and we want to attack everyone who puts on 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.580
 in front of a variant of this type of missions we will have a command from the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.730
 police that we must achieve strategically placing each 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.170
 police affiliated in different positions in the area 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.500
 the control to shoot goes pretty badly stopped by how difficult it is 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.040
 control the shots 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.040
 and how fast the enemies move 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.660
 mined mission 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.730
 in the driving missions we will assemble a good variety of 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.790
 Vehicles mainly cars in which we will perform such varied tasks 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.950
 how to intercept vehicles on the run 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.740
 discreetly pursued other vehicles 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.950
 transport merchandise with trucks 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.420
 use motorboats 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.020
 and make car racing all over the city of new york 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.650
 with multiple variables like dense traffic 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.940
 o'barry those who explode on the track 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.659
 the driving part of the game is better balanced 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.990
 and they are for the most part the mission is most fun of the game 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.479
 our main ally will be an electronic device called 3 c the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.130
 which we will use constantly to take us off to continue in the adventure its 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.330
 The main use will be the gps to locate the premises or places to 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.060
 that we must address then we can also open doors 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.599
 e-mails by entering the corresponding numeric code 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.750
 call an ambulance to see the city's security cameras 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.309
 record enemy conversations today even take pictures 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.909
 finally we will have other complementary elements I lent it 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.189
 as a wikipedia in which we can read information about the characters 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.859
 the special characteristics of vehicles and weapons 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.849
 visually we find ourselves with an impressive title regarding the 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.909
 City architecture and the effects of light are concerned 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.679
 the negative aspect is in the design of the characters in 3d 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.340
 These characters are very neat 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.859
 identifiable coconut 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.959
 and with very rigid and unreal animations, the sound section does not 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.209
 rid of the criticism since the soundtrack of the game is scarce 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.399
 and just a couple of title songs are saved 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:04.040
 if not enough with the 60 missions spread throughout the city 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.210
 we will also have an achievement section 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.010
 incer secondary to extend the duration of the title 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.759
 how to stop robbers in stores in the city 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.929
 take photographs or knock down special fences hidden in the 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.929
 alleyways iker is block shortcuts 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:20.669
 to appeal 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.680
 He has very good ideas and the girdle dowries 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.199
 He also said that third place 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.649
 up to seven shots 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:30.039
 and a sound section too 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.139
 to the players who enjoyed the gth aina frau poor's 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.109
 this title will appear to you as coming from heaven 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.129
 the rest of the players of great level 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.839
 the game that started them in the sandbox genre 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:44.849
 as long as they have patience with some levels that are compensated 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.639
 with other more dynamic and spectacular situations
