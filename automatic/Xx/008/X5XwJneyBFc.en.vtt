feel like we know the lives we led right
and<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.810> think<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.529> they're<00:00:28.830> taking<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.279> off

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and I think that they're taking it off

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.880 
and I think that they're taking it off
of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.060> unauthorized<00:00:30.929> book<00:00:31.320> by<00:00:31.500> Dustin

Diamond right so it's a little silly to
give<00:00:33.809> credence<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.440> when<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.070> know<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
give credence to that when we know the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
give credence to that when we know the
innocence<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> joy<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.440> shared
