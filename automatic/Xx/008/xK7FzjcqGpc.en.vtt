well<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.580> my<00:00:26.730> opinion<00:00:27.090> there<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.240> three<00:00:27.539> major

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
well in my opinion there are three major

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.419 
well in my opinion there are three major
things<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.199> separate<00:00:28.650> ultrabook<00:00:29.099> from<00:00:29.310> your

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
things that separate ultrabook from your

are very very thin most of them coming
in<00:00:35.579> at<00:00:35.700> well<00:00:35.940> under<00:00:36.270> an<00:00:36.360> inch<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.230> top<00:00:37.860> of

what<00:00:42.780> separates<00:00:43.079> an<00:00:43.260> ultrabook<00:00:43.620> from

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
what separates an ultrabook from

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.680 
what separates an ultrabook from
something<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.309> an<00:00:44.460> ultra<00:00:44.760> portable<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
something like an ultra portable is the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.060 
something like an ultra portable is the
fact<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.050> ultrabook<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.620> really<00:00:46.890> made<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
fact that an ultrabook is really made to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.369 
fact that an ultrabook is really made to
be<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> primary<00:00:48.090> computer<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
be a primary computer so it's going to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.750 
be a primary computer so it's going to
have<00:00:49.469> plenty<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.739> speed<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> plenty<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> power

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
have plenty of speed and plenty of power

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.299 
have plenty of speed and plenty of power
to<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.120> most<00:00:51.420> any<00:00:51.660> task<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
to do most any task now you will be a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.770 
to do most any task now you will be a
little<00:00:53.579> bit<00:00:53.670> shy<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.090> ports<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.600> most

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
little bit shy on ports for the most

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.150 
little bit shy on ports for the most
part<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.140> they're<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.559> thin<00:00:55.800> there's<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
part as they're very thin there's not a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.040 
part as they're very thin there's not a
whole<00:00:56.280> lot<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> room<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.820> add<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:57.899> for

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
whole lot of room to add a lot but for

whole lot of room to add a lot but for
the<00:00:58.109> most<00:00:58.260> part<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.829> fine<00:00:58.949> for

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the most part it will be just fine for

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220 
the most part it will be just fine for
most<00:00:59.399> people<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.180> course<00:01:00.480> since<00:01:00.870> they're<00:01:01.020> so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
most people of course since they're so

most people of course since they're so
thin<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.530> line<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.920> first<00:01:02.100> thing<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.309> has<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
thin in line the first thing that has to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
thin in line the first thing that has to
go<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> optical<00:01:03.570> drive<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:04.589> personally

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
go is the optical drive well personally

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.140 
go is the optical drive well personally
that's<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> problem<00:01:05.400> at<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.729> me<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
that's not a problem at all for me I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.030 
that's not a problem at all for me I
can't<00:01:06.420> remember<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> last<00:01:06.960> time<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.260> used<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> CD

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

burner you just toss it in your bag
which<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.820> big<00:01:14.850> deal

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
which is not a really big deal

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.969 
which is not a really big deal
considering<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.810> how<00:01:15.960> small<00:01:16.350> thin<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
considering just how small thin and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.010 
considering just how small thin and
light<00:01:17.130> an<00:01:17.250> ultrabook<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.689> second

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
light an ultrabook really is the second

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
light an ultrabook really is the second
thing<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> sets<00:01:19.500> an<00:01:19.650> ultrabook<00:01:19.950> apart<00:01:20.340> from

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
thing that sets an ultrabook apart from

thing that sets an ultrabook apart from
other<00:01:20.729> laptops<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.659> fact<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.900> they

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
other laptops is the fact that they

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.570 
other laptops is the fact that they
pretty<00:01:22.200> much<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> solid-state<00:01:23.549> drive

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pretty much all have a solid-state drive

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.060 
pretty much all have a solid-state drive

most part the stall state drive is just

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.740 
most part the stall state drive is just
way<00:01:44.579> better<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.119> lot<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.390> different<00:01:45.630> areas

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
way better in a lot of different areas

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.660 
way better in a lot of different areas
it's<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> lot<00:01:46.920> faster<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.640> course

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it's going to be a lot faster of course

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.090 
it's going to be a lot faster of course
generally<00:01:48.450> by<00:01:48.630> 3<00:01:48.930> or<00:01:49.049> 4<00:01:49.079> times<00:01:49.470> depending<00:01:50.009> on

generally by 3 or 4 times depending on
which<00:01:50.220> solid-state<00:01:50.579> drive<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.180> it's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
which solid-state drive you get it's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
also going to be a lot quieter since

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.649 
also going to be a lot quieter since
there<00:01:53.399> are<00:01:53.490> no<00:01:53.610> moving<00:01:53.820> parts<00:01:53.970> there's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
there are no moving parts you're a lot

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.630 
there are no moving parts you're a lot
less<00:01:58.680> prone<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.189> getting<00:01:59.399> something

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
less prone to getting something

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.490 
less prone to getting something
destroyed<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.479> draw<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:01.049> shake<00:02:01.290> your

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
destroyed if you draw for shake your

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.830 
destroyed if you draw for shake your
laptop<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.640> that's<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:02.909> nice<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.360> you're

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
laptop so that's really nice if you're

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.969 
laptop so that's really nice if you're
doing<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.079> lot<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.229> traveling<00:02:04.680> whatever

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
doing a lot of traveling whatever

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.620 
doing a lot of traveling whatever
because<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.670> difficult<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.210> damage<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
because it's very difficult to damage a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.359 
because it's very difficult to damage a
chip<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.990> would<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.770> bust<00:02:08.099> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
chip you would really have to bust that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
chip you would really have to bust that
pretty<00:02:08.580> good<00:02:08.789> they<00:02:09.270> also<00:02:09.420> put<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:09.780> less<00:02:09.959> heat

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
pretty good they also put out less heat

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.330 
pretty good they also put out less heat
which<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.590> very<00:02:10.770> important<00:02:11.160> when<00:02:11.280> you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
which is very important when you

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.930 
which is very important when you
consider<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:12.000> how<00:02:12.120> thin<00:02:12.360> most

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
consider just how thin most

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.760 
consider just how thin most
books<00:02:13.120> are<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.600> they<00:02:13.960> take<00:02:14.140> less<00:02:14.290> power<00:02:14.590> which

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
books are and they take less power which

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.500 
books are and they take less power which
can<00:02:14.920> give<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.190> bit<00:02:15.340> more<00:02:15.370> battery<00:02:15.820> life<00:02:15.850> my

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
can give you a bit more battery life my

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.090 
can give you a bit more battery life my
opinion<00:02:16.900> once<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.440> get<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> solid-state<00:02:18.070> drive

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
opinion once you get a solid-state drive

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.220 
opinion once you get a solid-state drive
you<00:02:18.520> never<00:02:18.700> want<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.000> go<00:02:19.120> back<00:02:19.150> now<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:19.930> did<00:02:20.140> this

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
you never want to go back now I did this

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.750 
you never want to go back now I did this

life in general when you look at

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
something that's this then this portable

something that's this then this portable
it's<00:02:33.790> either<00:02:34.060> going<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.270> be<00:02:34.390> very<00:02:34.660> anemic<00:02:35.080> and

it's either going to be very anemic and

it's either going to be very anemic and
