00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.160
 good to all guys and girls we are 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.100
 in destiny's so they go and well I 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.310
 so I bring the other set of complete 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.960
 the new root of the moon the end of chalk 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.640
 you will ask what has determined if I have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 finished before the titan or the hunter 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.050
 because the windbreaker has not finished 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.000
 this time he sends the bib to the windbreaker 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.010
 that what I was missing and what I need is 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.329
 enables not only the chest in 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.129
 how much do you have to see if the week that 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 He comes and gives it to me and I also show him 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 full set is now I will teach from 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.610
 the hunter that is this that you see here of 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.500
 aspect is missing the helmet logically 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.260
 when you are in the tower, because the helmet 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.879
 you do not see but we give you here and here what 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.130
 we will see its real aspect this is the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.490
 aspect of 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.030
 of the set of the end of crota of the root 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.030
 of the hunter 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.690
 that skull in the belt with three 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.250
 eyes the good thing of the helmet because as the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.430
 stage the hood as it has each 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.710
 bicharraco xosé and one of the shoulders 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.250
 has a pinch 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.210
 good is simple and a machete in the 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.210
 left leg as you can see 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.090
 good good is at level 30 first very 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.930
 easy explanation is because I'm not 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.970
 going up 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.250
 I'm keeping the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.900
 the resources for the titan to climb 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.490
 both the chest when that when I 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.770
 of the fast and running 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.439
 and I'm not saving but as you can 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.409
 see I have everything uploaded are three faults 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.950
 for the fragments that if the week that 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.240
 comes by not adapting to the titan 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.240
 logically 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.530
 would go up to be as good as we are going to 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.239
 start it because I helmet 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.840
 they are inviting in the city I do not know 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.030
 who is but always invite and when 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.920
 when you see that you have weapons and that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.260
 well let's start with the first 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.209
 part 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.530
 and abilities have to cause damage with 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.610
 the grenade reduces the time of 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.620
 recovery of recovery your body to 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.620
 body while the soul look 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.829
 supreme active activated the damage of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.780
 your weapon increases for a while 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.900
 fill your health by collecting an orb of 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.409
 light we will have the skill that hosts the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.000
 Orb after we will also recover health 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.280
 and the appearance of the helmet that looks 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.410
 little more closely this what would this 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.570
 we did with the warlock 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.340
 is not ugly is not ugly and I tell you that the 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.620
 hood 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.480
 molaría not wearing a hood so that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.950
 really look like it is the helmet but not 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.300
 they leave us in this game there are hoods that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.160
 let see a little more but that 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.970
 they also continue to cover they continue to cover 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.460
 the look and let's move on now to the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.950
 arms 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.800
 increases the recharge speed of the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.890
 special weapons possibility of 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.530
 regenerate an orb when killing a servant 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.780
 of the hive with a grenade swallows the 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.630
 we can regenerate we have possibilities 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:35.680
 they tell us to regenerate orb 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.020
 also by an orb several one to cause 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.360
 damage with a melee attack is 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.230
 reduce recovery time of your 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.620
 grenades and the appearance 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.280
 it would be in profile you can not turn to see 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.120
 if one day put more things to 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.830
 customize the characters and that 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.860
 we can show it 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.519
 both front and back and the profile 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.519
 how we want 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.739
 this one does not see much which we see the 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.910
 arm that does not have the skewer 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:10.520
 we're going directly to the chest 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.650
 the chest while the soul gaze 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.500
 Supreme your speed is activated 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.420
 recharge increases for a while 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.540
 we will reload the weapons first and then 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.820
 puts carries more ammunition for the rifles 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.010
 of pulse this can always vary I have 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.260
 had the bad leg of it being rifles 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.360
 of pulse instead of scout that 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.190
 would have liked more and carries more ammo 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.410
 for no sniper rifles 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.569
 are entering I'm not going to say no 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.520
 I usually carry 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.860
 and appearance that is so we will 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.939
 can see 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.639
 the look is this looks like it's 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:49.990
 abdominal as if they were souls gives 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.390
 printing is not for so 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.130
 and it takes that some teeth to lower a 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.620
 tooth necklace and you see there the 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.210
 shoulder pad that before we saw in profile the 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.630
 arm is the shoulder pad that carries in the 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.630
 right arm 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:12.630
 in defense you see that it reaches 488 37 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:15.690
 366 447 and we're going to see the feet that is what 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.280
 last we have left would be 325 to 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.410
 level 36 of light and the skills is 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.190
 carries more heavy weapons ammunition and 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.840
 brandishing the blade of a sword holder had 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.080
 skill increases for a while 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.690
 what increases then the agility the 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.930
 speed 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.850
 and appearance of the feet would be this in the 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.919
 that we won the machete and they do not let us 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.400
 see up there the little tip of the skull 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.729
 they do not let us see well what a bad 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.330
 they have 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:52.059
 but it would be this aspect pretty much and 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.969
 well you can see it here this is the 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:57.320
 what aspect of the shader I have left 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.720
 before you ask me 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.540
 This is worth millions of millions though 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.810
 I can also wear black if you want 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.889
 I like this is the black so it would be 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.889
 with fly wings 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.319
 the noon 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.090
 what is green is not bad either because 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:21.479
 the skull is not seen because it stayed 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.650
 black a very dark green and you can not see 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.650
 same as the machete 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:33.880
 or if the art of Lugano 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.880
 but the skull is not seen much either 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.910
 and the red layer 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.850
 or the white for example from the camera 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.850
 crystal 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.560
 that the white does not look bad the truth 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.560
 he's pretty cool 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.050
 and good and this is when you spend 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.050
 crota give you stessel ideas 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.960
 that is called a cryptographer that is also 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.030
 the red layer but it is more clear it looks 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.700
 perfectly the skull on the chest 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.580
 that is well marked and the knife also 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:13.120
 it looks and the boys I hope that I have 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:15.250
 liked not to forget to comment already like and 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.790
 to see if soon I can bring you the 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.190
 of the titan 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.050
 because it would be fine from titanic that is 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.230
 the one that the chest is the only thing that 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.310
 was missing to bring to bring it and the truth 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.990
 that is not giving me but good 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.400
 I hope so suddenly and so 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.060
 can teach to share it with 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:36.620
 you and see you in 7 videos now 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.620
 yes until after um
