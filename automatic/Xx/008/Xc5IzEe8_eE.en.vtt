00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.480 

I<00:01:41.969> got<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> chance<00:01:45.770> they<00:01:46.770> attacked<00:01:47.189> me<00:01:47.310> what

they<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:49.579> want<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.640> lead<00:01:50.789> in<00:01:50.909> them<00:01:52.759> I<00:01:53.759> think

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
they really want to lead in them I think

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.710 
they really want to lead in them I think
I'll<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:54.929> lootable

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:09.760 

a<00:02:02.930> lot<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.960> gold<00:02:05.960> some<00:02:06.960> glass<00:02:07.230> arrows<00:02:07.590> back<00:02:08.149> and

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
a lot of gold some glass arrows back and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.630 
a lot of gold some glass arrows back and
they<00:02:10.770> didn't<00:02:10.979> attack<00:02:11.280> me<00:02:11.310> which<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.360> lucky<00:02:13.640> so

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
they didn't attack me which is lucky so

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.220 
they didn't attack me which is lucky so
I<00:02:14.760> think<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.240> time<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.480> take<00:02:15.720> him<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:15.930> with<00:02:16.080> on

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
I think it's time to take him on with on

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:25.690 
I think it's time to take him on with on
then<00:02:19.430> noise<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:23.670> try<00:02:23.880> sneak<00:02:24.270> attack<00:02:24.600> ease

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
then noise can try sneak attack ease

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.650 
then noise can try sneak attack ease
then<00:02:26.700> I'll<00:02:27.660> actually<00:02:27.870> get<00:02:28.170> some<00:02:28.290> extra<00:02:28.500> points

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
then I'll actually get some extra points

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.150 
then I'll actually get some extra points
damage<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.870> them<00:02:31.050> because<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.709> don't<00:02:31.770> think<00:02:32.100> I

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160
