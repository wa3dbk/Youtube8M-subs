00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
couldn't play because of injuries so we

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.029 
couldn't play because of injuries so we
didn't<00:00:59.460> expect<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> get<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.270> far<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.930> thought<00:01:01.920> we

didn't expect to get so far I thought we

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.860 
didn't expect to get so far I thought we
did<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> apart<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.120> day<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.629> think

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
did it apart on this day and I think

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.390 
did it apart on this day and I think
it's<00:01:04.080> owed<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> right<00:01:04.799> team<00:01:05.040> spirit
