00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 that is, all the boys are there today I will 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.910
 boxing my new keyboard from 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.590
 of the riser la leaf home for this 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.880
 first purchase the breeding of the breeds 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.710
 for what I say I have accomplished this 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.500
 I like the job first of all 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.490
 aesthetically because if you will be held 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.650
 December 4th does so there is a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.750
 blue led backlighting are not 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.420
 facebook a binago take off 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 however there are ten profile bodies 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.770
 that can be changed 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.870
 therefore for veroli yesterday for each 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 opportunity I can change one's own thread 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.969
 depending on your preferences I would like to why 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.739
 including prisons as a leap inflicted 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.510
 for example the things leardi siro cultura 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.820
 those exchange reactions with the gesture 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.670
 is while they are able to overcome in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.969
 more with the f as I am sowing 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.989
 I get confused I can change profiles 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.449
 so it is however to my liking then 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:04.110
 these are starting to joke 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.830
 beautiful pockets are incapable 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:19.520
 they are clean of soft mi knife 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:19.520
 formal on the safe side but how nice 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:34.979
 received 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:37.409
 ok so we do the plastic will be 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:44.450
 beautiful 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:47.579
 so a little bit so here it is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.560
 therefore quite polished as keyboards 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.229
 so from now on, however, not to put more 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.020
 on my keyboard that removed mine 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.899
 vegeta explains that it sucks 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.329
 here it is that it is if the exhibition hall 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.099
 crumbs for all the times I'm there 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.990
 therefore win 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:10.229
 ouch ouch act of this keyboard and there is to 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.819
 say that instead it is English 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.840
 therefore there are no agents like 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.870
 you can see see us are there are not 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.299
 accents so I will have to wear myself 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.840
 anyway, I can remember the profiles 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:27.269
 I watch a lot as I write therefore 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.480
 imagine then we have to test here 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.480
 thing 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.040
 this version 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:03:07.280
 and here it is these things here quo and here 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:07.280
 or yes because for these masons 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.320
 so here we have read that these 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.090
 these jacks that you can plug in that 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.200
 in the computer so they can 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.950
 connect directly here here I can 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.090
 connect the headphones directly e 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.690
 microphone here ok took it 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:38.070
 the opening served to coach here has 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.020
 also killed the disk to install i 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.170
 driver 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:50.900
 I think though and it's enough here to clean it 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.900
 let's create the notice to clean it 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.170
 take the case of the fair spa breed 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:07.710
 nothing to see others anyway 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.710
 all things of the race all but now 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.040
 that all we have left is coastal 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.840
 so here is the illuminated keyboard 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.840
 so how well you can see enough 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:26.440
 glossy and then here with this button 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.810
 you change the brightness of the keys like this 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.970
 only the keys light up 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.500
 directional that are used in games for 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.780
 then move the food so that is 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.540
 pretty pretty nothing i'd say 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.940
 this one striano liked 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.310
 this can also hunt this part 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.650
 here but I now because it is beautiful anyway 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.480
 and no finished boxing guys 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.450
 if you liked it, leave me a lot 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.840
 like it so see you next time 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.840
