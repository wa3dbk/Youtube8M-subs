right and left footed towards the left
but<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:25.890> depends<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.880> situation

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
but it all depends on the situation

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.660 
but it all depends on the situation
there<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.500> few<00:01:28.860> ways<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.250> changing

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
there are a few ways of changing

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.569 
there are a few ways of changing
direction<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:31.229> my<00:01:31.470> opinion<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.159> spinning

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
direction and in my opinion the spinning

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.270 
direction and in my opinion the spinning
right<00:01:32.759> or<00:01:32.970> left<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.689> most<00:01:34.020> effective<00:01:34.680> so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
right or left is the most effective so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
right or left is the most effective so
make<00:01:35.729> sure<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.210> add<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.509> cue<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.960> your

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
make sure to add this cue to your

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.249 
make sure to add this cue to your
gameplay<00:01:37.710> win<00:01:38.670> play<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.180> another<00:01:39.810> great

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
gameplay win play is another great

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.679 
gameplay win play is another great
aspect<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.250> skill<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.240> create<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
aspect of the skill you can create a

crossing situation by using the spin
left<00:01:45.689> or<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.860> my<00:01:47.100> opinion<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.759> turn<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
left or right in my opinion this turn is

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.200 
left or right in my opinion this turn is
as<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.619> body<00:01:49.890> fence<00:01:50.250> cue<00:01:50.549> turn

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
as good as the body fence cue turn

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.300 
as good as the body fence cue turn

avoid an opponent and create space you

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.999 
avoid an opponent and create space you
