00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
like this now of course you can use an

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that just fit as elf but you might

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.630 
that just fit as elf but you might
struggle<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.360> find<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> container

roll of a toilet paper and I also ended

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.830 
roll of a toilet paper and I also ended
up<00:01:50.310> using<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.700> little<00:01:50.790> bit<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.090> sellotape<00:01:51.360> and

up using a little bit of sellotape and
the<00:01:52.170> air<00:01:52.320> drying<00:01:52.710> modeling<00:01:53.189> clay<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.820> clay

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the air drying modeling clay the clay

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.700 
the air drying modeling clay the clay
then<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.600> leave<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.170> dry<00:01:55.350> overnight

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
then you just leave out to dry overnight

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.800 
then you just leave out to dry overnight
not<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.399> type<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.880> need<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> put<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
not the type that you need to put in the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.590 
not the type that you need to put in the
oven<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.229> bake<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.030> first<00:02:00.270> thing<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.570> I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
oven to bake so the first thing that I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.920 
oven to bake so the first thing that I
did<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.350> took<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.909> empty<00:02:03.420> roll<00:02:03.659> of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
did is I took and the empty roll of

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.499 
did is I took and the empty roll of
toilet<00:02:04.259> paper<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.860> cardboard<00:02:05.310> roll<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.759> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
toilet paper the cardboard roll and I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
toilet paper the cardboard roll and I
just<00:02:06.990> simply<00:02:07.320> cut<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.770> lengthwise<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:09.030> in

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
just simply cut it lengthwise just in

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.850 
just simply cut it lengthwise just in
one<00:02:09.300> cut<00:02:09.539> lengthwise

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
one cut lengthwise

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.780 
one cut lengthwise
and<00:02:10.950> after<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.970> wrote<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.620> piece<00:02:14.490> of

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and after that I wrote the piece of

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.270 
and after that I wrote the piece of
cardboard<00:02:15.360> into<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.810> tiny<00:02:16.380> into<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.860> smaller

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
cardboard into a tiny into a smaller

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.970 
cardboard into a tiny into a smaller
cylinder<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:19.320> don't<00:02:19.740> know<00:02:19.800> how<00:02:19.920> to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
cylinder it's I don't know how to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.320 
cylinder it's I don't know how to
explain<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.460> but<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.670> basically<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.060> watch

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
explain it but you basically just watch

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.510 
explain it but you basically just watch
what<00:02:21.510> I'm<00:02:21.600> doing<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.770> what<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.250> want<00:02:23.430> to

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
what I'm doing and but what you want to

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.580 
what I'm doing and but what you want to
do<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.850> want<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> create<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.420> spout<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
do is you want to create a spout of the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.800 
do is you want to create a spout of the
watering<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.850> course<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.360> spout<00:02:27.780> of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
watering can and of course the spout of

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.570 
watering can and of course the spout of
water<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.290> carrots<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.650> little<00:02:28.860> bit<00:02:29.100> wider<00:02:29.340> at

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
water and carrots a little bit wider at

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820 
water and carrots a little bit wider at
one<00:02:29.820> end<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.630> little<00:02:30.810> bit<00:02:31.080> narrower<00:02:31.500> at<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
one end and a little bit narrower at the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.280 
one end and a little bit narrower at the
other<00:02:31.980> end<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.150> basically<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.080> played

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
other end so basically I just played

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.990 
other end so basically I just played
around<00:02:34.440> with<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.040> little<00:02:35.070> bit<00:02:35.340> until<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.820> was

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
around with it a little bit until I was

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.060 
around with it a little bit until I was
happy<00:02:36.270> with<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.020> shape<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.500> once<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.800> got<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
happy with the shape and once I got the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.160 
happy with the shape and once I got the
shape<00:02:38.310> right<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:39.240> put<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.420> little<00:02:39.750> bit<00:02:40.020> of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
shape right I just put a little bit of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.750 
shape right I just put a little bit of
sellotape<00:02:40.440> around<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.130> make<00:02:41.280> sure<00:02:41.310> it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
sellotape around it to make sure it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.160 
sellotape around it to make sure it
doesn't<00:02:41.940> come<00:02:42.090> undone<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.810> keeps<00:02:42.990> its

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
doesn't come undone and it keeps its

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.530 
doesn't come undone and it keeps its
shape<00:02:43.310> cut<00:02:44.310> off<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.850> end<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.209> bit<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.420> an

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
shape cut off the end and a bit of an

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.330 
shape cut off the end and a bit of an
angle<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:45.959> basically<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:46.800> how<00:02:46.980> it's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
angle and basically this is how it's

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.940 
angle and basically this is how it's
going<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.910> be<00:02:48.360> positioned<00:02:48.900> onto<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> side<00:02:49.650> off

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
going to be positioned onto the side off

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.120 
going to be positioned onto the side off
and<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.820> plastic<00:02:51.180> container<00:02:51.739> after<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.920> I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
and the plastic container after that I

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.840 
and the plastic container after that I
took<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.550> little<00:02:53.790> bit<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.239> my<00:02:54.630> modelling<00:02:55.170> clay

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
took a little bit of my modelling clay

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.300 
took a little bit of my modelling clay
rolled<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:57.209> ball<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.290> my<00:02:58.320> hands<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.920> warm<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.220> up

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
rolled a ball in my hands to warm it up

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.580 
rolled a ball in my hands to warm it up
a<00:02:59.489> little<00:02:59.580> bit<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.000> then<00:03:00.630> flatten<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.230> out<00:03:01.380> in

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
a little bit and then flatten it out in

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.000 
a little bit and then flatten it out in
a<00:03:01.650> very<00:03:01.920> thin<00:03:02.190> sheet<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:04.320> this<00:03:04.500> sheet<00:03:04.770> of

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
a very thin sheet so this sheet of

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.860 
a very thin sheet so this sheet of
modeling<00:03:05.400> clay<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.910> only<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.330> few<00:03:06.630> millimeters

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
modeling clay is only a few millimeters

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
modeling clay is only a few millimeters
thick<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.620> probably<00:03:07.860> about<00:03:08.040> two<00:03:08.310> millimeters

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
thick is probably about two millimeters

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.390 
thick is probably about two millimeters
thick<00:03:09.000> now<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.900> can<00:03:10.110> actually<00:03:10.410> skip<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> step

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
thick now you can actually skip the step

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.100 
thick now you can actually skip the step
you<00:03:11.430> don't<00:03:11.820> have<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.239> do<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.510> what<00:03:12.720> I'm<00:03:12.810> going

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
you don't have to do this what I'm going

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.680 
you don't have to do this what I'm going
to<00:03:13.140> do<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.650> basically<00:03:13.860> put<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:15.150> sheet<00:03:15.450> of

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
to do is basically put the sheet of

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.020 
to do is basically put the sheet of
modeling<00:03:16.290> clay<00:03:16.320> all<00:03:16.709> around<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.790> plastic

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
modeling clay all around the plastic

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.030 
modeling clay all around the plastic
container<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.840> cover<00:03:19.260> everything<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
container and cover everything in the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.920 
container and cover everything in the
molding<00:03:20.400> clay<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:21.060> don't<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.660> do<00:03:21.780> this

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
molding clay you don't have to do this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.720 
molding clay you don't have to do this
you<00:03:22.110> can<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.620> example<00:03:23.010> straight<00:03:23.400> up<00:03:23.519> go

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
you can just for example straight up go

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.840 
you can just for example straight up go
and<00:03:24.000> paint<00:03:24.510> your<00:03:25.080> plastic<00:03:25.620> container<00:03:25.980> but<00:03:26.670> I

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
and paint your plastic container but I

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.850 
and paint your plastic container but I
think<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.570> if<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.810> cover<00:03:28.080> everything<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.799> the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
think that if I cover everything in the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.670 
think that if I cover everything in the
same<00:03:29.220> I'm<00:03:29.459> sculpting<00:03:30.060> clay<00:03:30.450> material<00:03:30.810> it's

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
same I'm sculpting clay material it's

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.710 
same I'm sculpting clay material it's
just<00:03:31.920> going<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.280> make<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.640> whole<00:03:32.940> end<00:03:33.269> project

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
just going to make the whole end project

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.380 
just going to make the whole end project
look<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.200> bit<00:03:34.350> more<00:03:34.530> cohesive<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.280> not<00:03:36.150> as

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
look a bit more cohesive and not as

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.060 
look a bit more cohesive and not as
disjointed<00:03:36.989> as<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.350> know<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.040> a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
disjointed as you know this is a

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.160 
disjointed as you know this is a
container<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> spout<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:40.140> a

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
container this is a spout this is a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.430 
container this is a spout this is a
handle<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.790> topic<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.900> handle<00:03:43.290> and

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
handle on the topic of the handle and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.740 
handle on the topic of the handle and
the<00:03:43.650> spout<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.160> worked<00:03:44.700> on<00:03:44.880> those<00:03:45.090> snakes<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.660> I

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
the spout I worked on those snakes so I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.600 
the spout I worked on those snakes so I
took<00:03:45.810> another<00:03:46.080> little<00:03:46.500> bit<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.680> clay<00:03:46.920> rolled

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
took another little bit of clay rolled

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.479 
took another little bit of clay rolled
in<00:03:47.760> English<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.330> thin<00:03:48.780> sheet<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.080> clay<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.950> just

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
in English a thin sheet of clay and just

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.160 
in English a thin sheet of clay and just
covered<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.030> spout<00:03:51.299> exactly<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.110> did

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
covered the spout exactly like I did

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.320 
covered the spout exactly like I did
with<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.440> container<00:03:52.799> but<00:03:53.340> just<00:03:53.640> covered<00:03:54.060> them

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
with the container but just covered them

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.810 
with the container but just covered them
the<00:03:54.989> roll<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.350> toilet<00:03:55.530> paper<00:03:55.709> with<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.580> clay

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
the roll of toilet paper with the clay

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.900 
the roll of toilet paper with the clay
and<00:03:57.120> then<00:03:57.870> next<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.350> started<00:03:58.799> working<00:03:59.220> on<00:03:59.430> the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
and then next I started working on the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.390 
and then next I started working on the
handle<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.630> for<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.470> handle<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.890> thought<00:04:02.100> just

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
handle and for the handle I thought just

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.039 
handle and for the handle I thought just
to<00:04:02.549> make<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.910> project<00:04:03.209> look<00:04:03.570> a<00:04:03.660> little<00:04:03.840> bit

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
to make this project look a little bit

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.400 
to make this project look a little bit
more<00:04:04.260> more<00:04:05.010> self<00:04:05.670> related<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.480> decided<00:04:07.140> to

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
more more self related I decided to

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.530 
more more self related I decided to
actually<00:04:07.829> make<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.310> handle<00:04:08.760> into<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.299> shape

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
actually make the handle into the shape

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.440 
actually make the handle into the shape
of<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.989> Z<00:04:10.170> from<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.739> self<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.579> actually<00:04:11.910> used

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
of a Z from the self so I actually used

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.500 
of a Z from the self so I actually used
a<00:04:12.810> self<00:04:13.350> as<00:04:13.560> guide<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:14.190> looked<00:04:14.760> at<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.060> back<00:04:15.239> of

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
a self as guide I looked at the back of

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.080 
a self as guide I looked at the back of
the<00:04:15.870> self<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.440> see<00:04:16.680> how<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.919> Z<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.549> drawn<00:04:17.820> on

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
the self to see how the Z is drawn on

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.080 
the self to see how the Z is drawn on
there<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:19.049> bum<00:04:19.260> cheek<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:20.549> took<00:04:20.640> three

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
there the bum cheek and I took three

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.969 
there the bum cheek and I took three
little<00:04:21.270> bits<00:04:21.479> of<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:22.200> clay<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.650> modelling

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
little bits of the clay the modelling

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:23.610 
little bits of the clay the modelling
clay

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
clay

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.340 
clay
and<00:04:23.710> yeah<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.580> just<00:04:25.000> modeled<00:04:25.389> them<00:04:25.540> until<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.080> was

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
and yeah I just modeled them until I was

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.810 
and yeah I just modeled them until I was
kind<00:04:26.560> of<00:04:26.650> happy<00:04:26.949> that<00:04:26.979> they<00:04:27.190> kind<00:04:27.460> of<00:04:27.610> look

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
kind of happy that they kind of look

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.420 
kind of happy that they kind of look
like<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.210> shape<00:04:28.419> of<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.840> Z<00:04:29.020> from<00:04:29.710> dissolves

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
like the shape of the Z from dissolves

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.580 
like the shape of the Z from dissolves
and<00:04:30.760> just<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.479> make<00:04:31.660> this<00:04:31.810> project<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.410> little

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
and just to make this project a little

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.650 
and just to make this project a little
bit<00:04:32.830> more<00:04:33.070> magical<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.729> different<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.389> not

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
bit more magical and different and not

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.540 
bit more magical and different and not
just<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.080> know<00:04:35.229> a<00:04:35.260> simple<00:04:35.560> watering<00:04:36.280> can

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
just you know a simple watering can

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.540 
just you know a simple watering can
looking<00:04:37.000> thing<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.570> took<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:38.410> few<00:04:38.949> more<00:04:39.130> bits<00:04:39.340> of

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
looking thing I took a few more bits of

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.760 
looking thing I took a few more bits of
the<00:04:39.790> sculpting<00:04:40.240> clay<00:04:40.449> roll<00:04:41.110> them<00:04:41.320> into<00:04:41.560> really

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
the sculpting clay roll them into really

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.800 
the sculpting clay roll them into really
thin<00:04:41.860> little<00:04:42.520> strips<00:04:42.729> like<00:04:43.090> cylinders<00:04:43.600> and

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
thin little strips like cylinders and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.650 
thin little strips like cylinders and
then<00:04:44.500> roll<00:04:44.860> them<00:04:45.130> like<00:04:45.160> so<00:04:45.699> like<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:46.180> see<00:04:46.389> here

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
then roll them like so like you see here

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.110 
then roll them like so like you see here
and<00:04:46.810> then<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.500> just<00:04:47.710> left<00:04:48.040> everything<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.880> dry

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
and then I just left everything to dry

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.150 
and then I just left everything to dry
and<00:04:49.540> basically<00:04:50.020> these<00:04:50.199> little<00:04:50.530> swirls<00:04:50.830> are

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
and basically these little swirls are

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.909 
and basically these little swirls are
going<00:04:51.699> to<00:04:51.850> be<00:04:52.030> like<00:04:52.419> little<00:04:52.750> spurts<00:04:53.320> of<00:04:53.500> water

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
going to be like little spurts of water

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.590 
going to be like little spurts of water
you're<00:04:54.400> going<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.699> see<00:04:54.850> how<00:04:55.000> it<00:04:55.120> looks<00:04:55.270> like<00:04:55.389> at

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
you're going to see how it looks like at

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.080 
you're going to see how it looks like at
the<00:04:55.750> end<00:04:55.780> but<00:04:56.380> yeah<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.560> took<00:04:57.310> everything<00:04:57.789> and

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
the end but yeah I took everything and

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.390 
the end but yeah I took everything and
put<00:04:58.600> it<00:04:58.690> aside<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:59.260> left<00:04:59.530> it<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.740> dry<00:05:00.039> I<00:05:00.070> think

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
put it aside and left it to dry I think

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.920 
put it aside and left it to dry I think
I<00:05:00.490> left<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:00.729> to<00:05:00.850> dry<00:05:01.000> for<00:05:01.030> about<00:05:01.330> two<00:05:01.539> days<00:05:01.720> just

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
I left it to dry for about two days just

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.330 
I left it to dry for about two days just
to<00:05:02.080> be<00:05:02.169> sure<00:05:02.350> that<00:05:02.500> he<00:05:02.560> was<00:05:02.650> completely<00:05:03.160> dry

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
to be sure that he was completely dry

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.390 
to be sure that he was completely dry

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
and once the clay got hard I used a nail

don't have to use spray paints you can

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.230 
don't have to use spray paints you can
use<00:05:29.200> normal<00:05:29.560> acrylic<00:05:29.800> paints<00:05:30.280> I<00:05:30.370> just<00:05:30.849> find<00:05:31.090> a

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
use normal acrylic paints I just find a

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.270 
use normal acrylic paints I just find a
little<00:05:31.419> bit<00:05:31.599> quicker<00:05:31.810> to<00:05:32.020> use<00:05:32.139> spray<00:05:32.289> paint<00:05:32.560> so

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
little bit quicker to use spray paint so

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.129 
little bit quicker to use spray paint so
I<00:05:33.639> colored<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.210> whole<00:05:34.240> thing<00:05:34.660> with<00:05:34.780> purple

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
I colored the whole thing with purple

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.339 
I colored the whole thing with purple
and<00:05:35.380> then<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.280> used<00:05:36.580> normal<00:05:36.970> acrylic<00:05:37.419> paint<00:05:37.690> to

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
and then I used normal acrylic paint to

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.740 
and then I used normal acrylic paint to
paint<00:05:38.710> on<00:05:39.010> these<00:05:39.250> little<00:05:39.430> swirls<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:40.240> dots

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
paint on these little swirls and dots

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.190 
paint on these little swirls and dots
with<00:05:41.590> black<00:05:41.860> paint<00:05:42.160> just<00:05:42.849> to<00:05:43.000> fit<00:05:43.240> Guyanese

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
with black paint just to fit Guyanese

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.100 
with black paint just to fit Guyanese
color<00:05:44.530> scheme<00:05:44.919> of<00:05:45.099> black<00:05:45.490> and<00:05:45.729> purple<00:05:45.910> so<00:05:46.870> once

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
color scheme of black and purple so once

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.830 
color scheme of black and purple so once
the<00:05:47.620> paint<00:05:47.979> was<00:05:48.160> dry<00:05:48.190> I<00:05:48.639> simply<00:05:49.240> used<00:05:49.479> hot<00:05:49.810> glue

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
the paint was dry I simply used hot glue

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.589 
the paint was dry I simply used hot glue
to<00:05:50.349> glue<00:05:50.950> the<00:05:51.430> three<00:05:51.639> pieces<00:05:51.970> together<00:05:52.150> so<00:05:52.419> I

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
to glue the three pieces together so I

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.439 
to glue the three pieces together so I
glued<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.289> spout<00:05:53.620> on<00:05:53.860> one<00:05:54.160> side<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.789> exactly

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
glued the spout on one side and exactly

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.839 
glued the spout on one side and exactly
on<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.930> other<00:05:56.080> side<00:05:56.320> of<00:05:56.440> it<00:05:56.560> I<00:05:56.740> glued<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.610> Z

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
on the other side of it I glued the Z

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.870 
on the other side of it I glued the Z
handle<00:05:58.300> and<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:59.650> other<00:05:59.860> little<00:06:00.190> swirls<00:06:00.610> that

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
handle and the other little swirls that

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.570 
handle and the other little swirls that
I<00:06:00.940> created<00:06:01.360> with<00:06:01.660> a<00:06:01.690> modeling<00:06:02.139> clay<00:06:02.410> I<00:06:02.710> painted

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
I created with a modeling clay I painted

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.219 
I created with a modeling clay I painted
those<00:06:03.760> with<00:06:04.030> blue<00:06:04.270> because<00:06:04.690> they're<00:06:04.810> going<00:06:05.080> to

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
those with blue because they're going to

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.010 
those with blue because they're going to
be<00:06:05.380> like<00:06:05.740> magical<00:06:06.460> water<00:06:06.760> so<00:06:07.510> I<00:06:07.570> painted<00:06:07.810> them

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
be like magical water so I painted them

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.870 
be like magical water so I painted them
in<00:06:08.080> blue<00:06:08.380> and<00:06:08.620> then<00:06:08.889> I<00:06:08.919> used<00:06:09.280> a<00:06:09.400> little<00:06:09.430> bit<00:06:09.760> of

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
in blue and then I used a little bit of

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.969 
in blue and then I used a little bit of
super<00:06:10.270> glue<00:06:10.389> to<00:06:10.479> draw<00:06:10.960> like<00:06:11.169> a<00:06:11.199> little<00:06:11.560> strip

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
super glue to draw like a little strip

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.010 
super glue to draw like a little strip
on<00:06:12.360> one<00:06:13.360> side<00:06:13.660> of<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.669> clay<00:06:15.669> swirls<00:06:16.060> and<00:06:16.330> then

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
on one side of the clay swirls and then

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.409 
on one side of the clay swirls and then
I<00:06:17.050> simply<00:06:17.440> just<00:06:17.770> sprinkle<00:06:18.250> some<00:06:18.280> glitter<00:06:18.849> some

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
I simply just sprinkle some glitter some

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.290 
I simply just sprinkle some glitter some
sparkly<00:06:19.900> shiny<00:06:20.110> beautiful<00:06:20.650> lakes<00:06:21.099> and<00:06:21.400> once

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
sparkly shiny beautiful lakes and once

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.900 
sparkly shiny beautiful lakes and once
they<00:06:22.539> all<00:06:22.690> dried<00:06:23.020> up<00:06:23.050> I<00:06:23.440> just<00:06:24.099> glued<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.639> ends

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
they all dried up I just glued the ends

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.360 
they all dried up I just glued the ends
of<00:06:25.000> them<00:06:25.210> in<00:06:25.419> the<00:06:25.900> inside<00:06:26.289> of<00:06:26.530> the<00:06:26.830> spout<00:06:27.070> so<00:06:27.280> it

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
of them in the inside of the spout so it

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.950 
of them in the inside of the spout so it
kind<00:06:27.610> of<00:06:27.699> looks<00:06:27.910> like<00:06:28.000> you<00:06:28.240> know<00:06:28.360> magical

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
kind of looks like you know magical

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.290 
kind of looks like you know magical
water<00:06:29.260> coming<00:06:29.800> out<00:06:29.889> of<00:06:29.949> it<00:06:30.190> and<00:06:30.370> that's

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
water coming out of it and that's

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.980 
water coming out of it and that's
actually<00:06:31.900> it

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
actually it

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.840 
actually it
it's<00:06:33.110> very<00:06:33.290> easy<00:06:33.530> and<00:06:33.860> straightforward<00:06:33.980> very

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
it's very easy and straightforward very

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.370 
it's very easy and straightforward very
simple<00:06:34.970> project<00:06:35.450> and<00:06:35.810> maybe<00:06:36.140> it<00:06:36.350> doesn't

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
simple project and maybe it doesn't

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.050 
simple project and maybe it doesn't
really<00:06:36.800> look<00:06:36.950> all<00:06:37.160> that<00:06:37.280> impressive<00:06:37.430> but<00:06:38.030> I

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
really look all that impressive but I

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.940 
really look all that impressive but I
think<00:06:38.390> that<00:06:38.570> once<00:06:38.870> I<00:06:39.170> actually<00:06:39.410> put<00:06:39.920> it

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
think that once I actually put it

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.830 
think that once I actually put it
together<00:06:40.220> next<00:06:40.790> to<00:06:40.850> all<00:06:41.060> my<00:06:41.330> others<00:06:41.660> old

together next to all my others old
houses<00:06:42.260> it's<00:06:42.830> going<00:06:43.130> to<00:06:43.250> look<00:06:43.430> the<00:06:43.580> part<00:06:43.730> so
