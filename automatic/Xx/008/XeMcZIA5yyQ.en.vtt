black<00:00:13.380> bias<00:00:13.980> GP<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.660> ultra-thin

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
black bias GP so this is the ultra-thin

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.870 
black bias GP so this is the ultra-thin
case<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.759> very<00:00:18.150> similar<00:00:18.540> in<00:00:18.689> the<00:00:19.020> class<00:00:19.290> of

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
case it's very similar in the class of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.720 
case it's very similar in the class of
you<00:00:20.880> know<00:00:21.000> incipio<00:00:21.539> feather<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:22.519> incase<00:00:23.519> snap
