00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
don't really match the colors since I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.830 
don't really match the colors since I
have<00:01:28.229> some<00:01:28.470> old<00:01:28.829> gray<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.689> right

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
have some old gray in there like right

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.530 
have some old gray in there like right
here<00:01:31.520> then<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.790> some<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> parts<00:01:33.450> don't

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
here then like some of the parts don't

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.090 
here then like some of the parts don't
really<00:01:33.780> match<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.380> these<00:01:34.590> parts<00:01:35.009> right

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
really match up like these parts right

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.520 
really match up like these parts right
here<00:01:35.360> don't<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.509> match<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.200> what's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
here don't really match up with what's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.200 
here don't really match up with what's
going<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.920> over<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.520> side<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
going on over on this side because I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.840 
going on over on this side because I
couldn't<00:01:39.570> find<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.680> right<00:01:40.920> piece<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.610> here

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
couldn't find the right piece to go here

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.639 
couldn't find the right piece to go here
because<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.329> can't<00:01:42.720> find<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.140> some<00:01:43.350> reason

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
because I can't find it for some reason

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
because I can't find it for some reason
then<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.579> some<00:01:44.850> other<00:01:44.880> pieces<00:01:45.329> are

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
then you know some other pieces are

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.210 
then you know some other pieces are
going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.110> different<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.500> uh<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.100> know

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
going to be different but uh you know

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.069 
going to be different but uh you know
then<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.520> found<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> figures<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.659> set<00:01:48.869> -

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
then I found the figures for this set -

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.560 
then I found the figures for this set -
I<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.560> old<00:01:49.829> Anakin<00:01:50.820> Skywalker<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I have the old Anakin Skywalker and the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.990 
I have the old Anakin Skywalker and the
old<00:01:51.780> r2d2<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:52.920> went<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.909> I'll

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
old r2d2 that with went with it so I'll

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.130 
old r2d2 that with went with it so I'll
just<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> comparison<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.960> these<00:01:55.079> two

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
just do a comparison of these two

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.249 
just do a comparison of these two
figures<00:01:56.210> as<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.450> tell<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> old<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.049> had

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
figures as you can tell the old one had

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.280 
figures as you can tell the old one had
more<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> feminist<00:01:59.250> hair<00:02:00.110> not<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
more of like a feminist hair not that

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
more of like a feminist hair not that
much<00:02:01.520> torso<00:02:02.520> detail<00:02:03.890> then<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> know<00:02:05.130> no

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
much torso detail then you know no

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.740 
much torso detail then you know no
detail<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> back<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> old<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.600> but

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
detail on the back for the old one but

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.020 
detail on the back for the old one but
from<00:02:06.930> new<00:02:07.079> one<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:08.729> see<00:02:08.789> now

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
from new one there is you see now

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.430 
from new one there is you see now
there's<00:02:09.239> those<00:02:09.450> two<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.259> does<00:02:10.410> have

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
there's those two but this one does have

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.790 
there's those two but this one does have
the<00:02:10.709> little

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
the little

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
the little
microphone<00:02:13.800> thing<00:02:14.240> then<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.360> know<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
microphone thing then you know the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.780 
microphone thing then you know the
differences<00:02:16.230> between<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.709> two<00:02:16.860> r2d2<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.550> you

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
guys have fries seen this before as you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.110 
guys have fries seen this before as you
can<00:02:19.950> tell<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.190> new<00:02:20.340> ones<00:02:20.490> got<00:02:20.670> more<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
can tell the new ones got more of like a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.080 
can tell the new ones got more of like a
sharper<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.690> more<00:02:21.750> vibrant<00:02:22.620> color<00:02:23.160> whole

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
sharper and more vibrant color whole

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.059 
sharper and more vibrant color whole
fiber<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.720> printing<00:02:25.110> as<00:02:25.350> well<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.860> head

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
fiber and printing as well as the head

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.180 
fiber and printing as well as the head
printing<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.610> better<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.470> let's<00:02:28.890> move<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
printing is better so let's move the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.180 
printing is better so let's move the
figures<00:02:29.520> aside<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.959> let's<00:02:31.709> just<00:02:31.860> get<00:02:32.010> into

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
figures aside and let's just get into

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.570 
figures aside and let's just get into
the<00:02:32.600> Jedi<00:02:33.600> starfighters<00:02:34.110> themselves<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.190> one

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the Jedi starfighters themselves so one

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.160 
the Jedi starfighters themselves so one
thing<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.790> want<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.060> point<00:02:36.209> out<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
thing I want to point out is that the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.199 
thing I want to point out is that the
sticker<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> bottom<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:38.640> flap<00:02:39.000> is

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
sticker on the bottom of this flap is

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.670 
sticker on the bottom of this flap is
missing<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.690> don't<00:02:39.870> know<00:02:39.959> what<00:02:40.110> happened<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.470> it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
missing I don't know what happened to it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.930 
missing I don't know what happened to it
I<00:02:40.739> think<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.040> took<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.340> off<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.670> put<00:02:41.730> it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
I think I took it off and put it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.790 
I think I took it off and put it
someplace<00:02:42.120> else<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.959> just<00:02:43.260> can't<00:02:43.410> find<00:02:43.590> it

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
someplace else but I just can't find it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.560 
someplace else but I just can't find it
so<00:02:43.950> that's<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.280> only<00:02:44.489> downside<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.330> but

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
so that's the only downside of this but

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.890 
so that's the only downside of this but
uh<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:46.440> know<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.730> first<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.420> guess<00:02:48.750> we'll

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
uh you know so at first I guess we'll

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.860 
uh you know so at first I guess we'll
just<00:02:48.959> start<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.500> side<00:02:49.560> move<00:02:50.040> our<00:02:50.430> way

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
just start on this side move our way

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.600 
just start on this side move our way
forward<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.709> know<00:02:52.830> you've<00:02:53.130> got<00:02:53.310> like<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
forward so you know you've got like the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.330 
forward so you know you've got like the
same<00:02:53.820> design<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.390> wings<00:02:54.830> if<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.950> open<00:02:56.190> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
same design on the wings if you open it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.740 
same design on the wings if you open it
up<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.640> one's<00:02:56.820> got<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.030> great<00:02:57.330> system<00:02:57.690> I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
up this one's got the great system I

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.830 
up this one's got the great system I
couldn't<00:02:58.019> really<00:02:58.110> find<00:02:58.380> any<00:02:58.620> at<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.860> time<00:02:59.840> so

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
just a plate with a sticker but this one

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.530 
just a plate with a sticker but this one
I<00:03:14.130> just<00:03:14.340> had<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.489> plate<00:03:14.760> going<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.209> all<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> way

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
I just had a plate going on all the way

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.069 
I just had a plate going on all the way
cuz<00:03:15.900> my<00:03:16.440> original<00:03:16.860> intention<00:03:17.310> was<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.519> use<00:03:18.079> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
cuz my original intention was to use the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.060 
cuz my original intention was to use the
plate<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:21.150> one<00:03:21.420> but<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.500> couldn't<00:03:22.739> find

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
plate this one but I just couldn't find

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.130 
plate this one but I just couldn't find
the<00:03:23.549> other<00:03:23.579> plate<00:03:24.329> with<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.690> sticker<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.079> it

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
the other plate with the sticker on it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.130 
the other plate with the sticker on it
so<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.500> decided<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:26.280> not<00:03:26.519> go<00:03:26.790> with<00:03:26.820> those<00:03:27.150> since

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
so I decided to not go with those since

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
missiles which I don't really care about

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.310 
missiles which I don't really care about
but<00:03:53.610> this<00:03:53.760> one<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.269> does<00:03:54.450> have<00:03:54.690> missiles<00:03:55.140> in

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.640 
don't really like flick fire missiles I
just<00:04:00.480> added<00:04:00.600> those<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:00.989> there<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.260> match<00:04:01.440> up

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
just added those in there to match up

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.470 
just added those in there to match up
with<00:04:01.739> this<00:04:01.890> design<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.850> side<00:04:03.150> which<00:04:03.329> I'll

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
with this design on that side which I'll

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.140 
with this design on that side which I'll
get<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.660> later<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:05.420> now<00:04:06.420> onto<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:07.970> spot<00:04:08.970> for

by<00:04:23.400> 2<00:04:23.460> down<00:04:23.789> there<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.180> just<00:04:24.360> holds<00:04:24.450> it<00:04:24.690> in

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
by 2 down there that just holds it in

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.499 
by 2 down there that just holds it in
place

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
place

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.179 
place
so<00:04:27.509> you<00:04:27.569> put<00:04:27.780> him<00:04:27.960> down<00:04:28.110> there<00:04:28.319> but<00:04:28.530> anything<00:04:29.099> I

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
so you put him down there but anything I

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:30.529 
so you put him down there but anything I
don't<00:04:29.400> like<00:04:29.580> about<00:04:29.729> this<00:04:29.969> is<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.389> can

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
don't like about this is that you can

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.519 
don't like about this is that you can
see<00:04:30.780> his<00:04:30.960> legs<00:04:31.319> and<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:31.889> can<00:04:31.919> move<00:04:32.189> him<00:04:32.340> around

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:33.529 
see his legs and you can move him around

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.189 
see his legs and you can move him around
so<00:04:34.529> what<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.650> did<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:34.979> fix<00:04:35.219> that<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.960> made<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.080> more

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
so what I did to fix that I made it more

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.980 
so what I did to fix that I made it more
like<00:04:37.409> this<00:04:37.650> where<00:04:38.430> it's<00:04:38.580> got<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:39.599> plate<00:04:39.840> in

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
like this where it's got the plate in

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.959 
like this where it's got the plate in
the<00:04:40.110> middle<00:04:40.229> but<00:04:40.529> then<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.770> two<00:04:40.979> on<00:04:41.219> the<00:04:41.669> side

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
the middle but then the two on the side

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.420 
the middle but then the two on the side
so<00:04:42.900> he's<00:04:43.050> in<00:04:43.199> there<00:04:43.349> more<00:04:43.529> secure<00:04:44.009> you<00:04:44.400> can

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
so he's in there more secure you can

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.510 
so he's in there more secure you can
still<00:04:44.729> get<00:04:44.909> him<00:04:44.969> out<00:04:45.150> fairly<00:04:45.539> easy<00:04:46.370> just<00:04:47.370> by

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
still get him out fairly easy just by

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.110 
still get him out fairly easy just by
you<00:04:47.999> know<00:04:48.050> don't<00:04:49.050> like<00:04:49.490> that<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.969> know<00:04:51.090> you

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
you know don't like that you know you

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.089 
you know don't like that you know you
can<00:04:51.419> get<00:04:51.539> them<00:04:51.659> out<00:04:51.779> like<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.020> but<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:52.830> don't

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
can get them out like that but I don't

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.459 
can get them out like that but I don't
want<00:04:53.279> to<00:04:53.310> do<00:04:53.430> that<00:04:53.550> right<00:04:53.729> now<00:04:54.289> so<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.379> know

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
want to do that right now so you know

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.110 
want to do that right now so you know
overall<00:04:55.770> it's<00:04:56.520> basically<00:04:56.819> the<00:04:56.939> same

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
overall it's basically the same

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.879 
overall it's basically the same
injection<00:04:57.539> system<00:04:58.110> or<00:04:58.229> not<00:04:58.379> exact<00:04:58.740> same

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
injection system or not exact same

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.649 
injection system or not exact same
system<00:04:59.159> just<00:04:59.520> overall<00:04:59.879> where<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.240> joy<00:05:00.449> it<00:05:00.569> is

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
system just overall where the joy it is

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.330 
system just overall where the joy it is
as<00:05:01.080> you<00:05:01.379> can<00:05:01.500> tell<00:05:01.650> this<00:05:01.770> one<00:05:01.949> looks<00:05:02.129> a<00:05:02.219> little

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
as you can tell this one looks a little

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.709 
as you can tell this one looks a little
better<00:05:02.580> because<00:05:02.789> you<00:05:02.969> can't<00:05:03.180> see<00:05:03.330> his<00:05:03.449> legs

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
better because you can't see his legs

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:08.179 
better because you can't see his legs
hanging<00:05:03.990> out<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:06.120> no<00:05:06.900> there's<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.409> no

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
hanging out so no there's that no

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:09.679 
hanging out so no there's that no
landing<00:05:08.610> gear<00:05:08.789> for<00:05:09.090> these<00:05:09.210> sets<00:05:09.479> because

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:09.689 
landing gear for these sets because

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.059 
landing gear for these sets because
mainly<00:05:10.139> this<00:05:10.229> one<00:05:10.409> doesn't<00:05:10.560> have<00:05:10.680> any<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.039> I

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
mainly this one doesn't have any so I

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:12.350 
mainly this one doesn't have any so I
didn't<00:05:11.279> want<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.490> put<00:05:11.610> them<00:05:11.699> in<00:05:11.759> this<00:05:11.969> one<00:05:12.210> I

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
didn't want to put them in this one I

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.490 
didn't want to put them in this one I
couldn't<00:05:12.539> really<00:05:12.689> figure<00:05:12.870> out<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.020> good<00:05:13.229> design

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
couldn't really figure out a good design

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.540 
couldn't really figure out a good design
you<00:05:14.960> know<00:05:15.960> that's<00:05:16.169> pretty<00:05:16.289> much<00:05:16.409> it<00:05:16.740> fruit<00:05:17.099> the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
you know that's pretty much it fruit the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.159 
you know that's pretty much it fruit the
wings<00:05:17.819> then<00:05:18.120> on<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.330> back<00:05:18.539> as<00:05:18.779> you<00:05:18.810> can<00:05:18.930> tell

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
wings then on the back as you can tell

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.600 
wings then on the back as you can tell
there's<00:05:19.349> just<00:05:19.500> some<00:05:19.680> minor<00:05:19.919> color

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
there's just some minor color

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.719 
there's just some minor color
differences<00:05:21.529> then<00:05:22.529> on<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.740> cockpit<00:05:23.039> inside

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
differences then on the cockpit inside

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.800 
differences then on the cockpit inside
this<00:05:24.389> one<00:05:25.370> it's<00:05:26.370> got<00:05:26.610> like<00:05:26.849> it's<00:05:27.419> got<00:05:27.599> two

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
this one it's got like it's got two

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.119 
this one it's got like it's got two
plates<00:05:28.499> stacked<00:05:28.889> up<00:05:29.159> whereas<00:05:29.699> this<00:05:29.939> one<00:05:30.240> on

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
plates stacked up whereas this one on

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.070 
plates stacked up whereas this one on
the<00:05:32.129> yellow<00:05:32.339> one<00:05:32.580> has<00:05:32.819> three<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:33.659> it's<00:05:33.810> like

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
the yellow one has three so it's like

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.079 
the yellow one has three so it's like
level<00:05:34.620> with<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.979> rather<00:05:35.250> than<00:05:35.490> this<00:05:35.699> one<00:05:35.939> where

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.089 
level with it rather than this one where

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.519 
level with it rather than this one where
you<00:05:36.150> can<00:05:36.240> work<00:05:36.689> that<00:05:36.900> like<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.080> little<00:05:37.229> gap

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 
you can work that like a little gap

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.079 
you can work that like a little gap
right<00:05:37.680> there<00:05:38.900> so<00:05:39.900> you<00:05:39.960> know<00:05:40.080> it's<00:05:40.229> got<00:05:40.879> no<00:05:41.879> gap

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.089 
right there so you know it's got no gap

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.570 
right there so you know it's got no gap
so<00:05:43.080> you<00:05:43.139> know<00:05:43.439> that's<00:05:43.589> interiors<00:05:44.399> are

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
so you know that's interiors are

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.100 
so you know that's interiors are
basically<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:45.089> same<00:05:45.120> this<00:05:45.539> one<00:05:45.719> has<00:05:45.839> got<00:05:45.960> the

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
basically the same this one has got the

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.230 
basically the same this one has got the
tan<00:05:46.319> detail<00:05:46.770> where<00:05:47.279> that<00:05:47.520> one<00:05:47.639> has<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:47.819> grey

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
tan detail where that one has the grey

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.670 
tan detail where that one has the grey
mainly<00:05:48.659> because<00:05:48.779> the<00:05:49.199> grey<00:05:49.529> I<00:05:51.560> didn't<00:05:52.560> have

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
mainly because the grey I didn't have

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.439 
mainly because the grey I didn't have
any<00:05:52.889> more<00:05:53.099> tan<00:05:53.370> pieces<00:05:53.819> that's<00:05:54.000> basically<00:05:54.300> the

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
any more tan pieces that's basically the

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.110 
any more tan pieces that's basically the
main<00:05:54.599> reason<00:05:55.430> sorry<00:05:56.430> about<00:05:56.580> that<00:05:56.610> this<00:05:56.879> piece
