and<00:02:18.080> gently<00:02:18.830> put<00:02:19.040> them<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.890> they<00:02:21.890> will

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
and gently put them in and they will

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.949 
and gently put them in and they will
float<00:02:22.370> up<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.819> top<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.450> might<00:02:23.660> want<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
float up to the top so you might want to

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.199 
float up to the top so you might want to
take<00:02:25.000> some<00:02:26.000> type<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:27.910> paintbrush<00:02:28.910> or

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
take some type of like paintbrush or

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.870 
take some type of like paintbrush or
like<00:02:29.450> styling<00:02:30.319> tool<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:31.459> push<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.850> to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
like styling tool and just push it to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.610 
like styling tool and just push it to
the<00:02:32.000> bottom<00:02:32.420> where<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:33.080> will<00:02:33.260> become<00:02:33.590> really

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
the bottom where it will become really

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.070 
the bottom where it will become really
soft<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.400> instantly<00:02:35.330> it'll<00:02:35.660> become<00:02:35.750> really

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
soft and instantly it'll become really

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.320 
soft and instantly it'll become really
soft<00:02:36.380> but<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.709> want<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.920> wait<00:02:37.069> for<00:02:37.100> about<00:02:37.970> 3<00:02:38.300> to

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
soft but you want to wait for about 3 to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.420 
soft but you want to wait for about 3 to
5<00:02:38.750> minutes<00:02:39.170> for<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.620> become<00:02:39.950> completely

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
5 minutes for it to become completely

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.640 
5 minutes for it to become completely
soft<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:43.550> once<00:02:43.880> your<00:02:44.060> clay<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.360> soft<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:45.410> will

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
soft so once your clay is soft it will

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.309 
soft so once your clay is soft it will
look<00:02:45.769> like<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.100> if<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.519> poke<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.360> stick

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
look like this if you poke like a stick

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.470 
look like this if you poke like a stick
into<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:49.069> should<00:02:49.310> be<00:02:49.489> really<00:02:50.030> really<00:02:50.060> nice

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
into it it should be really really nice

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.880 
into it it should be really really nice
and<00:02:50.690> soft<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:52.120> be<00:02:53.120> careful<00:02:53.480> not<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:54.500> not<00:02:54.650> let

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
and soft and be careful not to not let

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.740 
and soft and be careful not to not let
it<00:02:55.069> stick<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.760> bottom<00:02:56.180> because<00:02:56.360> if<00:02:56.630> it

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
it stick to the bottom because if it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.120 
it stick to the bottom because if it
sticks<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.110> bottom<00:02:57.290> then<00:02:57.709> it'll<00:02:58.069> be

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
sticks to the bottom then it'll be

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.610 
sticks to the bottom then it'll be
really<00:02:58.340> hard<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.519> get<00:02:58.730> off<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.410> you're<00:03:00.410> going

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
really hard to get off so you're going

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.910 
really hard to get off so you're going
to<00:03:00.680> take<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.069> out<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:03.200> once<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.530> take<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.830> out

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
to take this out so once you take it out

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.650 
to take this out so once you take it out
it's<00:03:04.130> really<00:03:04.370> soft<00:03:04.760> but<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.299> want<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.540> work

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
it's really soft but you do want to work

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.039 
it's really soft but you do want to work
really<00:03:06.080> fast<00:03:06.440> because<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.920> om<00:03:07.250> eruv<00:03:07.489> does

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
really fast because this om eruv does

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.810 
really fast because this om eruv does
harden<00:03:09.049> really<00:03:09.620> fast<00:03:09.860> just<00:03:10.220> want<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.640> roll<00:03:10.790> it

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
harden really fast just want to roll it

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.610 
harden really fast just want to roll it
up<00:03:11.000> until<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.390> bulb<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.290> want<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.500> make

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
up until a bulb and you want to make

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.170 
up until a bulb and you want to make
sure<00:03:12.739> there's<00:03:12.950> no<00:03:13.130> like<00:03:13.370> creases<00:03:13.880> or<00:03:14.060> anything

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
sure there's no like creases or anything

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.150 
sure there's no like creases or anything
and<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.110> want<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.320> smooth<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.739> out<00:03:15.890> really

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
and you want to smooth it out really

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.789 
and you want to smooth it out really
nicely<00:03:16.459> cuz<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.120> don't<00:03:17.269> want<00:03:17.540> your<00:03:18.200> mold<00:03:18.560> to

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
nicely cuz you don't want your mold to

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.050 
nicely cuz you don't want your mold to
rip<00:03:19.630> after<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.870> hardens<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.730> good<00:03:22.880> thing

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
rip after it hardens and the good thing

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.920 
rip after it hardens and the good thing
about<00:03:23.090> oil<00:03:23.329> maru<00:03:23.780> is<00:03:24.049> that<00:03:24.350> after<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:26.420> hardens

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
about oil maru is that after it hardens

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.509 
about oil maru is that after it hardens
and<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.440> don't<00:03:27.590> like<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.980> way<00:03:28.130> your<00:03:28.310> mold

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
and you don't like the way your mold

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.050 
and you don't like the way your mold
turn<00:03:28.730> out<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.359> can<00:03:29.480> always<00:03:29.660> remake<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:31.060> yeah

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
turn out you can always remake it yeah

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.849 
turn out you can always remake it yeah
so<00:03:32.299> right<00:03:32.480> now<00:03:32.660> I'm<00:03:32.870> just<00:03:32.989> pushing<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.590> sides

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
so right now I'm just pushing the sides

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:40.750 
so right now I'm just pushing the sides
of<00:03:34.390> my<00:03:35.390> mold<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.880> make<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.600> more<00:03:38.690> perfect<00:03:39.760> so

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
of my mold to make it more perfect so

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.699 
of my mold to make it more perfect so
you'll<00:03:40.910> want<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.150> gently<00:03:41.390> take<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.989> out<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
you'll want to gently take it out of the

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.160 
you'll want to gently take it out of the
mold<00:03:42.890> like<00:03:43.070> that<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.670> that<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.180> your<00:03:44.390> hold<00:03:47.170> so

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
mold like that and that is your hold so

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.960 
mold like that and that is your hold so
now<00:03:48.320> I'm<00:03:48.440> going<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.650> do<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.920> comparison<00:03:49.519> between

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
now I'm going to do a comparison between

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.330 
now I'm going to do a comparison between
these<00:03:50.480> two<00:03:50.810> molds<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.560> course<00:03:51.950> this<00:03:52.040> one<00:03:52.310> is

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
these two molds of course this one is

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.090 
these two molds of course this one is
the<00:03:52.760> silicone<00:03:53.450> one<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:54.530> one<00:03:54.739> is<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.070> eye

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
the silicone one and this one is the eye

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.250 
the silicone one and this one is the eye
of<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.489> loose<00:03:55.730> bolt<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.810> I'm<00:03:56.870> going<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.079> start

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
of a loose bolt so I'm going to start

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:07.560 
of a loose bolt so I'm going to start
off<00:03:57.350> with<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:58.780> silicone<00:03:59.780> we'll<00:03:59.989> play

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.690 

so<00:04:08.570> if<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.750> take<00:04:08.960> it<00:04:09.080> out<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.650> mold<00:04:10.010> you

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
so if you take it out of the mold you

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.930 
so if you take it out of the mold you
can<00:04:10.850> see<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.600> does<00:04:11.900> take<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.260> detailing

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
can see that it does take the detailing

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.479 
can see that it does take the detailing
quite<00:04:13.940> nicely<00:04:16.750> so<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:18.709> course<00:04:18.980> the<00:04:19.130> silicone

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
quite nicely so of course the silicone

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.030 
quite nicely so of course the silicone
is<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.700> very<00:04:19.880> nice<00:04:20.260> multi-use<00:04:21.260> so<00:04:21.859> now<00:04:21.980> I'm

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
is a very nice multi-use so now I'm

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.480 
is a very nice multi-use so now I'm
going<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.220> compare<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:24.380> silicone<00:04:24.890> mold<00:04:25.340> put

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
going to compare the silicone mold put

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.270 
going to compare the silicone mold put
it<00:04:25.610> using<00:04:25.970> this<00:04:26.180> mold<00:04:26.720> made<00:04:27.200> from<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.620> plastic

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
it using this mold made from the plastic
