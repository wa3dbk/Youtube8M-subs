the best gear this that's the crystal
Forge<00:00:17.190> set<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:18.420> thought<00:00:19.140> it'd<00:00:19.289> look<00:00:19.410> pretty

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
Forge set I thought it'd look pretty

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.470 
Forge set I thought it'd look pretty
cool<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:20.400> riding<00:00:20.699> around<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
cool so I was riding around with it and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.300 
cool so I was riding around with it and
of<00:00:21.930> course<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.320> didn't<00:00:22.500> stay<00:00:22.680> with<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> presto

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
of course I didn't stay with the presto

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.480 
of course I didn't stay with the presto
forge<00:00:23.609> set<00:00:23.939> because<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:26.160> it's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
forge set because it is that it's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.140 
forge set because it is that it's
useless<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.480> PvP<00:00:28.160> mainly<00:00:29.160> because<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.939> need

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
useless in PvP mainly because you need

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.540 
useless in PvP mainly because you need
resilience<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.109> resilience<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
resilience and resilience is what is

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790
