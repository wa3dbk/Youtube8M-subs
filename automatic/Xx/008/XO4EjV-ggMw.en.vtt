like<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> lot<00:01:29.399> my<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.180> best<00:01:30.390> friends<00:01:30.810> now

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
like a lot my one of my best friends now

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.050 
like a lot my one of my best friends now
was<00:01:31.859> actually<00:01:31.979> my<00:01:32.219> flatmate<00:01:32.609> from<00:01:32.789> my<00:01:32.880> first

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
was actually my flatmate from my first

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.209 
was actually my flatmate from my first
year<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.469> way<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:34.740> put<00:01:34.890> people
