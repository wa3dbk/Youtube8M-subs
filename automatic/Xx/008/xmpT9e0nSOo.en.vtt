00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
black so it had a rougher texture just

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
black so it had a rougher texture just
painted<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.259> had<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> rougher<00:01:52.829> texture

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
painted it so I had a rougher texture

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190 
painted it so I had a rougher texture
and<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.549> did<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.909> part<00:01:54.390> yellow<00:01:54.810> cuz<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and then I did this part yellow cuz I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.590 
and then I did this part yellow cuz I
thought<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:55.590> look<00:01:55.710> nice<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.600> then

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
thought that would look nice and then

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.530 
thought that would look nice and then
these<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.759> legs

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
these the legs

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.389 
these the legs
I<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:01.049> put<00:02:01.259> red<00:02:01.470> right<00:02:01.740> there<00:02:01.950> cuz<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.220> thought

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
I just put red right there cuz I thought

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.789 
I just put red right there cuz I thought
they<00:02:03.180> needed<00:02:03.420> something<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.439> think<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
they needed something and I think that

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.069 
they needed something and I think that
