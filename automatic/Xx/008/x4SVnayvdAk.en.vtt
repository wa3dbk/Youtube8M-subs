record<00:00:47.160> while<00:00:47.399> playing<00:00:47.730> that's<00:00:48.120> why<00:00:48.239> I'm

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
record while playing that's why I'm

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.240 
record while playing that's why I'm
doing<00:00:48.420> right<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.079> only<00:00:49.410> had<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.890> did<00:00:50.129> it

doing right now I only had I did it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.209 
doing right now I only had I did it
because<00:00:50.339> it'd<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.790> easier<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.980> explain<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
because it'd be easier to explain the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.450 
because it'd be easier to explain the
