00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 I'll show you in the following video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.770
 you like your external drives under os 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.670
 10 throw it out properly and you again 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.670
 can activate 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.910
 many of you know this as just 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.000
 umsteiger von windows you are one 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.040
 usb stick or an external disk one 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.730
 sd card whatever in the mac purely 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.710
 makes your thing and habit moderate 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.530
 she just pulls out then comes the 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.440
 following message here the hard disk 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.510
 was not ejected correctly why 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.850
 Should I throw the hard disk out of it ? 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.600
 what does that bring under windows is it 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.820
 not otherwise 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.770
 actually there is hardware 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.480
 Remove it safely and you should 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.550
 under windows actually do too 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.520
 for those who have half already 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.970
 Pictures so so pictures with so scrimp 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.970
 or with too gray content or partially 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.119
 gray content on usb sticks on 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.619
 sd cards have found the knowledge 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.540
 What I mean that is because 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.130
 that during a write operation the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.880
 also in the background of the operating system 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.060
 on the external disk to the external one 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.910
 Drive on the SD card to be completed 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.830
 This device has been removed and thus 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.920
 the writing process is aborted 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.890
 but since the many windows users that 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.110
 not necessarily wanted to indulge every time 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.510
 sure to remove the hardware 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.360
 one gave the possibility the house 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.710
 to draw in nine out of ten cases 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.190
 just to give an example 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.400
 call 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.350
 nothing happens and so zamek 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.659
 in principle , but you get the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.630
 Nevertheless you should warn if you 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.470
 external volumes or sticks have these 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.650
 eject 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.100
 on the one hand you can do that here in the enemy 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.220
 do 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.049
 here clicks in the enemy on the device 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.390
 on it the equipment for the here in the 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.369
 sidebar you see i have here 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.259
 Network drives connected and under devices 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.080
 down here that can of course be one 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.720
 another place to be with you you will find 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.570
 my usb stick if you stick usb 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.799
 does not find or devices here with you 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.350
 is not displayed 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.200
 then you click on enemy attitudes 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.930
 and ensures in the rider sidebar 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.130
 that down here are external hard drives 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.620
 are displayed 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.790
 then we can stick a usb here 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.180
 Eject once 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.340
 and if you remove him now 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.620
 then there is no message all 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.049
 Write and read operations are here 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.700
 Completed by the system and that 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.370
 device can be removed 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.489
 So to speak, I want to go mountain again 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.379
 the possibility remains short the device 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.510
 pull out of the usb port or out 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.909
 the sd card slot or the panda 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.739
 bolt port wherever and just easy 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.000
 plug in again or it will turn off 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.019
 and turn it back on 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.760
 Is this fine with you here? 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.400
 throw out something too elaborate then you can 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.790
 you also go to the device right here 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.310
 mouse button usb stick eject or say 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.760
 You do that with the key combination 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.980
 command and e 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.389
 another possibility you can too 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.389
 The device simply on the trash 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.980
 then pull is also thrown out 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.469
 Another possibility is you start 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.599
 once the hard disk utility 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:24.359
 That's where I'm on the left 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.519
 side once the device itself and the 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.040
 on it partitions 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.439
 I can throw the device out here too 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.450
 or I can only do a single one 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.230
 disable partitions 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.450
 that means I say disabled 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.430
 and you see now this is the device of 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.319
 desk ejected here too now 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.170
 I can pull it out without that 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.490
 Osc complains and if I am again 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.900
 tuck it is automatically reported 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.690
 or i can do the partition here 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.180
 deactivate 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.820
 then the device is ejected here and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.210
 I can activate it very quickly 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.440
 Activate mountain again 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.330
 currently this may be a bit 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.840
 cumbersome or seems cumbersome too 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.090
 his 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.210
 however, you should use external devices 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.010
 actually throw it out and again 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.989
 mountain on your mac just around 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.299
 ensure that no write and 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.100
 readings take place more and data 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.560
 be damaged 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.940
 I hope you flag this helpful 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.410
 this place still the hint looks 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.570
 in a channel there you will find over 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.530
 250 more videos around the topic apple 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.390
 mac os 10 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.770
 A visit to a max de is also worthwhile 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.870
 There you will not only see the block or 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.580
 a little more about me but also that 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.080
 entire video archive i tell many 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.380
 thanks for watching and until the next 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.380
 times
