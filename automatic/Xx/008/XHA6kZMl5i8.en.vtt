00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
seem like it's based a lot around just

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.710 
seem like it's based a lot around just
kind<00:01:48.710> of<00:01:48.770> like<00:01:49.000> reshuffling<00:01:50.000> what<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.570> do

kind of like reshuffling what you do
during<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.020> day<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:52.010> be<00:01:52.190> like<00:01:52.910> have<00:01:53.390> like<00:01:53.420> a

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
during the day to be like have like a

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
15-minute walk and eat one of these

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.050 
15-minute walk and eat one of these
beefy<00:01:56.030> shakes<00:01:56.300> every<00:01:56.600> morning<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:58.060> go

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
beefy shakes every morning and go

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.880 
beefy shakes every morning and go
outside<00:01:59.360> for<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.020> break<00:02:00.260> every<00:02:00.410> now<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.740> then

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
outside for a break every now and then

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.670 
outside for a break every now and then
people<00:02:01.490> who<00:02:01.729> just<00:02:01.940> sit<00:02:02.090> around<00:02:02.119> all<00:02:02.420> day

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
people who just sit around all day

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.280 
people who just sit around all day
benefit<00:02:03.680> from<00:02:03.890> greatly<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.210> think<00:02:05.330> that's<00:02:06.140> a

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
benefit from greatly so I think that's a

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.719 
benefit from greatly so I think that's a

sin a source might be probably going to

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.880 
sin a source might be probably going to
check<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.000> out<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.739> do<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:09.770> boo<00:02:09.979> boo<00:02:10.009> boo<00:02:11.890> the

well<00:02:54.860> no<00:02:54.890> Tony<00:02:55.700> Stark<00:02:56.000> would<00:02:56.180> have<00:02:56.390> like<00:02:56.720> an

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
well no Tony Stark would have like an

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.150 
well no Tony Stark would have like an
overwhelming<00:02:57.680> amount<00:02:57.769> of<00:02:57.980> data<00:02:58.190> at<00:02:58.489> any<00:02:58.670> given

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
overwhelming amount of data at any given

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.180 
overwhelming amount of data at any given
because<00:02:59.910> he<00:03:00.210> can<00:03:00.390> process<00:03:00.600> at<00:03:00.900> all<00:03:00.990> like<00:03:01.290> like

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
because he can process at all like like

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.280 
because he can process at all like like
he<00:03:02.820> related<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.360> like<00:03:03.600> if<00:03:03.780> somebody<00:03:04.140> who

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
he related it to like if somebody who

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.380 
he related it to like if somebody who
doesn't<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.740> any<00:03:05.040> kind<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.520> close<00:03:06.360> to

what<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.390> can<00:03:15.600> be<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> Tony<00:03:15.990> Stark<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.500> do<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
what I can be a Tony Stark and do the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.950 
what I can be a Tony Stark and do the
