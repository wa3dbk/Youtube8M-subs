video now first of all I think is going

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
video now first of all I think is going
to<00:00:47.309> depend<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.820> which<00:00:48.300> area<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.230> for

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
to depend on which area you are in for

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.740 
to depend on which area you are in for
instance<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> more<00:00:51.210> run<00:00:51.510> down

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
instance if we are in the more run down

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.439 
instance if we are in the more run down

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and all that kind of stuff whereas if we

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
go into the rundown type types of parts

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.359 
go into the rundown type types of parts
of<00:01:06.900> Los<00:01:07.260> Santos<00:01:07.439> suppose<00:01:07.860> we're<00:01:08.070> gonna<00:01:08.159> get

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
of Los Santos suppose we're gonna get

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
of Los Santos suppose we're gonna get
gangs<00:01:08.670> such<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.240> grocery<00:01:09.780> barliss<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> all

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
gangs such as grocery barliss and all

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
gangs such as grocery barliss and all
that<00:01:10.830> kind<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.159> stuff<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> be

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that kind of stuff so it's going to be

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600 
that kind of stuff so it's going to be
more<00:01:12.540> rough<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> city

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
more rough then it would be in the city

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.700 
more rough then it would be in the city
so<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> city<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.290> instance<00:01:16.619> i

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so if we are in the city for instance i

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
so if we are in the city for instance i
think<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.159> pedestrians<00:01:17.759> are<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> be

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
think the pedestrians are going to be

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.840 
think the pedestrians are going to be
more<00:01:18.750> mature<00:01:19.049> i<00:01:19.350> guess<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.860> could<00:01:19.979> say<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.460> mean

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
more mature i guess you could say I mean

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.039 
more mature i guess you could say I mean
of<00:01:20.970> course<00:01:21.000> we're<00:01:21.270> gonna<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.630> them<00:01:21.840> walking

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
of course we're gonna see them walking

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
of course we're gonna see them walking
with<00:01:22.290> briefcases<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.549> kind<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
with briefcases and all that kind of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.249 
with briefcases and all that kind of
stuff<00:01:23.909> since<00:01:24.330> we've<00:01:24.570> seen<00:01:24.750> them<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.140> be

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
stuff since we've seen them to be

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.929 
stuff since we've seen them to be
lawyers<00:01:25.470> businessmen<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.400> said<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> few

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.179 
could come over and salt the police
officer<00:01:42.960> maybe<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.979> would<00:01:44.070> be

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
officer maybe I think that would be

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.620 
officer maybe I think that would be
pretty<00:01:44.369> cool<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> realistic<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:45.540> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
pretty cool and realistic and then of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.240 
pretty cool and realistic and then of
course<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.960> may<00:01:46.170> actually<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.829> drunk

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
actually it would be pretty funny

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.789 
actually it would be pretty funny
because<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.689> mean<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.110> imagine<00:01:52.229> walking<00:01:52.560> down

depends<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.780> location<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.649> then<00:02:05.040> of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
depends on the location and then of

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.859 
depends on the location and then of
course<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> official<00:02:05.939> gameplay<00:02:06.180> video<00:02:06.719> we

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
course in the official gameplay video we

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.660 
course in the official gameplay video we
actually<00:02:07.200> did<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.680> some<00:02:07.950> guy<00:02:08.190> say<00:02:08.640> to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
actually did see some guy say to

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.790 
actually did see some guy say to
Franklin<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.810> out<00:02:09.929> or<00:02:10.080> feel<00:02:10.229> something<00:02:10.259> like

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
Franklin get out or feel something like

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.610 
Franklin get out or feel something like
that<00:02:11.069> so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
that so

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.949 
that so
all<00:02:11.680> goes<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.220> how<00:02:12.549> pedestrians<00:02:13.360> will<00:02:13.659> behave

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
all goes on how pedestrians will behave

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.960 
all goes on how pedestrians will behave
I<00:02:14.319> mean<00:02:14.650> some<00:02:14.920> people<00:02:15.220> might<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.519> completely

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
I mean some people might be completely

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.059 
I mean some people might be completely
crazy<00:02:16.510> pedestrians<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.440> some<00:02:17.620> people<00:02:17.950> might

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
crazy pedestrians and some people might

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.030 
crazy pedestrians and some people might
be<00:02:18.310> normal<00:02:18.909> smart<00:02:19.239> people<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.840> who<00:02:20.620> knows<00:02:20.799> we

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
be normal smart people and who knows we

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.920 
be normal smart people and who knows we
actually<00:02:21.370> might<00:02:21.549> see<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:21.879> riot<00:02:22.269> because<00:02:22.659> I<00:02:22.780> mean

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
actually might see a riot because I mean

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.750 
actually might see a riot because I mean
we<00:02:23.049> actually<00:02:23.319> did<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> cheap<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:24.489> this<00:02:24.610> in

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
we actually did have a cheap for this in

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.660 
we actually did have a cheap for this in
like<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:25.060> old<00:02:25.209> GTA<00:02:25.659> so<00:02:25.780> maybe<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:27.310> didn't<00:02:27.580> have

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
like the old GTA so maybe we didn't have

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.309 
like the old GTA so maybe we didn't have
to<00:02:27.790> use<00:02:27.909> a<00:02:27.940> cheat<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.360> them<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.599> do<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.930> riot

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
to use a cheat for them to do a riot

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.780 
to use a cheat for them to do a riot
that<00:02:29.680> would<00:02:29.799> be<00:02:29.920> pretty<00:02:30.129> awesome<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.610> seeing

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
that would be pretty awesome just seeing

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.369 
that would be pretty awesome just seeing
like<00:02:30.909> a<00:02:31.209> mob<00:02:31.690> or<00:02:31.840> something<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.319> that

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
like a mob or something like that

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.140 
like a mob or something like that
another<00:02:32.920> thing<00:02:33.220> was<00:02:33.430> when<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.760> were<00:02:33.879> driving

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
another thing was when you were driving

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.670 
another thing was when you were driving
and<00:02:34.390> if<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.659> were<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.780> hit<00:02:34.989> someone<00:02:35.260> else's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
and if you were to hit someone else's

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.259 
and if you were to hit someone else's
car<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.010> pedestrians<00:02:36.549> would<00:02:36.640> actually<00:02:37.060> go

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
car the pedestrians would actually go

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.880 
car the pedestrians would actually go
out<00:02:37.390> their<00:02:37.599> car<00:02:37.840> but<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.379> actually<00:02:38.530> only

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
out their car but this actually only

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.160 
out their car but this actually only
happened<00:02:39.340> when<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:39.519> actually<00:02:40.180> hit<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.599> so<00:02:40.810> this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
happened when we actually hit it so this

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.559 
happened when we actually hit it so this
got<00:02:41.530> me<00:02:41.680> thinking<00:02:41.709> someone<00:02:42.459> else's<00:02:42.819> car<00:02:43.030> can

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
got me thinking someone else's car can

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.000 
got me thinking someone else's car can
they<00:02:43.690> actually<00:02:43.810> get<00:02:44.200> out<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.379> like<00:02:44.769> have<00:02:44.980> a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
they actually get out and like have a

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.160 
they actually get out and like have a
fight<00:02:45.129> maybe<00:02:45.730> cuz<00:02:46.269> some<00:02:46.480> drivers<00:02:46.900> are<00:02:47.019> more

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
fight maybe cuz some drivers are more

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.229 
fight maybe cuz some drivers are more
arrogant<00:02:47.440> their<00:02:47.829> covers<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:48.819> all<00:02:48.940> falls

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
arrogant their covers so this all falls

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.300 
arrogant their covers so this all falls
down<00:02:49.359> under<00:02:49.840> pedestrian<00:02:50.379> behavior<00:02:50.859> and<00:02:51.069> then

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
down under pedestrian behavior and then

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.250 
down under pedestrian behavior and then
of<00:02:51.400> course<00:02:51.459> we<00:02:51.819> have<00:02:51.940> drug<00:02:52.239> users<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.019> game

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
of course we have drug users in the game

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.140 
of course we have drug users in the game
like<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:53.890> ran<00:02:54.069> a<00:02:54.099> pedestrian<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.790> taking

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
drugs that all falls down on the way

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.740 
drugs that all falls down on the way

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
they were behaving me some might be

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.809

extremely<00:02:59.470> happy<00:02:59.650> maybe<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:00.489> then<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.790> course

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
extremely happy maybe and then of course

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.880

we will get the more rundown types of

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.009 
we will get the more rundown types of
people<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.579> like<00:03:03.819> that<00:03:04.060> feel<00:03:04.239> suicidal<00:03:04.510> and

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
people and like that feel suicidal and

all<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.290> kind<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.650> stuff<00:03:05.709> but<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.670> sum<00:03:06.849> this

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
all that kind of stuff but to sum this

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.190 
all that kind of stuff but to sum this
whole<00:03:07.150> video<00:03:07.359> up<00:03:07.599> into<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.870> nutshell

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
whole video up into a nutshell

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.140 
whole video up into a nutshell
personally<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:08.950> think<00:03:09.010> it's<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.579> to<00:03:09.670> vary<00:03:09.909> on
