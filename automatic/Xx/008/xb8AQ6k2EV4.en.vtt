the table what that means is when

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.670 
the table what that means is when
someone<00:01:58.790> plays<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.270> jack<00:01:59.659> out<00:01:59.900> like<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.380> it's

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
someone plays a jack out like that it's

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.920 
someone plays a jack out like that it's
worth<00:02:00.860> 11<00:02:01.220> points<00:02:01.580> if<00:02:01.760> I<00:02:02.299> have<00:02:02.510> cards<00:02:02.869> that

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
worth 11 points if I have cards that

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.170 
worth 11 points if I have cards that
equal<00:02:03.470> 11<00:02:03.950> points<00:02:04.250> in<00:02:04.310> my<00:02:04.400> hand<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:04.820> can<00:02:05.000> play

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
equal 11 points in my hand I can play

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.730 
equal 11 points in my hand I can play
them<00:02:05.360> full<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:05.869> good<00:02:05.990> from<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.260> same<00:02:06.439> suit

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
them full it's good from the same suit

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.190 
them full it's good from the same suit
so<00:02:07.340> here<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.520> have<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.729> 10<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.630> ace<00:02:08.959> is

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
so here I have a 10 and this ace is

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.080 
so here I have a 10 and this ace is
worth<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.530> 1<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:10.010> could<00:02:10.399> put<00:02:10.640> them<00:02:10.729> together<00:02:10.850> and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
worth a 1 I could put them together and

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.539 
worth a 1 I could put them together and
say<00:02:11.269> I'm<00:02:11.390> playing<00:02:11.660> an<00:02:11.810> 11<00:02:12.350> on<00:02:12.470> top<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.799> that<00:02:12.920> now

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
say I'm playing an 11 on top of that now

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.030 
say I'm playing an 11 on top of that now
you<00:02:13.610> see<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.060> ace<00:02:14.450> there<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:16.610> 14<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:18.709> I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
you see that that ace there is a 14 so I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.759 
you see that that ace there is a 14 so I
could<00:02:19.519> say<00:02:19.820> okay<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.600> my<00:02:20.720> turn<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:21.290> gonna<00:02:21.530> play

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
could say okay on my turn I'm gonna play

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.550 
could say okay on my turn I'm gonna play
this<00:02:21.920> 10<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.459> 4<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.910> top<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.299> ace<00:02:23.560> ok

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
this 10 in this 4 on top of that ace ok

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.270 
this 10 in this 4 on top of that ace ok
so<00:02:24.620> your<00:02:24.860> ought<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.040> do<00:02:25.100> that

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
so your ought to do that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.580 
so your ought to do that
you're<00:02:25.670> also<00:02:25.850> allowed<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.239> do<00:02:26.450> subtraction<00:02:26.660> so

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
you're also allowed to do subtraction so

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.410 
you're also allowed to do subtraction so
if<00:02:27.709> there<00:02:27.860> was<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.010> 3<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.549> top<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:28.970> pile<00:02:29.209> and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
if there was a 3 on top of the pile and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.259 
if there was a 3 on top of the pile and
I<00:02:29.959> had<00:02:30.230> cards<00:02:30.829> that<00:02:31.040> if<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.430> subtract<00:02:31.910> one<00:02:32.239> from

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
I had cards that if I subtract one from

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.509 
I had cards that if I subtract one from
the<00:02:32.450> other<00:02:32.600> one<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:32.989> let's<00:02:33.140> say<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.739> 4

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
the other one so let's say I have a 4

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.670 
the other one so let's say I have a 4
and<00:02:34.549> a<00:02:34.820> 1<00:02:34.850> in<00:02:35.180> my<00:02:35.269> hand<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:36.019> place<00:02:36.470> those

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
and a 1 in my hand I can place those

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.130 
and a 1 in my hand I can place those
down<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.100> say<00:02:37.190> 4<00:02:37.370> minus<00:02:37.610> 1<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.790> 3<00:02:37.989> all<00:02:38.989> right

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
down and say 4 minus 1 is 3 all right

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.710 
down and say 4 minus 1 is 3 all right
pretty<00:02:39.530> simple<00:02:39.920> now<00:02:40.820> there's<00:02:41.329> two<00:02:41.510> ways<00:02:41.540> to

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
pretty simple now there's two ways to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.650 
pretty simple now there's two ways to
win<00:02:42.019> into<00:02:42.769> bomb<00:02:42.950> one<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.670> go<00:02:43.790> out<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.209> you

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
win into bomb one is to go out if you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.060 
win into bomb one is to go out if you
have<00:02:44.780> one<00:02:44.900> card<00:02:45.110> left<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.380> say<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.680> know<00:02:45.829> I'm

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
have one card left you say you know I'm

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.750 
have one card left you say you know I'm
sorry<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:47.110> say<00:02:48.110> last<00:02:48.560> card<00:02:48.860> or<00:02:49.040> one<00:02:49.250> card<00:02:49.519> and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
sorry you say last card or one card and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.520 
sorry you say last card or one card and
if<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.000> don't<00:02:50.180> then<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.540> can<00:02:50.660> take<00:02:50.750> cards<00:02:51.079> ok

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
if you don't then you can take cards ok

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.170 
if you don't then you can take cards ok
they<00:02:52.250> got<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.489> room<00:02:52.640> from<00:02:52.700> some<00:02:52.880> other<00:02:53.000> game

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
they got that room from some other game

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.259 
they got that room from some other game
I<00:02:53.269> think<00:02:53.329> but<00:02:53.720> anyway<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:55.910> if<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.120> play

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
I think but anyway and then if you play

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.150 
I think but anyway and then if you play
that<00:02:56.299> card<00:02:56.480> on<00:02:56.870> your<00:02:57.260> next<00:02:57.500> turn<00:02:57.650> you're<00:02:58.010> out

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
that card on your next turn you're out

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.440 
that card on your next turn you're out
if<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.370> can't<00:02:58.549> play<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.730> card<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.060> your<00:02:59.150> turn<00:02:59.329> by

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
if you can't play a card of your turn by

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.830 
if you can't play a card of your turn by
the<00:02:59.510> way<00:02:59.630> you<00:02:59.690> draw<00:03:00.019> one<00:03:00.230> from<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.440> pile

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
the way you draw one from the pile

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.650 
the way you draw one from the pile
now<00:03:01.830> another<00:03:02.580> way<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.849> go<00:03:03.000> out<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.209> by<00:03:03.599> doing

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
now another way to go out is by doing

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.809 
now another way to go out is by doing
what's<00:03:04.020> called<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.260> natural<00:03:04.530> de<00:03:04.860> bomb<00:03:05.040> if

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
what's called a natural de bomb if

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.030 
what's called a natural de bomb if
there's<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> card<00:03:06.540> out<00:03:07.080> let's<00:03:07.410> say<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:07.709> nine

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
there's a card out let's say this nine

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.949 
there's a card out let's say this nine
is<00:03:08.250> out<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.670> all<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.270> cards<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:09.810> hand

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
is out and all the cards in my hand

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.339 
is out and all the cards in my hand
together<00:03:10.890> equal<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:11.940> cost<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.480> card<00:03:12.750> so

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
together equal that cost of that card so

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.690 
together equal that cost of that card so
here<00:03:13.590> let's<00:03:14.010> say<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.160> have<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> three<00:03:14.459> three<00:03:14.610> a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
here let's say I have a three three a

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.170 
here let's say I have a three three a
two<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.970> one

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
two and one

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.270 
two and one
and<00:03:15.360> as<00:03:15.989> soon<00:03:16.170> as<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.380> happens<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:17.040> doesn't

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
and as soon as this happens it doesn't

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.680 
and as soon as this happens it doesn't
have<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.519> my<00:03:17.670> turn<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:18.030> can<00:03:18.239> slam<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.569> my

cards down and shout to bomb now this

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.150 
cards down and shout to bomb now this
doesn't<00:03:20.819> happen<00:03:21.030> very<00:03:21.180> often<00:03:21.830> all<00:03:22.830> right<00:03:22.950> well

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
doesn't happen very often all right well

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.770 
doesn't happen very often all right well
maybe<00:03:23.550> at<00:03:23.819> least<00:03:23.940> hasn't<00:03:24.269> in<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.420> games<00:03:24.630> I

play out a natural de bomb
so<00:03:31.470> that's<00:03:31.650> basically<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:33.350> basic<00:03:35.120> rules<00:03:36.120> of

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
so that's basically the basic rules of

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.699 
so that's basically the basic rules of
the<00:03:36.330> game<00:03:36.540> there's<00:03:36.900> some<00:03:37.019> really<00:03:37.200> weird<00:03:37.350> rules

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
the game there's some really weird rules

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.229 
the game there's some really weird rules
too<00:03:37.950> if<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.310> play<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> card<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.850> change<00:03:39.120> your

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
too if you play a card you change your

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.270 
too if you play a card you change your
mind<00:03:39.480> before<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.500> next<00:03:40.680> person<00:03:40.950> plays<00:03:41.130> you

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
mind before the next person plays you

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.500 
mind before the next person plays you
can<00:03:41.430> take<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.730> off<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:42.000> course<00:03:42.030> if<00:03:42.269> you<00:03:42.360> do<00:03:42.480> that

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
can take it off of course if you do that

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.300 
can take it off of course if you do that
the<00:03:43.049> person<00:03:43.410> who<00:03:43.530> played<00:03:43.739> before<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.160> can

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
the person who played before you can

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.100 
the person who played before you can
take<00:03:44.430> their<00:03:44.640> card<00:03:44.910> off<00:03:45.060> too<00:03:45.299> it's<00:03:45.690> really<00:03:45.750> kind

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
take their card off too it's really kind

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.350 
take their card off too it's really kind
of<00:03:46.170> an<00:03:46.290> odd<00:03:46.440> rule<00:03:46.799> but<00:03:47.580> that's<00:03:47.700> basic<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.180> bond

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
of an odd rule but that's basic the bond

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.300 
of an odd rule but that's basic the bond
now<00:03:48.720> intermediate<00:03:49.260> dabangg<00:03:49.500> adds<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:50.099> couple

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
now intermediate dabangg adds a couple

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.089 
now intermediate dabangg adds a couple
things<00:03:50.780> mostly<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.410> coolest<00:03:52.799> rule<00:03:53.010> of

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
things mostly the coolest rule of

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.860 
things mostly the coolest rule of
intermediate<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.610> bond<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.000> one<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.180> you

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
intermediate the bond and the one I you

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.030 
intermediate the bond and the one I you
know<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.019> don't<00:03:55.260> know<00:03:55.410> why<00:03:55.530> they<00:03:55.650> didn't<00:03:55.950> have

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
know I don't know why they didn't have

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.949 
know I don't know why they didn't have
any<00:03:56.190> original<00:03:56.459> one<00:03:56.610> is<00:03:56.730> if<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.299> play<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.569> draw

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
any original one is if you play a draw

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.050 
any original one is if you play a draw
to<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.830> next<00:03:59.069> person<00:03:59.340> can<00:03:59.400> play<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.610> draw<00:03:59.849> too
