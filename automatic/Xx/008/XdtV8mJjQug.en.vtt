go<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> machine<00:01:28.350> gun<00:01:28.530> spree<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.189> get<00:01:29.340> no

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
go on a machine gun spree you can get no

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
go on a machine gun spree you can get no
end<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.850> points<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.270> win<00:01:30.360> games<00:01:30.659> kind<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.350> play

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
end of points and win games kind of play

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.899 
end of points and win games kind of play
in<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.740> way<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:31.979> i<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.220> crowd<00:01:32.520> control

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
in that way so i think crowd control

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
in that way so i think crowd control
isn't<00:01:33.060> insanely<00:01:33.570> good<00:01:33.960> perk<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.500> heavy

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
isn't insanely good perk for heavy

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
isn't insanely good perk for heavy

an absolute beast it's remarkable how

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.840 
an absolute beast it's remarkable how
many<00:01:52.110> kills<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.860> actually<00:01:53.310> pick<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.670> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
many kills you can actually pick up that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.370 
many kills you can actually pick up that
you<00:01:53.939> didn't<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.390> know<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.840> other<00:01:54.990> rocket

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you didn't you know with other rocket

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.719 
you didn't you know with other rocket
launches<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.770> wouldn't<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
launches you wouldn't even get a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.609 
launches you wouldn't even get a
hitmarker<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.200> grenades<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
hitmarker with so grenades and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.620 
hitmarker with so grenades and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
horseshoes basically the rocket detonate

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.149 
horseshoes basically the rocket detonate
when<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.020> gets<00:02:01.140> close<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.439> them<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.130> I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
when it gets close to them so like I

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.679 
when it gets close to them so like I
said<00:02:02.310> before<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.909> you've<00:02:03.030> got<00:02:03.180> fast<00:02:03.450> firing

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
said before if you've got fast firing

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.420 
said before if you've got fast firing

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
rockets with high blast radius you'll

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.609 
rockets with high blast radius you'll
pick<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.180> many<00:02:06.360> kills<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:07.110> grenades<00:02:07.469> and

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
pick up so many kills with grenades and

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.100 
pick up so many kills with grenades and
horseshoes<00:02:07.700> absolute<00:02:08.700> beast<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.420> trials<00:02:10.020> of

you've got small
amount<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.290> target<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:13.860> if<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.980> can<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.130> get

amount of target so if you can just get

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.160 
amount of target so if you can just get
those<00:02:14.460> guaranteed<00:02:15.000> rocket<00:02:15.450> kills<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.080> know

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
those guaranteed rocket kills you know

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.660 
those guaranteed rocket kills you know
it's<00:02:16.320> really<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.920> great<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.430> makes

tomorrow's answer my absolute favorite
rocket<00:02:19.650> launcher<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.160> PvP<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.240> is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
rocket launcher for PvP so that is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.050 
rocket launcher for PvP so that is
grenades<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.170> horseshoes<00:02:22.520> in<00:02:23.520> at<00:02:23.820> number

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
grenades and horseshoes in at number

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.910 
grenades and horseshoes in at number
three<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:24.900> going<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.260> look<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
three and it's going to be look in the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.130 
three and it's going to be look in the
chamber<00:02:26.370> one<00:02:26.670> round<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.090> your<00:02:27.240> magazine<00:02:27.420> will

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
chamber one round in your magazine will

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.380 
chamber one round in your magazine will
grant<00:02:28.380> thirty-three<00:02:28.980> percent<00:02:29.220> bonus<00:02:30.150> damage

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
grant thirty-three percent bonus damage

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.210 
grant thirty-three percent bonus damage
so<00:02:30.690> very<00:02:30.900> similar<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.260> final<00:02:31.650> round<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.040> that

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
so very similar to final round in that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.130 
so very similar to final round in that
it<00:02:32.340> does<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.640> thirty-three<00:02:33.210> percent<00:02:33.390> bonus

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
it does the thirty-three percent bonus

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.290 
it does the thirty-three percent bonus
damage<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.770> course<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.070> don't<00:02:35.400> know<00:02:35.670> when

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
damage but of course you don't know when

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.760 
damage but of course you don't know when
you're<00:02:36.600> going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.810> get<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.020> damage<00:02:37.410> because

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
you're going to get that damage because

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.320 
you're going to get that damage because
it's<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.250> random<00:02:38.790> round<00:02:39.000> within<00:02:39.240> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
it's one random round within the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
when I'm likely to get bonus damage but

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.990 
when I'm likely to get bonus damage but
those<00:03:00.900> who<00:03:01.380> have<00:03:01.470> spent<00:03:01.680> time<00:03:01.890> reforging<00:03:02.550> you

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
those who have spent time reforging you

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.370 
those who have spent time reforging you

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380

to them in the crucible have made look

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.630 
to them in the crucible have made look
in<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.210> chamber<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.690> absolutely

in the chamber and absolutely

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.040

overpowered<00:03:08.640> perk<00:03:09.090> when<00:03:09.480> combined<00:03:09.870> with

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
overpowered perk when combined with

overpowered perk when combined with
other<00:03:10.500> things<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.460> is<00:03:11.730> look<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.240> the

other things so that is look in the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
chamber in that number two and it's

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.190

going<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.090> shocked<00:03:15.420> package<00:03:15.990> which

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
going to be shocked package which

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.080 
going to be shocked package which
narrows<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.590> pellet<00:03:17.010> spread<00:03:17.280> while<00:03:17.760> aiming

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
narrows the pellet spread while aiming

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.270 
narrows the pellet spread while aiming
weapons<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.020> is<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> shotgun<00:03:19.680> specific

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
weapons so this is a shotgun specific

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.040 
weapons so this is a shotgun specific
perk<00:03:20.520> obviously<00:03:21.120> narrowing<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.750> pellet

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
perk obviously narrowing the pellet

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.870 
perk obviously narrowing the pellet
spread<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.530> very<00:03:22.980> powerful<00:03:23.160> shotgun<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.850> a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
spread on a very powerful shotgun is a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.400 
spread on a very powerful shotgun is a
great<00:03:24.120> thing<00:03:24.330> because<00:03:24.510> if<00:03:24.840> you're<00:03:25.020> incredibly

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
great thing because if you're incredibly

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.170 
great thing because if you're incredibly
accurate<00:03:25.620> then<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.370> means<00:03:26.490> more<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:26.910> those

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
accurate then it means more of those

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.150 
accurate then it means more of those
pellets<00:03:27.480> hit<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> target<00:03:28.170> means<00:03:28.800> you'll<00:03:28.980> get

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
pellets hit a target means you'll get

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.880 
pellets hit a target means you'll get
kills<00:03:29.520> from<00:03:30.120> further<00:03:30.300> ages<00:03:30.840> or<00:03:31.050> more<00:03:31.350> one-shot

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
kills from further ages or more one-shot

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.770 
kills from further ages or more one-shot
kills<00:03:32.130> at<00:03:32.310> least<00:03:32.340> than<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.120> would<00:03:33.360> without

kills at least than you would without
shot<00:03:34.290> package<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.070> shot<00:03:35.670> package<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.090> very

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
shot package so shot package is very

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.670 
shot package so shot package is very
very<00:03:36.600> powerful<00:03:36.780> particularly<00:03:37.410> on<00:03:37.500> things

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
very powerful particularly on things

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.890 
very powerful particularly on things
like<00:03:37.800> fell<00:03:38.100> winters<00:03:38.400> lie<00:03:38.610> Matador<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.720> the

party crasher also shot package is not

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.620 
party crasher also shot package is not
potentially<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.560> most<00:03:43.590> opie<00:03:44.490> perk<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.390> blame

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
potentially the most opie perk to blame

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.090 
potentially the most opie perk to blame
for<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:46.110> know<00:03:46.230> these<00:03:46.380> really<00:03:46.709> powerful

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
for you know these really powerful

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.949 
for you know these really powerful
shotguns<00:03:47.580> things<00:03:48.060> are<00:03:48.209> range<00:03:48.420> finder<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
shotguns things are range finder and

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.080 
shotguns things are range finder and
rifled<00:03:49.380> barrel<00:03:49.740> reinforced<00:03:50.430> barrel<00:03:50.820> things

rifled barrel reinforced barrel things

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.000 
rifled barrel reinforced barrel things
to<00:03:51.270> increase<00:03:51.600> range<00:03:51.870> combined<00:03:52.590> with<00:03:52.770> shot

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
to increase range combined with shot

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.830 
to increase range combined with shot
package<00:03:53.310> on<00:03:53.430> shotguns<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.000> what<00:03:54.270> makes<00:03:54.510> these

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
package on shotguns is what makes these

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.500 
package on shotguns is what makes these
shotguns<00:03:55.170> one-shot<00:03:55.860> kill<00:03:56.100> from<00:03:56.520> so<00:03:56.700> far<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:57.180> is

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
shotguns one-shot kill from so far it is

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.420 
shotguns one-shot kill from so far it is
incredibly<00:03:58.080> incredibly<00:03:58.650> powerful<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.250> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
incredibly incredibly powerful so that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.510 
incredibly incredibly powerful so that
is<00:03:59.670> sharp<00:04:00.240> package<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.170> in<00:04:01.380> at<00:04:01.560> number<00:04:01.740> one<00:04:02.250> and

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
is sharp package so in at number one and

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.130 
is sharp package so in at number one and
I'm<00:04:02.760> sure<00:04:02.940> some<00:04:03.209> people<00:04:03.480> would<00:04:03.600> disagree<00:04:03.780> with

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
I'm sure some people would disagree with

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.560 
I'm sure some people would disagree with
me<00:04:04.380> on<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.680> one<00:04:04.920> but<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:05.459> gonna<00:04:05.640> be<00:04:05.760> final

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
me on this one but it's gonna be final

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.210 
me on this one but it's gonna be final
round<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.200> last<00:04:07.290> shot<00:04:07.770> in<00:04:07.920> your<00:04:08.070> magazine

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
round the last shot in your magazine

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.120 
round the last shot in your magazine

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
deals thirty-three percent bonus damage

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.979 
deals thirty-three percent bonus damage
so<00:04:11.459> similar<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:11.850> look<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.270> chamber<00:04:12.600> with

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
so similar to look in the chamber with

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.420 
so similar to look in the chamber with
the<00:04:13.110> bonus<00:04:13.470> damage<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.040> course<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
the bonus damage but of course the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.949 
the bonus damage but of course the
positive<00:04:14.790> with<00:04:14.940> final<00:04:15.300> round<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.810> know

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
positive with final round is you know

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.690 
positive with final round is you know
exactly<00:04:16.260> when<00:04:16.620> you're<00:04:16.830> gonna<00:04:17.010> get<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.400> when

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
exactly when you're gonna get it when

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.520 
exactly when you're gonna get it when
you've<00:04:17.880> only<00:04:18.030> got<00:04:18.270> one<00:04:18.299> round<00:04:18.750> left<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.350> it's

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
you've only got one round left so it's

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.800 
you've only got one round left so it's
incredibly<00:04:20.040> powerful<00:04:20.280> for<00:04:21.000> shotguns<00:04:21.479> some

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
incredibly powerful for shotguns some

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.960 
incredibly powerful for shotguns some
snipers<00:04:22.320> such<00:04:22.530> as<00:04:22.710> effort<00:04:23.070> eat<00:04:23.160> sphere<00:04:23.550> which

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
snipers such as effort eat sphere which

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.770 
snipers such as effort eat sphere which
of<00:04:24.120> course<00:04:24.150> now<00:04:24.510> final<00:04:24.990> round<00:04:25.169> has<00:04:25.350> been

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
of course now final round has been

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.300 
of course now final round has been
moved<00:04:25.930> from<00:04:26.200> so<00:04:26.380> if<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.560> do<00:04:26.680> reforge<00:04:27.070> those

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
moved from so if you do reforge those

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.190 
moved from so if you do reforge those
now<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:28.000> can't<00:04:28.270> get<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.540> anymore<00:04:28.750> because<00:04:28.960> it

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
now you can't get it anymore because it

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.320 
now you can't get it anymore because it
will<00:04:29.440> one<00:04:29.950> shot<00:04:30.220> kill<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.760> body<00:04:30.970> in<00:04:31.180> the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
will one shot kill to the body in the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.240 
will one shot kill to the body in the
crucible<00:04:31.540> so<00:04:31.900> there<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.200> an<00:04:32.320> example<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.860> just

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
crucible so there is an example of just

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.909 
crucible so there is an example of just
how<00:04:33.370> good<00:04:33.850> final<00:04:34.360> round<00:04:34.570> can<00:04:34.840> be<00:04:35.080> when<00:04:35.590> used

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
how good final round can be when used

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.560 
how good final round can be when used
cleverly<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:36.700> know<00:04:36.820> it's<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.120> kind<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.419> thing

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
cleverly you know it's a kind of thing

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.480 
cleverly you know it's a kind of thing
that<00:04:37.600> your<00:04:38.110> best<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.710> be<00:04:38.830> paying<00:04:39.040> attention<00:04:39.160> to

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
that your best to be paying attention to

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.680 
that your best to be paying attention to
you<00:04:39.760> know<00:04:39.940> you've<00:04:40.060> got<00:04:40.120> your<00:04:40.330> phone<00:04:40.450> around

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
you know you've got your phone around

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.720 
you know you've got your phone around
you<00:04:41.020> know<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.470> can<00:04:41.710> exploit<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.520> a

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
you know that you can exploit that a

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.310 
you know that you can exploit that a
little<00:04:43.090> bit<00:04:43.210> during<00:04:43.660> your<00:04:43.840> next<00:04:43.960> engagement

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
little bit during your next engagement

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.870 
little bit during your next engagement
so<00:04:44.680> that's<00:04:44.830> what<00:04:44.950> I<00:04:44.980> think<00:04:45.220> final<00:04:45.520> round<00:04:45.669> is<00:04:45.790> an

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
so that's what I think final round is an

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.270 
so that's what I think final round is an
absolutely<00:04:46.389> beast<00:04:46.810> perk<00:04:47.260> specifically<00:04:48.100> on

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
absolutely beast perk specifically on

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.030 
absolutely beast perk specifically on
shotguns<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.210> snipers<00:04:50.020> also<00:04:50.410> some<00:04:50.620> people<00:04:50.650> do

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
shotguns and snipers also some people do

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.129 
shotguns and snipers also some people do
like<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.250> roll<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.639> on<00:04:51.760> small<00:04:52.360> magazine<00:04:52.570> size

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
like to roll it on small magazine size

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.870 
like to roll it on small magazine size
hand<00:04:53.800> cannons<00:04:54.220> along<00:04:54.460> with<00:04:54.580> look<00:04:54.700> in<00:04:54.820> the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
hand cannons along with look in the

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.790 
hand cannons along with look in the
chamber<00:04:55.180> like<00:04:55.300> i<00:04:55.330> said<00:04:55.630> before<00:04:55.750> can<00:04:56.410> be<00:04:56.530> very

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
chamber like i said before can be very

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.120 
chamber like i said before can be very
very<00:04:57.010> useful<00:04:57.100> but<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.760> is<00:04:57.970> final<00:04:58.810> round<00:04:59.140> so

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130
