00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
the patient the the philosophy is

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.599 
the patient the the philosophy is
totally<00:03:41.840> different<00:03:42.199> basis<00:03:42.949> of<00:03:43.099> Hope<00:03:43.280> than<00:03:43.489> it

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
totally different basis of Hope than it

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.879 
totally different basis of Hope than it
might<00:03:43.790> be<00:03:44.000> at<00:03:44.120> other<00:03:44.269> hospitals<00:03:44.690> tell<00:03:45.530> us<00:03:45.680> how

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
might be at other hospitals tell us how

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.129 
might be at other hospitals tell us how
it's<00:03:46.099> different<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.760> you're<00:03:47.120> using<00:03:47.419> shark

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
it's different and you're using shark

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.569 
it's different and you're using shark
cartilage<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:49.120> laetrile<00:03:50.120> die<00:03:50.599> good<00:03:50.959> for<00:03:51.229> you

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.199 
cartilage and laetrile die good for you
the<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.419> reason<00:03:53.930> for<00:03:54.229> this<00:03:54.440> is<00:03:54.799> that<00:03:54.940> since<00:03:55.940> we

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
the the reason for this is that since we

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.680 
the the reason for this is that since we
provide<00:03:56.930> resources<00:03:57.500> for<00:03:57.949> our<00:03:58.099> patients<00:03:58.690> then

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
provide resources for our patients then

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.289 
provide resources for our patients then
the<00:03:59.900> patients<00:04:00.560> can<00:04:00.739> actually<00:04:01.190> come<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.000> live

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
the patients can actually come and live

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.599 
the patients can actually come and live
instead<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:02.989> a<00:04:03.079> parasite<00:04:03.709> relationship<00:04:04.459> of

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
instead of a parasite relationship of

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.949 
instead of a parasite relationship of
the<00:04:04.699> tumor<00:04:05.000> in<00:04:05.449> a<00:04:05.659> symbiosis<00:04:06.049> which<00:04:06.590> means<00:04:06.859> I

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
explained to them like a good marriage

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.159 
explained to them like a good marriage
what's<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.180> good<00:04:11.359> marriage<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.840> don't<00:04:11.870> bother

biologically with your tumor we have

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.170 
biologically with your tumor we have
patients<00:04:20.750> live<00:04:20.930> in<00:04:21.109> twenty<00:04:21.500> five<00:04:21.739> years<00:04:22.250> after

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:24.409 
being told that they were going to live

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.820 
being told that they were going to live
a<00:04:24.620> few<00:04:24.919> months<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.729> we<00:04:25.990> take<00:04:26.990> x-rays<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:27.620> they

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
a few months and we take x-rays and they

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.649 
a few months and we take x-rays and they
still<00:04:28.250> have<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.639> tumor<00:04:28.909> but<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.300> we<00:04:29.479> were

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
still have the tumor but that we were

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:33.339 
still have the tumor but that we were
able<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.409> arrange<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:32.060> immune<00:04:32.570> system<00:04:33.139> and

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
able to arrange the immune system and

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.730 
able to arrange the immune system and
biologically

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
biologically

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.990 
biologically
a<00:04:34.970> status<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.720> allows<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.919> tumor<00:04:38.370> not<00:04:38.699> to

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
a status that allows that tumor not to

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.850 
a status that allows that tumor not to
grow<00:04:39.240> in<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:39.509> to<00:04:39.660> threat<00:04:40.080> them<00:04:40.319> anymore

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
grow in that to threat them anymore

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.920 
grow in that to threat them anymore
we<00:04:41.400> also<00:04:41.580> have<00:04:41.910> patients<00:04:42.389> that<00:04:42.419> are<00:04:42.509> cured

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
we also have patients that are cured

we also have patients that are cured
where<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.590> tumor<00:04:43.860> is<00:04:43.889> gone<00:04:44.190> but<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.150> us<00:04:45.330> that
