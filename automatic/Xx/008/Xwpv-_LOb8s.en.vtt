00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.690
 how about friends of youtube thanks for 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.940
 be here on the green route on the day of 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.150
 today I want to tell you what is going to happen 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.900
 on February 15, 2013 because already 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.480
 a lot of theories started to come out 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.440
 from the most exaggerated to mouth lip 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.890
 ticas until the most informed that goes to 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.230
 happen good as a meteor approaches 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.140
 is going to skim across the earth but 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.020
 when it is said that it will touch the earth 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.660
 that will happen very close and we are 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.150
 talking about a let's say concept 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.270
 astronomical will not happen using because 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.370
 will go to 27 thousand kilometers is a 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.580
 asteroid that was actually discovered 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.520
 in Spain by people who lived there 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.130
 and for the first time in 2012 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.790
 early there by February and up 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.190
 march april there could already calculate 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.830
 well the orbit because it was believed that it would 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.750
 hit the earth there really was 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.270
 a very big possibility that 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.050
 will impact but you have already calculated the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.040
 orbit and you know what will happen on 15 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.880
 February to 27 thousand little more than 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.990
 kilometers away and size as of 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.600
 50 meters 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.100
 this asteroid reminds us of several 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.380
 they are already hanging around like the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.220
 called from 14 an asteroid that also 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.369
 has a similar orbit and that 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.340
 ensures that in 2020 the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.250
 possibilities that that same orbit 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.470
 make it collide with the earth is not a 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.890
 possibility let's say 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.380
 greater the possibility is calculated from 1 to 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.590
 100 thousand but good the possibility is 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.519
 there 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.190
 this we say the news that will cause more 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.640
 impact surely in February because 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.590
 many blogs are already talking about going 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.170
 to impact on earth which is not 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.720
 true and it's wrong even if it's a size 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.180
 considered 50 meters can already cause 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.930
 some damage in some inhabited areas 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.920
 we will come crashing which like them 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.019
 I say is totally discarded and good 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.060
 Well then I just wanted 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.260
 tell them not to get carried away 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.140
 by blogs that are say taking a 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.660
 information you can alarmist you know 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.670
 how is this not for now because they 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.459
 I appreciate you being here and we continue 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.980
 chatting on twitter on facebook 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.519
 obviously for the comments that leave 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.670
 you here and we always read them 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.670
 see you later 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.780
 ah 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.060
 ah
