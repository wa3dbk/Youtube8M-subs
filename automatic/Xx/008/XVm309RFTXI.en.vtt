00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 and to get a little warm, let's see 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.460
 what our partner prepared 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.460
 Adolfo Díaz 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.750
 and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.780
 and now that 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.720
 when the game is as boring as 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.660
 these are slower and boring than a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.170
 Sunday in canoe will not be entrusted many 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.330
 and what are you doing in which you have dinner 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.410
 looking at the necks look what happens is 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.720
 that the game is not boring 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.160
 but we already have so much confidence 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.050
 in which we are going to win and that the querétaro 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.880
 can not do anything against us that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.239
 we endure the game and hopefully 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.550

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.810
 to bring the homework to do it here 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.170
 to the blowpipes because but not even 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.720
 that's because they did not cut them anymore 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.190
 Of course it was all over, no no no no 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.190

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.530

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.750
