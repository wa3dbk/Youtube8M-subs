00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.070 
easy and just making sure you're ready
to<00:02:37.430> ready<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.940> shoot<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.209> bow<00:02:38.360> making<00:02:38.930> sure

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
to ready to shoot the bow making sure

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.380 
to ready to shoot the bow making sure
you're<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.319> position<00:02:39.560> for<00:02:39.920> him<00:02:40.090> when<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.180> pass

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
you're in position for him when you pass

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.390 
you're in position for him when you pass
it<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.600> you<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:42.200> shoot<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.220> put

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
it to you to shoot it and just just put

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.039 
it to you to shoot it and just just put
the<00:02:43.489> ball<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.730> basket<00:02:43.910> makes<00:02:44.600> our<00:02:44.810> job

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
the ball in the basket makes our job

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.660 
the ball in the basket makes our job
easy<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.739> hard<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.010> really<00:02:46.190> say<00:02:46.400> who's

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
easy so it's hard to really say who's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.520 
easy so it's hard to really say who's
better<00:02:46.940> because<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.810> think<00:02:48.049> they<00:02:48.110> both<00:02:48.260> play

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
better because I think they both play

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.809 
better because I think they both play
the<00:02:48.650> same<00:02:48.830> type<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.100> basketball<00:02:49.670> with<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
the same type of basketball with a

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.789 
the same type of basketball with a
password<00:02:50.090> point<00:02:50.630> guard<00:02:50.870> with<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.410> ability<00:02:51.560> to

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
password point guard with the ability to

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.580 
password point guard with the ability to
score<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.730> think<00:02:53.420> they<00:02:53.690> were<00:02:53.780> tied<00:02:54.560> for

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
score so I think they were tied for

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:05.170 
score so I think they were tied for
first<00:03:00.310> there<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.400> go<00:03:02.470> once<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.120> a
