clear as right eye and the other eye is
real<00:00:42.690> gunky<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.680> doesn't<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
real gunky because it doesn't have a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
liver kit it gets come to you every day

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.340 
liver kit it gets come to you every day
this<00:00:46.489> could<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.640> due<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> allergies<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:49.110> hay

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
this could be due to allergies like hay

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.160 
this could be due to allergies like hay
fever<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.340> could<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.640> due<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.789> glaucoma

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.319 

produce<00:00:55.170> enough<00:00:55.440> tears<00:00:56.059> tears<00:00:57.059> have

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
produce enough tears tears have

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.810 
produce enough tears tears have
lubricant<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.020> them<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.250> eye<00:00:59.280> opens

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
lubricant in them so as the eye opens

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.540 
lubricant in them so as the eye opens
and<00:01:00.000> closes<00:01:00.239> over<00:01:00.719> thousands<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.379> times<00:01:01.620> point

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and closes over thousands of times point

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.719 
and closes over thousands of times point
point<00:01:03.120> point<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> lubricant<00:01:05.070> lubricates

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
point point so the lubricant lubricates

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
point point so the lubricant lubricates
the<00:01:05.880> lids<00:01:06.240> over<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.020> surface<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> eye

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the lids over the surface of the eye

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.490 
the lids over the surface of the eye
now<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.210> eyeball<00:01:09.990> doesn't<00:01:10.350> have

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
now if the eyeball doesn't have

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.039 
now if the eyeball doesn't have
lubricant<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> eyelids<00:01:12.390> rub<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
lubricant then the eyelids rub on the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.090 
lubricant then the eyelids rub on the
eye<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.549> eye<00:01:15.170> because<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.710> doesn't<00:01:17.009> have

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
eye so this eye because it doesn't have

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.920 
eye so this eye because it doesn't have
lubricant<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.689> turned<00:01:19.049> cloudy<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.689> it's<00:01:21.689> got

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
lubricant it turned cloudy and it's got

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.490 
lubricant it turned cloudy and it's got
some<00:01:22.110> scar<00:01:22.380> tissue<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.130> cornea

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
some scar tissue on the cornea

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.719 
some scar tissue on the cornea
cortney's<00:01:25.500> should<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.830> nice<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.040> clear<00:01:26.580> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
cortney's should be nice and clear you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.460 
cortney's should be nice and clear you
should<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> iris<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> pupil<00:01:27.990> the

have<00:01:58.159> a<00:01:58.190> wet<00:01:58.549> line<00:01:58.880> there<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.140> is<00:02:00.290> from<00:02:00.470> a

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
have a wet line there and this is from a

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.800 
have a wet line there and this is from a
normal<00:02:01.100> eye<00:02:01.220> in<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.850> dog<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:02.630> usually

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
normal eye in the dog and it's usually

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.870 
normal eye in the dog and it's usually
about<00:02:03.020> tan<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:03.950> that's<00:02:04.190> what<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.549> turned<00:02:04.759> out

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
about tan and that's what it turned out

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.550 
about tan and that's what it turned out
to<00:02:04.940> be<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.509> then<00:02:05.720> we<00:02:05.810> did<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.170> other<00:02:06.320> eye<00:02:06.409> and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
to be and then we did the other eye and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.889 
to be and then we did the other eye and
it<00:02:06.979> only<00:02:07.130> turned<00:02:07.520> out<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.850> be<00:02:07.970> about<00:02:08.119> two<00:02:08.660> or

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
it only turned out to be about two or

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.770 
it only turned out to be about two or
three<00:02:09.289> on<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.009> strip<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.510> means

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
three on the strip and so that means

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.350 
three on the strip and so that means
that<00:02:11.930> dye<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.500> dog<00:02:12.739> does<00:02:13.069> have<00:02:13.280> dry<00:02:13.550> eye<00:02:13.580> what

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
that dye that dog does have dry eye what

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.940 
that dye that dog does have dry eye what
that<00:02:14.510> means<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.930> we're<00:02:15.110> gonna<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.709> use

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
that means is we're gonna have to use

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.300 
that means is we're gonna have to use
artificial<00:02:16.819> tears<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:18.530> some<00:02:19.010> other<00:02:19.250> eye

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
artificial tears and then some other eye

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.160 
artificial tears and then some other eye
drops<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.150> will<00:02:20.300> help<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:20.959> dog

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170
