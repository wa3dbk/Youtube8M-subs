00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
 I am kalle 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.440
 what a shame 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.920
 I am able 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.750
 how can you feel at work ? 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 to introduce between them 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 A good question if you are there at all 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.590
 Talking about work can do both of us 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.660
 to drift from morning to evening then 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.900
 we do not just have one but 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.330
 for was a gentleman living kalle lives his 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 lust at nonsense and is happy 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 royally when others talk about him 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.690
 amused and I enjoy myself over 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.720
 my dog â€‹â€‹and always fascinated 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.149
 how excited people are of that 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.829
 what is he gas when he comes to 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.930
 example in the same leaps me seems 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.110
 then the sudden jump in the lot 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.610
 out of water bubbles around like a walrus 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.579
 there blooms day is back in the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.989
 Waves disappear that produces 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.719
 sometimes even cheers 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.699
 the amount are at home and then 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.739
 We'll swap the rolls then write 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.789
 I listened to what I told him so and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.860
 have sent 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.300
 and he climbs up with me and then 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.280
 desk full of dormitory 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.149
 retirees around me then photos horst 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 anzugucken 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.600
 when he comes to himself and I am 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.720
 still not what i would not be 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.509
 happy car with lifestyle is no co 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.979
 the stage would be the biggest stage too 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.320
 small when kalle the 2 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.140
 but he is only really one 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.009
 alphatier when it comes to his claim 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 agrees 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.470
 he takes what he wants unrestrained 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.500
 kaisers is indeed something of everything 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.710
 Creeps Fleucht or has two hands if 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.040
 the two right hands got caught 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.850
 then 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.820
 Tailor like Bear is buzzing and is only 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.710
 still only heart is upside down too 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.650
 only the heart of people regularly 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.750
 catapulted to right and high altitude flights 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.880
 because then they feel so accepted 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.260
 what then is the authority 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.860
 Distribution of his dog 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.080
 That's easy and can be proven 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.460
 It can be a continuation for all 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.460
 of the first book 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.660
 no, these are two completely 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.310
 different books because the dogs 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.400
 also completely different stories 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.800
 Paul was a suspended and 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.040
 Abuse takes many men that 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.030
 animal shelter is the embassy of paul 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.870
 think of your next everything we know 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.980
 expects him too from you 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.040
 self- care charity 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.390
 friendliness also trust help 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.850
 and if we do that all together 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.550
 then we would have a very pleasant one 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.530
 together a far better 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.720
 and whether they believe it 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.180
 I want that as the message one man 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.640
 understood by the federal government and can erich 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.959
 unlike the stark contrary 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.019
 kalle is a jester of the dmi 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.170
 popular and the comedy and above all 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.450
 But life is natural too 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.010
 someone who teaches something with him 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.310
 I have learned something new, which I almost did 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.269
 Namely, having forgotten how to live was 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.000
 to accept and enjoy such and such 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.250
 to be grateful for what it is 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.320
 every day gives you that you are healthy 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.209
 when you come to them in the morning that you do 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.280
 commented on was that one has friends 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.660
 that you were such a wonderful creature 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.780
 was allowed to find this round 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.610
 These are gifts that are underlined 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.470
 worth much more in my understanding 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.459
 are as many millions on 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.260
 any Swiss or 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.790
 Liechten- stein customers if you go to her 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.860
 If you could tell him you could listen 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.110
 actually mean that round the 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.370
 are better people 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.799
 absolutely imagine we would 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.169
 We would do the same as the dogs do 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.340
 how can it be embassy is lives loves 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.340
 laughs heartily
