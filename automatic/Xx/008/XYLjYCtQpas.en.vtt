 I 'm taking them to install there. 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.890
 understood that this jack is connected in the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 it's right here above the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.760
 fuses 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.270

 will find all the threads here already with 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:58.859
 the numbering of the respective connectors 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 here for example has positive pin 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.310
 what's the pin at that point time 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:13.780
 The key is 73 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:17.560
 the arrow pins are 66 in 6 4 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.350
 is there a locking treatment going 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.670
 be done the way the crew goes 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:29.679
 receive the negative course of 15 seconds 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.170
 on the pin is 36 and it is also 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.780
 Locking child unlocking will not be 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.780
 connected here in case you are not 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:46.060
 also placing here a resistor of 180 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:50.399
 men being copied that the open this rich 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.569
 the unlock will put him then 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.890
 relationship with locking and 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:02:05.800
 unlocking in the same period 36 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:09.789
 and I put that yes he has it too 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:15.070
 they will find in the 54 cases they are 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:18.850
 put receive on the negative pulse to laep 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:22.110
 Also the trunk is that way guys 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.110
 a hug and beauty
