00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
the way up and the high is at 12 see how

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:21.620 
the way up and the high is at 12 see how
that<00:02:05.660> sounds

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:30.700 

I<00:02:27.560> can't<00:02:28.560> channel<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.240> distortion<00:02:30.240> channel

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
I can't channel the distortion channel

the<00:02:31.710> low<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:33.110> pretty<00:02:34.110> much<00:02:34.230> said<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.850> three<00:02:36.080> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
the low is pretty much said it three the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.540 
the low is pretty much said it three the
mid<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.770> just<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.310> tad<00:02:39.590> rate<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.010> 12<00:02:41.280> o'clock

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
mid is just a tad rate of the 12 o'clock

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.430 
mid is just a tad rate of the 12 o'clock
position<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.750> high<00:02:42.950> I'd<00:02:43.950> say<00:02:44.370> between

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
position and the high I'd say between

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.190 
position and the high I'd say between
not<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.470> what<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.160> guess<00:02:47.900> see<00:02:48.900> how<00:02:48.990> that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
not just what a to I guess see how that

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:23.840 
not just what a to I guess see how that
sounds

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.900 

the<00:03:24.850> sustainer<00:03:25.360> it's<00:03:25.780> really<00:03:26.560> good<00:03:26.770> I<00:03:27.100> think

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
the sustainer it's really good I think

00:03:27.910 --> 00:04:11.759 
the sustainer it's really good I think
it's<00:03:28.300> a<00:03:28.860> gonna<00:03:29.860> replace<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.250> lot<00:03:30.490> of<00:03:30.670> patents

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.369 

now<00:04:12.769> if<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.159> wouldn't<00:04:13.370> mind<00:04:14.049> getting<00:04:15.049> the

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
now if you wouldn't mind getting the

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:27.280 
now if you wouldn't mind getting the
hell<00:04:15.769> out<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.250> my<00:04:16.549> room

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290
