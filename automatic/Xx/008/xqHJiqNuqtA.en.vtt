passer<00:02:58.140> out<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.920> his<00:02:59.010> five<00:02:59.220> games<00:02:59.490> this<00:02:59.640> season

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
passer out of his five games this season

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.300 
passer out of his five games this season
he's<00:03:00.060> got<00:03:00.270> 4<00:03:00.630> 300<00:03:01.110> yard<00:03:01.260> games<00:03:01.500> but<00:03:02.070> his

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
he's got 4 300 yard games but his

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.460 
he's got 4 300 yard games but his
discredit<00:03:02.640> he's<00:03:02.880> got<00:03:03.000> six<00:03:03.270> picks<00:03:03.510> vs<00:03:04.230> eight

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
discredit he's got six picks vs eight

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.720 
discredit he's got six picks vs eight
touchdowns<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.100> think<00:03:05.310> that's<00:03:05.460> part<00:03:05.670> of

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
touchdowns and I think that's part of

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.400 
touchdowns and I think that's part of
the<00:03:05.820> reason<00:03:05.910> why<00:03:06.120> he's<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:06.990> getting<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
the reason why he's not getting the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.680 
the reason why he's not getting the
boost<00:03:07.740> from<00:03:08.700> week<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.060> week<00:03:09.090> he<00:03:09.390> pretty<00:03:09.600> much

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
boost from week to week he pretty much

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.350 
boost from week to week he pretty much
is<00:03:09.840> locked<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.740> he<00:03:10.920> started<00:03:11.310> Madden<00:03:11.580> 12<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.030> 88

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
is locked in he started Madden 12 and 88

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.170 
is locked in he started Madden 12 and 88
and<00:03:12.570> he's<00:03:13.020> still<00:03:13.290> locked<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.590> at<00:03:13.740> an<00:03:13.860> 88<00:03:14.310> but

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
and he's still locked in at an 88 but

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.550 
and he's still locked in at an 88 but
here's<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.110> thing<00:03:16.200> an<00:03:16.620> 88<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.490> not<00:03:17.790> bad<00:03:18.630> an<00:03:19.050> 88

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
here's the thing an 88 is not bad an 88

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.620 
here's the thing an 88 is not bad an 88

that but he's doing what's expected of

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.050 
that but he's doing what's expected of
them<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.800> you<00:03:56.100> know<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.370> part<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:56.910> his

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
them and you know it's part of his

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.520 
them and you know it's part of his
problem<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.900> know<00:03:57.990> just<00:03:58.200> sort<00:03:58.320> of<00:03:58.410> a

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
problem and you know just sort of a

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.350 
problem and you know just sort of a
perception<00:03:59.010> issue<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.460> whenever<00:04:00.060> the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
perception issue is that whenever the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.450 
perception issue is that whenever the
Cowboys<00:04:00.690> do<00:04:00.930> lose<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.800> almost<00:04:02.100> always<00:04:02.310> when

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
Cowboys do lose it's almost always when

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.310 
Cowboys do lose it's almost always when
he's<00:04:02.670> make<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.270> cause<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.020> he's<00:04:04.140> kind

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
he's make is a cause of it so he's kind

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.080 
he's make is a cause of it so he's kind
of<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.470> quarterback<00:04:04.860> he's<00:04:05.220> he's<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.700> furthest

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
of a quarterback he's he's the furthest

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.820 
of a quarterback he's he's the furthest
thing<00:04:06.150> from<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.540> game<00:04:06.750> manager<00:04:06.960> in<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.350> NFL<00:04:07.650> and

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
thing from a game manager in the NFL and

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.470 
thing from a game manager in the NFL and
he's<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:07.980> guy<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.190> wins<00:04:08.490> games<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.270> he's<00:04:09.360> also

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
he's a guy that wins games but he's also

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.030 
he's a guy that wins games but he's also
got<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.870> kind<00:04:10.020> of<00:04:10.050> loses<00:04:10.260> them<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.800> I<00:04:10.860> think

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
got it kind of loses them and I think

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.890 
got it kind of loses them and I think
that<00:04:11.160> hurts<00:04:11.370> his<00:04:11.580> his<00:04:11.970> sort<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.210> perception<00:04:12.720> in

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
that hurts his his sort of perception in

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.840 
that hurts his his sort of perception in
the<00:04:13.230> overall<00:04:13.560> land<00:04:13.830> all<00:04:14.280> right<00:04:14.400> next<00:04:14.640> guy<00:04:14.820> you

really<00:04:26.030> made<00:04:26.630> their<00:04:26.810> mark<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.050> may<00:04:27.170> be<00:04:27.290> outside

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
really made their mark I may be outside

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.740 
really made their mark I may be outside
of<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.040> whole<00:04:28.190> coaching<00:04:28.880> spitball<00:04:29.720> fight

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
of the whole coaching spitball fight

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.900 
of the whole coaching spitball fight
since<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:30.500> we<00:04:30.620> saw<00:04:30.800> there<00:04:30.980> but<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.430> San

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
since that we saw there but the San

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.970 
since that we saw there but the San
Frisco<00:04:32.000> really<00:04:32.420> made<00:04:32.600> a<00:04:32.630> strong<00:04:33.620> statement

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
Frisco really made a strong statement

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.860 
Frisco really made a strong statement
with<00:04:34.460> their<00:04:34.610> defense<00:04:35.030> in<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.330> game<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.780> I

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
with their defense in that game and I

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.720 
with their defense in that game and I
think<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.140> entire<00:04:36.530> linebacker<00:04:37.130> corps<00:04:37.490> has

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
think the entire linebacker corps has

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.340 
think the entire linebacker corps has
really<00:04:38.240> stepped<00:04:38.420> up<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:38.750> season<00:04:38.900> become<00:04:39.320> a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
really stepped up this season become a

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.840 
really stepped up this season become a
lot<00:04:39.530> better<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.920> front<00:04:40.160> seven<00:04:40.430> is<00:04:40.520> really

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
lot better that front seven is really

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.640 
lot better that front seven is really
nasty<00:04:41.030> they're<00:04:41.570> making<00:04:41.690> their<00:04:41.960> secondary<00:04:42.530> a

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
nasty they're making their secondary a

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.620 
nasty they're making their secondary a
lot<00:04:42.830> better<00:04:43.040> and<00:04:43.250> all<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.730> Smiths<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.300> rookie

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
lot better and all the Smiths the rookie

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.420 
lot better and all the Smiths the rookie
teams<00:04:45.290> he<00:04:45.500> could<00:04:45.650> really<00:04:45.800> come<00:04:45.950> on<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.220> last

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
teams he could really come on the last

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.980 
teams he could really come on the last
few<00:04:46.610> weeks<00:04:46.700> I<00:04:46.970> mean<00:04:47.090> he's<00:04:47.420> up<00:04:47.540> to<00:04:47.630> five<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:47.930> a

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
few weeks I mean he's up to five and a

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.140 
few weeks I mean he's up to five and a
half<00:04:48.020> sacks<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:49.070> can't<00:04:49.430> help<00:04:49.610> but<00:04:49.700> go<00:04:49.910> back

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
half sacks and I can't help but go back

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.410 
half sacks and I can't help but go back
to<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.690> draft<00:04:50.990> when<00:04:51.770> Sam<00:04:52.130> Cisco<00:04:52.430> picked<00:04:52.760> Aldon

to the draft when Sam Cisco picked Aldon

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.030 
to the draft when Sam Cisco picked Aldon
Smith<00:04:53.660> everyone<00:04:54.320> expected<00:04:54.680> him<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.860> take<00:04:54.980> a

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
Smith everyone expected him to take a

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.410 
Smith everyone expected him to take a
quarterback<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.760> lot<00:04:56.090> of<00:04:56.180> people<00:04:56.360> were

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
quarterback a lot of people were

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.550 
quarterback a lot of people were
scratching<00:04:56.780> her<00:04:56.870> head<00:04:56.900> saying<00:04:57.200> who<00:04:57.350> is<00:04:57.470> this

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
scratching her head saying who is this

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.260 
scratching her head saying who is this
guy<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:57.770> Missouri<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.430> now<00:04:58.850> you<00:04:58.910> see<00:04:59.240> that

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
guy to Missouri and now you see that

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.940 
guy to Missouri and now you see that
like<00:04:59.540> he<00:04:59.780> is<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.900> key<00:05:00.200> component<00:05:00.230> of<00:05:00.890> that

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
like he is a key component of that

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.710 
like he is a key component of that
defense<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:02.210> know<00:05:02.300> they're<00:05:02.420> gonna<00:05:02.540> start

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
defense and you know they're gonna start

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.570 
defense and you know they're gonna start
relying<00:05:02.930> on<00:05:03.110> him<00:05:03.260> week<00:05:03.710> in<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:03.890> week<00:05:04.010> out<00:05:04.250> he

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
relying on him week in and week out he

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.580 
relying on him week in and week out he
got<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:04.760> safety<00:05:05.240> against<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.140> lions<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:06.560> I

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
got the safety against the lions I I

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.560 
got the safety against the lions I I
think<00:05:07.070> that's<00:05:07.490> that<00:05:07.760> linebacker<00:05:07.970> corps<00:05:08.420> that

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
think that's that linebacker corps that

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.210 
think that's that linebacker corps that
front<00:05:08.810> seven<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.170> really<00:05:09.470> gonna<00:05:09.620> you<00:05:09.980> know<00:05:10.070> get

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
front seven is really gonna you know get

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.620 
front seven is really gonna you know get
stronger<00:05:10.580> strong<00:05:10.880> as<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.120> season<00:05:11.390> goes<00:05:11.480> on

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
stronger strong as the season goes on

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.420 
stronger strong as the season goes on
with<00:05:11.780> all<00:05:11.930> this<00:05:12.020> myth<00:05:12.230> that<00:05:12.680> guy<00:05:12.890> I<00:05:13.100> think<00:05:13.340> that

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
with all this myth that guy I think that

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.560 
with all this myth that guy I think that
guy<00:05:13.550> might<00:05:13.730> be<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.940> truth<00:05:14.150> I'm<00:05:14.300> especially

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
guy might be the truth I'm especially

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.660 
guy might be the truth I'm especially
the<00:05:14.810> way<00:05:14.930> that<00:05:14.960> they're<00:05:15.230> using<00:05:15.560> them<00:05:15.680> so<00:05:16.310> so

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
the way that they're using them so so

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.710 
the way that they're using them so so
what<00:05:16.850> are<00:05:16.880> you<00:05:17.000> looking<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.330> see<00:05:17.540> from

Mountain<00:05:18.020> like<00:05:18.890> what<00:05:19.070> do<00:05:19.130> you<00:05:19.190> want<00:05:19.340> to<00:05:19.430> see

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
Mountain like what do you want to see

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.390 
Mountain like what do you want to see
his<00:05:19.610> radiance<00:05:19.970> increase<00:05:20.300> to<00:05:20.480> well<00:05:21.350> you<00:05:21.830> know<00:05:21.860> I

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
his radiance increase to well you know I

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.250 
his radiance increase to well you know I
don't<00:05:22.850> know<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.150> don't<00:05:23.570> want<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.810> you<00:05:24.170> know

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
don't know I I don't want to you know

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.170 
don't know I I don't want to you know
just<00:05:24.440> say<00:05:24.590> let's<00:05:25.040> give<00:05:25.190> him<00:05:25.280> five<00:05:25.790> points

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
just say let's give him five points

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.490 
just say let's give him five points
because<00:05:26.420> he's<00:05:26.540> you<00:05:26.840> know<00:05:26.870> feature<00:05:27.230> hall<00:05:27.380> of

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
because he's you know feature hall of

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.930 
because he's you know feature hall of
fame<00:05:27.650> or<00:05:27.680> anything<00:05:27.980> but<00:05:28.340> I<00:05:28.430> think<00:05:28.640> maybe<00:05:28.730> give

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
fame or anything but I think maybe give

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.540 
fame or anything but I think maybe give
a<00:05:29.030> boost<00:05:29.180> in<00:05:29.390> his<00:05:29.540> acceleration<00:05:30.250> maybe<00:05:31.250> boost

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
a boost in his acceleration maybe boost

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.950 
a boost in his acceleration maybe boost
his<00:05:31.700> tackle<00:05:32.120> things<00:05:32.270> that<00:05:32.450> are<00:05:32.510> important<00:05:32.900> to

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
his tackle things that are important to

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.750 
his tackle things that are important to
uh<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.500> pass-rushing<00:05:34.100> linebacker<00:05:34.580> like

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
uh to a pass-rushing linebacker like

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.620 
uh to a pass-rushing linebacker like
that<00:05:35.140> what<00:05:36.140> that<00:05:36.290> you<00:05:36.800> know<00:05:37.300> projects<00:05:38.300> out<00:05:38.420> to

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
that what that you know projects out to

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.360 
that what that you know projects out to
his<00:05:38.960> overall<00:05:39.320> rating<00:05:39.620> i'm<00:05:39.740> not<00:05:39.950> sure<00:05:40.160> but<00:05:40.190> i

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
his overall rating i'm not sure but i

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.950 
his overall rating i'm not sure but i
definitely<00:05:40.730> think<00:05:40.970> he's<00:05:41.420> shown<00:05:41.660> you<00:05:41.840> know

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
definitely think he's shown you know

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.870 
definitely think he's shown you know
some<00:05:42.170> some<00:05:42.350> athletic<00:05:42.740> skills<00:05:43.010> as<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.460> young<00:05:43.700> guy

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
some some athletic skills as a young guy

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.730 
some some athletic skills as a young guy
the<00:05:44.180> other<00:05:44.330> thing<00:05:44.540> to<00:05:45.110> be<00:05:45.170> honest<00:05:45.380> is<00:05:45.500> his

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
the other thing to be honest is his

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.050 
the other thing to be honest is his
acceleration<00:05:46.160> right<00:05:46.340> now<00:05:46.460> believes<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:46.940> like

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
acceleration right now believes it like

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.240 
acceleration right now believes it like
97<00:05:47.570> or<00:05:47.810> 96<00:05:48.170> which<00:05:48.380> is<00:05:48.500> just<00:05:48.650> outstanding<00:05:48.890> for

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
know we have Ryan Kerrigan I think rated

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.310 
know we have Ryan Kerrigan I think rated
us<00:06:19.460> slightly<00:06:19.910> better<00:06:20.210> than<00:06:20.330> Aldon<00:06:20.900> Smith<00:06:21.080> but

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
us slightly better than Aldon Smith but

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.570 
us slightly better than Aldon Smith but
Kerrigan's<00:06:21.650> pretty<00:06:21.890> much<00:06:22.040> he's<00:06:22.190> been<00:06:22.310> very

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
Kerrigan's pretty much he's been very

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.220 
Kerrigan's pretty much he's been very
consistent<00:06:22.910> from<00:06:23.180> week<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.450> week<00:06:23.480> von<00:06:24.200> Miller

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
consistent from week to week von Miller

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.050 
consistent from week to week von Miller
he's<00:06:25.040> going<00:06:25.220> to<00:06:25.280> be<00:06:25.400> right<00:06:25.580> in<00:06:25.610> their<00:06:25.820> range

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
he's going to be right in their range

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.460 
he's going to be right in their range
here<00:06:26.300> I<00:06:26.330> think<00:06:26.450> in<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.750> next<00:06:26.810> few<00:06:27.080> weeks<00:06:27.260> if<00:06:27.380> he

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
here I think in the next few weeks if he

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.870 
here I think in the next few weeks if he
can<00:06:27.620> keep<00:06:27.800> up<00:06:27.980> this<00:06:28.070> consistent<00:06:28.640> production

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
can keep up this consistent production

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.420 
can keep up this consistent production
he's<00:06:29.540> gonna<00:06:29.690> put<00:06:29.930> parys<00:06:30.229> haralson<00:06:30.380> out<00:06:31.010> of<00:06:31.370> a

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
he's gonna put parys haralson out of a

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.310 
he's gonna put parys haralson out of a
job<00:06:31.610> too<00:06:31.820> if<00:06:31.850> you'd<00:06:32.510> ask<00:06:32.750> me<00:06:32.900> yeah<00:06:33.890> I<00:06:33.919> think

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
job too if you'd ask me yeah I think

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.650 
job too if you'd ask me yeah I think
you<00:06:34.710> you're<00:06:34.950> comparing<00:06:35.340> the<00:06:35.430> rookie<00:06:35.760> pass<00:06:36.390> run

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
you you're comparing the rookie pass run

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.820 
you you're comparing the rookie pass run
linebacker<00:06:37.110> you<00:06:37.260> can<00:06:37.380> bring<00:06:37.470> them<00:06:37.620> to<00:06:37.650> each

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
linebacker you can bring them to each

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.440 
linebacker you can bring them to each
other<00:06:38.010> I<00:06:38.100> think<00:06:38.250> that's<00:06:38.550> really<00:06:38.790> that's<00:06:39.270> the

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
other I think that's really that's the

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.700 
other I think that's really that's the
best<00:06:39.630> way<00:06:39.750> to<00:06:39.810> look<00:06:39.930> at<00:06:40.050> I<00:06:40.110> mean<00:06:40.320> out<00:06:40.440> of<00:06:40.560> that

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
best way to look at I mean out of that

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.830 
best way to look at I mean out of that
group<00:06:40.920> who's<00:06:41.370> doing<00:06:41.550> the<00:06:41.730> best<00:06:41.910> I<00:06:42.210> all<00:06:42.630> say

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
group who's doing the best I all say

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.360 
group who's doing the best I all say
Aldon<00:06:43.080> Smith<00:06:43.230> right<00:06:43.440> now<00:06:43.590> he's<00:06:43.830> the<00:06:43.860> standard

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
Aldon Smith right now he's the standard

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.880 
Aldon Smith right now he's the standard
for<00:06:44.790> that<00:06:44.940> group<00:06:45.150> and<00:06:45.960> you're<00:06:46.260> probably<00:06:46.620> I

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
for that group and you're probably I

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.770 
for that group and you're probably I
mean<00:06:47.040> you're<00:06:47.310> taught<00:06:47.460> you<00:06:47.580> know<00:06:47.670> but<00:06:48.540> I<00:06:48.570> mean

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
mean you're taught you know but I mean

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.360 
mean you're taught you know but I mean
I'm<00:06:48.960> you<00:06:49.320> know<00:06:49.410> trying<00:06:49.440> to<00:06:49.710> kind<00:06:50.040> of<00:06:50.070> give<00:06:50.220> the

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
I'm you know trying to kind of give the

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.160 
I'm you know trying to kind of give the
listeners<00:06:50.850> an<00:06:50.970> idea<00:06:51.270> of<00:06:51.330> like<00:06:51.390> why<00:06:51.660> we<00:06:51.840> you

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170 
listeners an idea of like why we you

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.630 
listeners an idea of like why we you
know<00:06:52.260> he<00:06:52.440> started<00:06:52.770> off<00:06:52.860> a<00:06:52.890> little<00:06:52.980> bit<00:06:53.310> lower

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
know he started off a little bit lower

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.580 
know he started off a little bit lower
I'm<00:06:54.000> initially<00:06:54.630> because<00:06:54.930> he<00:06:55.050> started<00:06:55.230> slow

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
I'm initially because he started slow

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.020 
I'm initially because he started slow
wasn't<00:06:55.890> really<00:06:56.040> producing<00:06:56.490> as<00:06:56.580> a<00:06:56.610> first-round

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
wasn't really producing as a first-round

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.730 
wasn't really producing as a first-round
pick<00:06:57.180> like<00:06:57.420> he<00:06:57.540> should<00:06:57.720> top<00:06:57.930> 10<00:06:58.140> pick<00:06:58.350> and<00:06:58.560> of

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
pick like he should top 10 pick and of

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.050 
pick like he should top 10 pick and of
course<00:06:58.950> there's<00:06:59.160> probably<00:06:59.370> reasons<00:06:59.640> but<00:06:59.910> now

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
course there's probably reasons but now

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.010 
course there's probably reasons but now
we're<00:07:00.240> trying<00:07:00.450> to<00:07:00.540> start<00:07:00.720> to<00:07:00.780> come<00:07:00.930> around

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
we're trying to start to come around

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.960 
we're trying to start to come around
give<00:07:01.410> him<00:07:01.590> his<00:07:01.770> respect<00:07:02.160> and<00:07:02.250> and<00:07:02.700> you're<00:07:02.820> dead

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
give him his respect and and you're dead

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.520 
give him his respect and and you're dead
right<00:07:03.150> well<00:07:03.210> if<00:07:03.540> he<00:07:03.660> continues<00:07:04.110> this<00:07:04.230> level

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
right well if he continues this level

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.630 
right well if he continues this level
production<00:07:04.920> up<00:07:05.040> where<00:07:05.130> he's<00:07:05.220> getting<00:07:05.400> a<00:07:05.430> sack

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:05.640 
production up where he's getting a sack
