00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.770
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.290
 new video this is the work thunder 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.520
 let's go back to this 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.700
 we will call the series of videos of this 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.550
 tremendous game and if you are watching 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.450
 at 60 fps if you're watching it at 1080 or 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.480
 720 and well we are with the king cobra 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.750
 with 63 we are not with the pretty girl 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.860
 with yellow and red we're 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.040
 with the modest but 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.040
 but power of an aim that scares 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.890
 you will ask me why I do not upload 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.309
 60 fps videos 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.310
 you usually ask and it's for a 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.200
 reason 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.150
 what do I think? 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.110
 too important to ignore 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.120
 I do not know why youtube has decided that 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.300
 put 60 fps is for the big 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.960
 resolutions 720 1080 do not give you the option 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.660
 so I can see it at 30 fps and that's something 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220
 which to me kills me is , besides giving 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.970
 many problems and a connection arrives 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.760
 100 megabytes of download, no 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.180
 I do not know there are videos that do not load me well 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.950
 it charges me well at 60 fps and it's something that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
 kill and if it happens to me it can happen to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.760
 many people and people who do not have 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.170
 too much connection then instead of power 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.540
 watch the instant video what it has 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.400
 what to do is preload it or see it in a 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.650
 low resolution something that does not seem 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.420
 correct is worth thinking about others 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.360
 apart from that I think we have all 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.650
 clear here everything is very clear that the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.260
 rosemary 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.020
 let's say principally that that is 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.869
 practically impossible to run it to 60 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.650
 frames per second in a stable way 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.619
 and normal is is nonsense or would it be to see 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.950
 a video of 30 fps normally of 30 a 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.130
 40 then render the 60 to see the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.570
 60 30 that's very silly so it's not worth it 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.610
 I'm sorry and I'm not going to do it but 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.259
 especially for the subject that can not be 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.360
 regular if it could be regulated then 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.819
 yes I would think about it seriously and good 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.090
 let's go back to 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.650
 gameplay we are in a game in the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.959
 what 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.629
 my team includes me on the team because 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.569
 a team is a whole we did fatal 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.159
 we need as a team we do not 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.080
 we defend airports we do not try 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.750
 conquer them 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.600
 the air bases and we pay it we pay it 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.180
 very seriously I at least made myself 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.840
 a pretty respectable game I can not 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.650
 say the same of my colleagues but 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.590
 eye but good what is there is worth is 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.570
 what there is sometimes the matchmaking of 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.330
 this game that sincerely sometimes 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.280
 I think not even matchmaking 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.240
 yes yes you have it there you have a 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.890
 matchmaking and good show 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.020
 these two bullets that you did that you throw 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.750
 because in the last two that I 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.150
 they stayed and instead of reloading everything 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.680
 I wanted to recharge only cannons because hey 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.010
 you can always do one or the other 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.390
 Once I would see what I wanted with these 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.390
 50 caliber machine guns 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.230
 I hate them quite honestly it's more 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.420
 I put this end of some good games of 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.220
 fact I have taken this east by sandler 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.780
 tanks included because I'm also 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.780
 playing tanks this end 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.640
 I set out to get the p-51 a 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.349
 fucking time I practically wear it 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.330
 wanting to start the game of 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.920
 game playing with Americans there by 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.099
 when it was on sale two years ago 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.040
 already practically or if two years or two 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:48.420
 years and beaks and American games because 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.160
 I wanted the p-51 and I already have the p-51 I knew 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.690
 that was going to be bad because the 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.569
 50 caliber machine guns in this 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.360
 I play an arcade because in the end we are not 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.440
 it's also true that I do not have the 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.700
 improved but 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.680
 to see things as they are 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.100
 50 caliber trainers in this game 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.510
 well, but yes, it is a 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.920
 good plane yes it is a good plane and 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.520
 I think I will use it especially in 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.920
 battles 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.690
 realistic I think it can be where 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.330
 more blood matches 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.470
 and well, I'll tell you that I'm going to take up again 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.060
 this game is a problem is that but 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.960
 I commented it more than once they give me 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.510
 gusts of playing this war tandem no 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.009
 I usually play followed by always see us 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.360
 gusts start much 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.099
 and then I rest a little, I'll see things 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.399
 cool you are adding that they are 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.820
 very much in fact this weekend have 

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:47.630
 put a tank event 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.270
 very beautiful simulation that they have removed 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.790
 the theme the icons of unity to that of the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.610
 allies have also taken it away and do not know 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:02.090
 it gives you a feeling you're not nervous 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.090
 you are tense and you do not add much value 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.620
 to the tank game the simulator is a 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.320
 thing that happens to me in this game is 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.110
 because the tanks I need to play in 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.750
 realistic simulation rather because it's 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.660
 the most the most hardcore 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.360
 but 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.660
 but plane is the problem that I have or 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.350
 I would like there to be a 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.620
 a ship 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.680
 a middle ground between arcade and realistic 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.240
 because I would like to play realistic but 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.480
 be half an hour flying to get to 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.300
 for the enemy planes it kills me 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.180
 remove and take me out of the game no no I can not 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.670
 I need to get there fast but what 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.030
 is how you played I like it more in 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.350
 arcade realistic than worth my cost 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.030
 arcade I like I like it because it's 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.940
 instant action you have a good time 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.560
 you kill a lot look at this I'm missing two 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.020
 cannonballs I spent them in which 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.490
 I was capturing I went to put this 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.050
 machine guns and out 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.900
 most damaged sedation 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.210
 The truth is that here a server 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.129
 he scored a pretty good game 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.449
 decent in my team was not to the 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.120
 but I can not talk too much 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:18.259
 of my team because it's not like I'm 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.090
 have dedicated to take to take bases 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.009
 I'm not killing him because he was 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.210
 without ammunition I put behind him to 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.919
 that they did not take it from me in fact these 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.460
 shots that you hear are from my ally 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.430
 OK 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.590
 and now it's already going and now it's ready 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.229
 see how we were 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.100
 oh my god what horror and nothing I hope that 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.220
 you liked the game 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.350
 and see you in another video worth under in 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.770
 the people until the next 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.770
 a greeting
