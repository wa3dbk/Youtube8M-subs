immersive I mean our technology it's all
our<00:01:15.870> own<00:01:15.960> technology<00:01:16.820> goes<00:01:17.820> straight<00:01:18.090> across

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
our own technology goes straight across

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.020 
our own technology goes straight across
to<00:01:18.720> oculus<00:01:19.440> pretty<00:01:20.070> easily<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.730> we've<00:01:20.850> still

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
to oculus pretty easily but we've still

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.870 
to oculus pretty easily but we've still
got<00:01:21.090> some<00:01:21.210> work<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.900> mainly<00:01:22.740> around<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.280> 2d

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.020 
got some work to do mainly around the 2d
stuff<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.450> hard<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.260> user<00:01:25.500> interface<00:01:26.030> but

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
stuff that hard the user interface but

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.370 
stuff that hard the user interface but
we're<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.360> far<00:01:27.600> off<00:01:27.660> from<00:01:27.960> having<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
we're not far off from having that

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.950 
we're not far off from having that
completed<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.300> we<00:01:30.300> should<00:01:30.510> be<00:01:30.600> able<00:01:30.690> to<00:01:30.780> get

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
completed and we should be able to get

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
in first person looking around inside

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.640 
in first person looking around inside
your<00:01:38.880> cockpit<00:01:39.120> looking<00:01:39.780> around<00:01:39.840> right<00:01:40.320> behind

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
your cockpit looking around right behind

your cockpit looking around right behind
your<00:01:40.890> head<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> cockpit<00:01:42.170> is

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
your head at the back of the cockpit is

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.500 
your head at the back of the cockpit is
a<00:01:43.230> really<00:01:43.860> immersive<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.520> great<00:01:45.030> experience

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
a really immersive and great experience

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.960 
a really immersive and great experience
adds<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.080> hell<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.220> something

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
adds a hell of a lot to it and something

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.990 
adds a hell of a lot to it and something
that<00:01:48.000> we've<00:01:48.180> come<00:01:48.360> across<00:01:48.620> just<00:01:49.620> by

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
that we've come across just by

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000 
that we've come across just by
coincidence<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:52.830> you're

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
coincidence really is that when you're

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.980 
coincidence really is that when you're
in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> cutscenes<00:01:53.760> you<00:01:54.330> can<00:01:54.510> actually<00:01:54.659> look

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
in the cutscenes you can actually look

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.920 
in the cutscenes you can actually look
around<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.830> 3d<00:01:56.370> at<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.850> cut<00:01:57.060> scenes<00:01:57.330> scenes

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
around in in 3d at the cut scenes scenes

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.810 
around in in 3d at the cut scenes scenes
while<00:01:58.170> they're<00:01:58.380> running<00:01:58.470> it's<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.580> very

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
while they're running it's a very

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.540 
while they're running it's a very
strange<00:02:00.150> thing<00:02:00.470> but<00:02:01.470> works<00:02:01.800> really<00:02:01.920> well<00:02:02.280> if

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
strange thing but works really well if

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.430 
strange thing but works really well if
people<00:02:02.580> have<00:02:02.940> commented<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:04.020> leave<00:02:04.229> that

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
people have commented on know leave that

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.670 
people have commented on know leave that
in<00:02:04.620> I<00:02:04.830> like<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.120> hopefully<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:07.140> will<00:02:07.350> we'll

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
in I like it so hopefully we will we'll

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.589 
in I like it so hopefully we will we'll
see<00:02:07.890> if<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.129> poses<00:02:08.459> any<00:02:08.729> technical<00:02:09.090> challenges

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599

we<00:02:10.080> hope<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.319> leave<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.790> because<00:02:11.790> it's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
we hope we leave it in because it's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.720 
we hope we leave it in because it's
really<00:02:12.120> changes<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.049> nature<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.519> 3d<00:02:14.519> class

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
