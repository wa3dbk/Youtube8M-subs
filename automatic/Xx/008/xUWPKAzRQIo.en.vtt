00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 well, today we present the optimus lg 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.610
 that we are presenting it as 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.820
 a filter above all because of the theme of 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.500
 the tactility that has or is final what 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.470
 We presented in Barcelona and we talked 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.180
 of the issue of fluidity by the 0 gap that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.880
 It has eliminated the gap between the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.769
 crystal and the lcb haley and this makes 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.670
 have together with the four cores that 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:31.199
 have a fluency and go very very 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.780
 fluid the terminal and then also in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.370
 screen we have a 4.7 inch is a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.930
 ips screen and precisely that we think 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.460
 that give colors more real than what 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.770
 that can give other options that saturate 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.320
 a little more colors 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.420
 and in design, we have a phone that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.309
 the screen is completely black that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.750
 gives the impression that no frames per 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.820
 the lateral we have worked the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.250
 materials you have steel cut to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.400
 laser and in the back that you see 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.010
 lower to the effect of light 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.550
 Crystal has been worked and it is crystal 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.940
 polarized with effect with 3d effect 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.430
 then in some functionalities that 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.410
 has also a little fruit of those of 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.030
 the four nuclei because it has 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:20.060
 example the live x that what allows you 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.400
 is to be seeing for example a 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.980
 calendar you can have it what can you 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.190
 transparent and at the same time you can be 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.160
 below working is worth doing 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.080
 an internet search or you can be 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.650
 doing 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.720
 any other thing and then in 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.700
 how much the camera has a 3 camera 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.750
 megapixels but we were already advancing in the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.670
 mobile world congress that is not 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.560
 only the issue of pixel prices 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.950
 but also the functionalities that 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.470
 has the camera for example in the camera 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.680
 has what we have called the shot at 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.960
 past that is the retroactive shot what 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.940
 that allows you to take a picture when 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.920
 something is moving and in the moment 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.750
 what do you do the photo 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.360
 we need something moving in the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 moment you make the photo what you have 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.750
 made him 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.290
 shot the past is has caught me those 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.150
 two seconds before the moment in the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.400
 that I took the picture here is when I've 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.230
 I took the picture and he took me minus two 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.080
 seconds minus one and a half minus one 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.640
 second minus half a second and the moment 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.940
 in which I pressed if you do not give 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.140
 aa time to shoot the photo at the moment 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.240
 at the right moment then he has also 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.850
 other functions as for example has 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.950
 the smart shutter 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.800
 is the intelligent shutter what you 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.900
 allows I have to remove the shot at 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.100
 past first I do not have to cancel and 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.170
 Now let me do Dr. abel 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.700
 smart curator intelligent what 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.130
 what it allows is to reduce a photo in 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.530
 movement the each we are here that 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.110
 facing the light but we see as the photo 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.320
 he looked very moving with the 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.550
 Smart shutter has removed 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.680
 part of the movement and it's done a lot 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.870
 more lines taking away the focus despite 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.850
 of the movement is perfectly lily 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.390
 Hellenic curator helen is another 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.510
 the news that incorporates and good 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:22.650
 has more features the camera he 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.260
 If we have already taught it with the l9 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.640
 and with other phones that is power 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.190
 take the photo 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:35.590
 directly active the chip 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.590
 with is looking before chis 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.330
 and we have not done the photo 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.330
 because of the noise that is in the background 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.190
 it depends on the noise you have in the background and 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.470
 we see how he has taken me directly 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.860
 directly 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.860
 to my mother 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.690
 and basically that's what we 're going to 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.120
 work let's work a lot of screen 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.440
 design and tactility that gives the 0 range 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.440
 thank you
