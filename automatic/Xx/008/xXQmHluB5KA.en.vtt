and that I get the perm apart and now
it's<00:01:56.189> taking<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.610> shot<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> head<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.930> met

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it's taking one shot the head like met

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.310 
it's taking one shot the head like met
one<00:01:58.920> boom<00:01:59.310> one<00:02:00.119> boom<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> was<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:01.049> I

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
one boom one boom and I was like what I

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.899 
one boom one boom and I was like what I
was<00:02:01.829> life<00:02:02.070> calling<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.399> by<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.640> with<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
was life calling this by the way with a

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.219 
was life calling this by the way with a
face<00:02:03.090> cam<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.540> first<00:02:03.750> episode<00:02:04.079> will<00:02:04.170> be

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
face cam and the first episode will be

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.260 
face cam and the first episode will be
coming<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.590> tomorrow<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.399> was<00:02:05.909> like<00:02:06.030> what

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
coming out tomorrow but I was like what

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.310 
coming out tomorrow but I was like what
what's<00:02:06.479> happened<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:06.899> why<00:02:07.079> am<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.259> getting

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
what's happened here why am I getting

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.719 
what's happened here why am I getting
like<00:02:07.619> one<00:02:07.649> hit<00:02:07.950> edgell<00:02:08.220> sound<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:08.700> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
like one hit edgell sound so what I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.580 
like one hit edgell sound so what I
think<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.149> actually<00:02:09.300> does<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.959> increases

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
think it actually does is it increases

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.190 
think it actually does is it increases
the<00:02:10.619> headshot<00:02:11.250> multiplier<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:12.030> zombies

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the headshot multiplier on zombies

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440 
the headshot multiplier on zombies
I<00:02:13.319> don't<00:02:14.069> know<00:02:14.160> how<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.610> works<00:02:14.760> if<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.180> does<00:02:15.300> it

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I don't know how it works if it does it

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.449 
I don't know how it works if it does it
over<00:02:15.720> all<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.080> zombies<00:02:16.200> or<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.190> reason

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
over all the zombies or if the reason

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.740 
over all the zombies or if the reason
why<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.790> get<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.030> more<00:02:18.209> than<00:02:18.330> once<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
why you can get it more than once in the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.630 
why you can get it more than once in the
game<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.050> because<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.890> only<00:02:20.160> increases

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
game is because you if it only increases

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.509 
game is because you if it only increases
the<00:02:20.849> headshot<00:02:21.150> multiplier<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.629> that<00:02:22.050> weapon

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
the headshot multiplier for that weapon

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.160 
the headshot multiplier for that weapon
I<00:02:23.519> think<00:02:23.970> some<00:02:24.180> people<00:02:24.569> need<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.780> do<00:02:24.959> some

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
I think some people need to do some

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.100 
I think some people need to do some
testing<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:26.580> shall<00:02:26.849> find<00:02:27.060> out<00:02:27.209> but<00:02:27.540> i

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
testing and we shall find out but i

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.259 
testing and we shall find out but i
think<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.099> only<00:02:29.400> permanent<00:02:29.640> for<00:02:29.970> one<00:02:30.090> game

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
think it's only permanent for one game

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.699 
think it's only permanent for one game
you<00:02:30.330> need<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.569> get<00:02:30.660> our<00:02:30.810> collateral<00:02:31.110> headshot

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
you need to get our collateral headshot

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.059 
you need to get our collateral headshot
in<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.610> game<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.090> then<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.800> then<00:02:34.890> you're

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
in that game and then and then you're

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.800 
in that game and then and then you're
golden<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.730> know<00:02:35.849> for<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.120> game<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.690> then

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
golden you know for that game but then

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.940 
golden you know for that game but then
you<00:02:36.900> need<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> go<00:02:37.200> back<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.709> i'm<00:02:37.830> not
