00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
when trilogy came to us with this idea

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.800 
when trilogy came to us with this idea
we<00:00:26.369> knew<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.939> was<00:00:27.119> something<00:00:27.150> that's<00:00:27.689> never

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
we knew it was something that's never

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.950 
we knew it was something that's never
been<00:00:28.050> done<00:00:28.349> before<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.070> industry<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
been done before in this industry and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:42.950 
been done before in this industry and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
right then I knew we had to do it so we

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510 
right then I knew we had to do it so we
had<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> girls<00:00:43.920> paint<00:00:44.280> it

everyone's getting spray painted then

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.770 
everyone's getting spray painted then
they<00:00:47.579> can't<00:00:47.789> touch<00:00:47.940> each<00:00:48.149> other<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.600> don't

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
they can't touch each other if you don't

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.690 
they can't touch each other if you don't
want<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> smear<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> paint<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.250> then<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.550> the

want to smear the paint so then all the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.189 
want to smear the paint so then all the
models<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.270> together<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.719> formed<00:00:52.079> this

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
models got together and formed this

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.619 
models got together and formed this
humans<00:00:52.590> falster<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.000> crazy<00:00:54.239> with

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
humans falster but what was crazy with

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.119 
humans falster but what was crazy with
it<00:00:54.660> they<00:00:54.960> were<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.350> position<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.800> at

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it they were in that position for at

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.869 
it they were in that position for at
least<00:00:56.370> an<00:00:56.699> hour<00:00:57.199> this<00:00:58.199> year<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:58.559> NAB<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.489> wanted

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
least an hour this year at NAB we wanted

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
least an hour this year at NAB we wanted
to<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.210> something<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:01.199> different<00:01:01.620> we

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
to do something really different we

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.880 
to do something really different we
wanted<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.170> something<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.650> was

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
wanted to really do something that was

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.390 
wanted to really do something that was
gonna<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.360> impactful<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.189> provocative<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
gonna be impactful and provocative and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100 
gonna be impactful and provocative and
really<00:01:08.670> show<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.360> media<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> entertainment

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
really show the media and entertainment

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:28.630 
really show the media and entertainment
industry<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.640> understand<00:01:12.119> their<00:01:12.299> business

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.420 

I<00:01:31.990> think<00:01:32.990> what<00:01:33.110> was<00:01:33.260> unique<00:01:33.710> about<00:01:34.070> the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
I think what was unique about the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.469 
I think what was unique about the
primary<00:01:34.970> subjects<00:01:35.659> being<00:01:36.280> all<00:01:37.280> models<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.119> as

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
primary subjects being all models and as

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.060 
primary subjects being all models and as
since<00:01:38.659> our<00:01:38.810> entire<00:01:39.110> frame<00:01:39.440> was<00:01:39.650> filled<00:01:39.890> with

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
since our entire frame was filled with

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
since our entire frame was filled with
with<00:01:40.310> models<00:01:40.729> at<00:01:40.880> any<00:01:41.570> given<00:01:41.750> point<00:01:42.050> is<00:01:42.909> we<00:01:43.909> had

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
with models at any given point is we had

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.910 
with models at any given point is we had
so<00:01:44.300> much<00:01:44.420> movement<00:01:44.780> every<00:01:45.440> single<00:01:45.770> element

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
so much movement every single element

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.609 
so much movement every single element
unsaid<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.479> camera<00:01:47.930> was<00:01:48.080> moving<00:01:48.229> at<00:01:48.500> the

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
unsaid the in camera was moving at the

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.170 
unsaid the in camera was moving at the
same<00:01:48.800> time<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.160> camera<00:01:49.550> was<00:01:49.640> moving<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.090> the

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
same time the camera was moving so the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.359 
same time the camera was moving so the
orchestration<00:01:50.780> required<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.740> block<00:01:52.009> everyone

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
orchestration required to block everyone

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.060 
orchestration required to block everyone
properly<00:01:53.000> for<00:01:53.240> what<00:01:54.110> her<00:01:54.170> fairly<00:01:54.409> short<00:01:54.770> shots

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
properly for what her fairly short shots

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:12.589 
properly for what her fairly short shots
was<00:01:55.520> fairly<00:01:55.970> complex<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.770> well<00:01:57.770> worked<00:01:58.040> out

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.360 

this<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.439> first<00:02:13.650> time<00:02:13.829> I've<00:02:13.980> ever<00:02:14.010> done<00:02:14.310> a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
this is the first time I've ever done a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.190 
this is the first time I've ever done a
story<00:02:14.670> within<00:02:14.909> this<00:02:15.120> story<00:02:15.420> which<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.989> so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
story within this story which is so

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.129 
story within this story which is so
Shakespearean<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.129> cool<00:02:17.689> but<00:02:18.689> not<00:02:18.749> only<00:02:18.989> that

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139 
Shakespearean and cool but not only that

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.280 
Shakespearean and cool but not only that
but<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.439> feels<00:02:19.680> very<00:02:20.090> cinematic<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.569> me<00:02:21.749> and<00:02:22.170> I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
but it feels very cinematic to me and I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.660 
but it feels very cinematic to me and I
think<00:02:22.349> that's<00:02:22.590> what<00:02:22.799> it<00:02:22.889> was<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.159> appealing<00:02:23.400> to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
think that's what it was so appealing to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.309 
think that's what it was so appealing to
me<00:02:23.730> about<00:02:23.879> this<00:02:24.030> project<00:02:24.269> was<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.749> got<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.049> take

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
me about this project was I got to take

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.170 
me about this project was I got to take
this<00:02:25.499> amazing<00:02:25.799> background<00:02:26.189> in<00:02:26.489> cinema<00:02:26.939> and
