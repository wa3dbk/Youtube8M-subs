I think he I think he should just be
gone<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.360> regardless<00:01:33.869> what

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
if we still get top four so would you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.480 
if we still get top four so would you
