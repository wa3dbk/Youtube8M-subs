Andrews water system as you can see here
we've<00:00:10.559> got<00:00:10.590> two<00:00:10.920> kinds<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.340> lettuces<00:00:13.280> sure

we've got two kinds of lettuces sure
what<00:00:14.490> they<00:00:14.670> are<00:00:14.700> there<00:00:15.089> about<00:00:15.269> four<00:00:15.509> weeks<00:00:15.540> old

also got the bell train system in it of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.040 
also got the bell train system in it of
a<00:00:43.500> good<00:00:43.710> look<00:00:46.910> here<00:00:47.910> sis<00:00:48.090> MacMurray's<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
a good look here sis MacMurray's just a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.189 
a good look here sis MacMurray's just a
issue<00:00:49.770> basic<00:00:50.250> system<00:00:50.579> he's<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.989> you<00:00:51.989> see

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
issue basic system he's got a you see

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
issue basic system he's got a you see
it's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.250> these<00:00:53.340> drums<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.149> he<00:00:54.239> cut

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it's a is one of these drums that he cut

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's a is one of these drums that he cut
the<00:00:54.480> top<00:00:54.750> off<00:00:55.100> flipped<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> over<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.440> there

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the top off flipped it over and there

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.770 
the top off flipped it over and there
you<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.730> he's<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> pump<00:01:00.390> inside

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you have it so he's got the pump inside

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.429 
you have it so he's got the pump inside
at<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> moment<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.620> got<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:02.180> 100<00:01:03.439> little

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
at the moment it's got about 100 little

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.130 
at the moment it's got about 100 little
baby<00:01:04.619> fish<00:01:04.890> inside<00:01:05.519> their<00:01:05.820> pumps<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.020> got<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
baby fish inside their pumps up we got a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.530 
baby fish inside their pumps up we got a
backflow<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> control<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.390> amount

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
backflow in just to control the amount

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.240 
backflow in just to control the amount
of<00:01:09.659> volume<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.110> comes<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> top<00:01:10.830> here

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
of volume that comes out the top here

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.870 
of volume that comes out the top here
into<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> grow<00:01:11.939> bed<00:01:12.240> fills<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.020> normal<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
into the grow bed fills up as normal and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.969 
into the grow bed fills up as normal and
then<00:01:14.880> drains<00:01:15.350> system<00:01:16.350> run<00:01:16.500> he's<00:01:16.680> got<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
then drains system run he's got it

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
then drains system run he's got it
running<00:01:17.250> tenuously<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> moment<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.600> it's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
running tenuously at the moment but it's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.230 
running tenuously at the moment but it's
no<00:01:22.170> problems<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.710> he's<00:01:23.220> really<00:01:23.640> great<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
no problems at all he's really great I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.570 
no problems at all he's really great I
think<00:01:24.810> we've<00:01:24.960> lost<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.229> fish<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.100> only

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
think we've lost one fish and they only

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.039 
think we've lost one fish and they only
just<00:01:26.850> set<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> system<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.600> about<00:01:27.810> four

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
just set up the system here about four

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.039 
just set up the system here about four
weeks<00:01:28.080> ago<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.770> said<00:01:28.950> before<00:01:29.810> for<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> nice

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
weeks ago as I said before for the nice

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.050 
weeks ago as I said before for the nice
decorative<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.740> that's<00:01:31.860> about<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> trying<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
decorative and that's about it trying to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.730 
decorative and that's about it trying to
insulate<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.810> are<00:01:33.960> having<00:01:34.259> troubles<00:01:34.650> with

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
insulate it we are having troubles with

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.940 
insulate it we are having troubles with
our<00:01:35.159> warp<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.110> try<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.380> whatever<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.740> can

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
our warp so just try and whatever we can

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.060 
our warp so just try and whatever we can
to<00:01:38.009> keep<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.460> insulated<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.200> uh<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.950> know

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to keep it insulated and uh you know

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.740 
to keep it insulated and uh you know
what<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.729> still<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> nice<00:01:42.090> cool<00:01:42.329> temperature

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
what is still a nice cool temperature

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
what is still a nice cool temperature
but<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> lettuces<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.189> way<00:01:44.220> that's

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
but the lettuces like it that way that's

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.270 
but the lettuces like it that way that's
fine<00:01:44.930> looking<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.079> extending<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.040> another

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
fine looking at extending it to another

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.330 
fine looking at extending it to another
bath<00:01:47.640> tub<00:01:48.079> every<00:01:49.079> along<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> back<00:01:49.649> or<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
bath tub every along the back or on the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.149 
bath tub every along the back or on the
side<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.750> went<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> placing<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.829> sump<00:01:53.070> tank

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
side here went and placing a sump tank

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.580 
side here went and placing a sump tank
in<00:01:53.579> which<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.990> water<00:01:55.140> level

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
in which as you can see the water level

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.240 
in which as you can see the water level
does<00:01:56.430> drop<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.909> full<00:01:57.180> quite<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> bit<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.680> between

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
does drop in full quite a bit in between

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.490 
does drop in full quite a bit in between
fill<00:01:59.850> in<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> flood

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
fill in the flood

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.990 
fill in the flood
so<00:02:02.500> yeah<00:02:02.800> that's<00:02:02.950> pretty<00:02:03.100> much<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.460> system

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000
