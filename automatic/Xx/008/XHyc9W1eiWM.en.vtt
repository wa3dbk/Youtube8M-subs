00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello I'm rom brÃ©tigny I'm going 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.080
 present you with codes to be able to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.960
 have complaints a lot of vehicles 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.960
 in rare vehicles skin a game 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.080
 scarface that are played on playstation 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.580
 so started by saying that I love 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.410
 called the ariel mc3 the code 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.560
 memories the good it's old fast that you 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.349
 lets see the end so it's a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.390
 car that goes very very fast what is 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.000
 did so so they were very well done 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.570
 So here looks like what it 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.870
 all alone and I advise you that for 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.120
 the show where it goes pretty fast actually 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.120
 and where then especially when you need it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.590
 but the cops so I put four 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.890
 drivers because I do not play too much 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.310
 in to scarface now since I 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.660
 am rather on cydia gta iii gta iii 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.800
 on playstation 2 still but if not I 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.220
 think it's not too bad 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.119
 car 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.050
 it's even awesome I think she's 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.390
 very handy 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.770
 I am in the long term by added 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.350
 I advise against 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.119
 curb with the end xo car because 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:22.390
 his part often seen that it turns often 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:27.330
 vinea so next it's an end it's 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:31.270
 a military truck with a 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.630
 machine gun on the roof the code these 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.630
 mansions 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.380
 in the school field 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.470
 saab hummer 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.940
 and so there it is bodog bodog stampede 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.530
 Monoi is a construction company 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:17.410
 of heavy weapons in the game so that's it 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.700
 what has finally 2 is not bad but 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.620
 must go fast to be able to lead 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:27.190
 correctly still there handbrake 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.959
 even if you could have the airlock there 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.910
 use as many times as you can 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.260
 pre will make the impasse that I do not find 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.340
 that she do I think it's very 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.070
 although that brakes very well and that I 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.489
 will make a slip of the tongue it's banal 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.470
 and so here's to shoot that's it 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.260
 big damage it explodes well 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.830
 boats create everything else in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.239
 experience and speaking there 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.239
 Here it is 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.870
 what we see a little 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.690
 I prove that too much rigor 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.280
 all run 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.330
 because and we will go through the box like that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.720
 must press round and advice is 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.000
 better stop you before the crazy that 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.410
 that will fly because usually 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.330
 you think it's good then that 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:24.540
 it's not good at all so that's it 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:29.250
 after other code that you give yourself 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.250
 a kind of lamborghini 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.460
 the code is very easy 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.460
 these 6 6 6 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.370
 stress 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.430
 this is bah cinar they call that but 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.430
 it's like a no mori 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.170
 but number there are the yellows 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.330
 obligatorily but it's rsa is going very 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.470
 it's a bit like the ariel except 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.080
 that she behaves to two and that the 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.410
 handbrake it holds a little bit more if we 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.950
 knows how to control obviously what is 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.720
 not my case 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.720
 a thank you here 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.390
 but if they are joined two cars that 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.150
 go very fast I favor 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:19.010
 personally the normal brake because 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:22.840
 that it is 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:31.420
 it's better it brakes suddenly and then 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:33.830
 good ready you have other codes know 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.620
 but it wanted to discover I'm a 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:43.360
 other video for a video for that our 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.360
 video and so I say thank you
