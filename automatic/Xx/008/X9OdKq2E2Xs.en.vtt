sticky but that's no problem because

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.729 
sticky but that's no problem because
I'll<00:02:18.940> show<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.239> how<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.510> deal<00:02:19.959> with<00:02:19.989> sticky

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
I'll show you how I deal with sticky

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.140 
I'll show you how I deal with sticky
dough's<00:02:21.959> literally<00:02:22.959> flour<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.709> surface<00:02:24.459> but

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
dough's literally flour a surface but

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.610 
dough's literally flour a surface but
you're<00:02:25.330> gonna<00:02:25.450> need<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.959> dough<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.379> your

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
you're gonna need the dough on your

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.729 
you're gonna need the dough on your
sticky<00:02:27.310> dough<00:02:28.200> turn<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.379> dough<00:02:29.590> out<00:02:29.860> and

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
sticky dough turn the dough out and

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.979 
sticky dough turn the dough out and
knead<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:34.690> well<00:02:35.879> and<00:02:36.879> some<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.360> flour<00:02:37.690> that

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
knead it well and some of the flour that

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.830 
knead it well and some of the flour that
you've<00:02:38.170> got<00:02:38.349> on<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.709> surface<00:02:39.640> will<00:02:40.450> start<00:02:40.720> to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
you've got on the surface will start to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.770 
you've got on the surface will start to
get<00:02:40.959> incorporated<00:02:41.799> into<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.220> dough<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.819> start

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
get incorporated into the dough I start

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.210 
get incorporated into the dough I start
to<00:02:43.900> remove<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:44.260> stickiness<00:02:44.739> now<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.040> may

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
to remove the stickiness now you may

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.140 
to remove the stickiness now you may
need<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.690> dust<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.840> surface<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.650> few<00:02:48.579> times

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
need to dust the surface a few times

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.940 
need to dust the surface a few times
depending<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.810> how<00:02:49.959> sticky<00:02:50.319> your<00:02:50.590> dough<00:02:50.739> is

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
depending on how sticky your dough is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.190 
depending on how sticky your dough is
but<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.030> will<00:02:52.239> eventually<00:02:52.360> end<00:02:52.810> up<00:02:53.019> with<00:02:53.079> a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
but you will eventually end up with a

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.289 
but you will eventually end up with a
nice<00:02:53.440> soft<00:02:53.860> dough<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.640> see<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.030> getting

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
nice soft dough you see this is getting

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.080 
nice soft dough you see this is getting
much<00:02:55.450> better<00:02:55.630> already<00:02:56.760> I've<00:02:57.760> managed<00:02:58.060> to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
much better already I've managed to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.930 
much better already I've managed to
kneading<00:02:58.720> enough<00:02:59.019> flour<00:02:59.380> at<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.860> dough<00:03:00.099> is

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
kneading enough flour at the dough is

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.330 
kneading enough flour at the dough is
just<00:03:01.180> slightly<00:03:01.480> tacky<00:03:01.989> it's<00:03:02.319> not<00:03:02.530> sticky

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
just slightly tacky it's not sticky

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.770 
just slightly tacky it's not sticky
anymore

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
anymore

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.039 
anymore
so<00:03:04.780> I'm<00:03:04.900> gonna<00:03:05.019> need<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.560> now<00:03:06.090> for<00:03:07.090> about<00:03:07.360> seven

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
so I'm gonna need it now for about seven

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.400 
so I'm gonna need it now for about seven
or<00:03:08.110> eight<00:03:08.230> minutes<00:03:09.870> work<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.260> gluten<00:03:12.329> mm-hmm

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
or eight minutes work that gluten mm-hmm

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.870 
or eight minutes work that gluten mm-hmm
I've<00:03:14.410> been<00:03:14.590> given<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:14.980> dough<00:03:15.250> really<00:03:15.609> good

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
I've been given the dough really good

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.080 
I've been given the dough really good
pummelling<00:03:17.040> make<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.190> into<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.459> nice<00:03:18.670> smooth

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
pummelling make it into a nice smooth

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.819 
pummelling make it into a nice smooth
ball<00:03:19.950> pop<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.100> into<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.430> lightly<00:03:21.700> greased<00:03:22.180> bowl

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
ball pop it into a lightly greased bowl

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.140 
ball pop it into a lightly greased bowl
then<00:03:23.829> cover<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.609> put<00:03:25.299> in<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.540> nice<00:03:25.870> warm<00:03:26.560> place

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
then cover and put in a nice warm place

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.830 
then cover and put in a nice warm place
until<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.359> dough<00:03:28.600> doubles<00:03:28.900> in<00:03:29.350> size<00:03:30.840> well

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
until the dough doubles in size well

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.080 
until the dough doubles in size well
this<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.380> certainly<00:03:32.620> risen<00:03:33.130> very<00:03:33.489> nicely

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
this is certainly risen very nicely

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.420 
this is certainly risen very nicely
thank<00:03:34.630> you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
thank you

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.949 
thank you
so<00:03:36.430> I'll<00:03:36.579> tip<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.180> out<00:03:37.329> onto<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.720> floured

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
so I'll tip it out onto a floured

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.330 
so I'll tip it out onto a floured
surface<00:03:38.790> but<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:41.700> just<00:03:42.700> knock<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:42.970> back<00:03:43.329> a<00:03:43.359> bit

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
surface but I just knock it back a bit

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.629 
surface but I just knock it back a bit
now<00:03:45.340> add<00:03:45.579> all<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.880> dried<00:03:46.209> fruit<00:03:47.310> fold<00:03:48.310> over

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
now add all the dried fruit fold over

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:56.430 
now add all the dried fruit fold over
and<00:03:50.400> knead<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.730> fruit<00:03:52.530> into<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.829> dough<00:03:55.440> I'm

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
and knead the fruit into the dough I'm

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.370 
and knead the fruit into the dough I'm
gonna<00:03:56.680> knead<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.549> about<00:03:58.109> five<00:03:59.109> minutes

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
gonna knead for about five minutes

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.160 
gonna knead for about five minutes
probably

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
probably

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.130 
probably
I<00:04:01.230> like<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.069> think<00:04:02.190> I've<00:04:02.400> got<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.900> fruit<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
I like to think I've got the fruit a

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.960 
I like to think I've got the fruit a
fairly<00:04:04.500> well<00:04:04.650> incorporated<00:04:05.580> so<00:04:05.760> I'm<00:04:05.819> gonna

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
fairly well incorporated so I'm gonna

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.370 
fairly well incorporated so I'm gonna
make<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.450> into<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:07.069> around<00:04:08.780> now<00:04:09.780> what<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.020> tend

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
make this into a around now what I tend

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.520 
make this into a around now what I tend
to<00:04:10.500> do<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:12.030> if<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.300> see<00:04:12.480> any<00:04:12.660> bits<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:13.020> fruit<00:04:13.349> on

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
to do is if I see any bits of fruit on

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.550 
to do is if I see any bits of fruit on
the<00:04:13.680> surface<00:04:14.130> I'd<00:04:14.280> pull<00:04:14.610> them<00:04:14.849> off<00:04:15.230> because<00:04:16.230> in

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
the surface I'd pull them off because in

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.680 
the surface I'd pull them off because in
the<00:04:16.709> oven<00:04:17.040> they<00:04:17.549> tend<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.850> blacken<00:04:18.450> very

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
the oven they tend to blacken very

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.830 
the oven they tend to blacken very
easily<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.609> doesn't<00:04:20.940> make<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.299> loaf<00:04:21.540> look

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
easily and it doesn't make the loaf look

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.590 
easily and it doesn't make the loaf look
particularly<00:04:22.380> appetizing<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:24.330> I've<00:04:24.389> picked

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
particularly appetizing so I've picked

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.180 
particularly appetizing so I've picked
off<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> better<00:04:25.080> doesn't<00:04:25.410> just<00:04:25.770> over<00:04:26.070> it

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
off a better doesn't just over it

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.140 
off a better doesn't just over it
doesn't<00:04:26.419> it's<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.540> dried<00:04:27.810> fruit<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.820> I've<00:04:29.940> got

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
doesn't it's a dried fruit and I've got

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.750 
doesn't it's a dried fruit and I've got
a<00:04:30.180> piece<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.110> dough<00:04:31.530> here<00:04:31.860> which<00:04:32.040> has<00:04:32.220> no<00:04:32.400> fruit

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
a piece of dough here which has no fruit

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.040 
a piece of dough here which has no fruit
poking<00:04:33.389> out<00:04:33.540> of<00:04:33.720> it

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
poking out of it

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.610 
poking out of it
I'll<00:04:34.979> now<00:04:35.250> transfer<00:04:35.850> this<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:37.290> a<00:04:37.320> lightly

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
I'll now transfer this to a lightly

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.969 
I'll now transfer this to a lightly
greased<00:04:38.160> baking<00:04:38.520> tray<00:04:38.820> now<00:04:39.540> I'll<00:04:40.530> just<00:04:40.740> cover

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
greased baking tray now I'll just cover

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.710
