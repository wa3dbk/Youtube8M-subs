to<00:04:40.340> change<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.730> can<00:04:41.000> review<00:04:41.270> but<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:41.660> believe

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
to change the can review but I believe

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.320 
to change the can review but I believe
that<00:04:42.230> is<00:04:42.830> more<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.430> do<00:04:43.580> with<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.790> fact<00:04:44.060> that<00:04:44.210> i

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
that is more to do with the fact that i

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.630 
that is more to do with the fact that i
don't<00:04:44.840> think<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.230> game<00:04:45.440> has<00:04:45.860> any<00:04:46.160> more<00:04:46.430> than

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
don't think the game has any more than

don't think the game has any more than
just<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:46.940> one<00:04:47.150> camera<00:04:47.570> view<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.870> begin<00:04:48.110> with

just the one camera view to begin with
it<00:04:48.860> was<00:04:48.920> a<00:04:49.160> little<00:04:49.400> disappointing<00:04:49.940> but<00:04:49.970> again
