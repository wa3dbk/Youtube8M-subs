00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.100
 A separate reference for those who do not know

 where is camera raw open 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.110
 filter and here we have a camera raw filter for 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.450
 those who do not know what kind of filter I give you 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:37.120
 I'll show you click on it in my 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.580
 lessons lately very often i 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.860
 I use a slave camera as it is very 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.350
 well helps and in processing 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.400
 images and something like 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.990
 lightroom in principle they are somewhat similar 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.760
 here you can play with 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.120
 add cold temperature 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:59.380
 image or vice versa flowed also 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.919
 you can add different shades you can 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.740
 enhance or reduce the exposure ie 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.020
 add or reduce color 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.880
 contrast, in principle, understand already 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.610
 I myself have a review can it 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.840
 look here all sorts of interesting 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.390
 things sharpness you can add 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.570
 saturation is a very cool plugin in 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.180
 principle irreplaceable and cool than he 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.270
 supports most formats 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.010
 different camera if not to say that 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.680
 everything 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.470
 so it is very good without it 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.840
 plug-in principle photoshop 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.490
 image processing is very hard but 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.370
 in principle, if you take from the Internet 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.110
 photos in principle with this plugin 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.740
 you will only use for 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.590
 corrections for photographers this plugin 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.930
 simply indispensable therefore necessarily 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.120
 Ivan download for those who have 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.490
 remind you just need to upgrade 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.490
 that is, download this link 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.170
 camera run and and it updates your 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.350
 frames that you have already installed 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.590
 I also give a reference on your cloud me 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.360
 already downloaded camera raw 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.000

 download download from the cloud 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.460
