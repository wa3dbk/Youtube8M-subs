to take a logical guess i would say no

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.950 
to take a logical guess i would say no
because<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> developers<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.750> said<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
because as the developers have said a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440 
because as the developers have said a
few<00:01:25.140> times<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> prequel<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.970> Arkham

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
few times this is a prequel to Arkham

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
few times this is a prequel to Arkham
Asylum<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.960> Arkham<00:01:28.049> City<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:29.220> much

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
Asylum and Arkham City and it's much

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.130 
Asylum and Arkham City and it's much
earlier<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.299> Batman's<00:01:30.659> career<00:01:30.990> which

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
earlier on in Batman's career which

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.899 
earlier on in Batman's career which
means<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.009> pretty<00:01:32.220> much<00:01:32.310> count<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
means you can pretty much count on the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.210
