00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.870
 well hello everyone it's 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.480
 gaming and today we find ourselves 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.830
 for a video on destiny and yes 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.960
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.170
 enter the glass frame without 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.320
 form the monolith so that is to say 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.810
 without training them without taking the plates 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.609
 sync has it so first 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 you will launch the glass vault 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.510
 so on Venus is the launch the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.510
 mission revive the activity 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 so that's actually it's simple 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.690
 this method of consists is not 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.140
 to do the mission 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.629
 it's going to be for example to make for 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.579
 establish plans to make 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.090
 methods and all that means that you 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 do not go the game will you consider 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.640
 as in as always in the process of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 form synchronization plates 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.400
 that is to say that so here you come 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.760
 here is not usually you go 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760
 Go over there 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 in the name I did not do the real gem you 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.450
 go take the three plates of his 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.250
 chronic 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:25.820
 he did in fact make fun of you I do not 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:30.010
 do not even know you go there too 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.050
 you take your passerines here 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.690
 sykes and there you said roy as we 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.010
 can go look like this 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.070
 brings is not even modeling 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.480
 here you go back like these tech 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.310
 so here you see there the I consider 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.300
 that I'm not there makes the I consider 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.040
 that I am still doing the 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.660
 synchronie plates the classes 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.430
 to see no trunk but 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.130
 it can be really handy 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:03.180
 when you do that with your sim or 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.180
 with your friends three months to take 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.720
 for roba to make plans we 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.729
 you see the body that usually 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.729
 the ball there is not there 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.440
 so that means it's useless I'm 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.430
 okay in the sense that you will 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.130
 not do the mission you are going to be 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.180
 obliged to make the plates but but 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.970
 but it's cool in the sense that you 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.280
 look at it confess I have my help I 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.160
 I'm going to hire because I do not have 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.780
 not yet of my two friends 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.850
 Finally, what is it that a friend who has 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.840
 good level after others his club and 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.840
 the 25th so it's not enough 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.810
 you see the way already I can already there 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.300
 what are you going to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.720
 it's handy to make a plan 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.080
 look for the hideouts and there is even a 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.550
 I found a good hideout 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.110
 after that I think she said 'I have 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.440
 hundreds of hundred people who one 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.650
 had to find and here I am so my 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.650
 board 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.540
 you shame it is safe 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.959
 in fact you just got up there 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.829
 he goes up here you jump tiercÃ© you 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.840
 go up there 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:34.019
 and then after that you have a view 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:37.340
 especially over there that changes so 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.340
 then you go there 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.829
 see tech 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.049
 I go up and here and there there are 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.250
 enemies that this way down there do rule 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.079
 watch out for the goblins who are going 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.129
 turn on the platforms there what 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.840
 yes there are goblin goblins that are 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.010
 there in all platforms there 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.549
 down we can not go it's 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.139
 hard map 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.970
 so you can the room can be 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.510
 calm a good thing that this camp a 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.280
 good hideout where there you have access to 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.519
 at spo again sharply spawn they 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.049
 the lean minotaurs that's all you 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.950
 maybe have a view I do not know I 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.569
 have not done yet I do not know you 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.849
 are a small town france on the 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:20.190
 template a view on so the flaws to 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:22.440
 protect and so that's after you and 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.830
 you can find or agent up there the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.690
 bar after there are plenty of lacan of two 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.699
 positions like that you and there it can 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.210
 allow to do that next by 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:45.680
 example or there 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:46.940
 I want to do and there too watts with this 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.400
 system it can be a good hideout 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.490
 you have to climb the Templar 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.069
 from here against the person who is there 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.960
 to protect a little bit the stuff that 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.099
 is there but not too much can sit there can 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.110
 disassemble anyway the guys who go 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.750
 to go through there so it can be convenient 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.880
 he put one there one on one here 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.650
 I mean only one other hideout you 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.349
 put it here after that it's your 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.000
 organization if you who see years but 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:19.030
 that's it and that's what's good 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.030
 what do you see when you die and well 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:26.360
 resuscitation post it in good now ready 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.940
 to appear with wave or respawn is here 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.550
 in that in the mode likes to explore a 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.620
 little in the little glitch for the portal 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.590
 to spy on here so it's really 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.080
 you can you can do some 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.479
 simulations to rig all the flight so that 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.870
 can be really handy and we 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:48.590
 in fact I found it all at the end 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.849
 last night in with a friend playing and 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.949
 I thought it might be 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.560
 nice to do a little video so 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.780
 so here you are and then even you 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.259
 also master the sahel knows this 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.250
 tokyo hideout there you can destroy 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:07.099
 the oracles here there I believe it 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.610
 ba concerned as there is one that 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.139
 is there low 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.530
 in short, you still have a 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.370
 good view on almost all oracles 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.900
 some with the three plants there 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.219
 you have you have a view of all the 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.979
 oracles and so 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:22.070
 and therefore So here it is rather bah 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.139
 practice so there it's going to be everything 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.139
 for me, I tell you 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:30.460
 the next one for another video and 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.460
 charles everyone
