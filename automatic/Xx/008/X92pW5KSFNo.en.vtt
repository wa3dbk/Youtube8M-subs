00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hello I'm ibx toy cat and today I'm

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.800 
hello I'm ibx toy cat and today I'm
going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.700> be<00:00:02.760> tackling<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.210> fairly

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
going to be tackling the fairly

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.269 
going to be tackling the fairly
difficult<00:00:04.230> question<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.650> how<00:00:04.890> many<00:00:05.040> diamonds

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
difficult question of how many diamonds

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.130 
difficult question of how many diamonds
do<00:00:05.640> you<00:00:05.700> get<00:00:05.879> on<00:00:05.910> average<00:00:06.240> for<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> Minecraft

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
do you get on average for a Minecraft

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.500 
do you get on average for a Minecraft
Xbox<00:00:07.259> 60<00:00:07.919> or<00:00:08.099> PS<00:00:08.580> free<00:00:08.910> world

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
Xbox 60 or PS free world

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.900 
Xbox 60 or PS free world
so<00:00:09.830> because<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> worlds<00:00:11.250> on<00:00:11.340> Minecraft<00:00:11.759> Xbox

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
so because the worlds on Minecraft Xbox

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.789 
so because the worlds on Minecraft Xbox
60<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.540> ps3<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.019> console<00:00:13.290> versions<00:00:13.559> are

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
60 and ps3 the console versions are

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.829 
60 and ps3 the console versions are
finite<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.580> means<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.389> there<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
finite that means because there is a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.420 
finite that means because there is a
finite<00:00:16.260> number<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.619> diamonds<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.220> every

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
finite number of diamonds and every

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.010 
finite number of diamonds and every
overall<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:18.119> since<00:00:18.300> terms<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.720> rarest

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
overall but since terms of the rarest

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.420 
overall but since terms of the rarest
all<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.350> question<00:00:19.680> comes<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
all this question comes up a lot and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.769 
all this question comes up a lot and
there<00:00:20.789> most<00:00:21.150> people<00:00:21.359> haven't<00:00:21.480> been<00:00:21.570> able<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
there most people haven't been able to

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.810 
there most people haven't been able to
enact<00:00:22.020> your<00:00:22.199> answer<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.189> figured<00:00:23.490> because

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
enact your answer but I figured because

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.000 
enact your answer but I figured because
I've<00:00:24.210> given<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.570> response<00:00:24.930> before<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.859> do

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
I've given a response before I just do

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.710 
I've given a response before I just do
the<00:00:26.130> full-on<00:00:26.369> Maps<00:00:26.730> go<00:00:27.210> through<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the full-on Maps go through all the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.839 
the full-on Maps go through all the
calculations<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.439> took<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.830> work<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
calculations that took and work out the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.279 
calculations that took and work out the
number<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.210> that's<00:00:30.390> why<00:00:30.539> I've<00:00:30.630> got<00:00:30.750> today<00:00:31.019> so

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
number and that's why I've got today so

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.049 
number and that's why I've got today so
as<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.920> said<00:00:32.070> lots<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.340> youtubers<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.820> come<00:00:32.969> up

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
as I said lots of youtubers have come up

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.190 
as I said lots of youtubers have come up
rough<00:00:33.270> numbers<00:00:33.540> saying<00:00:33.719> oh<00:00:33.870> there's<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
rough numbers saying oh there's a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.600 
rough numbers saying oh there's a
thousand<00:00:34.590> diamonds<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.100> seed<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
thousand diamonds on this seed because I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340 
thousand diamonds on this seed because I
found<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.540> app<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.200> this

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
found some in my app you know just this

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.440 
found some in my app you know just this
cave<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:38.940> completely

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
cave and that is not actually completely

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.700 
cave and that is not actually completely
accurate<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.350> complete

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
accurate it's just a complete

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
accurate it's just a complete
fabrication<00:00:40.860> although<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.969> are<00:00:42.090> looking

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
fabrication although if you are looking

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.910 
fabrication although if you are looking
for<00:00:42.450> lots<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> diamonds<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.320> seed<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
for lots of diamonds on one seed and you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.500 
for lots of diamonds on one seed and you
want<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.550> know<00:00:44.579> find<00:00:45.030> them<00:00:45.180> back<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
want to just you know find them back and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
want to just you know find them back and
get<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.780> pepper<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.739> got<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> seed<00:00:47.190> where

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
get my pepper I have got a seed where

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.950 
get my pepper I have got a seed where
I've<00:00:47.370> got<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> hundred<00:00:47.910> diamonds<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I've got a hundred diamonds with all the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.880 
I've got a hundred diamonds with all the
coordinates<00:00:49.320> they'll<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
coordinates they'll be in the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.529 
coordinates they'll be in the
description<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.090> might<00:00:51.239> want<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.390> check

description that you might want to check

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.729 
description that you might want to check
out<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.809> you're<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.050> looking<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.379> lots<00:00:52.469> most

out if you're just looking for lots most

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.529 
out if you're just looking for lots most
diamonds<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.879> don't<00:00:54.210> want<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> find

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
diamonds but if you don't want to find

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
diamonds but if you don't want to find
out<00:00:54.690> how<00:00:54.870> many<00:00:54.930> diamonds<00:00:55.289> run<00:00:55.500> each<00:00:55.590> seed<00:00:55.829> so

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
out how many diamonds run each seed so

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.830 
out how many diamonds run each seed so
you<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.340> impress<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.090> friends<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:57.809> just

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you can impress your friends or just

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
you can impress your friends or just
have<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> fun<00:00:58.379> statistic<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.340> what<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.609> all

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
have a fun statistic that's what we all

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.250 
have a fun statistic that's what we all
can't<00:01:00.030> stay<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.300> first<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> all<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.020> need<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
can't stay so first of all you need to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.479 
can't stay so first of all you need to
know<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> chunk<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> before<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.430> go

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
know what a chunk is before we can go

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.420 
know what a chunk is before we can go
any<00:01:02.520> further<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:03.059> chunk<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.750> 16<00:01:04.260> by<00:01:04.559> 16<00:01:04.619> block

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
any further a chunk is a 16 by 16 block

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.929 
any further a chunk is a 16 by 16 block
of<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> Minecraft<00:01:07.590> world<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:08.430> work<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.820> in

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
of the Minecraft world they work in in

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
of the Minecraft world they work in in
multiples<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> 16<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> go<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.290> prove

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
multiples of 16 so if you go to prove

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500 
multiples of 16 so if you go to prove
multiple<00:01:10.920> 16<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.490> your<00:01:11.610> map<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.970> instance<00:01:12.240> -

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
multiple 16 on your map for instance -

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.899 
multiple 16 on your map for instance -
400<00:01:13.110> 360<00:01:13.890> -<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.280> trust<00:01:14.490> me<00:01:14.640> these<00:01:14.760> are

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
400 360 - just trust me these are

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
400 360 - just trust me these are
multiple<00:01:15.240> 16<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.439> go<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.710> waste

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
multiple 16 and then you go with waste

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.710 
multiple 16 and then you go with waste
the<00:01:17.070> edge<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.119> chunk<00:01:18.450> that's

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the edge here this is a chunk that's

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.330 
the edge here this is a chunk that's
inside<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.380> cluster<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> glowstone<00:01:20.130> store

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
inside this cluster the glowstone store

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859 
inside this cluster the glowstone store
the<00:01:20.400> chunk<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.090> everything<00:01:21.479> inside<00:01:21.720> it

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the chunk but the everything inside it

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.080 
the chunk but the everything inside it
is<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.799> basically<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> how<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> entire

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
is and basically this is how the entire

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.700 
is and basically this is how the entire
games<00:01:24.330> work<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.840> how<00:01:24.990> multiplayer<00:01:25.500> works

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
games work it's how multiplayer works

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
games work it's how multiplayer works
you'll<00:01:25.890> notice<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.310> load<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.670> chunks<00:01:27.000> like

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you'll notice your load in chunks like

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.819 
you'll notice your load in chunks like
if<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.869> was<00:01:27.990> playing<00:01:28.110> multiplayer<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.710> was

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
if I was playing multiplayer if this was

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.590 
if I was playing multiplayer if this was
a<00:01:28.860> back<00:01:29.100> wall<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.460> suddenly<00:01:29.640> load<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.240> this

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
a back wall it suddenly load all of this

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.080 
a back wall it suddenly load all of this
16<00:01:30.990> by<00:01:31.079> 16<00:01:31.140> area<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:32.670> that's<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
16 by 16 area because that's just the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.780 
16 by 16 area because that's just the
way<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.329> game<00:01:33.360> works<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.549> it's<00:01:35.549> used<00:01:35.759> for

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
way the game works and it's used for

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.580 
way the game works and it's used for
biomes<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.630> listens<00:01:36.930> bribes<00:01:37.170> it's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
biomes because it's listens bribes it's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.260 
biomes because it's listens bribes it's
used<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> whole<00:01:37.950> bunch<00:01:38.280> things<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:39.060> mine

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
used for a whole bunch things like mine

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.330 
used for a whole bunch things like mine
shops<00:01:39.479> etc<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.680> basically<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.159> how<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
shops etc and basically it's how the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
shops etc and basically it's how the
game<00:01:41.460> functions<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.290> how<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
game functions because it's just how it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.399 
game functions because it's just how it
does<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.950> basically<00:01:45.140> we're<00:01:46.140> gonna<00:01:46.229> work

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
does it and basically we're gonna work

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.749 
does it and basically we're gonna work
out<00:01:46.590> how<00:01:46.710> many<00:01:46.770> diamonds<00:01:47.070> each<00:01:47.340> chunk<00:01:47.549> has

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
out how many diamonds each chunk has

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.399 
out how many diamonds each chunk has
then<00:01:48.240> how<00:01:48.420> many<00:01:48.479> chunks<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> lot

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
then how many chunks there is in the lot

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
then how many chunks there is in the lot
so<00:01:49.590> basically<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.610> Minecraft<00:01:51.060> Wiki<00:01:51.210> says

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
so basically the Minecraft Wiki says

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.090 
so basically the Minecraft Wiki says
there<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.960> three<00:01:52.200> point<00:01:52.470> zero<00:01:52.530> nine<00:01:53.070> seven

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
there is three point zero nine seven

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
there is three point zero nine seven
diamonds<00:01:53.790> per<00:01:54.090> chuck<00:01:54.329> however<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.049> is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
diamonds per chuck however this is

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.840 
diamonds per chuck however this is
slightly<00:01:55.649> incorrect<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.219> console<00:01:56.520> versions

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
slightly incorrect for console versions

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
slightly incorrect for console versions
because<00:01:57.060> there<00:01:57.450> was<00:01:57.689> written<00:01:57.960> update<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.560> PCs

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
because there was written update on PCs

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.280 
because there was written update on PCs
decrease<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.520> number<00:01:59.790> from<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:01.049> four

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
decrease the number from you know four

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.749 
decrease the number from you know four
point<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.680> three<00:02:01.829> three<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.340> three<00:02:02.549> point

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
point one three three to three point

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.550 
point one three three to three point
nine<00:02:02.909> zero<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> console<00:02:03.990> versions<00:02:04.290> still

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
nine zero so the console versions still

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.130 
nine zero so the console versions still
have<00:02:04.740> 4.1<00:02:05.490> free--free<00:02:05.880> dimes<00:02:06.210> per<00:02:06.479> ton<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.930> mean

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
have 4.1 free--free dimes per ton I mean

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.839 
have 4.1 free--free dimes per ton I mean
if<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.320> dug<00:02:07.530> down<00:02:07.740> right<00:02:08.039> now<00:02:08.220> all<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> way<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
if I dug down right now all the way to a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.300 
if I dug down right now all the way to a
y<00:02:09.330> equals<00:02:09.690> twelve<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.289> off<00:02:10.410> area<00:02:10.679> on

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
y equals twelve that's off area on

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.730 
y equals twelve that's off area on
average<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.910> would<00:02:12.060> find<00:02:12.300> roughly<00:02:12.750> four

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
average I would find roughly four

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
average I would find roughly four
point<00:02:13.950> one<00:02:14.160> free<00:02:14.400> free<00:02:14.580> games<00:02:14.790> per<00:02:15.030> chunk<00:02:15.240> of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
point one free free games per chunk of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.790 
point one free free games per chunk of
course<00:02:15.600> can't<00:02:15.810> find<00:02:16.050> four<00:02:16.230> point<00:02:16.410> one<00:02:16.650> three

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
course can't find four point one three

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.920 
course can't find four point one three
three<00:02:16.890> diamonds<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.330> know<00:02:18.420> an<00:02:18.570> average

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
three diamonds but you know an average

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.330 
three diamonds but you know an average
so<00:02:19.140> some<00:02:19.320> you'll<00:02:19.500> find<00:02:19.710> zero<00:02:19.950> some<00:02:20.220> you'll

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
so some you'll find zero some you'll

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.310 
so some you'll find zero some you'll
find<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:20.820> some<00:02:21.060> you'll<00:02:21.240> find<00:02:21.480> ten<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:22.200> they

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
find for some you'll find ten but they

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.720 
find for some you'll find ten but they
average<00:02:22.710> out<00:02:22.890> that's<00:02:23.160> how<00:02:23.220> I've<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.580> worked

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
average out that's how I've just worked

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.820 
average out that's how I've just worked
three<00:02:24.000> four<00:02:24.240> point<00:02:24.420> one<00:02:24.750> three<00:02:24.990> three<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.740> now

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
three four point one three three so now

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.680 
three four point one three three so now
we<00:02:25.890> have<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.250> information<00:02:26.490> from<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.480> wiki

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
we have this information from the wiki

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.090 
we have this information from the wiki
and<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.930> actually<00:02:28.140> correct<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.530> now<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:28.950> need

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
and we actually correct it now we need

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.590 
and we actually correct it now we need
to<00:02:29.160> work<00:02:29.310> out<00:02:29.460> how<00:02:29.610> many<00:02:29.670> chunks<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.240> as<00:02:30.360> per

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
to work out how many chunks are as per

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.420 
to work out how many chunks are as per
world<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.560> pretty<00:02:32.250> difficult

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
world so this is a pretty difficult

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
world so this is a pretty difficult
calculation<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.510> basically<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:33.930> need<00:02:34.110> snow

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
calculation but basically we need snow

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.480 
calculation but basically we need snow
you<00:02:34.350> need<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> work<00:02:34.710> out<00:02:34.800> how<00:02:34.980> big<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.370> world

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
you need to work out how big the world

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.780 
you need to work out how big the world
is

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
is

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.360 
is
so<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.320> fun<00:02:37.740> fact<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.010> most<00:02:38.130> people

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
so what a fun fact that most people

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.010 
so what a fun fact that most people
don't<00:02:38.490> actually<00:02:38.580> know<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.030> people<00:02:39.660> think<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
don't actually know is people think the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.230 
don't actually know is people think the
world<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.260> 1024<00:02:41.040> by<00:02:41.160> thousand<00:02:41.550> 24<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.120> it's

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
world is 1024 by thousand 24 but it's

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.350 
world is 1024 by thousand 24 but it's
actually<00:02:42.690> 432<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:43.770> that's<00:02:43.980> 432<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.210> goes

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
actually 432 but that's 432 but it goes

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.780 
actually 432 but that's 432 but it goes
both<00:02:45.540> directions<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.170> that's<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.470> 612<00:02:46.920> 864<00:02:47.430> I

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
both directions so that's a 612 864 I

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.280 
both directions so that's a 612 864 I
don't<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.390> where<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> inflation<00:02:48.960> came<00:02:49.110> from

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
don't know where the inflation came from

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.420 
don't know where the inflation came from
but<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.470> used<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.710> believe<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.040> too<00:02:50.190> but

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
but I used to believe it too but

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.550 
but I used to believe it too but
basically<00:02:50.720> if<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.810> went<00:02:51.990> all<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.140> way<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:52.290> there

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
basically if I went all the way up there

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.800 
basically if I went all the way up there
it<00:02:52.710> go<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.920> 432<00:02:53.550> again<00:02:53.820> meaning<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.480> world<00:02:54.630> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
it go to 432 again meaning the world is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.430 
it go to 432 again meaning the world is
862<00:02:55.650> 64<00:02:56.550> by<00:02:56.730> Andrus<00:02:57.090> 64<00:02:57.510> blocks<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:58.200> can't

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
862 64 by Andrus 64 blocks you can't

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.660 
862 64 by Andrus 64 blocks you can't
actually<00:02:58.590> use<00:02:58.740> some<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> blocks<00:02:59.520> each

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
actually use some of the blocks each

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.040 
actually use some of the blocks each
side<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.060> concealed<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.510> gets<00:03:00.750> stuck<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:01.020> a

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
side is concealed it gets stuck in a

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.780 
side is concealed it gets stuck in a
wall<00:03:01.230> here<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.560> also<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.160> can't<00:03:02.520> actually

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
wall here and also you can't actually

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.810 
wall here and also you can't actually
use<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:04.440> very<00:03:04.620> corner<00:03:04.830> box<00:03:04.980> there<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:05.760> we

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
use the very corner box there but we

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.370 
use the very corner box there but we
will<00:03:05.910> assume<00:03:06.000> we're<00:03:06.780> working<00:03:07.080> at<00:03:07.170> how<00:03:07.230> many

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
will assume we're working at how many

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.930 
will assume we're working at how many
diamonds<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.160> corner<00:03:08.370> box<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.610> can't<00:03:08.760> get

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
diamonds on the corner box you can't get

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.880 
diamonds on the corner box you can't get
to<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.720> assume<00:03:09.990> that<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.260> can't<00:03:10.470> access

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
to so just assume that you can't access

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.280 
to so just assume that you can't access
like<00:03:11.190> point<00:03:11.550> zero<00:03:12.180> zero<00:03:12.270> one<00:03:12.660> percent<00:03:12.990> of

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
like point zero zero one percent of

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.080 
like point zero zero one percent of
these<00:03:13.380> diamonds<00:03:13.830> unfortunately<00:03:14.370> I've

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
these diamonds unfortunately I've

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.640 
these diamonds unfortunately I've
actually<00:03:15.240> seen<00:03:15.540> someone<00:03:16.080> have<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.230> world<00:03:16.470> like

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
actually seen someone have a world like

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.050 
actually seen someone have a world like
that<00:03:16.680> where<00:03:17.040> they<00:03:17.160> can<00:03:17.370> go<00:03:17.490> in<00:03:17.610> their<00:03:17.730> diamonds

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
that where they can go in their diamonds

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.880 
that where they can go in their diamonds
it's<00:03:18.180> kind<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.510> sad<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:19.020> it's<00:03:19.170> kind<00:03:19.830> of

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
it's kind of sad but it's kind of

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.530 
it's kind of sad but it's kind of
amusing<00:03:20.100> at<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> same<00:03:20.460> time<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:20.940> we<00:03:21.360> know

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
amusing at the same time so we know

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.020 
amusing at the same time so we know
there<00:03:21.780> are<00:03:21.810> it's<00:03:22.290> 864<00:03:23.100> but<00:03:23.220> engine<00:03:23.340> 64<00:03:23.910> blocks

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
there are it's 864 but engine 64 blocks

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.330 
there are it's 864 but engine 64 blocks
wide<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.810> divide<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.230> into<00:03:25.350> chunks<00:03:25.680> you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
wide we divide that into chunks you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.690 
wide we divide that into chunks you
divide<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.610> noir<00:03:26.880> 64<00:03:27.330> by<00:03:27.510> 16<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.680> get<00:03:28.830> 54

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
divide a noir 64 by 16 and you get 54

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.420 
divide a noir 64 by 16 and you get 54
which<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.590> then<00:03:31.590> goes<00:03:31.740> in<00:03:31.860> both<00:03:31.980> directions<00:03:32.280> so

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
which is then goes in both directions so

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.850 
which is then goes in both directions so
this<00:03:32.670> way<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.210> way<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:34.080> if<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.590> then

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
this way and that way and if you then

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.190 
this way and that way and if you then
work<00:03:35.280> out<00:03:35.460> with<00:03:35.610> this<00:03:35.670> 54<00:03:36.120> by<00:03:36.300> 54<00:03:36.690> chunks<00:03:37.050> that

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
work out with this 54 by 54 chunks that

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.720 
work out with this 54 by 54 chunks that
means<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.860> world<00:03:38.100> has<00:03:38.280> 200<00:03:39.980> 2916<00:03:41.010> chunks<00:03:41.580> I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
means the world has 200 2916 chunks I

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.040 
means the world has 200 2916 chunks I
just<00:03:42.120> follow<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.360> master<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.720> trust<00:03:42.930> this

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.380 
you can get anywhere between like five
old<00:04:16.770> temps<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.459> bubble<00:04:17.730> below<00:04:18.030> this<00:04:18.180> but

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
old temps and a bubble below this but

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.330 
old temps and a bubble below this but
that's<00:04:18.480> going<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> be<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.989> rough<00:04:19.200> number<00:04:19.620> so

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
that's going to be the rough number so

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.620 
that's going to be the rough number so
if<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.459> ever<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:20.850> know<00:04:20.880> fought<00:04:21.180> your<00:04:21.330> worlds

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
if you ever you know fought your worlds

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.969 
if you ever you know fought your worlds
running<00:04:21.810> up<00:04:21.900> diamonds<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.440> probably<00:04:22.800> have

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
running up diamonds you probably have

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.770 
running up diamonds you probably have
12,000<00:04:23.729> diamonds<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.090> just<00:04:24.300> haven't<00:04:24.630> seen

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
12,000 diamonds you just haven't seen

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.840 
12,000 diamonds you just haven't seen
yet<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.680> next<00:04:25.830> we're<00:04:26.010> gonna<00:04:26.100> cover<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.700> little

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
yet so next we're gonna cover the little

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.500 
yet so next we're gonna cover the little
more<00:04:26.940> complex

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
more complex

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.260 
more complex
so<00:04:27.840> basically<00:04:28.170> although<00:04:29.100> there's<00:04:29.370> 12050<00:04:30.000> one

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
so basically although there's 12050 one

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.210 
so basically although there's 12050 one
diamond<00:04:30.600> or<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.290> can<00:04:31.470> actually<00:04:31.560> get<00:04:31.800> multiple

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
diamond or you can actually get multiple

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.710 
diamond or you can actually get multiple
diamonds<00:04:32.670> per<00:04:32.850> diamond<00:04:33.090> door<00:04:33.390> as<00:04:33.570> you'll

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
diamonds per diamond door as you'll

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.960 
diamonds per diamond door as you'll
probably<00:04:33.930> aware<00:04:34.230> if<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.010> use<00:04:35.370> something

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
probably aware if you use something

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.250 
probably aware if you use something
called<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.150> fortunate<00:04:36.480> challenge<00:04:36.840> I'm<00:04:36.960> sure

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
called a fortunate challenge I'm sure

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.780 
called a fortunate challenge I'm sure
you're<00:04:37.410> all<00:04:37.470> familiar<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.770> bit<00:04:37.920> basically<00:04:38.700> what

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
you're all familiar a bit basically what

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.730 
you're all familiar a bit basically what
this<00:04:38.910> does<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.330> when<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:39.600> mine<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:40.200> diamond

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
this does is when you mine a diamond

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.370 
this does is when you mine a diamond
block<00:04:40.890> it<00:04:41.190> gives<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.960> rough<00:04:42.960> chance<00:04:43.200> of

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
block it gives you a rough chance of

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.170 
block it gives you a rough chance of
getting<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:43.800> three<00:04:44.220> or<00:04:44.400> even<00:04:44.430> four<00:04:44.640> diamonds

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
getting to three or even four diamonds

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.480 
getting to three or even four diamonds
per<00:04:45.480> block<00:04:45.720> giving<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.470> an<00:04:46.530> average<00:04:46.710> 2.5

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
per block giving you an average 2.5

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.010 
per block giving you an average 2.5
divers<00:04:47.820> because<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.030> can<00:04:48.120> get<00:04:48.240> one<00:04:48.420> two<00:04:48.690> three

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
divers because you can get one two three

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.140 
divers because you can get one two three
or<00:04:49.140> four<00:04:49.350> as<00:04:49.800> then<00:04:50.100> if<00:04:50.190> we<00:04:50.310> multiply<00:04:50.490> twelve

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
or four as then if we multiply twelve

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.940 
or four as then if we multiply twelve

by<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.820> 2.5<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.540> get<00:04:54.660> with<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.840> fortune

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
by the 2.5 you get with a fortune

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.870 
by the 2.5 you get with a fortune
pickaxe<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.770> course<00:04:55.980> there<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.250> luck<00:04:56.490> but<00:04:56.760> it's

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
pickaxe of course there is luck but it's

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.590 
pickaxe of course there is luck but it's
gonna<00:04:57.060> average<00:04:57.390> out<00:04:57.540> to<00:04:57.570> 2.5<00:04:58.110> this<00:04:58.860> gives<00:04:59.190> us

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
gonna average out to 2.5 this gives us

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.660 
gonna average out to 2.5 this gives us
thirty<00:05:00.600> thousand<00:05:01.290> one<00:05:01.590> hundred<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.040> twenty

of<00:05:06.750> course<00:05:06.990> we'll<00:05:07.350> just<00:05:07.530> round<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.800> up

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
of course we'll just round that up

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.220 
of course we'll just round that up
around<00:05:08.370> that<00:05:08.520> down<00:05:08.700> to<00:05:08.880> thirty<00:05:09.420> thousand<00:05:09.870> one

hundred and twenty nine diamonds which

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.890 
hundred and twenty nine diamonds which
is<00:05:12.960> an<00:05:13.200> absolutely<00:05:13.740> insane<00:05:14.520> amounts<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:15.510> the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
go up down by ten percent but the max

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.690 
go up down by ten percent but the max
amount<00:05:19.620> of<00:05:19.770> diamonds<00:05:19.890> you<00:05:20.130> can<00:05:20.430> get<00:05:20.580> an

installed the entire game just to
collect<00:05:28.710> these<00:05:28.890> you<00:05:29.370> could<00:05:29.640> have<00:05:29.850> thirty

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
collect these you could have thirty

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.120 
collect these you could have thirty

thousand one hundred and twenty nine

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.580 
thousand one hundred and twenty nine
diamonds<00:05:32.670> in<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.150> survival<00:05:33.570> world<00:05:33.600> so<00:05:34.470> what

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
diamonds in a survival world so what

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.840 
diamonds in a survival world so what
does<00:05:34.680> that<00:05:34.710> actually<00:05:34.950> look<00:05:35.130> like<00:05:35.280> so<00:05:35.700> if<00:05:35.820> you

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
does that actually look like so if you

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.370 
does that actually look like so if you
put<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.180> diamonds<00:05:36.540> into<00:05:36.780> diamond<00:05:37.140> blocks

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
put the diamonds into diamond blocks

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.640 
put the diamonds into diamond blocks
these<00:05:37.890> ones<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.480> then<00:05:39.480> you<00:05:39.720> are<00:05:39.870> them<00:05:40.620> in

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
these ones and then you are them in

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.920 
these ones and then you are them in
stacks<00:05:40.920> 264<00:05:41.580> then<00:05:42.030> store<00:05:42.390> them<00:05:42.510> in<00:05:42.600> a<00:05:42.660> chest

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
stacks 264 then store them in a chest

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.170 
stacks 264 then store them in a chest
the<00:05:43.170> chest<00:05:43.200> would<00:05:43.650> look<00:05:43.860> something<00:05:44.100> like<00:05:44.400> this

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
the chest would look something like this

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.840 
the chest would look something like this
I<00:05:45.720> actually<00:05:46.140> calculate<00:05:46.650> this<00:05:46.800> using<00:05:47.460> some

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
I actually calculate this using some

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.910 
I actually calculate this using some
pretty<00:05:48.270> difficult<00:05:48.960> calculation<00:05:49.620> but<00:05:49.770> yeah

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
pretty difficult calculation but yeah

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.340 
pretty difficult calculation but yeah
you<00:05:49.980> get<00:05:50.250> this<00:05:50.490> many<00:05:50.790> blocks<00:05:51.180> of<00:05:51.360> diamonds<00:05:51.840> and

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
you get this many blocks of diamonds and

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.960 
you get this many blocks of diamonds and
then<00:05:52.470> you<00:05:52.530> get<00:05:52.650> 19<00:05:53.040> and<00:05:53.190> then<00:05:53.250> five<00:05:53.490> left<00:05:53.670> over

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
then you get 19 and then five left over

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.970 
then you get 19 and then five left over
so<00:05:54.570> basically<00:05:54.840> in<00:05:54.990> a<00:05:55.080> realistic<00:05:55.320> world<00:05:55.710> you

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
so basically in a realistic world you

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.650 
so basically in a realistic world you
can't<00:05:56.310> get<00:05:56.550> more<00:05:56.760> than<00:05:56.820> a<00:05:57.120> chest<00:05:57.450> full<00:05:57.600> of

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
can't get more than a chest full of

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.330 
can't get more than a chest full of
blocks<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:58.020> diamonds<00:05:58.440> if<00:05:58.890> you<00:05:58.980> want<00:05:59.100> to<00:05:59.160> prove

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
blocks of diamonds if you want to prove

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.380 
blocks of diamonds if you want to prove
that<00:05:59.400> songs<00:05:59.760> duplicate<00:06:00.180> although

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
that songs duplicate although

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.760 
that songs duplicate although
realistically<00:06:00.870> if<00:06:00.960> they<00:06:01.050> have<00:06:01.200> Harper<00:06:01.560> chest

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
realistically if they have Harper chest

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.500 
realistically if they have Harper chest
they<00:06:01.920> probably<00:06:02.100> have<00:06:02.340> then<00:06:03.150> if<00:06:03.240> they<00:06:03.360> have

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
they probably have then if they have

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.330 
they probably have then if they have
more<00:06:03.750> mature<00:06:04.080> full<00:06:04.290> of<00:06:04.350> diamonds<00:06:04.560> it's<00:06:04.980> fake

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
more mature full of diamonds it's fake

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.700 
more mature full of diamonds it's fake
so<00:06:05.390> fun<00:06:06.390> fact<00:06:06.660> for<00:06:06.900> you

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
so fun fact for you

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.980 
so fun fact for you
you<00:06:08.610> can<00:06:08.760> roughly<00:06:09.120> fill<00:06:09.390> a<00:06:09.540> chest<00:06:09.840> with

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
you can roughly fill a chest with

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.530 
you can roughly fill a chest with
diamond<00:06:10.320> blocks<00:06:10.560> with<00:06:11.220> if<00:06:11.520> you<00:06:11.760> mind<00:06:12.210> every

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
diamond blocks with if you mind every

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.880 
diamond blocks with if you mind every
diamond<00:06:12.840> in<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:12.960> world<00:06:13.020> of<00:06:13.260> fortune<00:06:13.560> pickaxe

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
diamond in the world of fortune pickaxe

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.830 
diamond in the world of fortune pickaxe
so<00:06:14.580> yeah<00:06:14.700> that's<00:06:14.940> how<00:06:15.030> many<00:06:15.240> diamonds<00:06:15.570> you<00:06:15.690> can

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
so yeah that's how many diamonds you can

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.530 
so yeah that's how many diamonds you can
have<00:06:16.020> in<00:06:16.200> a<00:06:16.410> minecraft<00:06:16.950> xbox<00:06:17.370> sixty<00:06:17.700> /ps<00:06:18.300> free

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
have in a minecraft xbox sixty /ps free

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.450 
have in a minecraft xbox sixty /ps free
world<00:06:18.750> if<00:06:18.960> you<00:06:19.410> were<00:06:19.560> to<00:06:19.740> mind<00:06:19.950> move<00:06:20.100> outlines

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
world if you were to mind move outlines

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.340 
world if you were to mind move outlines
so<00:06:20.760> twelve<00:06:21.060> thousand<00:06:21.420> iron<00:06:21.660> or<00:06:21.810> thirty

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
so twelve thousand iron or thirty

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.970 
so twelve thousand iron or thirty
thousand<00:06:23.040> diamonds<00:06:23.940> potential<00:06:24.660> so<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:25.290> hope

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
thousand diamonds potential so I hope

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.920 
thousand diamonds potential so I hope
