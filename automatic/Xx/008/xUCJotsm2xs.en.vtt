their whatever their warehouse didn't
have<00:00:29.340> anymore<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> upgrade<00:00:30.449> mean<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
have anymore so the upgrade mean to the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.359 
have anymore so the upgrade mean to the
performance<00:00:31.380> mouse<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.130> sent<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
performance mouse and they just sent it

is<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.059> doesn't<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.780> wheel<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
is that doesn't have that wheel on the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.610 
is that doesn't have that wheel on the
side<00:00:43.890> which<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.340> use<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.820> lot<00:00:45.469> expose<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
side which I really use a lot expose and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
side which I really use a lot expose and
spaces<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.730> guess<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.030> live<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.300> um

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
spaces but I guess I can live with it um

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.410 
spaces but I guess I can live with it um
I'm<00:00:49.559> plan<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> use<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> lot<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.030> like

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
since my MX revolution dot I invested in

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.040

cradle I guess this is the receiver for
it<00:02:13.430> or<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> desktop<00:02:14.910> receiver<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.750> ever

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.920 
it or a desktop receiver if you ever
wanted<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:18.030> then<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
wanted it and then this is just the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.770

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.250 
design the cable sits above the desks
kind<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.300> their<00:02:24.390> harmony<00:02:24.720> remotes<00:02:25.020> i
