00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
I also think that mario gutierrez is at

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.839 
I also think that mario gutierrez is at
a<00:05:20.330> disadvantage<00:05:20.569> all<00:05:21.139> of<00:05:21.289> a<00:05:21.409> force<00:05:21.680> is<00:05:21.919> he

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
a disadvantage all of a force is he

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.519 
a disadvantage all of a force is he
looks<00:05:23.029> like<00:05:23.149> he<00:05:23.389> wants<00:05:23.839> to<00:05:23.990> run<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:24.349> run<00:05:24.499> and

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.529
