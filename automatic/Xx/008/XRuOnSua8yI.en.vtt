 Hello, I am with FranÃ§ois Doz Tier 1 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.610
 mixologist who will show it in 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.280
 most consumed cocktails in the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.200
 hotel bars the sahwa whiskey so for 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.109
 make the whiskey saute a cocktail 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.210
 very classic of the bar we need 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.970
 of liquid sugar whiskey and juice 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 lemon yellow we will think 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.289
 shaker so for that we're going 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.859
 fill the glass part of the shaker 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.969
 with ice cubes then we will pour 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.969
 406 liters of whiskey 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.940
 then we will place two 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.940
 centilitres of liquid sugar to dose 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 at home know that a plug of 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.559
 bottle any bottle 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.860
 always makes sense so title of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860
 plugs 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.710
 then we will pour 210 liters of 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.710
 yellow lemon juice 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.120
 then just mix the three 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 shaker ingredients for those ci placed 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.680
 pushes them on the glass part for 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.470
 block and mix for 10 to 15 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.300
 seconds 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.550
 little trick as soon as the condensation 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.260
 appears on the shaker is that the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.540
 cocktail is cool to serve this 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.460
 are the ice cubes 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.009
 we use a bar strainer that 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.390
 will hold the ice cubes in the shaker and 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.690
 let pass only the part 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.690
 liquid 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.790
 if you do not have a strainer at the 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.410
 house you can also blocked the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:52.130
 ice cubes by turning the glass to mix 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.869
 then pour this for you at home 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.360
 a tip that does not cost anything but who 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:02.000
 always impresses people we 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.909
 let's cut a straw in half he has 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.370
 glued to the edge of the glass by rubbing it 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.979
 slightly against the party towards the 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.180
 frost will act with the plastic what 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.890
 will allow us to stick the straw to 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.630
 green and you will always have the facts 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.519
 she catches booby from someone who 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.549
 will try to drink straw in success 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.549
 guaranteed
