00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.786
 Here we go! Tamagotchi! 

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.116
 Yah-tchi! 

00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:15.016
 Mrs. Perfect's birthday! 

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.886
 Okay everyone, we go over the plan again! 

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:22.386
 We have to find the perfect gift for Mrs. Perfect in the department store! 

00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:23.516
 Let's find the perfect gift! 

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:25.046
 Yes! 

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:27.616
 Are you going to help us, Chamametchi? 

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:30.486
 I said she was better at home, but she wouldn't listen to me. 

00:00:30.586 --> 00:00:32.316
 Yes, I did not listen to Mametchi! 

00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:37.386
 We search the entire store for the perfect gift. Appointment here in 30 minutes! 

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:38.816
 All right! 

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:42.316
 Welcome, children. 

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:51.886
 Flowers would be the perfect gift for Mrs. Perfect! 

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:57.546
 I think sports gear would be a good gift! 

00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:58.686
 Me too. 

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:03.686
 I think I'm taking a nap. 

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:07.446
 We are looking for a gift, oh yeah, yeah, yeah! 

00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:14.046
 Look! Yah-tchi! 

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:18.116
 I think tasty desserts would be a great gift-tchi. 

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.946
 I bet she would like a vacuum cleaner! 

00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:23.186
 One of those, please! 

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:24.346
 And this one! 

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:26.086
 And this one too! 

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:27.846
 Oh, and that too! 

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:30.886
 Why do I have the impression that Makiko is just shopping for himself? 

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:33.986
 Okay everyone, what is the result? Someone a good idea? 

00:01:34.016 --> 00:01:36.946
 She would probably love a new electric guitar! 

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:38.486
 Or maybe flowers? 

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.816
 You can never be wrong with a collection of sports equipment! 

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:42.486
 Agreement. 

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:44.786
 You can always use more cleaning supplies! 

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:47.986
 Donuts and cakes and candies are the perfect gift tchi! 

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:51.186
 Designer stuff would suit Mrs. Perfect the best! 

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:53.416
 You say something like that! Oh yeah! That sounds good. I do not know... 

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:57.986
 Can everyone be quiet for a minute !? 

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.786
 I think we've overlooked something very important ... 

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:03.416
 Something very important? 

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:05.846
 Yes! Do you still remember our budget ?! 

00:02:08.016 --> 00:02:10.746
 We really don't have that much money to spend on a gift. 

00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:12.816
 So we can't buy anything here ... 

00:02:12.886 --> 00:02:15.146
 Now we will never find a gift-tchi. 

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:20.586
 I have an idea for a gift and it costs us nothing! 

00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:23.186
 Huh ??? 

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.246
 Happy birthday, Mrs. Perfect! 

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:33.386
 You are so nice ... 

00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:35.946
 Really thanks! 

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.086
 That ended well! 

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:38.016
 Yep! 

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:44.246
 This is so perfect! The most perfect gift I have ever received!
