 Dear friends , Cristian 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.959
 Duke of the page is Frank Alex 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.750
 dotcom if they have not done so far 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:11.940
 please subscribe I know you help us 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.920
 much to the page to keep us in 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.910
 contact with you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.010
 the theme of this video is carbohydrates 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.180
 that have insulin reaction in the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.520
 blood 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.400
 not all carbohydrates have the 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.720
 same reaction this video is going to be very 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.060
 I'm going to tell you why I 'm tortilla 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 like tortillas with all the meals or 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.739
 almost all the meals the tortillas of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.470
 corn are very rich there are multi tortillas 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.640
 grains but a question that always 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.309
 we want to know is how many carbohydrates 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 I should eat if I'm open how many 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 carbohydrates I should eat if I'm 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.660
 preparing me for the stage how many 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.130
 carbohydrates is healthy then one 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.950
 tortilla that is a good idea are 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.300
 tortillas that are low in carbohydrates 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.800
 they sell them promotions 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.830
 special 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.830
 and also the multi summer tortillas 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.820
 but this video has to do with the 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.680
 insulin reaction in the body to 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.259
 through the carbohydrates then by 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.600
 example in this product has a total 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.229
 of 11 grams of carbohydrates 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.409
 says he has zero sugar and says that 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.549
 has seven grams of dietary fiber 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.159
 when we want to calculate 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.799
 carbohydrates we only use those 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.859
 carbohydrates that have a reaction 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.569
 insulin then although this product 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.179
 say you have a total of 11 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:48.319
 carbohydrate we are going to subtract 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:51.229
 the 7 grams of dietary fiber for a 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.590
 new total of 4 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.840
 this product has 4 carbohydrates that 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.649
 they have to do with insulin ie 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.310
 the 7 of dietary fiber we do not care 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:08.599
 we do not count them, we only count the 4 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.709
 that are reaction in your book as 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.900
 this product says it has zero sugar 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.989
 then those four grams of 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.329
 carbohydrates are going to be carbohydrates 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:27.170
 complexes like multi grains like quaker 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:30.500
 not like white sugar, not like noodles or 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.750
 noodles or pasta not like 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.820
 the fries do not like micro bars 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.460
 chocolate those are those are 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.890
 simple carbohydrates the worst 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.660
 carbohydrates that there is or that in 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.660
 actually you can say that there are 3 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.280
 carbohydrate varieties the worst 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.500
 for the body are the sugars 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.420
 simple the medium or neutral ones are of 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.320
 complex sugars or carbohydrates 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.790
 complex and the best but neither is 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.620
 to eat in abundance because if you do not 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.350
 going to spend the life in the bathroom are the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.260
 carbohydrates based on dietary fiber 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.110
 Dietary fiber has no impacts 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.000
 none on insulin 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.890
 I am cristian duque jacques de reis
