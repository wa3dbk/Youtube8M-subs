00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.690 

it<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.840> too<00:01:28.050> much<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> smell<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.980> it

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.550 

yeah<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.760> see<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.840> work<00:01:34.050> really

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
yeah I see that you have to work really

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.430 
yeah I see that you have to work really
fast<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:36.770> so<00:01:37.770> I'm<00:01:37.830> going<00:01:37.980> to<00:01:38.010> speed<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.580> my

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
fast with it so I'm going to speed up my

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:55.690 
fast with it so I'm going to speed up my
blending<00:01:40.440> here

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:04.569 

it<00:01:56.060> feels<00:01:56.600> um<00:01:57.049> quite<00:01:58.009> tacky<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.710> that's<00:02:04.369> just

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
it feels um quite tacky and that's just

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.869 
it feels um quite tacky and that's just
the<00:02:05.060> first<00:02:06.100> layer<00:02:07.100> there<00:02:09.009> which<00:02:10.009> I<00:02:10.220> think<00:02:10.640> will

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
the first layer there which I think will

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.130 
the first layer there which I think will
be<00:02:11.060> good<00:02:11.090> enough<00:02:11.569> I<00:02:11.870> just<00:02:12.080> did<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.349> thin<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:14.140> thin

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
be good enough I just did it thin a thin

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.020 
be good enough I just did it thin a thin
layer<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.470> blended<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.220> really<00:02:19.819> nicely

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
layer so it blended in really nicely

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.270 
layer so it blended in really nicely
although<00:02:20.690> like<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.019> said<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.530> had<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.069> move

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
although like I said I had to move

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.059 
although like I said I had to move
quickly<00:02:22.989> with<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:27.650> seem<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.040> have

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
quickly with it and I seem to have

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.240 
quickly with it and I seem to have
gotten<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.430> perfect<00:02:28.880> match<00:02:29.060> for<00:02:29.530> my<00:02:30.530> skin<00:02:30.950> so

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
gotten a perfect match for my skin so

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.900 
gotten a perfect match for my skin so
that's<00:02:31.459> good<00:02:33.459> cancelled<00:02:34.459> out<00:02:34.579> all<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910
