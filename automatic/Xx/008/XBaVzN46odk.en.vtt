00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.000
 What does a reversal bar look like and what is it? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.860
 Let's start with the bull reversal bar. 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.240
 Here it is presented on the chart. 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.760
 We see the price opened. 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.820
 Then she went below the previous low of the bar. 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.020
 The fall continued. 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.590
 It was selling. 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.019
 But then the price stops, and buyers enter the market. 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.099
 and start pushing the price back up. 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.739
 And thus the closing price is almost on one 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.199
 level with the opening price. 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 And as we see, the closing price is in the top 25–33% of the whole range. 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.690
 bar, that is, it is in the upper half of the bar. 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.190
 It is very important. 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.690
 A tail is thereby formed. 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.079
 The opening price and the closing price are approximately equal, and below 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.660
 a long tail. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.140
 This is a bullish reversal bar. 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.489
 The same bullish reversal bar was here. 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.210
 The price opens, starts to go below the previous low 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.210
 the bar. 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.010
 Sales continue, but then enter the market 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.179
 buyers and begin to return the price back up. 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.609
 And the closing price closes about where it was 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.910
 opening a bar. 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.280
 As we can see, the closing price is in the upper half. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.651
 bar, and in the top 25%. AND 

00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:16.110
 again we see a long tail below. Than 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.190
 the longer the tail, the better, the stronger the bar. 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.190
 Bearish 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.490
 reversal bar can look like this. Price 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.570
 opens, starts to go above the previous high 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.890
 the bar. Purchases 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.340
 continue, but then they are either depleted or 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.200
 sellers enter the market and begin to push the price 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 below. So 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.570
 Thus, the bar closes at about the same place 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.260
 opened: at the bottom 25–33% of the entire bar range, 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.000
 in his lower half. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.430
 And we see a tail forming above. 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.002
 This bar is medium in size compared to 

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:57.270
 with previous bars, so it is not so strong. 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.420
 But, nevertheless, it can be called a bear turning 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 by the bar. 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.980
 This bar was the same bearish reversal bar. 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.200
 We see he also had a tail. 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.990
 We can say that it is a bearish reversal bar, but its 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.420
 note that the maximum does not exceed the maximum of the previous bar. 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.850
 And in fact this bar is inside this big bar, 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.010
 therefore, it’s not such a substantial bar to talk about. 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.730
