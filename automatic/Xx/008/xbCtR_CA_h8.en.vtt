 hi guys how are you 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.450
 like the things that add to your hearing with 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.510
 that I chastise you in a little bit the pep and are 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.480
 like things you hate or things that you 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.889
 they feel like this because they already know 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.949
 about all the things that I like 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.330
 the things that I do then can end 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.970
 of bad that stops you a bit of the things 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.060
 I do not like 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.820
 when you get ready and in those days or those 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.619
 nights you do not really look amazing 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.230

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.129
 everything is canceled is that is how 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.010
 feelings that every thing you say no 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.010
 it may be possible I can not stand it 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.920

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.320

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.899
