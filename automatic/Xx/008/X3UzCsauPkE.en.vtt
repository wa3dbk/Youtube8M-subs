welcome to a brand new game on Steam

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.519 
welcome to a brand new game on Steam
I<00:00:15.730> believe<00:00:16.209> it's<00:00:16.360> called<00:00:16.509> shark<00:00:16.990> attack<00:00:17.320> or

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
I believe it's called shark attack or

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.760 
I believe it's called shark attack or
shark<00:00:18.039> attack<00:00:18.579> deathmatch<00:00:19.300> -<00:00:19.720> I've<00:00:20.020> never

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
shark attack deathmatch - I've never

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.439 
shark attack deathmatch - I've never
played<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.160> first<00:00:21.279> one<00:00:21.579> but<00:00:22.029> it<00:00:22.150> kind<00:00:22.360> of

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
played the first one but it kind of

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.810 
played the first one but it kind of
looks<00:00:22.689> like<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:23.230> depths<00:00:23.710> game<00:00:23.980> that's<00:00:24.429> out<00:00:24.670> on

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
looks like the depths game that's out on

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.749 
looks like the depths game that's out on
Steam<00:00:25.029> as<00:00:25.210> well<00:00:25.420> where<00:00:25.720> you're<00:00:26.759> going

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
Steam as well where you're going

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.820 
Steam as well where you're going
underwater<00:00:27.939> finding<00:00:28.480> gold<00:00:28.630> but<00:00:29.380> I<00:00:29.410> don't<00:00:29.769> know

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
underwater finding gold but I don't know

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.349 
underwater finding gold but I don't know
if<00:00:29.919> that's<00:00:30.099> exactly<00:00:30.429> correct

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
if that's exactly correct

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.970 
if that's exactly correct
so<00:00:31.749> I'm<00:00:31.839> just<00:00:31.929> gonna<00:00:32.019> do<00:00:32.199> survival<00:00:32.800> because<00:00:32.949> I

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
so I'm just gonna do survival because I

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.259 
so I'm just gonna do survival because I
think<00:00:33.190> that's<00:00:33.309> basically<00:00:33.730> like<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.030> single

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
think that's basically like the single

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:34.829 
think that's basically like the single
player

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839 
player

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:38.250

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
yeah single player survival seven points

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.500 
yeah single player survival seven points

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
the map can you change the map there

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.760 
the map can you change the map there
might<00:00:43.059> be<00:00:43.090> only<00:00:43.300> one<00:00:43.480> map<00:00:43.660> right<00:00:43.899> now<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:44.440> is

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
might be only one map right now this is

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.119 
might be only one map right now this is
early<00:00:45.129> access<00:00:45.610> so<00:00:46.000> I<00:00:46.829> can't<00:00:47.829> really<00:00:47.949> give<00:00:48.100> you

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
early access so I can't really give you

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.290 
early access so I can't really give you
too<00:00:48.309> much<00:00:48.399> information<00:00:48.460> better<00:00:49.090> okay<00:00:49.239> so

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
too much information better okay so

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.680 
too much information better okay so
shark<00:00:49.660> attack<00:00:49.960> deathmatch<00:00:50.320> -<00:00:50.530> yes<00:00:50.829> okay<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:51.730> we

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
shark attack deathmatch - yes okay so we

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.090 
shark attack deathmatch - yes okay so we
start<00:00:52.930> right<00:00:52.960> in<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.289> water<00:00:53.440> I<00:00:53.649> don't<00:00:53.920> know<00:00:54.010> if

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
start right in the water I don't know if

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.950 
start right in the water I don't know if
the<00:00:54.190> objective<00:00:54.550> is<00:00:54.730> I<00:00:54.879> think<00:00:55.120> this<00:00:55.600> one<00:00:55.840> is

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
the objective is I think this one is

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.500 
the objective is I think this one is
probably<00:00:56.140> just<00:00:56.469> like<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.620> oh<00:00:56.980> hey<00:00:57.489> buddy<00:00:57.699> this

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
he's chomping at me at a certain

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.860 
he's chomping at me at a certain
distance<00:06:14.850> and<00:06:14.970> I'm<00:06:15.090> not<00:06:15.180> even<00:06:15.360> close<00:06:15.479> enough

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
distance and I'm not even close enough

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.260 
distance and I'm not even close enough
but<00:06:16.340> that's<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.460> lot<00:06:17.610> of<00:06:17.699> that's<00:06:17.970> actually<00:06:18.090> a

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
but that's a lot of that's actually a

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.000 
but that's a lot of that's actually a
lot<00:06:18.360> of<00:06:18.419> fun<00:06:18.479> it's<00:06:18.810> not<00:06:18.960> very<00:06:19.229> expensive<00:06:19.560> it's

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
lot of fun it's not very expensive it's

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.580 
lot of fun it's not very expensive it's
only<00:06:20.130> like<00:06:20.400> seven<00:06:21.389> dollars<00:06:21.570> right<00:06:22.110> now<00:06:22.289> and

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
only like seven dollars right now and

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.260 
only like seven dollars right now and
that's<00:06:22.949> probably<00:06:23.220> just<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.580> early<00:06:23.729> access

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
that's probably just the early access

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.820 
that's probably just the early access
price<00:06:24.570> so<00:06:25.080> there's<00:06:25.229> gonna<00:06:25.350> be<00:06:25.500> tons<00:06:25.680> of

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
price so there's gonna be tons of

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.520 
price so there's gonna be tons of
updates<00:06:26.190> hopefully<00:06:26.639> for<00:06:26.820> it<00:06:27.000> I<00:06:27.570> mean<00:06:28.110> as<00:06:28.350> long

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
updates hopefully for it I mean as long

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.100 
updates hopefully for it I mean as long
as<00:06:28.740> people<00:06:28.919> decide<00:06:29.639> to<00:06:29.850> you<00:06:30.300> know<00:06:30.330> put<00:06:30.960> some

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
as people decide to you know put some

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.230 
as people decide to you know put some
money<00:06:31.260> into<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:31.680> game<00:06:31.860> it<00:06:32.610> could<00:06:32.910> be<00:06:33.030> a<00:06:33.060> lot<00:06:33.210> of

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
money into the game it could be a lot of

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.270 
money into the game it could be a lot of
fun<00:06:33.510> it's<00:06:33.900> a<00:06:34.020> bit<00:06:34.500> different<00:06:34.830> than<00:06:34.979> the<00:06:35.100> depth

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
fun it's a bit different than the depth

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.010 
fun it's a bit different than the depth
game<00:06:35.580> so<00:06:35.789> that's<00:06:36.060> completely<00:06:36.510> different<00:06:36.599> if

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
game so that's completely different if

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.100 
game so that's completely different if
you<00:06:37.139> haven't<00:06:37.320> played<00:06:37.470> depth<00:06:38.039> either<00:06:38.930> that's<00:06:39.930> a

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110
