just really really good gameplay um but

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.350 
just really really good gameplay um but
it's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> difficult<00:00:47.670> game<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.930> read<00:00:49.410> all

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
it's a difficult game I have read all

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.270 
it's a difficult game I have read all
I'm<00:00:51.360> doing<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.809> badly<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.649> today<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.100> well

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
as usual I'm not quite sad absolutely

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.970 
as usual I'm not quite sad absolutely
square<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> does<00:00:58.320> become<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.590> slightly

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
square on so it does become a slightly

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.740 
square on so it does become a slightly
more<00:00:59.129> challenging<00:00:59.190> game<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> play<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.300> me<00:01:00.420> but
