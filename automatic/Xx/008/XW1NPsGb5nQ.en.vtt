so<00:00:03.350> I<00:00:03.380> thought<00:00:03.620> I<00:00:03.650> would<00:00:03.889> put<00:00:04.040> up<00:00:04.190> a<00:00:04.370> video<00:00:04.939> with

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330 
so I thought I would put up a video with

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.670 
so I thought I would put up a video with
a<00:00:05.359> couple<00:00:05.540> of<00:00:05.779> tips<00:00:05.990> for<00:00:06.290> a<00:00:06.319> graphite<00:00:06.620> pencil

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
a couple of tips for a graphite pencil

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.009 
a couple of tips for a graphite pencil
drawing<00:00:07.220> just<00:00:07.460> really<00:00:08.240> basic<00:00:08.420> tips<00:00:08.840> and

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
drawing just really basic tips and

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.390 
drawing just really basic tips and
techniques<00:00:09.139> that<00:00:09.650> might<00:00:09.769> help<00:00:09.950> a<00:00:10.099> beginner

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
techniques that might help a beginner

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.060 
techniques that might help a beginner
and<00:00:10.610> they're<00:00:11.300> not<00:00:11.420> like<00:00:11.630> rules<00:00:12.050> in<00:00:12.350> art<00:00:12.740> books

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
and they're not like rules in art books

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.250 
and they're not like rules in art books
or<00:00:13.340> anything<00:00:13.490> like<00:00:13.790> that<00:00:13.850> they're<00:00:14.420> just<00:00:14.690> some

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
or anything like that they're just some

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.620 
or anything like that they're just some
of<00:00:15.290> the<00:00:15.470> techniques<00:00:15.830> I<00:00:15.980> picked<00:00:16.219> up<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:17.359> more<00:00:17.599> I

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
of the techniques I picked up the more I

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.680 
of the techniques I picked up the more I
drew<00:00:18.070> so<00:00:19.070> I<00:00:19.100> hope<00:00:19.460> you<00:00:19.670> benefit<00:00:20.090> from<00:00:20.119> it<00:00:20.390> or

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
drew so I hope you benefit from it or

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.540 
drew so I hope you benefit from it or
basically<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.440> tools<00:00:21.710> that<00:00:21.949> I<00:00:22.070> use<00:00:22.160> when<00:00:22.520> I

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
basically the tools that I use when I

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.180 
basically the tools that I use when I
draw<00:00:22.850> I<00:00:23.750> found<00:00:24.350> that<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:24.650> best<00:00:24.830> kind<00:00:25.070> of

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
draw I found that the best kind of

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.300 
draw I found that the best kind of
pencils<00:00:25.580> are<00:00:25.730> favored<00:00:26.210> castile<00:00:27.110> pencils<00:00:27.650> you

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
pencils are favored castile pencils you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.680 
pencils are favored castile pencils you
know<00:00:28.400> they're<00:00:28.609> really<00:00:29.000> really<00:00:29.180> good<00:00:29.390> for

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
know they're really really good for

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.099 
know they're really really good for
smooth<00:00:29.900> shading<00:00:30.350> I<00:00:30.560> use<00:00:31.310> Fabriano<00:00:31.939> paper<00:00:32.689> and

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:33.109 
smooth shading I use Fabriano paper and

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.969 
smooth shading I use Fabriano paper and
a<00:00:33.710> kneaded<00:00:34.039> eraser<00:00:34.210> um<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.300> long<00:00:35.839> eraser<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:36.649> a

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:36.979 
a kneaded eraser um a long eraser and a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.119 
a kneaded eraser um a long eraser and a
sharpener<00:00:37.370> these<00:00:37.579> are<00:00:37.819> the<00:00:38.329> basic<00:00:38.690> tools<00:00:38.899> for

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
sharpener these are the basic tools for

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.069 
sharpener these are the basic tools for
graphic<00:00:40.129> drawing<00:00:40.309> try<00:00:41.089> to<00:00:41.149> use<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.809> kneaded

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
graphic drawing try to use the kneaded

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.319 
graphic drawing try to use the kneaded
eraser<00:00:42.139> more<00:00:42.710> than<00:00:42.979> a<00:00:43.280> rubber<00:00:43.579> eraser<00:00:44.149> because

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
eraser more than a rubber eraser because

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.989 
eraser more than a rubber eraser because
the<00:00:45.019> rubber<00:00:45.199> eraser<00:00:45.649> usually<00:00:46.129> changes<00:00:46.850> the

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:46.999 
the rubber eraser usually changes the

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:48.759 
the rubber eraser usually changes the
texture<00:00:47.329> of<00:00:47.359> the<00:00:47.510> paper<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:47.989> it's<00:00:48.469> almost

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
texture of the paper and it's almost

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.309 
texture of the paper and it's almost
impossible<00:00:49.219> to<00:00:49.579> shade<00:00:50.329> as<00:00:50.479> evenly<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.199> as

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
impossible to shade as evenly and as

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:54.579 
impossible to shade as evenly and as
smoothly<00:00:51.649> as<00:00:52.059> before<00:00:53.059> after<00:00:53.299> erasing<00:00:53.690> okay<00:00:54.530> so

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
smoothly as before after erasing okay so

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.979 
smoothly as before after erasing okay so
shading<00:00:55.159> is<00:00:55.309> just<00:00:55.549> basically<00:00:56.149> drawing<00:00:56.449> lines

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
shading is just basically drawing lines

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.020 
shading is just basically drawing lines
that<00:00:57.260> are<00:00:57.350> very<00:00:57.530> close<00:00:57.799> to<00:00:57.979> each<00:00:58.010> other<00:00:58.219> in<00:00:58.549> a

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
that are very close to each other in a

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.609 
that are very close to each other in a
way<00:00:59.149> that<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.420> cover<00:00:59.659> all<00:01:00.019> the<00:01:00.319> weight<00:01:00.469> of<00:01:00.499> the

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:00.619 
way that you cover all the weight of the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.009 
way that you cover all the weight of the
paper<00:01:00.889> and<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:02.149> keys<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.569> the<00:01:02.629> pressure<00:01:02.839> of

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
paper and the keys and the pressure of

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.450 
paper and the keys and the pressure of
your<00:01:03.170> hands<00:01:03.469> so<00:01:03.649> if<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:04.489> want<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.699> start<00:01:04.909> dark

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
your hands so if you want to start dark

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.390 
your hands so if you want to start dark
you<00:01:07.460> add<00:01:07.640> more<00:01:07.940> pressure<00:01:10.690> and<00:01:12.370> then<00:01:13.370> you

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
you add more pressure and then you

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.840 
you add more pressure and then you
slowly<00:01:14.060> light<00:01:14.480> in<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:16.220> pressure<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.640> your

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
slowly light in the pressure of your

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.350 
slowly light in the pressure of your
hand

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.570 

and<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:26.290> keep<00:01:26.500> repeating<00:01:26.650> this<00:01:27.070> until<00:01:27.130> you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
and you keep repeating this until you

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.310 
and you keep repeating this until you
get<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:28.660> desired<00:01:28.690> effect<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.810> if<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.110> can't

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
get the desired effect so if you can't

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.070 
get the desired effect so if you can't
do<00:01:32.500> this<00:01:32.650> with<00:01:32.890> one<00:01:33.160> pencil<00:01:33.660> which<00:01:34.660> is<00:01:34.840> always

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
do this with one pencil which is always

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.610 
do this with one pencil which is always
better<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:37.150> can<00:01:37.360> do<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.720> with<00:01:37.990> more<00:01:38.320> than<00:01:38.350> one

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
better you can do it with more than one

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.020 
better you can do it with more than one
pencil<00:01:38.830> for<00:01:39.220> example<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.760> can<00:01:39.940> start<00:01:40.270> with<00:01:40.620> B

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
pencil for example you can start with B

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:53.730 
pencil for example you can start with B
and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:45.130> bring<00:01:45.550> each<00:01:46.330> B

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:05.050 

and<00:01:54.220> then<00:01:54.490> H<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.210> then<00:01:55.720> 2<00:01:55.900> H<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.260> so<00:01:56.409> on

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.130 

you

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.080 

there<00:02:12.680> are<00:02:12.860> two<00:02:13.100> basic<00:02:13.280> ways<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.700> hold<00:02:13.940> a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
there are two basic ways to hold a

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.510 
there are two basic ways to hold a
graphite<00:02:14.390> pencil<00:02:14.960> there's<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.860> tripod<00:02:16.280> grip

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
graphite pencil there's the tripod grip

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.880 
graphite pencil there's the tripod grip
where<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.390> point<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.110> pencil<00:02:18.319> is<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.800> one

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
where the point of the pencil is the one

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.650 
where the point of the pencil is the one
that's<00:02:19.040> doing<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.430> shading<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.540> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
that's doing the shading and this is the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.230 
that's doing the shading and this is the
one<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.900> most<00:02:21.110> people<00:02:21.700> probably<00:02:22.700> use<00:02:22.940> and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
one that most people probably use and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.240 
one that most people probably use and
then<00:02:23.780> there's<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.200> overhead<00:02:24.680> grip<00:02:24.890> which<00:02:25.100> is

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
then there's the overhead grip which is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.780 
then there's the overhead grip which is
like<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.660> overhead<00:02:27.170> grip<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:28.400> side<00:02:28.610> of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
like this the overhead grip the side of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.430 
like this the overhead grip the side of
the<00:02:28.910> pencil<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.810> one<00:02:29.959> that's<00:02:30.140> doing<00:02:30.320> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
the pencil is the one that's doing the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:03:07.380 
the pencil is the one that's doing the
shading

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.559 

always<00:03:08.170> use<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.770> lighter<00:03:08.980> pencils<00:03:09.490> like<00:03:09.850> 2h

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
always use the lighter pencils like 2h

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.340 
always use the lighter pencils like 2h
or<00:03:10.960> 3<00:03:11.260> H<00:03:11.410> for<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.610> outlines<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.959> drawing

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
or 3 H for the outlines of the drawing

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.600 
or 3 H for the outlines of the drawing
for<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.770> sketch<00:03:15.100> because<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.660> darker<00:03:17.020> colors

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
for the sketch because the darker colors

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.490 
for the sketch because the darker colors
usually<00:03:18.610> almost<00:03:19.150> never<00:03:19.510> get<00:03:20.020> completely

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
usually almost never get completely

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.810 
usually almost never get completely
erased<00:03:23.070> no<00:03:24.070> matter<00:03:24.250> how<00:03:24.459> hard<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:25.000> race<00:03:25.540> and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
erased no matter how hard you race and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.460 
erased no matter how hard you race and
that<00:03:27.820> really<00:03:28.120> can<00:03:28.450> affect<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.959> drawing<00:03:29.290> I'm

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
that really can affect the drawing I'm

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.030 
that really can affect the drawing I'm
personally<00:03:30.100> not<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.310> fan<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.780> smudging<00:03:31.780> but<00:03:32.740> if

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
personally not a fan of smudging but if

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.340 
personally not a fan of smudging but if
you're<00:03:33.610> someone<00:03:34.390> who<00:03:34.510> does<00:03:34.690> that

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
you're someone who does that

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.800 
you're someone who does that
be<00:03:35.830> sure<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.400> never<00:03:36.580> ever<00:03:37.000> use<00:03:37.330> your<00:03:37.360> finger

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
be sure to never ever use your finger

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.979 
be sure to never ever use your finger
because<00:03:38.770> your<00:03:39.580> finger<00:03:39.880> has<00:03:40.030> oils<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.780> water

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
because your finger has oils and water

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.979 
because your finger has oils and water
that<00:03:41.830> will<00:03:42.130> mix<00:03:42.670> with<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:42.940> graphite<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.870> the

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
that will mix with the graphite of the

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.509 
that will mix with the graphite of the
pencil<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.620> will<00:03:44.739> leave<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.100> really

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
pencil and it will leave a really

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.699 
pencil and it will leave a really
undesirable<00:03:46.150> effect<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:47.140> if<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.380> want<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.620> do

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
undesirable effect so if you want to do

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.390 
undesirable effect so if you want to do
that<00:03:47.860> use<00:03:48.040> cotton<00:03:48.459> or<00:03:48.940> even<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.480> napkin<00:03:50.400> to

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
that use cotton or even a napkin to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.310 
that use cotton or even a napkin to
smudge<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.060> even<00:03:52.480> out<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.810> shading<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:59.290> I

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
smudge and even out the shading but I

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.440 
smudge and even out the shading but I
find<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.709> it<00:03:59.830> usually<00:04:00.160> shows<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.880> the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
find that it usually shows and the

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.280 
find that it usually shows and the
shaded<00:04:03.810> naturally<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:05.320> looks<00:04:05.530> better

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
shaded naturally it looks better

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.949 
shaded naturally it looks better
try<00:04:08.290> not<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.620> rest<00:04:09.100> your<00:04:09.489> hand<00:04:10.030> on<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.570> drawing

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
try not to rest your hand on the drawing

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.970 
try not to rest your hand on the drawing
because<00:04:11.680> usually<00:04:12.640> you<00:04:13.090> get<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:14.470> know<00:04:14.590> this

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
because usually you get you know this

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.550 
because usually you get you know this
kind<00:04:15.220> of<00:04:15.310> thing<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:16.450> what<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.630> usually<00:04:16.870> do<00:04:17.229> when

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
kind of thing so what I usually do when

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.800 
kind of thing so what I usually do when
I<00:04:17.620> draw<00:04:17.919> I<00:04:18.040> usually<00:04:18.340> put<00:04:18.519> a<00:04:18.549> paper<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.600> rest

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
I draw I usually put a paper and I rest

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.520 
I draw I usually put a paper and I rest
my<00:04:19.989> hand<00:04:20.169> on<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:21.070> draw<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.870> protects

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
my hand on it and I draw and it protects

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.740 
my hand on it and I draw and it protects
the<00:04:23.710> paper<00:04:23.890> from<00:04:24.190> unwanted<00:04:24.729> smudging<00:04:25.390> like

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
the paper from unwanted smudging like

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.490 
the paper from unwanted smudging like
this<00:04:26.040> when<00:04:27.040> using<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.910> darker<00:04:28.360> pencils<00:04:29.320> like

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
this when using the darker pencils like

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.780 
this when using the darker pencils like
7<00:04:29.919> B<00:04:30.070> 8<00:04:30.100> B<00:04:30.669> 4<00:04:30.940> B<00:04:31.570> like<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:33.280> really<00:04:33.520> need<00:04:33.760> to

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
7 B 8 B 4 B like that you really need to

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.120 
7 B 8 B 4 B like that you really need to
keep<00:04:34.660> your<00:04:34.810> sharpener<00:04:35.169> always<00:04:35.500> with<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:35.860> and

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
keep your sharpener always with you and

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.700 
keep your sharpener always with you and
continuously<00:04:36.790> sharpen<00:04:37.270> because<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.560> edge

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
continuously sharpen because the edge

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.650 
continuously sharpen because the edge
gets<00:04:39.010> dull<00:04:39.280> really<00:04:39.790> really<00:04:40.030> fast<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.690> it'll

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
gets dull really really fast and it'll

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.420 
gets dull really really fast and it'll
give<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:43.810> shading<00:04:44.290> that's<00:04:44.800> affected<00:04:45.250> by<00:04:45.370> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
give you shading that's affected by the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.880 
give you shading that's affected by the
texture<00:04:45.820> of<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.000> paper<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.690> not<00:04:47.680> very

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
texture of the paper and not very

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.110 
texture of the paper and not very
realistic<00:04:48.400> shading<00:04:50.640> opposed<00:04:51.640> to<00:04:51.850> when<00:04:51.970> it's

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
realistic shading opposed to when it's

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.920 
realistic shading opposed to when it's
sharpened<00:04:52.570> it'll<00:04:53.580> be<00:04:54.580> like<00:04:54.789> this

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.960 

so<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:58.919> can<00:04:59.130> see<00:04:59.280> there's<00:04:59.490> a<00:04:59.550> definite

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
so you can see there's a definite

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.850 
so you can see there's a definite
difference<00:05:02.419> never<00:05:03.419> ever<00:05:03.870> outline<00:05:04.410> no<00:05:04.650> matter

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
difference never ever outline no matter

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.249 
difference never ever outline no matter
what<00:05:05.310> kind<00:05:05.490> of<00:05:05.550> drawing<00:05:05.820> you're<00:05:06.300> doing<00:05:06.690> if<00:05:06.900> you

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
what kind of drawing you're doing if you

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.330 
what kind of drawing you're doing if you
want<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.620> look<00:05:07.740> realistic

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
want it to look realistic

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.879 
want it to look realistic
you<00:05:08.550> should<00:05:08.759> never<00:05:08.910> outline<00:05:09.479> like<00:05:09.630> this

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
you should never outline like this

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.129 
you should never outline like this
because<00:05:10.889> when<00:05:11.039> you<00:05:11.130> think<00:05:11.340> about<00:05:11.490> it<00:05:12.139> sensibly

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
because when you think about it sensibly

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.890 
because when you think about it sensibly
there<00:05:13.949> are<00:05:14.310> no<00:05:14.759> hard<00:05:15.030> edges<00:05:15.240> like<00:05:15.570> this<00:05:15.600> in

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
there are no hard edges like this in

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.939 
there are no hard edges like this in
real<00:05:16.050> life<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:17.669> know<00:05:17.789> this<00:05:18.210> is<00:05:18.509> made<00:05:18.840> by<00:05:18.949> two

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
real life you know this is made by two

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.980 
real life you know this is made by two
different<00:05:20.280> tonal<00:05:20.639> values<00:05:21.180> meeting<00:05:21.720> which<00:05:21.960> is

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
different tonal values meeting which is

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.340 
different tonal values meeting which is
this<00:05:22.620> should<00:05:22.800> be<00:05:22.979> the<00:05:23.400> sky<00:05:24.050> meeting<00:05:25.050> with<00:05:25.229> the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
this should be the sky meeting with the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.490 
this should be the sky meeting with the
white<00:05:25.470> of<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.770> petal<00:05:26.210> so<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:28.020> shouldn't<00:05:28.350> have

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
white of the petal so you shouldn't have

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.800 
white of the petal so you shouldn't have
lines<00:05:28.919> like<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:29.669> you<00:05:30.060> should<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.510> need<00:05:30.660> to

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
lines like this you should you need to

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.719 
lines like this you should you need to
try<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.020> mix<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.740> make<00:05:31.800> it<00:05:31.949> into<00:05:32.130> shadows

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
try to mix it and make it into shadows

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.500 
try to mix it and make it into shadows
and<00:05:32.940> different<00:05:33.479> tone<00:05:33.630> values<00:05:34.820> we<00:05:35.820> can<00:05:36.000> see<00:05:36.180> the

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
and different tone values we can see the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.140 
and different tone values we can see the
big<00:05:36.720> difference<00:05:37.139> over<00:05:37.710> if<00:05:38.039> you<00:05:38.190> can<00:05:38.370> this<00:05:38.760> and

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
big difference over if you can this and

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.330 
big difference over if you can this and
this<00:05:39.419> which<00:05:39.960> doesn't<00:05:40.500> have<00:05:40.620> outlines<00:05:41.039> but

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
this which doesn't have outlines but

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.850 
this which doesn't have outlines but
rather<00:05:41.610> you<00:05:42.389> know<00:05:42.479> blending<00:05:43.050> of<00:05:43.169> tones<00:05:45.860> so

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
rather you know blending of tones so

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.379 
rather you know blending of tones so
when<00:05:47.010> you<00:05:47.130> smudge<00:05:47.430> with<00:05:47.580> your<00:05:47.760> fingers<00:05:48.150> you

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
when you smudge with your fingers you

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.029 
when you smudge with your fingers you
all<00:05:48.479> get<00:05:48.840> a<00:05:48.870> result<00:05:49.229> that's<00:05:49.380> like<00:05:49.590> this<00:05:49.800> it's

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
all get a result that's like this it's

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.140 
all get a result that's like this it's
almost<00:05:50.190> like<00:05:50.430> a<00:05:50.460> cloudy

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
almost like a cloudy

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.150 
almost like a cloudy
I<00:05:51.500> don't<00:05:52.500> know<00:05:52.560> layer<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:54.199> it<00:05:55.199> does<00:05:55.800> not<00:05:55.949> look

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
I don't know layer and it does not look

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.659 
I don't know layer and it does not look
realistic<00:05:56.699> at<00:05:56.820> all<00:05:56.940> so<00:05:57.630> as<00:05:57.930> we<00:05:58.080> said<00:05:58.289> never

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
realistic at all so as we said never

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.670 
realistic at all so as we said never
smudge<00:05:59.669> with<00:05:59.910> your<00:06:00.030> finger<00:06:00.360> if<00:06:01.050> you<00:06:01.110> do<00:06:01.500> want

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
smudge with your finger if you do want

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.850 
smudge with your finger if you do want
to<00:06:01.770> smudge<00:06:02.010> try<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.430> smudge<00:06:02.729> with<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.360> napkin

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
to smudge try to smudge with a napkin

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.670 
to smudge try to smudge with a napkin
this<00:06:04.860> is<00:06:05.010> shading<00:06:05.400> with<00:06:05.639> 5b<00:06:06.320> to<00:06:07.320> make<00:06:07.530> it

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
this is shading with 5b to make it

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.189 
this is shading with 5b to make it
smoother<00:06:08.160> will<00:06:08.340> take<00:06:09.800> to<00:06:10.800> be<00:06:11.070> or<00:06:11.340> be<00:06:12.199> something

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
smoother will take to be or be something

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.189 
smoother will take to be or be something
that's<00:06:13.380> slightly<00:06:13.919> lighter<00:06:14.250> and<00:06:14.870> then<00:06:15.870> we<00:06:16.020> go

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
that's slightly lighter and then we go

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.560 
that's slightly lighter and then we go
over<00:06:16.560> it<00:06:19.340> and<00:06:20.340> you<00:06:20.520> can<00:06:20.550> see<00:06:20.880> it<00:06:21.000> just<00:06:21.030> makes<00:06:21.419> it

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
over it and you can see it just makes it

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:28.390 
over it and you can see it just makes it
more<00:06:21.780> smooth<00:06:22.229> and<00:06:22.470> more<00:06:22.650> realistic

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:37.409 

you

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.670 

don't<00:06:38.419> be<00:06:38.540> afraid<00:06:38.750> to<00:06:38.930> use<00:06:39.050> the<00:06:39.169> darker<00:06:39.470> shades

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
don't be afraid to use the darker shades

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.520 
don't be afraid to use the darker shades
like<00:06:39.860> 8b<00:06:40.340> 6b<00:06:40.820> 4b<00:06:41.060> because<00:06:41.570> it'll<00:06:41.810> make<00:06:41.960> the

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
like 8b 6b 4b because it'll make the

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.379 
like 8b 6b 4b because it'll make the
drawing<00:06:42.860> look<00:06:43.010> more<00:06:43.250> realistic<00:06:43.820> and<00:06:44.030> it'll

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
drawing look more realistic and it'll

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.590 
drawing look more realistic and it'll
really<00:06:44.660> bring<00:06:44.870> out<00:06:45.050> the<00:06:45.080> contrast<00:06:45.699> like<00:06:46.699> this

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
really bring out the contrast like this

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.480 
really bring out the contrast like this
is<00:06:47.870> using<00:06:48.440> um<00:06:48.940> 6b<00:06:49.940> and<00:06:50.800> 4v<00:06:51.800> and<00:06:52.150> this<00:06:53.150> flower<00:06:53.389> is

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
is using um 6b and 4v and this flower is

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.700 
is using um 6b and 4v and this flower is
using<00:06:55.490> only<00:06:55.639> HP<00:06:55.940> so<00:06:56.750> you<00:06:56.810> can<00:06:57.290> tell<00:06:57.500> that

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
using only HP so you can tell that

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.050 
using only HP so you can tell that
there's<00:06:57.949> a<00:06:58.040> huge<00:06:58.250> difference<00:06:58.280> between<00:06:58.760> the

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
there's a huge difference between the

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.379 
there's a huge difference between the
two<00:06:59.090> drawings<00:07:00.370> so<00:07:01.370> don't<00:07:01.610> be<00:07:01.760> afraid<00:07:02.060> to<00:07:02.360> use

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:02.389 
two drawings so don't be afraid to use

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.100 
two drawings so don't be afraid to use
the<00:07:02.630> darker<00:07:02.930> shades<00:07:03.580> so<00:07:04.580> here<00:07:04.880> we<00:07:05.210> we're<00:07:05.930> going

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
the darker shades so here we we're going

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.629 
the darker shades so here we we're going
to<00:07:06.169> compare<00:07:06.590> between<00:07:06.710> the<00:07:06.949> one<00:07:07.280> with<00:07:07.490> the

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 
to compare between the one with the

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.270 
to compare between the one with the
mistakes<00:07:08.060> the<00:07:08.330> outlining<00:07:08.720> the<00:07:09.020> smudging<00:07:09.530> you

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
mistakes the outlining the smudging you

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.000 
mistakes the outlining the smudging you
know<00:07:10.400> not<00:07:11.240> layering<00:07:11.660> the<00:07:12.110> darker<00:07:12.470> colors<00:07:12.800> not

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
know not layering the darker colors not

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.120 
know not layering the darker colors not
sharpening<00:07:13.550> the<00:07:13.699> darker<00:07:14.000> colors<00:07:14.330> and<00:07:14.630> between

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
sharpening the darker colors and between

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.070 
sharpening the darker colors and between
the<00:07:16.130> one<00:07:16.280> where<00:07:16.460> we<00:07:16.580> did<00:07:16.699> all<00:07:16.850> those<00:07:17.060> and<00:07:17.570> I

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
the one where we did all those and I

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.779 
the one where we did all those and I
think<00:07:18.169> you<00:07:18.500> can<00:07:18.680> see<00:07:18.860> the<00:07:18.979> difference<00:07:19.370> here<00:07:19.610> so

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:19.789 
think you can see the difference here so

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:22.830 
think you can see the difference here so
I<00:07:20.479> hope<00:07:20.780> you<00:07:20.990> benefited<00:07:21.440> from<00:07:21.800> this<00:07:22.070> tutorial

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840
