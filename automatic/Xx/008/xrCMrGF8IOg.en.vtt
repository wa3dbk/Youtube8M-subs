00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.370
 hello mom top is back in touch and in 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.740
 this time we will show drakensang online 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.810
 this is the most unique browser it 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.810
 my rpb we will devote this review 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.710
 the game is developed on the unity engine 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.869
 from the bigpoint company that allows us 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.879
 see in the browser awesome 3d 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.980
 graphics dynamic lighting my and 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.140
 shadows also pleased with the quality 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.390
 textures and 3d models so 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.309
 the terrain detailing is amazing 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.000
 the world looks very colorful and 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.000
 saturated 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.090
 plot racket 7 to the banality of the line so 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.390
 how strong the game is not at all 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.710
 this 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.260
 the game action takes place in 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.300
 fantasy world called a venturi 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.150
 which is a classic 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.250
 world of medieval or pgs elves orcs 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.940
 dragons and all forest marsh 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.800
 the ancient world and venturi repeats pretty 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.020
 Standard Story Awakened 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.420
 universal evil that craves to enslave 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.490
 all living only this time she is 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.620
 in the form of a dragon which for some 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.750
 incomprehensible to ordinary mortal reasons 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.710
 missed dark worshipers from 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.710
 depths and numbers 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.909
 drakensang online 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.250
 as many browsers are conditionally 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.899
 free game so you only need 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.380
 create a game account on the official 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.850
 site and drove 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.130
 to start the journey through the game world 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.350
 you need to choose a comfortable server for the game 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.600
 and one of the three strongman characters 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.149
 dodger and magician all standard 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.740
 about characters tell a little more so 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.939
 how they absolutely don't look like each other 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.070
 friend and so dragon warrior 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.049
 he is a tank shield and sword and his loyal 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.479
 satellites as resources for their 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.060
 abilities use rage which 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.890
 with each beat the magician of the circle accumulates 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.929
 this class never needed 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.580
 submission rather frail in the near 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.429
 the battle will cause huge damage in the distance 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.519
 and can bring down on enemies tons to 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.160
 fire lava and lightning and last 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.959
 tracker he is a sly can poke 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.120
 on buddy with arrows and melee 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.720
 wave a bow with attached to it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.340
 blades 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.470
 as a resource use 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.239
 concentration which is quickly replenished 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.239
 it's worth giving him a little break 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.840
 Unfortunately the character editor is missing 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.569
 the only thing we can choose 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.430
 Gender growth hero and hairstyle last 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.060
 the way changes with vegetation 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.370
 on the face 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.349
 this is if the game is not a male after 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.750
 relative on long boot first 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.180
 what we see is indescribable beauty which 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.430
 personally reminded us such a lpg as 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.489
 titan quest monsters are beautiful 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.660
 capsizes on back after steam plus 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.580
 detail beyond praise 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.680
 well and soundtrack in general 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.390
 words can not describe but not so good 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.549
 as it seems at first glance 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.019
 leveling skills of the character in this game 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.819
 unfortunately missing 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.130
 skills are simply given to the player by 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.230
 reaching a certain level of everything up 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.750
 12 different skills for each class 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.790
 though the developers promised at the end 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.209
 beta test add new skill and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.190
 introduce character development branches 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.590
 cities in drakensang online are made on 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.480
 surprise beautiful and high quality in them 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.959
 there are all the attributes of modern 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.870
 rpp 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.670
 traders herbalists blacksmiths enchant or 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.190
 and the rest of the auxiliary ndpi si 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.080
 besides the main storyline there is 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.060
 a lot of secondary quests that 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.190
 will help not only earn but also 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.670
 diversify your stay in the world 3 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.670
 Kinsi 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.440
 the game also has a donato system 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.080
 for real money you can purchase 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.130
 so -called foreigners if you are too lazy 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.709
 waste your time 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.390
 and the money you like shit west can 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.390
 deposit about 40 American 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.190
 dollars on these same foreigners and your 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.000
 character can be put on the most 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.400
 top gear 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.860
 it certainly introduces some imbalance in 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.569
 the game but the blessing the foreigners will fall from the monster 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.450
 the game world is a little more depressing 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.090
 lack of guilds and an auction that long ago 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.349
 already become an attribute and us arpg but it 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.349
 also kind of like a matter of time 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.209
 combat system is ugly just 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.980
 click on the monsters as a seizure and 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.170
 our character will water the enemies 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.970
 unceasing hail of blows in 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.930
 character control is not used 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.990
 so many buttons 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.460
 namely the left and right mouse button 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.370
 regular attacker and knitting needle 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.560
 me olya sacred or diablo and several 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.120
 hot keys on your keyboard in your 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.790
 queue responsible for use 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.800
 different skill items and potions also 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.840
 have the ability to create things yourself 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.790
 rather to modify for this 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.900
 used workbench it can be found in 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.090
 some locations 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.169
 you will need four to modify 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.090
 things of rank 1 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.830
 insert their workbench broke the button 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.230
 combine and get one thing 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.600
 next time there is a game 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.720
 ranks of things but combines you can just 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.940
 3 6 namely magic and improved 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.310
 special after long 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.560
 exhausted pumping crowds of dead mobs 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.210
 good mount visor stands 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.690
 surely brag about it before 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.070
 other players joined in battle 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.620
 There are two types of pvp battles 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.330
 free battles and arena fights 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.220
 the first case we take pvp status 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.260
 special from yoga after we can 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.240
 engage with players having such 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.790
 same status in almost any location 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.340
 arena fighting is based on the turret principle 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.380
 I mean one-on-one group of 3 on 3 or 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.150
 participation in 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.150
 five to five flag capture teams 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.820
 besides all the above main 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.560
 The charms of the game are there for most of 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.170
 we know and pleasant things 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.900
 increasing attacks essence of sol type 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.580
 Shatov extract 2 or even the opportunity 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.890
 improve uniforms various 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.810
 pebbles such nice friends 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.580
 quite a few things at times 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.930
 simplifies familiarization with the game and 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.480
 our further development is quite a lot 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.280
 It was said in a tracking send review but 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.830
 I would like to see some features 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.540
 and disadvantages of the pros we have 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.730
 excellent graphics professional 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.890
 sound moderate eating 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.030
 traffic can be played in a browser or 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.550
 through the game client 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.810
 easy to learn weekly updates 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.240
 and contests 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.280
 but without the minus anywhere absence 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.290
 the guild is a very weak editor 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.140
 the appearance of the character is not enough game classes 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.060
 and skills we hope that all the cons 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.040
 near future will come to naught 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.710
 developers will delight us with new 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.800
 updates on this we say goodbye 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.910
 all the best and good luck to the generation of worlds 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.910
