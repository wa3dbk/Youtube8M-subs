that<00:05:02.550> I<00:05:02.610> thought<00:05:02.910> if<00:05:03.419> you<00:05:03.480> can<00:05:03.660> do<00:05:03.750> this<00:05:03.930> that

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
that I thought if you can do this that

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.170 
that I thought if you can do this that
was<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.890> tale<00:05:05.220> what<00:05:05.520> can<00:05:05.669> you<00:05:05.790> do<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:06.030> with

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
was a tale what can you do that with

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.620 
was a tale what can you do that with
plugs<00:05:07.610> now<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.669> only<00:05:08.910> thing<00:05:09.030> I'm<00:05:09.360> going<00:05:09.540> to

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
plugs now the only thing I'm going to

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.159 
plugs now the only thing I'm going to
say<00:05:09.720> is<00:05:10.140> that<00:05:10.410> when<00:05:11.040> you're<00:05:11.390> finished<00:05:12.390> and

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
when we finish with their hair line is

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.070 
when we finish with their hair line is
that<00:05:15.540> you<00:05:15.720> might<00:05:16.050> want<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.500> go<00:05:16.650> back<00:05:16.890> and<00:05:17.160> use
