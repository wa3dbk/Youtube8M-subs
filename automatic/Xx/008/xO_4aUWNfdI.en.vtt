00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the most important aspects of this boss

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.380 
the most important aspects of this boss
is<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.260> because<00:00:43.410> she<00:00:43.770> uses<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> spear<00:00:44.700> she<00:00:45.239> has

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
is that because she uses a spear she has

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.310 
is that because she uses a spear she has
very<00:00:45.629> long<00:00:45.899> melee<00:00:46.320> attack<00:00:46.620> range<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:49.110> not

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
very long melee attack range so I do not

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
very long melee attack range so I do not
recommend<00:00:49.680> trying<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.280> roll<00:00:50.460> backwards<00:00:51.030> away

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
recommend trying to roll backwards away

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
recommend trying to roll backwards away
from<00:00:51.719> her<00:00:52.110> melee<00:00:52.590> attacks<00:00:52.890> you'll<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.520> get

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
from her melee attacks you'll just get

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.770 
from her melee attacks you'll just get
hit<00:00:53.879> anyway<00:00:57.739> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:59.010> also<00:00:59.219> dodge<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.300> swings

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
hit anyway you can also dodge the swings

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.039 
hit anyway you can also dodge the swings
of<00:01:00.930> her<00:01:01.020> spear<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> side<00:01:01.910> but<00:01:02.910> her<00:01:03.539> arcing

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.480 
swings are a little bit more complicated
to<00:01:06.090> dodge<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.770> preferable<00:01:08.220> just

frequently enough that predicting her

can<00:02:13.120> be<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.360> little<00:02:13.690> bit<00:02:13.900> tricky<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.010> again<00:02:15.610> we

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
can be a little bit tricky so again we

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.670 
can be a little bit tricky so again we
recommend<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.360> unless<00:02:17.170> you're<00:02:17.380> very

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
recommend that unless you're very

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.070 
recommend that unless you're very
confident<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:18.280> your<00:02:18.400> ability<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:19.210> roll<00:02:19.900> at

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
exactly the right time just come here

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.800 

this<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.849> another<00:02:31.060> good<00:02:31.209> opportunity<00:02:31.780> to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
this is another good opportunity to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.140 
this is another good opportunity to
damage<00:02:32.230> her<00:02:32.439> when<00:02:32.860> she's<00:02:33.159> lunging<00:02:33.730> forward<00:02:33.939> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
damage her when she's lunging forward to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.729 
damage her when she's lunging forward to
retrieve<00:02:34.480> her<00:02:34.659> head<00:02:34.840> after<00:02:35.230> throwing<00:02:35.439> it<00:02:35.650> to

retrieve her head after throwing it to

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.210 
retrieve her head after throwing it to
do<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:35.950> explosion<00:02:36.459> attack<00:02:37.349> also<00:02:38.349> it's<00:02:38.980> worth

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
do the explosion attack also it's worth

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.369 
do the explosion attack also it's worth
noting<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.819> can<00:02:40.180> cut<00:02:40.450> off<00:02:40.599> mythos<00:02:41.049> tail

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
noting that you can cut off mythos tail

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.380 
noting that you can cut off mythos tail
I've<00:02:41.650> gotten<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.549> lot<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.730> questions<00:02:43.269> about

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
I've gotten a lot of questions about

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.119 
I've gotten a lot of questions about
this<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.140> comments<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.650> my<00:02:44.769> own<00:02:44.920> videos

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
this in the comments of my own videos

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.729 
this in the comments of my own videos
and<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:46.359> seems<00:02:46.659> worthwhile<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.290> address<00:02:47.590> it

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
and it seems worthwhile to address it

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.979 
and it seems worthwhile to address it
now<00:02:47.890> cutting<00:02:48.670> off<00:02:48.819> mythos<00:02:49.239> tail<00:02:49.480> doesn't<00:02:49.750> give

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
now cutting off mythos tail doesn't give

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.280 
now cutting off mythos tail doesn't give
you<00:02:50.079> any<00:02:50.109> items<00:02:50.739> unfortunately<00:02:51.519> but<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:53.019> does

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
you any items unfortunately but it does

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.039 
you any items unfortunately but it does
make<00:02:53.560> her<00:02:54.129> rotating<00:02:55.000> tail<00:02:55.239> swing<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:55.810> little

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
make her rotating tail swing a little

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.130 
make her rotating tail swing a little
bit<00:02:56.140> less<00:02:56.319> dangerous<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:58.269> that's<00:02:58.780> really<00:02:59.019> the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
bit less dangerous so that's really the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.349 
bit less dangerous so that's really the
only<00:02:59.230> benefit<00:02:59.859> to<00:03:00.099> severing<00:03:00.609> her<00:03:00.760> tail<00:03:01.000> you

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
only benefit to severing her tail you

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:07.229 
only benefit to severing her tail you
don't<00:03:01.540> get<00:03:01.659> anything<00:03:01.870> else<00:03:02.139> for<00:03:02.409> it<00:03:05.849> so<00:03:06.849> what

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
don't get anything else for it so what

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.339 
don't get anything else for it so what
you<00:03:07.359> guys<00:03:07.569> have<00:03:07.840> seen<00:03:08.049> up<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.319> this<00:03:08.470> point<00:03:09.090> is

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
essentially how the fight will play out

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.449 
essentially how the fight will play out
for<00:03:12.970> most<00:03:13.659> maley<00:03:14.109> builds<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.829> aren't<00:03:15.280> using

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
because with magic you can just stand

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.559 
because with magic you can just stand
