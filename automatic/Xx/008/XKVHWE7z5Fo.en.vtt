Duncan was killed by some angry chickens

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.960 
Duncan was killed by some angry chickens
that<00:02:38.890> spawned<00:02:39.310> when<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.580> picked<00:02:39.760> them<00:02:39.910> up

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
that spawned when you picked them up

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.640 
that spawned when you picked them up
without<00:02:40.180> actually<00:02:40.600> looking<00:02:40.690> okay<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:41.440> there's

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
without actually looking okay so there's

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.620 
without actually looking okay so there's
a<00:02:41.710> number<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.400> items<00:02:42.550> all<00:02:42.910> over<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.240> over<00:02:43.600> the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
a number of items all over the over the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.680 
a number of items all over the over the
over<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.920> map<00:02:45.730> now<00:02:46.090> you'll<00:02:46.240> see<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.450> it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
over the the map now you'll see that it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.690 
over the the map now you'll see that it
says<00:02:46.810> you're<00:02:46.990> teleporting<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.770> xx<00:02:48.280> seconds

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
says you're teleporting in xx seconds

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.580 
says you're teleporting in xx seconds
now<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:49.480> basically<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:50.170> am<00:02:50.290> not

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
now that just basically I am not

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.440 
now that just basically I am not
actually<00:02:50.980> playing<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.030> game<00:02:52.060> at<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.420> moment

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
actually playing the game at the moment

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.180 
actually playing the game at the moment
so<00:02:52.780> it's<00:02:52.930> it's<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.320> kind<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.530> going<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.980> loop

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
so it's it's just kind of going to loop

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.190 
so it's it's just kind of going to loop
but<00:02:54.730> when<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.030> timer<00:02:55.300> reaches<00:02:55.690> zero<00:02:55.720> it'll

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
but when the timer reaches zero it'll

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.560 
but when the timer reaches zero it'll
randomly<00:02:56.440> teleport<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.370> somewhere<00:02:58.060> on<00:02:58.270> this

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
randomly teleport you somewhere on this

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.450 
randomly teleport you somewhere on this
map<00:02:58.780> okay<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.890> that's<00:03:00.130> kind<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.400> the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
map okay so that that's kind of the

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.380 
map okay so that that's kind of the
thing<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.090> becomes<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.510> kind<00:03:01.990> of<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:03.390> strategy

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
thing so it becomes a kind of a strategy

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.850 
thing so it becomes a kind of a strategy
to<00:03:04.570> kind<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.960> check<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.530> see<00:03:05.680> if<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.830> item

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
to kind of check to see if the item

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.960 
to kind of check to see if the item
smokes<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.910> then<00:03:07.390> not<00:03:07.960> teleport<00:03:08.620> okay<00:03:09.280> go

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
smokes and then not teleport okay go

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.130 
smokes and then not teleport okay go
