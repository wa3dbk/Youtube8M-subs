who<00:01:53.570> what<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.740> want<00:01:55.950> to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
who what was that that's what we want to

who what was that that's what we want to
go<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.760> get<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.909> little<00:01:57.060> bit<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
go for it and we get a little bit of a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
go for it and we get a little bit of a
look<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> game<00:01:57.900> obviously<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.619> dark<00:01:59.100> game

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
look at the game obviously a dark game

look at the game obviously a dark game

Engine 4 here for ps4 to talk to me a

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.370 
Engine 4 here for ps4 to talk to me a
little<00:02:06.270> bit<00:02:06.420> about<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:06.900> that<00:02:07.049> means

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
little bit about what what that means

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.960 
little bit about what what that means
and<00:02:07.650> some<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> effects<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and some of the effects and the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.429 
and some of the effects and the
atmosphere<00:02:09.479> you'll<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.750> able<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.959> create<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
atmosphere you'll be able to create the

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.489 
atmosphere you'll be able to create the
so<00:02:11.310> we're<00:02:11.519> we're<00:02:12.030> unreal<00:02:12.900> through<00:02:13.319> and

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:13.499 
so we're we're unreal through and

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.750 
so we're we're unreal through and
through<00:02:13.650> developer<00:02:14.159> we've<00:02:14.279> been<00:02:14.459> working

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
through developer we've been working

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.759 
through developer we've been working
with<00:02:14.790> unreal<00:02:15.180> for<00:02:15.510> many<00:02:15.779> many<00:02:15.989> many<00:02:16.230> years<00:02:16.319> and

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
with unreal for many many many years and

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.900 
with unreal for many many many years and
we<00:02:16.829> were<00:02:17.010> able<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.249> get

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
we were able to get

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.680 
we were able to get
light<00:02:18.090> or<00:02:18.720> actually<00:02:19.140> unreal<00:02:19.440> for<00:02:20.480> GDC<00:02:21.480> last

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
light or actually unreal for GDC last

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.810 
light or actually unreal for GDC last
year<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.500> big<00:02:22.980> thing<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.340> they

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
year and the one big thing that they

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.450 
year and the one big thing that they
added<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.210> four<00:02:24.600> was<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.460> procedurally

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
added to four was this procedurally

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.230 
added to four was this procedurally
generated<00:02:27.290> content<00:02:28.290> drop<00:02:28.590> where<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:30.060> make

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
generated content drop where you make

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.060 
generated content drop where you make
volumes<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:30.990> could<00:02:31.140> put<00:02:31.350> what's<00:02:31.680> inside

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
volumes and you could put what's inside

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.430 
volumes and you could put what's inside
of<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.610> will<00:02:33.000> fill<00:02:33.330> fill<00:02:33.840> rooms<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
of it and it will fill fill rooms and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.010 
of it and it will fill fill rooms and
and<00:02:34.650> we<00:02:35.190> looked<00:02:35.430> at<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:35.880> wait<00:02:36.600> we<00:02:36.810> can

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
and we looked at this like wait we can

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.620 
and we looked at this like wait we can
do<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:38.160> can<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.490> take<00:02:38.700> logic<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.420> do<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
do this but can it take logic and do it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.770 
do this but can it take logic and do it
as<00:02:39.750> well<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.500> did<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.550> we<00:02:41.730> made<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> room

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
as well and it did and so we made a room

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.320 
as well and it did and so we made a room
generation<00:02:43.470> system<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.940> we're<00:02:45.090> using

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
generation system that we're using

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.950 
generation system that we're using
unreal<00:02:46.110> blueprints<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:48.060> populating

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
unreal blueprints and so it's populating

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.470 
unreal blueprints and so it's populating
not<00:02:49.200> only<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.680> world

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
not only the world

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.700 
not only the world
procedurally<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.020> each<00:02:52.170> room<00:02:52.410> will<00:02:52.560> be

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
procedurally so each room will be

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.530 
procedurally so each room will be
different<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.970> elements<00:02:54.420> will

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
different and the and the elements will

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.180 
different and the and the elements will
be<00:02:54.570> different<00:02:54.990> but<00:02:55.380> it's<00:02:55.500> also<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.890> horror

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
be different but it's also the horror

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.360 
be different but it's also the horror
and<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:57.450> shock<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.740> placement<00:02:59.070> of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
and the shock and the placement of

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.810 
and the shock and the placement of
ghosts<00:02:59.850> and<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.090> placement<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.630> anything<00:03:01.260> is

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
ghosts and the placement of anything is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.940 
ghosts and the placement of anything is
completely<00:03:02.820> different<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.440> really

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
completely different and it's really

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.990 
completely different and it's really
hard<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.550> demo

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
hard to demo

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.870 
hard to demo
I<00:03:06.950> think<00:03:07.950> horror<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.400> all<00:03:08.550> about<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
I think horror is all about the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.630 
I think horror is all about the
unexpected<00:03:09.360> having<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.410> procedural<00:03:11.130> system<00:03:11.310> to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
unexpected having a procedural system to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.760 
unexpected having a procedural system to
kind<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.910> build<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.300> randomized<00:03:13.020> but<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.530> mean

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
kind of build a randomized but I mean

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.900 
kind of build a randomized but I mean
not<00:03:13.890> randomized<00:03:14.370> you're<00:03:14.490> not<00:03:14.580> just<00:03:14.760> throwing

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
not randomized you're not just throwing

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.210 
not randomized you're not just throwing
them<00:03:15.300> on<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> table<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.230> it's<00:03:16.680> scattering

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
them on a table and it's scattering

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.100 
them on a table and it's scattering
willy-nilly<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.060> mean<00:03:18.300> it's<00:03:18.540> still<00:03:18.810> there's<00:03:19.050> a

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
willy-nilly I mean it's still there's a

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.990 
willy-nilly I mean it's still there's a
logic<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:19.710> you<00:03:19.830> said<00:03:20.070> there<00:03:20.250> are<00:03:20.340> systems<00:03:20.850> in

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
logic like you said there are systems in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.820 
logic like you said there are systems in
place<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.750> guide<00:03:21.959> this<00:03:22.140> experience<00:03:22.560> they'll

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
place to guide this experience they'll

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.990 
place to guide this experience they'll
talk<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.010> me<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> little<00:03:23.340> bit<00:03:23.490> about<00:03:23.640> what<00:03:23.880> we're

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
talk to me a little bit about what we're

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.460 
talk to me a little bit about what we're
seeing<00:03:24.030> here<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.570> mean<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.900> looks<00:03:25.050> like<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.170> cell

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
seeing here I mean it looks like a cell

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.080 
seeing here I mean it looks like a cell
phone<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.370> looks<00:03:26.520> like<00:03:26.610> that's<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.880> source

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
phone and it looks like that's a source

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.580 
phone and it looks like that's a source
of<00:03:27.180> illumination<00:03:27.450> right<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.170> little<00:03:28.260> bit<00:03:28.380> about

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
of illumination right a little bit about

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.800 
of illumination right a little bit about
some<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:28.860> tools<00:03:29.070> at<00:03:29.430> your<00:03:29.700> disposal<00:03:29.940> as

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
some of the tools at your disposal as

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.600 
some of the tools at your disposal as
you<00:03:31.140> navigate<00:03:31.620> these<00:03:31.740> environments<00:03:32.400> so

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
you navigate these environments so

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.500 
you navigate these environments so
anytime<00:03:33.120> anyone<00:03:34.040> needs<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.280> light<00:03:35.490> or<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.450> a

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
anytime anyone needs a light or is in a

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.760 
anytime anyone needs a light or is in a
dark<00:03:36.690> place<00:03:36.780> they<00:03:37.140> pull<00:03:37.350> out<00:03:37.380> their<00:03:37.560> cell

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
dark place they pull out their cell

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.240 
dark place they pull out their cell
phone<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.610> it's<00:03:39.030> just<00:03:39.440> true<00:03:40.440> tech<00:03:40.890> that's

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
phone it's it's just true tech that's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.150 
phone it's it's just true tech that's
everyone<00:03:42.000> has<00:03:42.209> even<00:03:42.510> kids<00:03:42.780> have<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:43.950> is

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
everyone has even kids have and so is

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.110 
everyone has even kids have and so is
one<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.370> those<00:03:44.490> things<00:03:44.670> there's<00:03:44.820> like<00:03:44.940> this

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
one of those things there's like this

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.780 
one of those things there's like this
makes<00:03:45.420> sense<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.020> we<00:03:46.650> put<00:03:46.980> different<00:03:47.520> items

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
makes sense and we put different items

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.930 
makes sense and we put different items
so<00:03:48.030> for<00:03:48.600> example<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.110> glow<00:03:49.350> stick<00:03:49.709> or<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.730> can

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
so for example the glow stick or you can

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.910 
so for example the glow stick or you can
find<00:03:51.209> flares<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.989> each<00:03:52.410> one<00:03:52.709> of<00:03:52.800> those

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
find flares and each one of those

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.710 
find flares and each one of those
actually<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.340> game<00:03:53.700> mechanics<00:03:54.239> connected

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
actually have game mechanics connected

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.540 
actually have game mechanics connected
to<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.230> glow<00:03:55.410> sticks<00:03:55.680> will<00:03:55.890> allow<00:03:56.489> you

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
to it so the glow sticks will allow you

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.820 
to it so the glow sticks will allow you
to<00:03:56.760> find<00:03:57.090> clues<00:03:57.630> or<00:03:58.050> allow<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.500> find

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
to find clues or allow you to find

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.280 
to find clues or allow you to find
different<00:03:59.190> elements<00:03:59.610> the<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.630> flares<00:04:00.959> will

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
different elements the the flares will

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.520 
different elements the the flares will
actually<00:04:02.090> fort<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.450> ghosts<00:04:03.870> or<00:04:03.959> scare<00:04:04.380> them

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
actually fort the ghosts or scare them

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.650 
actually fort the ghosts or scare them
away<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.430> way<00:04:05.550> that<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.820> flare<00:04:06.120> works<00:04:06.390> is

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
away but the way that the flare works is

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.350 
away but the way that the flare works is
it's<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:07.680> violent<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.820> it's<00:04:09.030> throwing

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
it's just so violent that it's throwing

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.210 
it's just so violent that it's throwing
shadows<00:04:09.989> all<00:04:10.200> over<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.530> place<00:04:10.739> using

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
shadows all over the place using

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.340 
shadows all over the place using
real-time<00:04:11.730> lighting<00:04:12.180> which<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.230> other

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
real-time lighting which is the other

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.400 
real-time lighting which is the other
big<00:04:13.590> thing<00:04:13.830> that<00:04:13.860> unreal<00:04:14.550> gave<00:04:14.760> us<00:04:14.940> is

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
big thing that unreal gave us is

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.900 
big thing that unreal gave us is
completely<00:04:16.410> dynamic<00:04:16.590> lighting<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.580> it<00:04:17.730> looks

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
completely dynamic lighting and it looks

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.630 
completely dynamic lighting and it looks
beautiful<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.620> allowed<00:04:19.950> us<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.400> make

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
beautiful and it allowed us to make

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.340 
beautiful and it allowed us to make
these<00:04:20.880> worlds<00:04:21.330> if<00:04:21.570> we<00:04:21.750> were<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.930> do<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.169> in

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
these worlds if we were to do this in

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.990 
these worlds if we were to do this in
Unreal<00:04:22.620> 3<00:04:22.860> each<00:04:23.070> time<00:04:23.400> we<00:04:23.550> would<00:04:23.669> make<00:04:23.850> the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
Unreal 3 each time we would make the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.250 
Unreal 3 each time we would make the
world<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.330> lighting<00:04:24.630> would<00:04:24.780> have<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.110> get

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
world the lighting would have to get

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.960 
world the lighting would have to get
baked<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.890> rice<00:04:26.220> day<00:04:26.460> we're<00:04:26.640> talking<00:04:26.880> about

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
baked and rice day we're talking about

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.270 
baked and rice day we're talking about
like

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
like

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.430 
like
per-pixel<00:04:27.790> real-time<00:04:28.540> lighting<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.170> kind<00:04:29.380> of

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
per-pixel real-time lighting the kind of

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.380 
per-pixel real-time lighting the kind of
stuff<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.800> used<00:04:29.980> to<00:04:30.100> see<00:04:30.250> in<00:04:30.370> Doom<00:04:30.580> 3<00:04:30.610> but<00:04:31.210> you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
stuff that used to see in Doom 3 but you

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.760 
stuff that used to see in Doom 3 but you
guys<00:04:31.630> are<00:04:31.810> doing<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:32.110> in<00:04:32.170> a<00:04:32.200> whole<00:04:32.380> new<00:04:32.560> way

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
guys are doing it in a whole new way

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.290 
guys are doing it in a whole new way
here<00:04:33.040> with<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.250> game<00:04:33.490> yeah<00:04:33.730> so<00:04:33.940> it<00:04:34.030> allows<00:04:34.270> us

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
here with the game yeah so it allows us

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.390 
here with the game yeah so it allows us
to<00:04:34.510> have<00:04:34.750> flexibility<00:04:35.290> but<00:04:35.500> also<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:36.130> the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
to have flexibility but also the the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.490 
to have flexibility but also the the
complex<00:04:36.970> textures<00:04:37.510> that<00:04:37.690> they're<00:04:37.900> that

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
complex textures that they're that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.660 
complex textures that they're that
they're<00:04:38.650> coming<00:04:38.890> out<00:04:38.980> we<00:04:39.070> can<00:04:39.250> make<00:04:39.400> just

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
they're coming out we can make just

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.750 
they're coming out we can make just
insane<00:04:40.180> shaders<00:04:40.690> that<00:04:40.960> will<00:04:41.650> manipulate<00:04:42.250> and

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
insane shaders that will manipulate and

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.700 
insane shaders that will manipulate and
kind<00:04:43.030> of<00:04:43.120> move<00:04:43.390> around<00:04:43.540> and<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.170> it's<00:04:44.290> really

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
kind of move around and and it's really

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.710 
kind of move around and and it's really
awesome<00:04:45.070> in<00:04:45.460> our<00:04:45.580> and<00:04:45.730> our<00:04:45.880> team<00:04:46.120> was

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
awesome in our and our team was

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.570 
awesome in our and our team was
relatively<00:04:47.440> small<00:04:47.710> when<00:04:47.890> we<00:04:48.040> first<00:04:48.280> started

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
relatively small when we first started

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.890 
relatively small when we first started
working<00:04:48.730> on<00:04:48.910> this<00:04:48.970> this<00:04:49.330> was<00:04:49.480> really<00:04:49.870> just

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
working on this this was really just

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.890 
working on this this was really just
kind<00:04:50.290> of<00:04:50.320> like<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.500> weekend<00:04:51.070> idea<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:52.630> grew

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
kind of like a weekend idea and it grew

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.510 
kind of like a weekend idea and it grew
and<00:04:52.930> grew<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.380> grew<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.710> it's<00:04:53.800> becoming

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
and grew and grew and it's becoming

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.160 
and grew and grew and it's becoming
something<00:04:55.210> very<00:04:55.450> interesting<00:04:55.780> because

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
something very interesting because

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.290 
something very interesting because
signing<00:04:56.620> with<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:56.890> list<00:04:57.130> done<00:04:57.970> bringing<00:04:58.180> it

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
signing with that list done bringing it

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.790 
signing with that list done bringing it
to<00:04:58.390> the<00:04:58.510> PlayStation<00:04:59.140> it's<00:04:59.290> no<00:04:59.440> longer<00:04:59.680> just

to the PlayStation it's no longer just

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.100 
to the PlayStation it's no longer just
gonna<00:05:00.190> be<00:05:00.310> this<00:05:00.460> little<00:05:00.790> indie<00:05:01.120> PC<00:05:01.540> thing<00:05:01.810> and

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110
