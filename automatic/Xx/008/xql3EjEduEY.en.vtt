dogs<00:00:07.620> love<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.160> joke<00:00:08.460> they<00:00:08.700> eat<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.090> up<00:00:09.450> like

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
dogs love that joke they eat it up like

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.890 
dogs love that joke they eat it up like
grass<00:00:10.200> which<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.460> guess<00:00:11.880> they<00:00:12.090> usually<00:00:12.269> vomit

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
grass which I guess they usually vomit

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.930 
grass which I guess they usually vomit
out<00:00:12.990> later<00:00:13.320> but<00:00:13.650> then<00:00:13.950> they<00:00:14.130> usually<00:00:14.340> eat<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
out later but then they usually eat the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730 
out later but then they usually eat the
vomit<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> think<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.080> analogy<00:00:16.560> holds

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
vomit so I think the analogy holds

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.859 
vomit so I think the analogy holds
