don't<00:03:45.210> waste<00:03:45.330> time<00:03:45.660> like<00:03:45.960> what<00:03:46.110> I'm<00:03:46.200> doing

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:17.550 

well

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.740

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
all right now here's a little sort of

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.010 
all right now here's a little sort of
difficult<00:04:20.200> sequence<00:04:20.859> because<00:04:21.220> there's<00:04:22.020> a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
difficult sequence because there's a

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.750 
difficult sequence because there's a
bunch<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.710> guys<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.310> see<00:04:24.490> they<00:04:24.580> have<00:04:24.700> a

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
bunch of guys and you see they have a

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.960 
bunch of guys and you see they have a
big<00:04:24.970> turret<00:04:25.300> at<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.450> top

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.780 

so<00:04:28.570> first<00:04:29.190> pick<00:04:30.190> off<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.460> guys<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.730> are

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
so first pick off the guys that are

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.070 
so first pick off the guys that are
running<00:04:31.060> on<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.210> step<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:31.720> might<00:04:31.900> have<00:04:32.020> to

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
running on the step so you might have to

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.210 
running on the step so you might have to
blind<00:04:32.380> fire<00:04:32.620> them<00:04:34.230> now<00:04:35.230> there's<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.650> few<00:04:36.010> ways

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220
