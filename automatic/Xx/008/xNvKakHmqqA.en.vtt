00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.350
 You will need two boxes of 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:28.789

 it will only be the feet on the table 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.690
 then you will cover the same so 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.450
 The water is ours and the insulation will stay that way. 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:15.310
 so you're covering it all over the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.430
 Ready table will stand if you can use 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.340

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.550
 then you will get a symbol of the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.220

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:01.990
 Then you'll get the pet bottle and go. 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:05.080
 cut under the block for you to do 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.950
 The base of the chair you go is cut into 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.950
 up the face 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.959
 Are you going to use these two parts? 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.840
 you will cut from that line and 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.880
 then cut the part of the other line 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 and then will cut the bottom line goes 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.160
 accept this way 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.340
 so you will get the electrical tape 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.340
 and will cover in the tone part 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.880
