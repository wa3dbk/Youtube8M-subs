this yes okay and then she's going to
slide<00:01:30.689> into<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.289> frog<00:01:31.710> position<00:01:34.429> there<00:01:35.429> are

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
slide into a frog position there are

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.840 
slide into a frog position there are
many<00:01:35.729> ways<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.390> frogs<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.399> is<00:01:38.429> one<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
many ways to do frogs so this is one of

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.060 
many ways to do frogs so this is one of
them<00:01:40.219> that's<00:01:41.219> probably<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.700> easiest<00:01:41.729> and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
them that's probably the easiest and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.219 
them that's probably the easiest and
then<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.850> open<00:01:45.890> square<00:01:46.890> frogs<00:01:47.429> is

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
then this like open square frogs is

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.980 
then this like open square frogs is
harder<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:51.240> gives<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> an

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
harder and that gives you more of an

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.969 
harder and that gives you more of an
active<00:01:52.409> stretch<00:01:55.219> okay<00:01:56.840> okay<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.469> now<00:01:58.649> I'm

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
active stretch okay okay so now I'm

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.720 
active stretch okay okay so now I'm

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.740 
and and that gives you a good stretch in
the<00:02:49.590> front<00:02:49.710> of<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.040> hips<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.540> can

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the front of your hips and so you can

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:06.480

stretch<00:02:54.930> many<00:02:55.320> ways<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:55.890> there

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.730
