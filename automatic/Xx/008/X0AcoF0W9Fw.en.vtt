for this one in this one of course and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.420 
for this one in this one of course and
he'll<00:02:10.080> do<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.530> he<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.130> do<00:02:11.250> about<00:02:13.430> 812

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.299 

I<00:07:01.530> don't<00:07:02.530> know<00:07:02.620> if<00:07:02.770> it<00:07:02.860> ever<00:07:02.949> gonna<00:07:03.160> work<00:07:03.370> again

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:05.309 
I don't know if it ever gonna work again

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:10.359 
I don't know if it ever gonna work again
see<00:07:05.849> it<00:07:06.239> just<00:07:06.569> keeps<00:07:06.929> on<00:07:07.079> going<00:07:07.529> and<00:07:07.709> going

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:10.369 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:13.609 

this<00:07:11.369> is<00:07:11.549> why<00:07:11.729> it<00:07:11.789> wouldn't<00:07:12.179> go<00:07:13.019> straight<00:07:13.439> when

00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:13.619 
this is why it wouldn't go straight when

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.649 
this is why it wouldn't go straight when
I<00:07:13.649> tried<00:07:13.949> to<00:07:14.129> show<00:07:14.339> you<00:07:14.399> it<00:07:14.729> it<00:07:15.269> wouldn't<00:07:15.569> go

I tried to show you it it wouldn't go

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:19.219 
I tried to show you it it wouldn't go
straight<00:07:16.549> because<00:07:17.549> it<00:07:17.699> was<00:07:17.789> fried<00:07:18.059> out<00:07:18.239> the
