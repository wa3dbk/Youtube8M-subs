00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
ski crystals when I first saw this watch

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.650 
ski crystals when I first saw this watch
I<00:01:02.160> did<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.520> know<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> watch<00:01:03.420> I
