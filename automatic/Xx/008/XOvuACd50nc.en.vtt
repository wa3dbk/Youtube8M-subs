00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.170
 I play big Reken in this issue presents from left statements 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.059
 his team Â«How much good Game Boy Perfomance Venture a doctor 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.599
 from the year 1991 for you 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.689
 but the game did not appear in the black and a year later 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.419
 Also in Germany 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.949
 Strictly speaking, the offender is most of the time on the 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:25.550
 building 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.859
 but already in the mid-1990s on Friday appear his debut on the 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.290
 Stage it in Japan the game here is based on Adventure a 2 on 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.340
 leaves the panel 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.550
 some of Switzerland found a handheld version again 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.010
 but I will once again basically easier 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.080
 Main protagonist is paid and intensity stock prices warlocks as 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.589
 16-year-old kidnapped 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.850
 Of course the Kings must help them 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.410
 because if this little subtle backstory two of the guide 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.000
 and read about the games packaging she will be in the game during the Imperial era 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 mentioned that is a pity but probably not to realize that 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.010
 in total 18x now we are out with our Higgins and collecting 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.539
 there 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.280
 Some extras hatch Pauli out of eggs 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 For example, we are equipped with a tor-trauma and we can 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.220
 against coughing sniffles and bats voices and further operated 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.030
 do 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.300
 as a lucrative we ride on some oversized change 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.290
 The NPD fires in its almost saved from the newer game reminds 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.250
 or states can stop 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.820
 or we are allowed the reference to a giant tortoise Last but 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.670
 Not least, we are also on the skateboard somewhere safe one 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.990
 Allusion to other games has 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.760
 Gameplay and Adventure Island is classic overall damage 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.770
 but without really claim 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.850
 The main difficulty is that the opponent does not jump in 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.810
 because we can die immediately 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.070
 rather, we have to use a weapon in it in their intensive 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.030
 Provides 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.410
 where no hammer to throw 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.400
 or no dinosaur of the stars spits up 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700
 then we have to try at the right moment to blow up the opponents 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.700
 another difficulty is a kind of life or energy indicator on the 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.189
 bottom of the screen 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.959
 If we use the weapon too often, it will decrease rapidly 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.919
 Basically, we lose a lesson over time anyway 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.959
 Refresh the demo with food collected on the way 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.459
 we can not reach the end of a level in time before the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.159
 Energy indicator has dropped to zero, we can start again from the beginning 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.560
 jumping off at the right time is sometimes the same 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.299
 vital to one of the most popular pitfalls and the reason 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.949
 Much frustration is the level design itself 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.680
 we have to go over protrusions and rivers most as far as possible 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:41.110
 edge 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.160
 GW jump off so we arrive on the other side otherwise 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.630
 time after time we go to ruin 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.400
 The individual sections are again structured a little harsh 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.270
 so that you do not have to start over here at the end of a level waiting 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.660
 always a boss to watch these are synonymous but that too 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.009
 the rest of the money brings little demanding 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.679
 in a first boss we send within two seconds becomes an important 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:05.739
 Game you are 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.739
 "If we get another game with the fire 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.170
 a second bus takes a little longer 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.459
 but that is because the bad guy is sure you are stuck in the house 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.279
 withdraws 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.729
 but still second best attacker is 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:22.019
 and, ultimately, apparently ends up having more difficulty with objects and opponents 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.999
 in which we do not touch out to touch 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.819
 to disable as a final boss 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.819
 actually one should assume that it is exactly the other way around 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:35.579
 In addition, the individual levels are sometimes very similar 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.890
 At times I had the feeling that I had been there before 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.610
 and if those are not met in between a godfather of new enemy types here 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.850
 It really does not matter that we are in the bakery 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.889
 and not level 1 anymore 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.299
 the main leak 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.760
 It has shown similar creativity because in the long run this is easy 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.389
 just kill 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.879
 but it is good that at least the melody in the fight with the bosses one 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:01.759
 others is 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.759
 and also the manta waits tension 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.709
 whoever sticks to it can decide in a few hours 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.099
 pull through 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.169
 actually only the life of the batteries or the stand in the way 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.559
 own brood fast 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:19.469
 because Herzens Schmalspur job at Kampfkraft neatly many Frustmomente 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:20.349
 to care 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.560
 the value for money was at the time of its publication 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:24.300
 modest 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.990
 if you just look at a repetitive soundtrack sometimes two 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.360
 wants Alba commanded 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.860
 the gameplay is also rather average 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.619
 That's why we only have 53 percent
