00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
hoping for two things here one is a good

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.250 
hoping for two things here one is a good
flight<00:00:13.440> but<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.309> other<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.900> GoPro

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
flight but the other is that the GoPro

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.810 
flight but the other is that the GoPro
doesn't<00:00:16.590> fall<00:00:16.980> off<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.310> bottom<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
doesn't fall off the bottom of the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.109 
doesn't fall off the bottom of the
airplane<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:18.990> mounted<00:00:19.880> with<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.000> of

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
airplane I have it mounted with one of

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.779
