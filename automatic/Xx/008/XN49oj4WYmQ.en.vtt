00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 today unfortunately we have to attend a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.349
 another extremely unpleasant event e 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.630
 so I believe the demonstration of one 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.839
 will I do not know in whose hands why not 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.720
 I guess he can have an idea like that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.820
 insane to damage a reality such as the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.230
 however, ferrosud has the will 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 stubborn to hinder consolidation e 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.300
 the development of this society that I believe 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.710
 so much good can be a pact for 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.360
 territory of Matera in two successive ones 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.030
 two successive moments came 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.270
 made randomly in quotation marks 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.879
 two fires that affected part 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.800
 of the roadbed and on the occasion not 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.350
 it was possible to understand what they could 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.809
 be the triggering elements here too 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.170
 of this behavior however in the case of 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.270
 species occurred before 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.550
 that trains should pass through 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 been repaired 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.659
 both times the reasons it is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.270
 difficult to understand that 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.210
 succeed and difficult to understand the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.460
 deviance of those who can concoct 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.490
 such an operation 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.979
 in principle the denominator 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.040
 common of any motivation is that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.830
 to damage ferrosud to put on 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.460
 risk of ferrosud and I also say of 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.130
 cause harm to those who are iron at work 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.290
 why then end this through 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.259
 property damage yes 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.960
 held jackie of iron on live two 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.000
 problems one the way we can 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.040
 deliver the carriages that undoubtedly 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.640
 they are objects that are difficult to 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.670
 carry because 26 meters and loose change 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.009
 of length 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.830
 they import transport difficulties 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.990
 from the other point the arrangement of the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.659
 track which is also owned by 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.670
 a consortium of companies and therefore 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.220
 will have to go through 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.250
 deliberations or will have to see a 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.080
 immediate intervention by iron 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.300
 on this we will evaluate later 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.790
 what is certain is that the dwarf is not small 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.790
 because in seeing this it comes to 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.400
 rearm over 400 meters of road 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.530
 undeniably there is also a via ferrata 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.390
 the problem that not only is there a risk 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.739
 of penalties but there will be 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.160
 possibility of delays in 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:31.060
 billings we will no doubt move 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.190
 to try to make this happen 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.700
 be recognized as a force cause 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.370
 greater by railways a clear 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.140
 sabotage to extremely serious work 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.680
 one of the most serious goes to mind to which 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.780
 we are assisting in this moment in the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.060
 in the industrial area of ​​the province of 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.959
 matera 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.450
 we believe the judiciary should 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.459
 urgently investigate to avoid giving alibis 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.930
 to no one who is not in this province 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.359
 can make investments 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.299
 we need to save work 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.250
 to safeguard workers and that 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.140
 who is struggling with giulia an act 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.069
 extremely song 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.069
 nice nice
