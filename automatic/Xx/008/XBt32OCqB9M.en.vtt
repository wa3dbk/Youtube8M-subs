00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
ground I'm overlooking the rift in storm

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.820 
ground I'm overlooking the rift in storm
peak<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:06.210> want<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.480> get<00:00:06.600> over<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.379> spot

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
peak and I want to get over to this spot

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.709 
peak and I want to get over to this spot
here<00:00:10.190> alright<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:11.429> now<00:00:11.670> i<00:00:11.700> can't<00:00:12.059> go<00:00:12.300> straight

here alright so now i can't go straight
up<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:12.990> mountain<00:00:13.259> range<00:00:13.620> here<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.250> i'm<00:00:14.340> going

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
up this mountain range here so i'm going

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.830 
up this mountain range here so i'm going
to<00:00:14.549> turn<00:00:14.820> around<00:00:15.500> come<00:00:16.500> down<00:00:16.680> over<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
to turn around come down over here and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.529 
to turn around come down over here and
basically<00:00:18.840> walk<00:00:19.380> past<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:21.090> stuff

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
basically walk past all of this stuff

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:37.480 
basically walk past all of this stuff
out<00:00:21.750> toward<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.740> sea

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.210 

I'm<00:00:38.030> just<00:00:38.270> gonna<00:00:38.390> keep<00:00:39.050> on<00:00:39.230> playing<00:00:39.770> all<00:00:40.160> of

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
I'm just gonna keep on playing all of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.420 
I'm just gonna keep on playing all of
the<00:00:40.850> way<00:00:41.060> here<00:00:41.570> because<00:00:41.930> it's<00:00:42.160> it's<00:00:43.160> kind<00:00:43.400> of

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
the way here because it's it's kind of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.640 
the way here because it's it's kind of
long<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:43.910> involved<00:00:44.150> and<00:00:45.110> I<00:00:45.260> don't<00:00:45.470> really

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
long and involved and I don't really

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.800 
long and involved and I don't really
want<00:00:45.830> to<00:00:45.890> skip<00:00:46.340> spots<00:00:47.030> because<00:00:47.330> it's<00:00:47.510> it's

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
want to skip spots because it's it's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.980 
want to skip spots because it's it's
already<00:00:48.260> kind<00:00:48.500> of<00:00:48.530> easy<00:00:48.740> to<00:00:48.830> get<00:00:49.040> lost<00:00:49.990> all

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
already kind of easy to get lost all

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.180 
already kind of easy to get lost all
right<00:00:51.140> now<00:00:51.290> you<00:00:51.350> can't<00:00:51.650> really<00:00:51.800> get<00:00:51.980> up<00:00:52.100> this

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
right now you can't really get up this

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.800 
right now you can't really get up this
way<00:00:52.400> so<00:00:52.460> we're<00:00:52.940> gonna<00:00:53.030> go<00:00:53.210> ahead<00:00:53.240> and<00:00:53.390> go<00:00:53.570> down

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
way so we're gonna go ahead and go down

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.230 
way so we're gonna go ahead and go down
here<00:00:54.200> this<00:00:54.770> whole<00:00:54.980> area<00:00:55.250> looks<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:55.970> lot<00:00:56.180> more

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
here this whole area looks a lot more

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.760 
here this whole area looks a lot more
dangerous<00:00:56.870> than<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:57.080> is<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:57.290> think<00:00:57.650> you're

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
dangerous than it is you think you're

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.250 
dangerous than it is you think you're
going<00:00:57.950> to<00:00:58.010> fall<00:00:58.250> off<00:00:58.540> but<00:00:59.540> for<00:01:00.050> whatever

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
going to fall off but for whatever

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.980 
going to fall off but for whatever
reason<00:01:00.470> you<00:01:00.980> just<00:01:01.490> don't<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.480> I<00:01:02.510> don't<00:01:02.810> know<00:01:02.900> if

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
reason you just don't so I don't know if

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.750 
reason you just don't so I don't know if
it's<00:01:03.110> just<00:01:03.230> not<00:01:03.440> as<00:01:03.650> steep<00:01:03.920> as<00:01:04.160> it<00:01:04.190> looks<00:01:04.520> like

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
it's just not as steep as it looks like

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.410 
it's just not as steep as it looks like
or<00:01:05.030> what<00:01:06.370> but<00:01:07.370> I'm<00:01:07.670> going<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.880> slide<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.240> little

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
or what but I'm going to slide a little

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.120 
or what but I'm going to slide a little
bit<00:01:08.720> here<00:01:09.020> but<00:01:09.050> I'll<00:01:09.350> be<00:01:09.470> able<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.680> get<00:01:09.830> up<00:01:09.950> onto

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
bit here but I'll be able to get up onto

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.340 
bit here but I'll be able to get up onto
this<00:01:10.310> Ridge<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:16.720> now<00:01:17.720> we're<00:01:17.930> basically

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
this Ridge and now we're basically

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.560 
this Ridge and now we're basically
headed<00:01:18.710> back<00:01:18.979> toward<00:01:19.550> where<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.180> put<00:01:20.420> the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
headed back toward where I put the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.150 
headed back toward where I put the
marker<00:01:20.869> now<00:01:21.229> can't<00:01:22.040> get<00:01:22.490> up<00:01:22.760> this<00:01:23.119> way<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.740> I'm

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
marker now can't get up this way so I'm

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.040 
marker now can't get up this way so I'm
going<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.580> go<00:01:25.760> ahead<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.420> come<00:01:26.810> down<00:01:27.020> a

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
going to go ahead and and come down a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.850 
going to go ahead and and come down a
little<00:01:27.290> bit<00:01:27.470> again<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:29.140> keep<00:01:30.140> trying<00:01:30.560> to

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
little bit again and keep trying to

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.310 
little bit again and keep trying to
climb<00:01:31.100> upward<00:01:31.760> because<00:01:32.330> if<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.600> do<00:01:32.780> fall<00:01:33.110> too

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
climb upward because if you do fall too

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.410 
climb upward because if you do fall too
far<00:01:33.530> down<00:01:33.760> then<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:34.910> won't<00:01:35.060> be<00:01:35.119> able<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.330> get

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
far down then you won't be able to get

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.880 
far down then you won't be able to get
back<00:01:35.510> up<00:01:35.570> here<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.229> got<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.440> take<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> long

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
back up here and you got to take a long

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.230 
back up here and you got to take a long
way<00:01:37.130> all<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.400> way<00:01:37.430> back<00:01:37.610> around<00:01:37.910> but<00:01:38.119> we're

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
way all the way back around but we're

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.670 
way all the way back around but we're
now<00:01:38.330> we're<00:01:38.479> coming<00:01:38.600> up<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.110> Ridge<00:01:39.380> here<00:01:39.410> i

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
now we're coming up to this Ridge here i

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.710 
now we're coming up to this Ridge here i
am<00:01:39.920> on<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.160> map<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:41.270> kind<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.479> give<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.690> an

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
am on the map to kind of give you an

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.180 
am on the map to kind of give you an
idea<00:01:41.869> in<00:01:42.140> case<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.440> lost<00:01:42.679> direction<00:01:45.039> but<00:01:46.039> i'm

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
idea in case you lost direction but i'm

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.740 
idea in case you lost direction but i'm
basically<00:01:46.520> kind<00:01:46.759> of<00:01:46.850> on<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.030> mountain<00:01:47.509> ridge

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
basically kind of on the mountain ridge

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.460 
basically kind of on the mountain ridge
above<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.770> behind<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.780> end<00:01:50.780> area<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.350> the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
above and behind that end area of the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.040 
above and behind that end area of the
zone<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.160> far<00:01:52.460> northern<00:01:52.820> point<00:01:53.570> there<00:01:53.899> on

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
zone that far northern point there on

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.169 
zone that far northern point there on
the<00:01:54.170> zone<00:01:54.440> now<00:01:55.100> we're<00:01:55.280> headed<00:01:55.700> toward<00:01:56.000> this

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
the zone now we're headed toward this

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.070 
the zone now we're headed toward this
glacier<00:01:56.720> over<00:01:57.020> here<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:59.630> just<00:01:59.780> want<00:01:59.990> to

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
glacier over here and you just want to

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.810 
glacier over here and you just want to
follow<00:02:00.440> because<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.100> can't<00:02:01.310> just<00:02:01.520> go<00:02:01.700> up

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
follow because you can't just go up

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.990 
follow because you can't just go up
there<00:02:01.850> but<00:02:02.149> if<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.539> follow<00:02:02.810> this<00:02:02.990> line<00:02:04.000> it's

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
there but if you follow this line it's

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.880 
there but if you follow this line it's
almost<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.330> graphical<00:02:05.899> glitch<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:06.380> it's<00:02:06.560> it's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
almost a graphical glitch but it's it's

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.370 
almost a graphical glitch but it's it's
like<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.100> little<00:02:07.640> Ridge<00:02:08.000> there<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:09.170> just
