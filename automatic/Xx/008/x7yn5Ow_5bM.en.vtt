00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.109
 the health conditions of the child would still be serious but stationary 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.750
 saint Elizabeth's child savior 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.960
 that next May 13 will be 6 years old and that Sunday afternoon in the 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.090
 countryside of the district malvicino sant'angelo muxaro was wounded in the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.660
 head from a rifle shot while traveling aboard an SUV 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.119
 conducted by uncle vincenzo marotta 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.140
 and on which the 16-year-old Carlo also traveled 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.210
 timely rescued the little savior adobe first and her band performed by 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.170
 sanitary ware of the san giovanni di dio hospital of agrigento 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.320
 I was subjected to another delicate person at night 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.950
 surgery this time at the civico of palermo 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.360
 a team of doctors from the first and resuscitation unit 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.720
 of the civic hospital 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.440
 directed by Professor Pier Giorgio Fabbri 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.040
 they followed an extension operation during which it would be extracted 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.020
 a bullet 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.850
 that had struck the child in the left temporal forehead area 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.480
 and penetrating the skull would also reach the yellow good zone 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.750
 they say they are confident about the success of the surgery 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.230
 of the civic of palermo 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.900
 which, however, await further developments from the post-operative course of the child 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.160
 savior 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.070
 meanwhile the child for precautionary purposes 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.300
 it is kept in a pharmacological coma by doctors 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.600
 at first it was immediately thought of an ambush of mafia origin 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.220
 as the rumor had spread that he had three victims they were related to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.680
 the mafia boss of santa elisabetta salvatore fragapane 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.380
 a circumstance that could be a case of homonymy 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.020
 so if this hypothesis is confirmed by the investigators 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.010
 investigations would take on a broader character 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.020
 thus increasing the range of sales demos have prompted the authors to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.130
 season the ambush meanwhile from the first surveys carried out by the agents of the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.530
 scientific police 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.960
 it would appear that the bullets would not have exploded from a distance 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.300
 close but from about ten meters 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.980
 the similarities common to the ambush of last Sunday with that are common 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.590
 occurred in the favara countryside on the evening of 22 April 1999 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.409
 when the eleven-year-old Stefano Pompeo was joined and killed by a blow from sewing 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:17.390
 his head while on board an off-road vehicle owned by a 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.089
 prejudiced of the place 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:23.709
 intando the whole country of santa elisabetta is shocked by what happened 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.949
 the bars in the squares of the small management center are not talking about anything else 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:33.859
 incredulous and embittered mayor emilio militello the archpriest calogero morgante 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.159
 the latter would also be organizing a prayer vigil for the little one 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:38.730
 savior
