00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:16.929 
including countering the recoil some of

including countering the recoil some of
the<00:00:16.990> do's<00:00:17.259> and<00:00:17.289> don'ts<00:00:17.529> and<00:00:18.039> burst<00:00:18.519> firing<00:00:18.849> at

the do's and don'ts and burst firing at
what<00:00:19.660> ranges<00:00:20.169> and<00:00:20.320> today<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:22.210> have<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:22.480> mtar

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
what ranges and today we have the mtar

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.429 
what ranges and today we have the mtar
which<00:00:23.949> has<00:00:24.189> a<00:00:24.220> phenomenal<00:00:24.999> rate<00:00:25.150> of<00:00:25.329> fire<00:00:25.599> but

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
which has a phenomenal rate of fire but

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.470 
which has a phenomenal rate of fire but
could<00:00:26.589> be<00:00:26.679> pretty<00:00:26.919> tricky<00:00:27.279> at<00:00:27.609> medium<00:00:28.300> and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
could be pretty tricky at medium and

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.630 
could be pretty tricky at medium and
longer<00:00:28.810> ranges<00:00:29.380> and<00:00:29.589> with<00:00:29.829> that<00:00:30.009> phenomenal

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
longer ranges and with that phenomenal

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.310 
longer ranges and with that phenomenal
rate<00:00:30.759> of<00:00:30.909> fire<00:00:31.119> it<00:00:31.630> can<00:00:31.810> get<00:00:31.900> you<00:00:32.050> in<00:00:32.169> trouble

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
rate of fire it can get you in trouble

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.680 
rate of fire it can get you in trouble
if<00:00:32.619> you're<00:00:32.740> bursting<00:00:32.950> too<00:00:33.460> far<00:00:33.820> because<00:00:34.360> then

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
if you're bursting too far because then

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.570 
if you're bursting too far because then
there's<00:00:34.840> too<00:00:35.050> much<00:00:35.200> deviation<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.190> your

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
there's too much deviation and your

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.670 
there's too much deviation and your
bullets<00:00:36.970> are<00:00:37.060> going<00:00:37.270> around<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:38.350> enemy

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
bullets are going around the enemy

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.980 
bullets are going around the enemy
instead<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.430> into<00:00:39.880> the<00:00:39.910> enemy<00:00:40.420> therefore

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 
instead of into the enemy therefore

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.580 
instead of into the enemy therefore
forcing<00:00:41.410> you<00:00:41.530> into<00:00:41.940> quicker<00:00:42.960> reloads<00:00:43.960> more

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
forcing you into quicker reloads more

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.290 
forcing you into quicker reloads more
reloads<00:00:45.250> which<00:00:45.490> can<00:00:45.670> really<00:00:45.880> get<00:00:46.120> you<00:00:46.150> in

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
reloads which can really get you in

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.460 
reloads which can really get you in
trouble<00:00:46.420> with<00:00:46.630> this<00:00:46.810> weapon<00:00:46.990> because<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.320> has

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
trouble with this weapon because it has

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.950 
trouble with this weapon because it has
a<00:00:47.500> longer<00:00:47.920> reload<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:49.330> first<00:00:49.570> let's<00:00:49.810> talk

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
a longer reload so first let's talk

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.870 
a longer reload so first let's talk
about<00:00:50.170> countering<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.100> recoil<00:00:51.580> we're<00:00:51.760> going

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
about countering the recoil we're going

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.990 
about countering the recoil we're going
to<00:00:51.940> shoot<00:00:52.090> this<00:00:52.240> wall<00:00:52.450> and<00:00:52.480> not<00:00:52.750> do<00:00:52.900> anything

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
to shoot this wall and not do anything

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.660 
to shoot this wall and not do anything
harsh<00:00:55.380> vertical<00:00:56.380> recoil<00:00:56.560> with<00:00:57.220> a<00:00:57.250> fair<00:00:57.640> amount

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
harsh vertical recoil with a fair amount

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.340 
harsh vertical recoil with a fair amount
of<00:00:58.090> horizontal<00:00:58.690> wiggle<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.080> how<00:00:59.170> are<00:00:59.260> we<00:00:59.290> going

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
of horizontal wiggle so how are we going

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.870 
of horizontal wiggle so how are we going
to<00:00:59.500> counter<00:00:59.710> this<00:00:59.830> we're<00:01:00.430> going<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.610> pull

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
to counter this we're going to pull

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.670 
to counter this we're going to pull
straight<00:01:01.270> down<00:01:01.300> not<00:01:02.020> much<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.320> can<00:01:02.350> do<00:01:02.560> about

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
straight down not much we can do about

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.189 
straight down not much we can do about
the<00:01:02.890> horizontal<00:01:03.400> part<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:04.239> let's<00:01:04.749> take<00:01:04.899> a<00:01:04.960> look

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
the horizontal part so let's take a look

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.080 
the horizontal part so let's take a look
here<00:01:07.229> something<00:01:08.229> like<00:01:08.380> that<00:01:08.820> now<00:01:09.820> at<00:01:09.939> this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
here something like that now at this

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.330 
here something like that now at this
range<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.899> can<00:01:11.049> pretty<00:01:11.200> much<00:01:11.289> shred<00:01:11.770> anybody

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
range you can pretty much shred anybody

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.130 
range you can pretty much shred anybody
whether<00:01:12.729> you're<00:01:12.999> a<00:01:13.210> deicing<00:01:13.509> aiming<00:01:14.020> down

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
whether you're a deicing aiming down

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.719 
whether you're a deicing aiming down
sight<00:01:14.439> or<00:01:14.619> even<00:01:14.979> hit<00:01:15.130> fire<00:01:17.729> extremely

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
sight or even hit fire extremely

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.819 
sight or even hit fire extremely
accurate<00:01:19.119> hipfire<00:01:19.509> and<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:20.289> one<00:01:20.469> thing<00:01:20.619> about

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
accurate hipfire and the one thing about

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.270 
accurate hipfire and the one thing about
the<00:01:20.979> hipfire<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.609> the<00:01:22.299> recoil<00:01:23.069> doesn't<00:01:24.069> seem

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
the hipfire is the recoil doesn't seem

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.969 
the hipfire is the recoil doesn't seem
as<00:01:24.490> bad<00:01:24.549> when<00:01:25.479> you're<00:01:25.689> in<00:01:25.749> this<00:01:25.869> hip<00:01:26.079> fire<00:01:26.319> but

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
as bad when you're in this hip fire but

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.770 
as bad when you're in this hip fire but
be<00:01:27.159> very<00:01:27.189> careful<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:28.030> mag<00:01:28.270> dumping<00:01:28.659> this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
be very careful of mag dumping this

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.230 
be very careful of mag dumping this
weapon<00:01:29.229> even<00:01:29.920> at<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:30.159> closer<00:01:30.399> ranges<00:01:30.939> you<00:01:31.119> can

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
weapon even at the closer ranges you can

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.300 
weapon even at the closer ranges you can
get<00:01:31.359> away<00:01:31.450> with<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> nice<00:01:32.079> 8<00:01:32.319> to<00:01:32.560> 10<00:01:32.770> round<00:01:33.009> burst

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
get away with a nice 8 to 10 round burst

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.849 
get away with a nice 8 to 10 round burst
at<00:01:33.579> this<00:01:33.759> range<00:01:34.149> but<00:01:34.990> again<00:01:35.259> they<00:01:35.469> can<00:01:35.619> get<00:01:35.710> you

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
at this range but again they can get you

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.620 
at this range but again they can get you
in<00:01:35.950> trouble<00:01:36.100> if<00:01:36.369> you're<00:01:36.520> bursting<00:01:36.759> that<00:01:37.299> much

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
in trouble if you're bursting that much

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.879 
in trouble if you're bursting that much
because<00:01:37.869> you're<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.319> chewing<00:01:38.619> through<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:38.889 
because you're just chewing through the

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.789 
because you're just chewing through the
ammo<00:01:39.179> so<00:01:40.179> with<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.659> mtar<00:01:41.109> with<00:01:41.499> the<00:01:41.590> higher

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
ammo so with the mtar with the higher

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.309 
ammo so with the mtar with the higher
rate<00:01:42.039> of<00:01:42.069> fire<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:43.240> deviation<00:01:43.929> kicks<00:01:44.139> in

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
rate of fire the deviation kicks in

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.309 
rate of fire the deviation kicks in
pretty<00:01:44.560> quickly<00:01:45.389> many<00:01:46.389> guns<00:01:46.689> i<00:01:46.929> would<00:01:47.109> give<00:01:47.289> a

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
pretty quickly many guns i would give a

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.319 
pretty quickly many guns i would give a
seven<00:01:47.829> to<00:01:47.889> eight<00:01:48.039> round<00:01:48.310> burst<00:01:48.579> at<00:01:48.819> this<00:01:48.999> range

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
seven to eight round burst at this range

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.219 
seven to eight round burst at this range
can't<00:01:50.109> get<00:01:50.380> away<00:01:50.469> with<00:01:50.859> that<00:01:51.039> with<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.429> mtar

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
can't get away with that with the mtar

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.519 
can't get away with that with the mtar
let's<00:01:53.229> try<00:01:53.499> I<00:01:53.799> was<00:01:54.609> eight<00:01:54.880> or<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:55.240> start<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.350> get

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:56.529 
let's try I was eight or so start to get

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:58.529 
let's try I was eight or so start to get
a<00:01:56.560> little<00:01:56.679> bit<00:01:57.009> squirrelly<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:58.179> what<00:01:58.389> we

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
a little bit squirrelly so what we

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.050 
a little bit squirrelly so what we
