taking classes it's actually

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.850 
taking classes it's actually
pursuing<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.050> research<00:03:10.409> you're<00:03:10.590> really

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
pursuing the research you're really

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.920 
pursuing the research you're really
interested<00:03:11.280> in<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.670> that's<00:03:12.330> what<00:03:12.540> graduate

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
interested in and that's what graduate

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.820 
interested in and that's what graduate
school<00:03:13.110> meant<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.440> me

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
school meant to me

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.180 
school meant to me
so<00:03:14.519> John<00:03:14.700> Laird<00:03:14.970> was<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.239> my<00:03:15.989> advisor<00:03:16.650> as<00:03:17.040> an

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
so John Laird was a my advisor as an

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.979 
so John Laird was a my advisor as an
undergraduate<00:03:17.519> he<00:03:18.180> got<00:03:18.299> me<00:03:18.390> started<00:03:18.569> on<00:03:18.720> games

research which I didn't know it at the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.020 
research which I didn't know it at the
time<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.680> ended<00:03:22.890> up<00:03:22.980> taking<00:03:23.580> an<00:03:23.760> internship

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
time but I ended up taking an internship

still<00:03:28.290> interact<00:03:28.590> with<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> games<00:03:28.950> community

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
still interact with the games community

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.500 
still interact with the games community
because<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.760> connection<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.269> he<00:03:30.360> made

because of that connection that he made
for<00:03:30.690> me<00:03:30.750> some<00:03:31.170> helped<00:03:31.620> by<00:03:31.769> setting<00:03:32.519> me<00:03:32.670> up<00:03:32.700> with

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
for me some helped by setting me up with

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.559 
for me some helped by setting me up with
great<00:03:33.330> internships<00:03:34.200> with<00:03:34.709> companies<00:03:35.160> where

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
great internships with companies where

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.580 
great internships with companies where
essentially<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.599> ended<00:03:36.840> up<00:03:36.930> changing<00:03:37.200> and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
essentially I ended up changing and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.220 
essentially I ended up changing and
picking<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.950> new<00:03:38.099> PhD<00:03:38.760> topic<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.900> turned<00:03:40.140> out

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
picking a new PhD topic that turned out

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.319 
picking a new PhD topic that turned out
to<00:03:40.260> be<00:03:40.379> a<00:03:40.500> very<00:03:40.769> influential<00:03:41.159> PhD<00:03:41.819> topic<00:03:42.150> that

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
to be a very influential PhD topic that

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.180 
to be a very influential PhD topic that
started<00:03:42.629> a<00:03:42.690> whole<00:03:42.720> new<00:03:43.079> area<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.410> research<00:03:43.530> in

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
started a whole new area of research in

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.949 
started a whole new area of research in
data<00:03:44.579> mining<00:03:44.970> what's<00:03:45.540> special<00:03:45.780> about

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
data mining what's special about

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.080 
data mining what's special about
Michigan<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.799> how<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.099> get<00:03:47.310> such<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> wonderful

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
diversity of things that they excel at I

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.190 
diversity of things that they excel at I
think<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.910> education<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.930> got<00:03:52.079> in

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
think that the education I got in

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.380 
think that the education I got in
Michigan<00:03:52.650> really<00:03:52.859> set<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.280> stage<00:03:53.519> for<00:03:53.849> me<00:03:54.239> to

have a successful career I pretty much

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.819 
have a successful career I pretty much
knew<00:03:57.060> all<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.569> time<00:03:57.780> when<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.230> was<00:03:58.410> little<00:03:58.590> that

knew all the time when I was little that
I<00:03:58.859> wanted<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.220> go<00:03:59.430> into<00:03:59.700> engineering<00:03:59.849> of<00:04:00.329> some

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
I wanted to go into engineering of some

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
and I I certainly found that here at

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.360 
and I I certainly found that here at

coming<00:05:53.569> out<00:05:53.690> of<00:05:53.839> Michigan<00:05:53.960> my<00:05:54.560> advisor<00:05:54.830> does

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
coming out of Michigan my advisor does

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.189 
coming out of Michigan my advisor does
work<00:05:55.419> addressing<00:05:56.419> the<00:05:56.509> problem<00:05:56.839> of<00:05:56.990> the

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
work addressing the problem of the

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.350

world's<00:05:57.440> aging<00:05:57.740> population<00:05:58.339> and<00:05:58.580> so<00:05:58.909> I<00:05:59.210> think

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
world's aging population and so I think

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.089 
world's aging population and so I think
it's<00:05:59.690> great<00:05:59.900> that<00:05:59.960> we<00:06:00.169> can<00:06:00.319> apply<00:06:00.500> artificial

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099
