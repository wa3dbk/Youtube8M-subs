00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
arguments when I'm out there on my own

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.320 
arguments when I'm out there on my own
and<00:04:08.710> I<00:04:08.770> come<00:04:08.950> in<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.430> try<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.640> tell<00:04:09.850> him<00:04:10.000> this

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
and I come in and I try to tell him this

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.370 
and I come in and I try to tell him this
is<00:04:10.450> wrong<00:04:10.600> with<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.810> car<00:04:10.930> that's<00:04:11.170> one<00:04:11.290> with

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
is wrong with the car that's one with

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.080 
is wrong with the car that's one with
the<00:04:11.470> car<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.190> way<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:12.340> explain<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.970> he

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
the car and the way I explain it he

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.640 
the car and the way I explain it he
doesn't<00:04:13.240> get<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.510> but<00:04:13.810> if<00:04:13.930> he's<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.470> think

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
doesn't get it but if he's you think

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.259 
doesn't get it but if he's you think
it's<00:04:14.740> in<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.890> passenger<00:04:15.370> seat<00:04:15.400> he<00:04:15.970> could<00:04:16.120> feel

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
it's in the passenger seat he could feel

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.270 
it's in the passenger seat he could feel

exactly what I'm on about and I'm yeah

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
and then he could fix it just like that

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.620 
and then he could fix it just like that
