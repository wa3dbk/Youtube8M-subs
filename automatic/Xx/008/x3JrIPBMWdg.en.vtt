okay<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.220> part<00:00:02.490> 9<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:02.939> my<00:00:03.149> blender<00:00:04.080> python

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay this is part 9 of my blender python

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.710 
okay this is part 9 of my blender python
tutorial<00:00:04.710> series<00:00:05.339> for<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.970> game<00:00:06.150> engine<00:00:06.540> and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
tutorial series for the game engine and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.570 
tutorial series for the game engine and
in<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.290> previous<00:00:07.560> ng<00:00:07.890> we<00:00:08.010> were<00:00:08.099> just<00:00:08.309> looking

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
in the previous ng we were just looking

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.580 
in the previous ng we were just looking
at<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> mouse<00:00:08.910> position<00:00:09.150> here<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.320> when<00:00:10.650> I

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
at the mouse position here so when I

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.110 
at the mouse position here so when I
started<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.920> move<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.309> mouse<00:00:14.519> half<00:00:14.969> way

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
started it and move the mouse half way

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.820 
started it and move the mouse half way
past<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> screen<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.960> moved<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.350> object

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
past the screen it moved that object

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.640 
past the screen it moved that object
like<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.940> then<00:00:18.480> I've<00:00:18.930> added<00:00:19.140> I've<00:00:19.470> made

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
like that and then I've added I've made

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.890 
like that and then I've added I've made
some<00:00:19.740> changes<00:00:20.010> now<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> code<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.150> that's

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
some changes now to the code so that's

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.689 
some changes now to the code so that's
pretty<00:00:22.170> straightforward<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.580> I've

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
pretty straightforward but what I've

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.830 
pretty straightforward but what I've
done<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.029> I've<00:00:24.210> moved<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.890> code<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.849> its<00:00:27.660> own

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
done is I've moved the code in its own

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.400 
done is I've moved the code in its own
into<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> separate<00:00:28.800> mouse<00:00:29.400> position<00:00:29.670> routine

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
into a separate mouse position routine

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.780 
into a separate mouse position routine
instead<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> within<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> keyboard<00:00:32.489> events

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
instead of within the keyboard events

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.490 
instead of within the keyboard events
routine<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.630> was<00:00:33.750> goofin<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.350> in

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
routine because that was goofin it up in

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.639 
routine because that was goofin it up in
the<00:00:34.620> sense<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.660> that<00:00:36.660> would<00:00:36.840> only<00:00:36.930> execute

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the sense that that would only execute

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.860 
the sense that that would only execute
if<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.340> mean<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.879> had<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
if the I mean I had it down here in the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.840 
if the I mean I had it down here in the
check<00:00:40.410> object<00:00:40.770> position<00:00:40.890> routine<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.700> was

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
check object position routine it was

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.670 
check object position routine it was
only<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> execute<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.899> object<00:00:43.200> had

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
only going to execute if this object had

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.910 
only going to execute if this object had
moved<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.809> now<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.170> by<00:00:46.320> itself<00:00:46.559> check

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
moved so now it's all by itself check

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.290 
moved so now it's all by itself check
the<00:00:47.039> mouse<00:00:47.190> position<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> up

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the mouse position and then I have it up

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.180 
the mouse position and then I have it up
here<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.719> Maine<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.649> also<00:00:49.950> what

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
here with in Maine and then also what

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
here with in Maine and then also what
I've<00:00:50.280> done<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:50.910> I've<00:00:51.030> started<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.539> an

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
I've done in here now I've started a an

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.979 
I've done in here now I've started a an
entry<00:00:52.739> called<00:00:52.920> Spanish<00:00:53.460> dictionary<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.239> this

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
entry called Spanish dictionary and this

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.810 
entry called Spanish dictionary and this
will<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.350> our<00:00:55.559> variables<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.640> could

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
will be like our variables then we could

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.040 
will be like our variables then we could
make<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> variable<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.899> could

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
make a variable like this and we could

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.039 
make a variable like this and we could
say<00:00:59.510> x<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.780> equal<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.620> 5<00:01:01.829> point<00:01:02.160> 0<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.840> do

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
say x is equal to 5 point 0 and and do

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.840 
say x is equal to 5 point 0 and and do
something<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.519> could<00:01:05.640> say

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
something with it you know we could say

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.620 
something with it you know we could say
X<00:01:06.180> plus<00:01:06.659> equals<00:01:07.170> 1<00:01:07.530> point<00:01:07.799> 0<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
X plus equals 1 point 0 like that and it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
X plus equals 1 point 0 like that and it
would<00:01:09.750> increment<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.260> except<00:01:10.830> however<00:01:11.010> every

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
would increment it except however every

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.160 
would increment it except however every
time<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.210> came<00:01:12.330> back<00:01:12.510> through<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.750> routine<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
time it came back through the routine is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.340 
time it came back through the routine is
going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> reset<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.070> five<00:01:14.280> point<00:01:14.640> 0<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.350> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
going to reset it as five point 0 and so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.539 
going to reset it as five point 0 and so
you're<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.369> anywhere

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you're really not going to get anywhere

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.399 
you're really not going to get anywhere
so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> set<00:01:19.200> these<00:01:19.350> up

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
so the way to do it is you set these up

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.480 
so the way to do it is you set these up
in<00:01:19.909> dictionary<00:01:20.909> entries<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.450> since<00:01:22.490> Python

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
in dictionary entries and since Python

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
in dictionary entries and since Python
dictionaries<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
dictionaries I kind of like the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.560 
dictionaries I kind of like the
associated<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> dictionary<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.479> I'll

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
associated with the dictionary so I'll

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.840 
associated with the dictionary so I'll
call<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:28.020> first<00:01:28.829> dictionary<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.400> Spanish

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
call my first dictionary a Spanish

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
call my first dictionary a Spanish
dictionary<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.020> two<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.320> terms<00:01:31.560> or

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
dictionary and a two of the terms or

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.069

is<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> spanish<00:01:42.509> term<00:01:42.869> followed<00:01:43.290> by<00:01:43.470> this

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
is the spanish term followed by this

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.469 
is the spanish term followed by this
colon<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.750> it's<00:01:45.750> k<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.119> has<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.329> be

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.940 
colon and it's k so and that has to be
in<00:01:48.659> double<00:01:48.930> quotes<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:49.259> that's<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.619> string

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
in double quotes because that's a string

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.569 
in double quotes because that's a string
so<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:51.000> i<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> comma<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
so then i have a comma and then I do the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.760 
so then i have a comma and then I do the
same<00:01:53.610> thing<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:55.020> English<00:01:55.500> I've

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
same thing for we in English I've

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.760 
same thing for we in English I've
defined<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.850> single<00:01:57.240> quotes<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.840> followed

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
defined we in single quotes and followed

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
defined we in single quotes and followed
by<00:01:58.890> its<00:01:59.100> colon<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.119> tell<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.420> what<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.719> means

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
by its colon to tell you what it means

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.249 
by its colon to tell you what it means
and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.320> nosotros<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:02.670> what<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
and then nosotros for what we is and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.249 
and then nosotros for what we is and
then<00:02:04.770> I'm<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> define<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.640> variable<00:02:06.450> X<00:02:06.930> in

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
then I'm going to define a variable X in

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.919 
then I'm going to define a variable X in
here<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.220> well<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.550> because<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.660> give<00:02:09.840> it

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
here as well just because and I give it

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.270 
here as well just because and I give it
a<00:02:09.989> value<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.259> 5<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.920> mix<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.220> match

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
a value of 5 so you can mix and match

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.620 
a value of 5 so you can mix and match
strings<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
strings and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.810 
strings and
members<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.140> even<00:02:13.290> equations<00:02:13.950> within<00:02:14.610> a

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
members and even equations within a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.950 
members and even equations within a
dictionary<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:16.400> then<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.670> actually<00:02:17.940> look<00:02:18.780> at

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
dictionary and then to actually look at

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.020 
dictionary and then to actually look at
the<00:02:18.990> dictionary<00:02:19.500> term<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.040> type<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.880> like

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the dictionary term I type it in like

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.780 
the dictionary term I type it in like
this<00:02:21.060> Spanish<00:02:21.660> dictionary<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.610> then<00:02:23.610> in

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
this Spanish dictionary and then in

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.630 
this Spanish dictionary and then in
square<00:02:24.600> brackets<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.620> name<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.220> entry<00:02:26.520> in

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
square brackets the name of the entry in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.150 
square brackets the name of the entry in
the<00:02:26.730> dictionary<00:02:26.880> what<00:02:27.390> or<00:02:27.660> we<00:02:28.110> or<00:02:28.470> X<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.070> they

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
the dictionary what or we or X and they

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.800 
the dictionary what or we or X and they
have<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> single<00:02:29.880> quotes<00:02:30.240> just<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
have to be in the single quotes just the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.540 
have to be in the single quotes just the
way<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.080> we<00:02:31.170> defined<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.920> alright

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
way that we defined like that alright

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.280 
way that we defined like that alright
and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:32.820> when<00:02:32.940> i<00:02:32.970> run<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.420> since<00:02:33.930> i<00:02:34.020> have<00:02:34.170> this

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
and then when i run it since i have this

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.400 
and then when i run it since i have this
within<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.740> mouse<00:02:34.920> position<00:02:35.510> routine<00:02:36.510> so

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
within the mouse position routine so

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.590 
within the mouse position routine so
that<00:02:37.620> means<00:02:37.830> when<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.310> mouse<00:02:38.520> other<00:02:39.360> doesn't

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
that means when the mouse other doesn't

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.880 
that means when the mouse other doesn't
really<00:02:39.720> matter<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.110> going<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.320> run<00:02:40.470> anywhere

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
really matter it's going to run anywhere

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.510 
really matter it's going to run anywhere
at<00:02:41.010> once<00:02:41.270> it's<00:02:42.270> going<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:43.160> every<00:02:44.160> time<00:02:44.340> this

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
at once it's going to every time this

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.010 
at once it's going to every time this
routine<00:02:44.910> runs<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.300> going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.540> constantly

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
routine runs is going to constantly

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.810 
routine runs is going to constantly
print<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.890> let's<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.220> go<00:02:47.280> see<00:02:47.520> if<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.640> does

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
print it so let's just go see if it does

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.960 
print it so let's just go see if it does
it<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.960> I'll<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.290> press<00:02:49.920> p<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.490> run<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.820> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
it so I'll just press p and run it and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.140 
it so I'll just press p and run it and
then<00:02:51.750> i'll<00:02:52.650> stop<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.280> go<00:02:53.370> get<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> console

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
then i'll stop it and go get the console

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.540 
then i'll stop it and go get the console
and<00:02:54.360> go<00:02:54.720> see<00:02:54.930> what<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.320> does<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.740> there<00:02:56.250> does

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
and go see what it does and there does

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.270 
and go see what it does and there does
it<00:02:56.790> just<00:02:57.030> constantly<00:02:57.510> printed<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.950> three

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
it just constantly printed the three

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.630 
it just constantly printed the three
entries<00:02:59.900> within<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.800> we<00:03:02.010> had<00:03:02.130> set<00:03:02.370> up<00:03:02.490> like

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
entries within that we had set up like

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.970 
entries within that we had set up like
that<00:03:02.820> all<00:03:03.720> right<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.380> that's<00:03:04.560> all<00:03:04.770> we<00:03:04.800> really

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
that all right so that's all we really

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.260 
that all right so that's all we really
going<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.220> look<00:03:05.370> at<00:03:05.460> in<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:05.730> lesson<00:03:05.910> because

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
going to look at in this lesson because

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.910 
going to look at in this lesson because
this<00:03:07.520> you<00:03:08.520> might<00:03:08.700> check<00:03:08.940> out<00:03:09.150> lesson<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:10.290> might

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
this you might check out lesson I might

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.920 
this you might check out lesson I might
be<00:03:11.040> 17<00:03:11.460> or<00:03:11.490> 18<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.970> my<00:03:12.060> other<00:03:12.210> python<00:03:12.630> tutorial

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
be 17 or 18 in my other python tutorial

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.660 
be 17 or 18 in my other python tutorial
series<00:03:13.440> where<00:03:13.710> I<00:03:13.740> cover<00:03:13.980> dictionaries<00:03:14.520> more

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
series where I cover dictionaries more

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.320 
series where I cover dictionaries more
extensively<00:03:15.210> and<00:03:16.760> basically<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:17.970> allows<00:03:18.300> us

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
extensively and basically this allows us

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.430 
extensively and basically this allows us
to<00:03:18.620> take<00:03:19.620> these<00:03:19.950> values<00:03:20.490> that<00:03:21.450> are<00:03:21.510> defined

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
to take these values that are defined

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.290 
to take these values that are defined
within<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.830> dictionary<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.580> use<00:03:23.880> them<00:03:24.120> within

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
within a dictionary and use them within

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.940 
within a dictionary and use them within
another<00:03:24.570> file<00:03:24.870> here<00:03:25.380> we're<00:03:25.530> using<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.830> within

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
another file here we're using it within

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.190 
another file here we're using it within
cube<00:03:26.280> object<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:26.820> within<00:03:27.270> cylinder<00:03:27.810> object

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
cube object but within cylinder object

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.380 
cube object but within cylinder object
we<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.800> also<00:03:28.980> come<00:03:29.400> back<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.820> reference<00:03:30.000> it

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
we can also come back and reference it

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.930 
we can also come back and reference it
as<00:03:30.540> well<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.740> we'll<00:03:32.250> be<00:03:32.370> doing<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.730> in

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
as well and we'll be doing that in

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.720 
as well and we'll be doing that in
future<00:03:33.120> lessons<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.530> get<00:03:34.730> information

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
future lessons so we can get information

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.710 
future lessons so we can get information
between<00:03:36.540> files<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.760> information<00:03:39.480> just

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
between files and the information just

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.780 
between files and the information just
kind<00:03:39.990> of<00:03:40.080> static<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.800> holds<00:03:41.100> its<00:03:41.190> values

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
kind of static it holds its values

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.790 
kind of static it holds its values
between<00:03:42.090> files<00:03:42.510> as<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.930> go<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.590> we're<00:03:43.680> going

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
between files as you go and we're going

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.890 
between files as you go and we're going
to<00:03:43.860> need<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.130> because<00:03:44.660> when<00:03:45.660> we<00:03:45.750> do

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
to need that because when we do

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.980 
to need that because when we do
collision<00:03:46.380> detection<00:03:46.650> between<00:03:47.100> objects<00:03:47.520> i

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
collision detection between objects i

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.550 
collision detection between objects i
will<00:03:48.990> use<00:03:49.320> dictionary<00:03:50.220> values<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:51.360> store<00:03:52.350> the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
will use dictionary values to store the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.260 
will use dictionary values to store the
number<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.830> times<00:03:52.980> an<00:03:53.190> object<00:03:53.550> is<00:03:53.700> hid<00:03:53.970> or

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
number of times an object is hid or

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.010 
number of times an object is hid or
something<00:03:55.110> of<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.800> nature<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.870> so<00:03:57.870> these

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
something of that nature and so these

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.600 
something of that nature and so these
become<00:03:58.410> really<00:03:58.680> really<00:03:58.709> important<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.550> if

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
become really really important so if

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.949 
become really really important so if
you're<00:03:59.730> not<00:03:59.820> familiar<00:03:59.970> with<00:04:00.300> them<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.810> might

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
you're not familiar with them you might

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.330 
you're not familiar with them you might
look<00:04:01.080> them<00:04:01.200> up<00:04:01.290> online<00:04:01.440> or<00:04:01.620> go<00:04:01.920> check<00:04:02.100> my<00:04:02.220> other

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
look them up online or go check my other

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.360 
look them up online or go check my other
videos<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:03.110> because<00:04:04.110> we<00:04:04.320> will<00:04:04.800> be<00:04:04.920> needing<00:04:05.220> to

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
videos and because we will be needing to

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.340 
videos and because we will be needing to
use<00:04:05.550> this<00:04:06.330> kind<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.630> stuff<00:04:06.840> extensively

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
use this kind of stuff extensively

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.199 
use this kind of stuff extensively
alright<00:04:08.280> well<00:04:08.550> that's<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.820> for<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.030> lesson

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
alright well that's it for this lesson

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.530 
alright well that's it for this lesson
and<00:04:09.540> i'll<00:04:09.900> see<00:04:10.020> you<00:04:10.050> in<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.170> next<00:04:10.290> lesson
