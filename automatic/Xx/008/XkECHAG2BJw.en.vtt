a pretty nice buff because death siphon

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.620 
a pretty nice buff because death siphon
was<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> relatively<00:00:40.530> weak<00:00:40.890> ability<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.520> 5.1<00:00:42.770> our

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
was a relatively weak ability in 5.1 our

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.970 
was a relatively weak ability in 5.1 our
conversion<00:00:45.630> ability<00:00:45.990> has<00:00:46.230> also<00:00:46.470> been<00:00:46.740> buffed

conversion ability has also been buffed

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.210 
conversion ability has also been buffed
it<00:00:47.250> now<00:00:48.060> costs<00:00:48.630> half<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.320> much<00:00:49.500> runic<00:00:49.890> power<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
it now costs half as much runic power to

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.430 
it now costs half as much runic power to
cast<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.940> half<00:00:51.150> as<00:00:51.330> much<00:00:51.480> runic<00:00:51.810> power<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.380> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
cast and half as much runic power for a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.700 
cast and half as much runic power for a
second<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.980> maintain<00:00:53.930> they<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.080> buffed<00:00:55.470> our

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
second to maintain they also buffed our

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.650 
second to maintain they also buffed our
blood<00:00:56.130> worms<00:00:56.310> they<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.910> twice<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.300> much

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
blood worms they now have twice as much

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
blood worms they now have twice as much
health<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.290> heal<00:00:58.560> us<00:00:58.740> or<00:00:59.100> three<00:00:59.850> times

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
health and they heal us or three times

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
health and they heal us or three times
as<00:01:00.270> much<00:01:00.450> so<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.020> will<00:01:01.170> improve<00:01:01.620> our

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
as much so this will improve our

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.050 
as much so this will improve our
survivability<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:04.250> they<00:01:05.250> cut<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> cooldowns

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
survivability and they cut the cooldowns

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.149 
survivability and they cut the cooldowns
of<00:01:06.299> strangulate<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.470> fixie<00:01:07.860> ate<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
of strangulate and it's fixie ate in

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
of strangulate and it's fixie ate in
half<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.420> will<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.689> pretty<00:01:09.840> nice<00:01:10.170> i

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
half I think this will be pretty nice i

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.130 
half I think this will be pretty nice i
use<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.740> asphyxiate<00:01:11.400> quite<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.900> 30

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
use it asphyxiate quite a bit and a 30

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.319 
use it asphyxiate quite a bit and a 30
second<00:01:13.500> cooldown<00:01:13.759> seems<00:01:14.759> like<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> pretty<00:01:15.119> nice

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
second cooldown seems like a pretty nice

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.910 
second cooldown seems like a pretty nice
