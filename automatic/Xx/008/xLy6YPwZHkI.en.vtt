00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
really thick one thing i will say is I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.999 
really thick one thing i will say is I
don't<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.409> why<00:01:43.799> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
don't really think that this is why I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.319 
don't really think that this is why I
wouldn't<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.369> consider<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.850> hair<00:01:45.060> water

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
wouldn't really consider this hair water

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.660 
wouldn't really consider this hair water
wave<00:01:45.600> hair<00:01:45.960> compared<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.220> Brazilian

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
wave hair compared to the Brazilian

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.539 
wave hair compared to the Brazilian
water<00:01:47.850> wave<00:01:48.000> hair<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> had<00:01:48.420> last<00:01:48.689> time<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:50.340> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
water wave hair I had last time and this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.550 
water wave hair I had last time and this
is<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.180> natural<00:01:51.720> wave<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.290> me<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
is more like of a natural wave to me of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.100 
is more like of a natural wave to me of
anything<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.100> would<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.520> don't<00:01:53.729> know<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.110> wouldn't

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
anything I would I don't know I wouldn't

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.539 
anything I would I don't know I wouldn't
call<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.439> why<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> way<00:01:55.740> compared<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
call it why the way compared to the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.280 
call it why the way compared to the
water<00:01:56.790> wave<00:01:56.939> hair<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:58.020> more

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
water wave hair that I have I would more

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
water wave hair that I have I would more
so<00:01:58.500> say<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.100> natural<00:01:59.340> wave<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.240> either

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
so say it's a natural wave but either

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.780 
so say it's a natural wave but either
