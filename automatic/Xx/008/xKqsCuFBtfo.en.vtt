00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
mean our chances are pretty good but I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600 
mean our chances are pretty good but I
still<00:01:07.020> would<00:01:07.229> rather<00:01:07.260> earn<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> spot<00:01:08.220> myself

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
still would rather earn the spot myself

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
still would rather earn the spot myself
by<00:01:09.060> winning<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> games<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.780> didn't<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.080> oh

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
yeah they lost the games because we

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.710

playoffs but then ended up finishing
fourth<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.689> wouldn't<00:01:25.350> even<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.830> into

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
fourth which wouldn't even get you into

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.289 
fourth which wouldn't even get you into
Worlds<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.369> year<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.939> year<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.240> been

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
Worlds this year but this year it's been

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.670 
Worlds this year but this year it's been
a<00:01:27.390> totally<00:01:27.810> different<00:01:28.080> story<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.470> want<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
a totally different story you want to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.410 
a totally different story you want to
talk<00:01:28.799> about<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:30.060> started<00:01:30.299> off

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
talk about that a bit we started off

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.840 
talk about that a bit we started off
really<00:01:30.540> strong<00:01:31.280> at<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> beginning<00:01:32.700> last

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
really strong at the beginning last

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.460 
really strong at the beginning last
plate<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.869> were<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> teams

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
plate because we were one of the teams

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.170 
plate because we were one of the teams
that<00:01:34.619> didn't<00:01:35.189> even<00:01:35.220> make<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.520> into<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> LCS

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that didn't even make it into the LCS

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.819 
that didn't even make it into the LCS
were<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.479> damn<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.930> got<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.140> practice<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.619> lot

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
were like damn we got to practice a lot

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.710 
were like damn we got to practice a lot
to<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.280> make<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> league<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.150> all

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to like make it in the league and all

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.819 
to like make it in the league and all
the<00:01:39.810> other<00:01:39.900> teams<00:01:40.079> are<00:01:40.170> taking<00:01:40.439> breaks<00:01:40.650> I

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the other teams are taking breaks I

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.200 
the other teams are taking breaks I
guess<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.790> got<00:01:42.030> way<00:01:42.180> more

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
guess so I think we just got way more

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
guess so I think we just got way more
practicing<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.470> same<00:01:43.590> thing<00:01:43.740> happen

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
practicing I think the same thing happen

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.740 
practicing I think the same thing happen
to<00:01:43.920> cloud<00:01:44.100> nine<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:45.149> weren't<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
to cloud nine like they weren't in the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.179 
to cloud nine like they weren't in the
league<00:01:45.899> yet<00:01:46.049> had<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> qualify<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.100> they

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
league yet had to qualify for it so they

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.789 
league yet had to qualify for it so they
just<00:01:47.220> practice<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.880> ton<00:01:48.590> during<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.649> offseason

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
just practice a ton during the offseason

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.380 
just practice a ton during the offseason
and<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.000> reason<00:01:51.119> why<00:01:51.299> they

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and I think it's one reason why they

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.300 
and I think it's one reason why they
perform<00:01:51.689> really<00:01:51.810> well<00:01:51.930> too<00:01:52.200> okay<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.130> then

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
perform really well too okay and then

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.499 
perform really well too okay and then
coming<00:01:53.490> into<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.060> do<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.329> maybe

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
coming into this but do you think maybe

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
coming into this but do you think maybe
there<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:54.960> some<00:01:55.110> complacency<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
there was some complacency and the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.350 
there was some complacency and the
reason<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.250> guys<00:01:56.399> started<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.850> slowly<00:01:57.119> or

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
reason you guys started so slowly or

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.609 
reason you guys started so slowly or
what<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:57.810> contributed<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.350> as

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
what do you think contributed to that as

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.840 
what do you think contributed to that as
compared<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> first<00:01:59.430> split<00:01:59.640> where<00:01:59.790> he

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
compared to the first split where he

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.910 
compared to the first split where he
started<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.240> well<00:02:00.390> uh<00:02:00.600> yeah<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> think<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
started so well uh yeah I think like a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.469 
started so well uh yeah I think like a
lot<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.189> went<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.369> vacation<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:03.180> went<00:02:03.360> did

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
lot of you went on vacation I went did

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.510 
lot of you went on vacation I went did
all<00:02:03.600> stars<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.979> didn't<00:02:05.159> get<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
all stars and we just didn't get the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.850 
all stars and we just didn't get the
quality<00:02:06.329> practice<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.079> had<00:02:07.200> were<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.680> join

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
quality practice and we had were to join

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.160 
quality practice and we had were to join
the<00:02:08.009> team<00:02:08.160> he<00:02:08.399> had<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:09.119> work<00:02:09.300> him<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.780> get

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the team he had to like work him and get

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.350 
the team he had to like work him and get
getting<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.560> all<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.770> energy<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.000> I
