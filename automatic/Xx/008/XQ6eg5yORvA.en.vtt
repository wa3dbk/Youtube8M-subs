00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 in terms of position direction and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.049
 anatomical movements in this box 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.269
 let's observe that the position 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.780
 anatomical is defined as the position 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.560
 erect with the palms towards 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.100
 forward and from this the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.260
 other terms such as before and after 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.450
 which are parts of the body that are 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.690
 precede and follow during the progression 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.140
 anatomical and are synonyms of ventral and 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.140
 dorsal 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.969
 we also see that in the human being 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:42.620
 they are also synonymous cranial and superior 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:47.199
 and lower flow 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.500
 the terms like vertical vertical 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:54.860
 down and horizontal 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.620
 denote the relationship of the body of the foot 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.629
 with the seriousness 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.989
 and in turn we are also going to finish 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.989
 we will have the terms as 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.989
 longitudinal 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:13.460
 transverse sagittal 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.880
 coronal frontal medial and lateral sagittal 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.820
 let's see what is a plane that is going to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.310
 divide the individual in right half in 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.310
 half left this is the sagittal plane 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:36.910
 proximal and distal will mean him 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.010
 closer to the point or further away from 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.010
 same in general terms apply 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.750
 preferably to the proximal limbs 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.400
 closer to the trunk 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.620
 and distal further from the trunk 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.600
 there are also special terms 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.550
 applicable only to members 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.550
 medial and lateral dice 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.880
 continuing with the plans we will see 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.179
 the sagittal plane will divide the body 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.610
 in the right half in the left half 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.459
 frontal plane is going to be a line that goes 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.860
 to go through the coronary region and what's 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.819
 to divide the body into ventral region and 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.819
 in the dorsal region 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.989
 the transverse plane is the one that goes to 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.550
 divide the body into a superior region 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.550
 and a lower region 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.340
 now the sagittal plane again 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.400
 making a 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.530
 an emphasis let's see what will divide 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.050
 the body in half right half 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.310
 left the coronal plane will divide 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.830
 in the central region and in the dorsal region and 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.250
 the transverse plane will divide u 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.569
 horizontal the body in upper region 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.659
 and lower region 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.810
 watching here the movements of the ankle 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.749
 let's see that the ankle in flex 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.709
 dorsal that involves the movement of the foot 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:10.909
 towards the central region and bending 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:14.650
 planting means that the ankle is going to 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.650
 turn towards the dorsal region 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.740
 in terms of investment movements 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.590
 and investment 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.580
 these are defined those of turning the plant 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:30.810
 Foot out in the case of 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.750
 version and what to turn the foot 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.590
 the sole of the foot inwards that 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.590
 call investment 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.150
 pronation means that in the palm 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.540
 hand in hand towards Asia and towards 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.620
 down and overcoming the palm of the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.810
 hand 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.810
 is directed upwards 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.239
 and here we see the movements of the wrist 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.219
 in this case there will be bending that the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.319
 palm of the hand goes towards the region 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:09.670
 ventral and extension is to return to the 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:13.470
 previous position 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.470
 towards the dorsal region 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.170
 we are also going to see in extension we are going to 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.170
 see here 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:27.110
 extension extension will also see in 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.449
 both in the fingers and as flex 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.449
 extension we will also find 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.030
 level of the knee that the knee is going to 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.260
 go to your normal position inflection going to 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.320
 go to the dorsal region 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.640
 knee 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.190
 instead the movements more a little 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.639
 more out of the section go sea 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.379
 dorsiflexion not 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.219
 and extension is going to be called also 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:57.759
 plantar hyperextension in the case of 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.759
 ankle 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.800
 let's see in this case that we are going to 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.590
 find circumcision the 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.750
 circumcision 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.230
 it is a movement in which the member 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.690
 of write a cone when moving and its part 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.690
 distal moves in a circle 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:25.310
 and the next one acts as a pivot 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.910
 over which the movements come together 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.760
 of flexion abduction extension and 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.780
 adduction those who together produce the 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.780
 circular movement 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.760
 here we are going to see the terms of 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.090
 abduction in the case of the shoulder to 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.849
 deduction means that arm one what 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.789
 will move up 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.629
 and adduction the arm will go to your 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.629
 normal position
