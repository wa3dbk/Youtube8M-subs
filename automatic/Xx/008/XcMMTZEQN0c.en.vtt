the<00:02:00.400> front<00:02:01.390> face<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.630> this<00:02:02.050> case<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.590> which<00:02:02.800> in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
the front face of this case so which in

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.560 
the front face of this case so which in
turn<00:02:03.580> creates<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.180> very<00:02:04.660> high<00:02:05.470> ridge<00:02:05.800> or<00:02:06.640> very

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
turn creates a very high ridge or very

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.559 
turn creates a very high ridge or very
good<00:02:07.870> lay<00:02:08.410> on<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.709> table<00:02:08.739> design<00:02:09.369> some<00:02:10.090> might

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
good lay on the table design some might

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.869 
good lay on the table design some might
say<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:11.109> it<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> little<00:02:11.379> little<00:02:11.769> too<00:02:12.069> deep<00:02:12.250> i

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
say that it a little little too deep i

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.950 
say that it a little little too deep i
did<00:02:13.510> find<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.959> few<00:02:14.140> issues<00:02:14.319> with<00:02:14.859> using

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
did find a few issues with using

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.010 
did find a few issues with using
apps<00:02:16.230> running<00:02:16.980> into<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> corner<00:02:17.870> because<00:02:18.870> it

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
apps running into the corner because it

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.350 
apps running into the corner because it
was<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.350> high<00:02:19.700> there's<00:02:20.700> other<00:02:20.880> cases<00:02:21.120> that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
was so high there's other cases that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.700 
was so high there's other cases that
have<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> little<00:02:21.660> bit<00:02:21.750> lower<00:02:21.960> lay<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.650> the

have a little bit lower lay in the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.850 
have a little bit lower lay in the
disabled<00:02:23.160> design<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:24.480> isn't<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.530> would

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
disabled design that isn't as I would

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.360 
disabled design that isn't as I would

call true civ right other than that

call true civ right other than that
removal<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.390> case<00:02:30.600> should<00:02:31.110> be<00:02:31.170> relatively

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
removal the case should be relatively

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.130 
removal the case should be relatively
easy<00:02:31.830> all<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.280> really<00:02:32.550> need<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.940> do<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.140> press

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
easy all you really need to do is press

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.840 
easy all you really need to do is press
both<00:02:34.350> sides<00:02:34.650> together<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:35.580> just

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
both sides together and then just

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.700 
both sides together and then just
release<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.600> issue<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.020> had<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
release the issue that I had with the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.640 
release the issue that I had with the
both<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.700> black<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.690> spoke<00:02:39.960> version<00:02:40.410> it

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
both the black and the spoke version it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.600 
both the black and the spoke version it
could<00:02:41.160> be<00:02:41.310> because<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.160> soft<00:02:44.400> touch

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
could be because of the soft touch

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.480 
could be because of the soft touch
inside<00:02:45.560> depending<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.770> fit<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.220> phone

inside depending on the fit of the phone

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.670 
inside depending on the fit of the phone
it<00:02:47.820> could<00:02:48.060> be<00:02:48.240> any<00:02:48.510> number<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:49.050> reasons<00:02:49.170> since

it could be any number of reasons since

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.170 
it could be any number of reasons since
these<00:02:49.860> are<00:02:49.920> samples<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.610> were<00:02:50.700> sent<00:02:50.880> out<00:02:51.030> by

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
these are samples that were sent out by

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.840 
these are samples that were sent out by
proof<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.800> directions<00:02:53.280> say<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.490> just

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
proof but the directions say to just

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.330 
proof but the directions say to just
depress<00:02:54.240> both<00:02:54.480> ends<00:02:54.720> these<00:02:55.560> little<00:02:55.830> clips<00:02:56.100> and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
depress both ends these little clips and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.030 
depress both ends these little clips and
slide<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.300> out<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> issue<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.650> i<00:02:58.710> had

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
slide it out but the issue that i had

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.150 
slide it out but the issue that i had
was<00:02:59.370> as<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.570> can<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.290> isn't<00:03:01.980> really

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
was as you can see it isn't really

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.880 
was as you can see it isn't really
sliding<00:03:02.580> out<00:03:02.670> for<00:03:02.970> me<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:04.200> was<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.410> difficulty

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
sliding out for me that was a difficulty

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.010 
sliding out for me that was a difficulty

have<00:03:28.050> cover<00:03:28.950> up<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.930> edge<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:32.240> you're

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
have cover up the edge of it and you're

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.170 
have cover up the edge of it and you're
going<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:34.100> put<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.280> into<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.520> ridge<00:03:35.820> and

get that grip that you need to kind of

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.050 
get that grip that you need to kind of
remove<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.740> portion<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.220> case<00:03:44.520> out<00:03:44.760> and

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
remove the portion of the case out and

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.480 
remove the portion of the case out and
then<00:03:45.810> really<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.410> simple<00:03:46.980> there<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.340> just

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
then really it's simple there you just
