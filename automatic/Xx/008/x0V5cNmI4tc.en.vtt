and when I spoke to the makeup artist I

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.350 
and when I spoke to the makeup artist I
think<00:00:35.170> they<00:00:35.440> used<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:36.370> inspiration<00:00:37.000> of<00:00:37.120> like

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
think they used the inspiration of like

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.889 
think they used the inspiration of like
BB<00:00:37.719> creams<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.469> that<00:00:38.559> kind<00:00:38.829> of<00:00:39.239> aspect<00:00:40.239> of<00:00:40.749> it

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
BB creams and that kind of aspect of it

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.989 
BB creams and that kind of aspect of it
and<00:00:41.019> put<00:00:41.289> it<00:00:41.379> into<00:00:41.620> their<00:00:41.800> skin<00:00:42.789> base

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
and put it into their skin base

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.430 
and put it into their skin base
foundation<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:43.749> this<00:00:43.870> just<00:00:44.079> gives<00:00:44.260> a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
foundation and this just gives a

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.220 
foundation and this just gives a
flawless<00:00:44.920> finish<00:00:45.879> it's<00:00:46.359> just<00:00:46.600> so<00:00:46.960> beautiful
