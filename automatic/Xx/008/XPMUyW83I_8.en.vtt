00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
I know it but back to the bosses they

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.070 
I know it but back to the bosses they
aren't<00:04:22.889> hard<00:04:23.099> to<00:04:23.159> fight<00:04:23.550> per<00:04:24.030> se<00:04:24.479> but<00:04:24.810> they<00:04:24.960> are

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
aren't hard to fight per se but they are

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.170 
aren't hard to fight per se but they are
tricky<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.740> learning<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.190> pattern<00:04:26.909> really

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
tricky and learning the pattern really

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.260 
tricky and learning the pattern really
helps<00:04:28.070> except<00:04:29.070> maybe<00:04:29.159> chainsaw<00:04:29.789> guy<00:04:30.000> because

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
helps except maybe chainsaw guy because

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.000 
helps except maybe chainsaw guy because
I<00:04:30.300> actually<00:04:30.449> never<00:04:30.870> fought<00:04:31.260> him<00:04:31.500> hands-on

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
I actually never fought him hands-on

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.250 
I actually never fought him hands-on
because<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.400> don't<00:04:32.550> know<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.760> pattern<00:04:33.260> another

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
because I don't know the pattern another

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.050 
because I don't know the pattern another
thing<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.650> like<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:34.889> when<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.310> defeat<00:04:35.639> some<00:04:35.940> of

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
thing I like is when you defeat some of

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.909 
thing I like is when you defeat some of
the<00:04:36.120> bosses<00:04:36.330> they'll<00:04:36.780> have<00:04:36.990> this<00:04:37.169> last<00:04:37.500> attack

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
the bosses they'll have this last attack

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.860 
the bosses they'll have this last attack
move<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.400> they'll<00:04:38.580> throw<00:04:38.940> at<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:39.479> even

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
move that they'll throw at you so even

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.930 
move that they'll throw at you so even
when<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.110> battle<00:04:40.500> is<00:04:40.530> over<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:41.550> can<00:04:41.580> still

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
when the battle is over you can still

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.899 
when the battle is over you can still
die<00:04:42.180> kind<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.110> like<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.470> one<00:04:43.909> Castlevania

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
die kind of like that one Castlevania

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.950 
die kind of like that one Castlevania
game<00:04:45.210> in<00:04:45.389> that<00:04:45.690> Indiana<00:04:46.560> Jones<00:04:46.979> game<00:04:47.280> and

game in that Indiana Jones game and
that's<00:04:48.960> how<00:04:49.110> pretty<00:04:49.620> much<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.979> game<00:04:50.159> works<00:04:50.490> so

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
that's how pretty much the game works so

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.760 
that's how pretty much the game works so
let's<00:04:51.539> move<00:04:51.690> on<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:53.460> music<00:04:54.590> brilliant<00:04:55.590> it's
