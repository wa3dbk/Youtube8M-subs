with<00:03:37.620> Luke<00:03:37.769> Skywalker<00:03:38.280> in<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.300> film<00:03:40.130> so<00:03:41.130> you

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
with Luke Skywalker in the film so you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.699 
with Luke Skywalker in the film so you
can<00:03:41.459> recreate<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.239> glove<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.750> pops

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
can recreate that the glove just pops

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.050 
can recreate that the glove just pops
off<00:03:44.330> like<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.519> underneath<00:03:47.519> you've<00:03:47.850> got

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
off like so and underneath you've got

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.229 
off like so and underneath you've got
the<00:03:48.290> severed<00:03:49.290> circuits<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.400> Darth<00:03:50.820> Vader's

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
the severed circuits of Darth Vader's

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.610 
the severed circuits of Darth Vader's
chopped<00:03:51.600> off<00:03:51.780> hand<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.730> stub<00:03:54.180> there<00:03:54.620> does

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
chopped off hand and the stub there does

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.180 
chopped off hand and the stub there does
actually<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:58.320> doesn't<00:03:58.739> -<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:59.040> thought

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
actually and that doesn't - I thought

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.930 
actually and that doesn't - I thought
you<00:03:59.340> swivel<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.760> be<00:03:59.880> it<00:03:59.940> doesn't<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:01.470> glove

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
you swivel to be it doesn't the glove

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.360 
you swivel to be it doesn't the glove

new<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.800> table<00:05:05.100> you<00:05:05.430> know<00:05:05.550> it's<00:05:05.700> not

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
new to the table you know it's not

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.340 
new to the table you know it's not
something<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.300> we've<00:05:06.510> seen<00:05:06.750> time<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.290> time

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
something that we've seen time and time

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.890

again<00:05:07.470> it's<00:05:08.370> quite<00:05:08.580> unique<00:05:08.940> looking<00:05:09.540> figure

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
again it's quite unique looking figure

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.200 
again it's quite unique looking figure
and<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.830> know<00:05:10.920> the<00:05:11.100> translucent<00:05:11.760> helmet

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
and you know the translucent helmet

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.940

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
chilling and really really cool I'm not

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.070 
chilling and really really cool I'm not
sure<00:05:18.000> how<00:05:18.210> well<00:05:18.390> it's<00:05:18.570> showing<00:05:18.810> up<00:05:18.900> on<00:05:19.050> camera

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
sure how well it's showing up on camera

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.140 
sure how well it's showing up on camera
but<00:05:19.650> if<00:05:20.040> you<00:05:20.130> get<00:05:20.280> a<00:05:20.310> good<00:05:20.490> look<00:05:20.700> at<00:05:20.850> this<00:05:20.970> thing

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
but if you get a good look at this thing

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.790 
but if you get a good look at this thing
in<00:05:21.300> person<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:22.230> just<00:05:22.440> looks<00:05:22.650> absolutely

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
in person and it just looks absolutely

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.970 
in person and it just looks absolutely
phenomenal<00:05:23.190> so<00:05:24.170> the<00:05:25.170> camera<00:05:25.530> doesn't<00:05:25.710> really

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
phenomenal so the camera doesn't really

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.360 
phenomenal so the camera doesn't really
do<00:05:26.130> it<00:05:26.250> justice<00:05:26.280> in<00:05:26.940> this<00:05:27.120> review<00:05:28.220> but<00:05:29.220> here's

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
do it justice in this review but here's

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.370 
do it justice in this review but here's
a<00:05:29.430> very<00:05:29.760> very<00:05:29.970> cool<00:05:30.180> figure<00:05:30.480> definitely<00:05:31.200> one

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
a very very cool figure definitely one

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.800 
a very very cool figure definitely one
that<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.620> would<00:05:31.680> recommend<00:05:31.830> picking<00:05:32.640> up<00:05:32.810> the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
that I would recommend picking up the

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.630 
that I would recommend picking up the
Lightning<00:05:34.200> is<00:05:34.290> of<00:05:34.440> course<00:05:34.680> removable<00:05:35.220> but<00:05:35.430> I'm

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
Lightning is of course removable but I'm

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.860 
Lightning is of course removable but I'm
not<00:05:35.790> going<00:05:35.910> to<00:05:35.970> do<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.240> now<00:05:36.420> because<00:05:36.600> it's

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
not going to do that now because it's

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.860 
not going to do that now because it's
quite<00:05:37.050> tricky<00:05:37.320> to<00:05:37.470> take<00:05:38.010> on<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.400> off<00:05:38.870> but

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
quite tricky to take on and off but

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.850 
quite tricky to take on and off but
definitely<00:05:40.260> I<00:05:40.320> figure<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:40.650> I'd<00:05:40.710> recommend

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
definitely I figure that I'd recommend

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.340 
definitely I figure that I'd recommend
picking<00:05:41.340> up<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:41.850> perfect<00:05:42.720> if<00:05:42.930> you<00:05:43.080> want<00:05:43.260> to

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
picking up and perfect if you want to

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.010 
picking up and perfect if you want to
recreate<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.830> scene<00:05:44.300> from<00:05:45.300> Return<00:05:45.660> of<00:05:45.900> the

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
recreate the scene from Return of the

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.790 
recreate the scene from Return of the
Jedi<00:05:48.290> so<00:05:49.290> there<00:05:49.440> we<00:05:49.500> go

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
Jedi so there we go

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.820 
Jedi so there we go
that<00:05:49.980> is<00:05:50.160> Darth<00:05:50.730> Vader<00:05:51.169> nothing<00:05:52.169> much<00:05:52.380> more<00:05:52.590> to

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
that is Darth Vader nothing much more to

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.950 
that is Darth Vader nothing much more to
say<00:05:53.010> about<00:05:53.040> the<00:05:53.340> rest<00:05:53.550> of<00:05:53.700> the<00:05:53.790> figure<00:05:54.060> as<00:05:54.240> we

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
say about the rest of the figure as we

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.330 
say about the rest of the figure as we
all<00:05:55.050> know<00:05:55.169> what<00:05:55.320> a<00:05:55.470> fader<00:05:55.710> looks<00:05:55.919> like<00:05:56.100> by<00:05:56.280> this

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
all know what a fader looks like by this

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.970 
all know what a fader looks like by this
point<00:05:56.669> I'm<00:05:57.450> sure<00:05:57.690> we<00:05:58.050> all<00:05:58.080> have<00:05:58.260> enough<00:05:58.800> of

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
point I'm sure we all have enough of

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.750 
point I'm sure we all have enough of
