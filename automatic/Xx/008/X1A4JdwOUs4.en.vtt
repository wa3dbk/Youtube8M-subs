00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.290
 I present the new combination of 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.879
 boot colors in nitro chair 1.0 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.860
 that is know as the last drop 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.240
 designed adidas the youngest century that 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.500
 is designed to recover energy 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.500
 of the player in each footprint 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.349
 Nitro features the most 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.179
 important is that it has two technologies 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.009
 main thought to recover the 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.599
 energy that each player gives off in 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.269
 the footsteps energy that is normally 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.769
 loses and that it tries to recover a 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.079
 is in the housing that is this band of 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 Slim energy and another is in the sole that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.500
 it is this area that we see marked in a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.089
 different color called energy pools 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 let's go talking part by part of 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.490
 the boot and we'll stop in these two 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 pieces 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.910
 Oh 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.770
 we started talking about the housing the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.050
 housing has two parts well 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.340
 differentiated that are also cut 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.470
 precisely because of this rubber band 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.580
 energy sling the front part is the 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.830
 part that comes in contact with the 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.360
 ball and is made of bridgetown the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.180
 same material that is manufactured for everything 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.590
 what is manufactured from zero f50 and in this 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.850
 occasion has a few small inserts 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.740
 of silicone that what they are going to do to us 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.690
 is that we have much more contact between 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.980
 the ball and the boot when especially 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.110
 when wet, any of the 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.090
 two of the niles ribbon link towards 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.190
 back is a synthetic micro fiber a lot 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.780
 lighter adidas lends less 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.000
 importance to the ball contact with 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.920
 this area since the contacts are a lot 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.990
 minors and that if you are going to contribute 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 extra lightness to the boot we 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 we stop at the in the energy sling this 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.540
 area that we talked about earlier that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.670
 recover the energy that the player 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.470
 generates each tread is a band that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.119
 crosses the boot transversely a 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.290
 rubber band with a component of the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.240
 very large peaks and makes in each 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.500
 step or on each lateral support that 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.600
 produces an imbalance between the foot and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.790
 the boot quickly the foot regains its 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.170
 original position on the boot avoiding 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.759
 that loss of energy that in the end 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.759
 results in player comfort 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.180
 and 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.550
 we went on to talk about the sole plate 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.930
 which is where the second one is concentrated 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.390
 part of the technology of this boot 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.580
 before going to the energy press 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.350
 let's talk about the spin frame is a 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.350
 technology and know all 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.090
 incorporated lives in 2010 with the 1950 and 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.250
 it has continued to maintain many boots 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.600
 until it's disappearing except in 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.280
 nitro that still uses this 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.230
 technology that what you are going to do is 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.850
 reduce the profile to the minimum 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.620
 of the sole achieving maximum lightness 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.510
 getting a lot of stability because the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.460
 player is almost totally supported 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.020
 on the pitch and also an 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.880
 boot very balanced since it has in the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.290
 foot bridge area these bands of 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.030
 stability that will allow us to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.340
 no torsion affects our footprint 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.959
 as a curiosity he keeps the space of 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.240
 michaels to put the sensor that's going to 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.830
 measure the parameters of our game and 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.140
 we move to the front of the boot 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.180
 where we see the tacos traction 2.0 with 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.650
 three traction edges and above all 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.410
 this area marked in a lighter blue 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.300
 what is the energy pools energy push what 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.160
 that will endow is reactivity to the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.930
 tread and that is reactivity then after 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.100
 from each step the boot returns 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.480
 quickly to your position with a 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.950
 very elastic movement in such a way 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.810
 that we are prepared to do the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.950
 next support and get that each 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.470
 of the footprints be very 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.660
 ethics we do not have much of the reactivity 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.000
 of that kind of spring effect that 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.099
 generates the in the jeep press on the plate 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.099
 of our nitro 1.0 boot 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.830
 we ended up talking about nitro weight is 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.870
 a boot that is intermediate between a 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.730
 hitting boot and a very light boot like that 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.790
 that his weight should come out intermediate 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.930
 between predator and there is the f50 says if the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.510
 We go up to our precision scale 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.460
 gives us a weight of 217 grams and 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.580
 obviously it's between 200 grams 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.480
 approximate drive 0 50 and the almost 300 of 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.480
 prato lifting
