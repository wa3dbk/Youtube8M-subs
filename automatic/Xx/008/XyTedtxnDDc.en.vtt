 prices and all that ok I have three 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.050
 tones and used them to correct the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.790
 face more let's start with what 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 what is the product is not and from this side 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.070
 transparent here tends has here its 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.980
 name beezus and get this and under 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.989
 we have the tone ok in this case it turned 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.000
 the number three of this wood of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.500
 plastic closes very well I do not care 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.170
 that the makeup opens to me 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.329
 cochinero has this tone here of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.600
 esade arribita this tone that you will see 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.480
 in the product that this is retractable 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.030
 and that has the product has a little 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.070
 least because I use it a lot but this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.310
 it's been my type of skin environment 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.119
 that tone number 3 are we're going to give them to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.960
 5h are very common they are very soft 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.970
 very creamy milestones have the time to 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.070
 that you can move it perfectly well 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.539
 to correct the areas for example this 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.450
 case I use it to correct 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.060
 imperfections that little spots that friend and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.520
 the area of ​​the ojera any granite 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.319
 after the base ok and already said it well 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.960
 a little bit with the heat of the finger 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.550
 I define it little in the place that does not 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.920
 I try to diffuse a lot because of 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.170
 Suddenly you can go the color and it seems 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.789
 that you do not skip anything but this product 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.220
 is for many very pigmented 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.929
 we believe milestone I loved it I love the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.780
 formula once you feel on your skin 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.569
 already staying there is not like it would be so 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.539
 that you have with this fact forgiven 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.340
 for nothing but I quite like the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.190
 truth to correct perfection is to be 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.510
 very well if you choose a color the type of 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.520
 skin seems like a 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.520
 the truth is very good 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.060
 but keep in Mexico is very good to me 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.910
 I quite like that in a variety of 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.330
 infinite tones the truth of tones like 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.920
 of some dark the most clarito and also 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.870
 have to correct for example the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.550
 green have move it I have pink and one 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.100
 yellow esteem I am one white 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.780
 then that's fine order but 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.360
 as it will not set all the bought 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.970
 in the store in the crowd and I 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.470
 they went around like 40 pesos something 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.240
 well I'm not sure of the price but 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.190
 down you are putting it you already know that the 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.500
 Prices vary from boutique to useful so 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.270
 less here come Mexicalli I feel that 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.000
 they are a little more expensive but good 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.370
 We are leaving the page in the box 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.350
 of information here but if I like it 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.510
 quite and I use that for that very 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.670
 that to correct imperfections that in 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.489
 this moment I have it put those 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.060
 products now let's continue with this 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.790
 another is in tone number 6 and then everything 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.130
 has the same thing that changes nothing more than 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.780
 each one is the tone of this little thing 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.170
 up which is the tone that you will see in 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.590
 The product is 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.170
 another is a color with its yellow tone and 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.930
 is the use to illuminate the areas of my 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.300
 face anymore I start being run with 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.849
 the correction is more in depth I what 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.650
 What I do is put this product to 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.489
 illuminate the area of ​​my ojera of this 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.250
 side the bridge of my nose is to repeat 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.590
 in me in the cupid arch and also 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.360
 here on the chin that are of illuminates and 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.360
 wants to highlight the parts of your face 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.700
 I only use I is a logical tone 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.220
 what was it you can use it to illuminate 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.530
 is the tone number 6 will be true for 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.230
 all in the same formula I love and 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.620
 for that I use it now again 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.350
 very limited and it was pretty good this 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.970
 even though he used it to for 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.610
 illuminate I cover very well what is 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.950
 woman from the side I have this other one from 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.290
 here that is in tone number 8 I think that 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.689
 it's the darkest tone it has I 'm not 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.839
 very safe 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:39.689
 and that I use it to contour either 

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:41.939
 the nose is perfect for contouring 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.339
 that area also used it to 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:49.019
 outline my face as you can see 

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:53.040
 you have it next to the cheekbones also 

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:56.650
 under the chin here 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.060
 of the strawberry very well is a tone 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:04.479
 half because I have another miso too 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.630
 it's a very very brown tone that is the 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.120
 chocolate in the labial version 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.510
 but this works great for me 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.510
 true 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.060
 blurs very easily if you're a 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.610
 little more credit that I have left 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.310
 also perfectly to contour if 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.500
 you want to give more dimension to your 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.120
 face will be of much use to you 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.970
 blurs pretty well is not very creamy 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.410
 as I say and suddenly increase blur 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.120
 you can go a little color because 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.770
 you are blurring not because of what we believe and 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.810
 touch is but it's just now 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.630
 apply more with your finger you turn to 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.699
 blur and so it is becoming so I 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.070
 love this to do it with that 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.810
 I have three products on my face 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.270
 truth very much recommend it 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.729

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.600
