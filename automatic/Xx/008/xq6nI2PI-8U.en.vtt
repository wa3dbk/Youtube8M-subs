00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
controls are so slippery I'm trying to

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.730 
controls are so slippery I'm trying to
test<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.060> theory<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.810> can<00:04:06.050> jump<00:04:06.320> on<00:04:06.440> enemies

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
test the theory of I can jump on enemies

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.900 
test the theory of I can jump on enemies
like<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.310> could<00:04:07.490> in<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:07.700> game<00:04:07.880> boy<00:04:08.120> 1<00:04:09.610> so<00:04:10.610> far

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
like I could in the game boy 1 so far

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.930 
like I could in the game boy 1 so far
I've<00:04:11.660> been<00:04:11.720> unable<00:04:11.990> to<00:04:12.470> even<00:04:12.980> test<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.580> theory

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
I've been unable to even test the theory

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:21.250 
I've been unable to even test the theory
because<00:04:14.150> how<00:04:14.300> bad<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.660> controls<00:04:15.110> are<00:04:15.350> oh<00:04:20.260> now

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
because how bad the controls are oh now
