00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.190 
thinking is like what's that flying over
here<00:04:51.680> knife<00:04:52.370> in<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.640> throat<00:04:52.910> you're<00:04:53.300> dead<00:04:56.200> why

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
here knife in the throat you're dead why

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.470 
here knife in the throat you're dead why
what<00:04:57.470> was<00:04:57.590> he<00:04:57.680> guarding<00:04:58.070> there<00:04:58.220> anyways<00:05:01.480> why

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
what was he guarding there anyways why

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.780 
what was he guarding there anyways why
are<00:05:02.540> there<00:05:02.750> always<00:05:02.780> these<00:05:03.350> convenient<00:05:04.130> ATVs

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:22.240 

convenient<00:05:07.790> explosives

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:36.950 

whoo<00:05:32.330> that<00:05:33.330> probably<00:05:33.870> hurt

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.840 

this<00:05:37.960> is<00:05:38.020> my<00:05:38.170> favorite<00:05:38.410> part<00:05:38.620> of<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.800> map<00:05:41.850> just

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
this is my favorite part of the map just

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.370 
this is my favorite part of the map just
something<00:05:43.210> I<00:05:43.300> wanted<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.660> do<00:05:46.020> at<00:05:47.020> least<00:05:47.200> the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
something I wanted to do at least the

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.679 
something I wanted to do at least the
brakes<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:48.190> just<00:05:48.220> follow<00:05:48.910> the<00:05:49.360> show

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:55.129 

I<00:05:52.789> guess<00:05:53.789> this<00:05:53.969> is<00:05:54.119> the<00:05:54.209> worst<00:05:54.389> guard<00:05:54.689> position

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
I guess this is the worst guard position

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.479 
I guess this is the worst guard position
actually<00:05:55.439> exhibit<00:05:55.830> you<00:05:55.889> down<00:05:56.099> there<00:05:56.369> you

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:56.489 
actually exhibit you down there you

00:05:56.489 --> 00:06:03.289 
actually exhibit you down there you
you're<00:05:57.029> dead<00:05:57.209> oh<00:06:01.039> yeah<00:06:02.039> I<00:06:02.339> always<00:06:02.999> turn<00:06:03.119> off

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:03.299 
you're dead oh yeah I always turn off

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:04.729 
you're dead oh yeah I always turn off
fall<00:06:03.509> damage<00:06:03.869> so<00:06:04.019> you<00:06:04.110> can<00:06:04.229> just<00:06:04.259> do<00:06:04.559> some

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:04.739 
fall damage so you can just do some

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.109 
fall damage so you can just do some
crazy<00:06:04.889> stuff<00:06:05.099> and<00:06:05.579> you<00:06:05.669> know<00:06:05.759> have<00:06:05.849> to<00:06:05.909> worry

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:06.119 
crazy stuff and you know have to worry

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:07.789 
crazy stuff and you know have to worry
about<00:06:06.239> dying<00:06:06.719> from<00:06:07.079> something<00:06:07.229> stupid<00:06:07.679> like

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:07.799 
about dying from something stupid like

00:06:07.799 --> 00:06:10.009 
about dying from something stupid like
that<00:06:08.089> so<00:06:09.089> that's<00:06:09.209> why<00:06:09.360> I<00:06:09.389> just<00:06:09.629> won't<00:06:09.779> seem

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:10.019 
that so that's why I just won't seem

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:12.649 
that so that's why I just won't seem
straight<00:06:10.319> to<00:06:10.439> the<00:06:10.529> ground<00:06:10.769> and<00:06:11.659> didn't

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
straight to the ground and didn't

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:24.490 
straight to the ground and didn't
obliterate<00:06:13.319> myself

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.070 

look<00:06:25.500> at<00:06:25.620> that<00:06:25.860> accuracy<00:06:26.639> that<00:06:27.449> guy<00:06:27.690> only<00:06:27.870> took

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
look at that accuracy that guy only took

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:36.470 
look at that accuracy that guy only took
like<00:06:28.139> two<00:06:28.500> hundred<00:06:28.620> bullets<00:06:28.919> to<00:06:29.190> kill

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.140 

I<00:06:36.570> think<00:06:37.290> this<00:06:37.380> final<00:06:38.130> wave

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
almost at the extraction point let's

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.990 
almost at the extraction point let's
shock<00:06:47.870> on<00:06:48.050> this<00:06:48.200> guy<00:06:48.350> just<00:06:48.410> for<00:06:48.770> fun<00:06:54.910> look<00:06:55.910> at
