00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:06.290
 experts 2014 easily allows you to 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.590
 select tools starting from 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.639
 feature of your pieces in minutes 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.969
 saving the trouble of browsing 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.590
 catalogs to find the ideal tool 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.869
 just start by defining the features of the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.119
 your pieces in this case we have 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.250
 imported our nestri part who 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.800
 we have defined its features including 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.039
 a pocket a surface cana 1 shoulder 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.810
 mind once a channel that we 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.539
 selected the features of the piece 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.940
 select file and then export again 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.710
 the a machine features in the cloud i 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.899
 detailed parameters of the features e 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.600
 of the piece are exported and machine in 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.579
 cloud uses this information for 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.999
 automatically recommend best 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.350
 tool for each of the operations 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.760
 if we select the operation of 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.709
 smoothing we can see 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.289
 complete assembly of the tool 

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:56.869
 for that operation as well as the 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.539
 3d model in the 3d viewer the 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.519
 cloud machines even if it comes 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.600
 selected best tool for each 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.460
 operation 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.920
 the machine in the cloud compiles a list of 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.689
 potential tools classifying them from 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.700
 better to appropriate for each 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.380
 specific job 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.210
 in this way the programmer is always 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.789
 free to choose the tools from 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.229
 list with the parameters you can see 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.420
 deported in the summer comes 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.350
 automatically created a list of 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.350
 tools to display 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.490
 using channel processing 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.350
 as an example we can see that the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.390
 cloud machine considers all 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.120
 parameters of the worst in making one 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.130
 selection for users this 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.900
 includes the material the depth the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.610
 width the corner of the wall the 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.550
 radius the quality of the finish e 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.620
 any other information of such the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.690
 cloud machines also provide six others 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.270
 flights for tools for example if yes 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.640
 want to throttle end up with the same 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.620
 with two different users on the base 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.010
 of the requirements that so far superficial 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.870
 tolerance desired with the connection 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.820
 cloud effect machines and programmers 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.590
 have access to the database and can 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.780
 download a detailed list of 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.370
 associated data tools needed 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.130
 for the work 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.390
 this reduces the programming by hours 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.360
 eliminating the manual definition of 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.280
 tools the simulation improved with 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.920
 accurate 3d models of the components 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.540
 assembly tool provides 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.550
 more security in 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.530
 processing and a greater guarantee of 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.530
 optimal quality of the finished piece
