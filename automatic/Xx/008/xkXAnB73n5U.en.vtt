00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello and welcome here 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.490
 at the multi fritzsche yes in today 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.490
 video the eighth part of our little ones 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.089
 Here I show you how to take pictures 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.890
 embeds in the source text but not so 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.680
 that you have the pictures in the same folder 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.380
 has saved as in how hard 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.170
 but if you let us know that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.939
 have picture in another folder and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.369
 we did have the one he needed 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.390
 So they are not in the same place 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.190
 so to speak I show you now and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.160
 I would say we start so casually 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.170
 mentioned this is the first time today where 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.230
 I'm doing the video on a new pc 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:49.700
 just mentioned by the way and I ask 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.700
 make us a bit good 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:07.790
 Let's start like that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:17.180
 of course again with html 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:17.180
 then come and then come 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:48.960
 I just write in the title 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:48.960
 insert picture close heading 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.700
 flow 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.789
 and now we see that images we 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.360
 know yes a normal offer adds from 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:16.750
 Just like you just like yourself 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.549
 html file is the gti mgs rc's 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.840
 right around quotation marks and now 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.510
 re- enrolled as the file 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.070
 even murder halt hate and we write 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.380
 Now it were not who what like this 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.810
 part of the picture means that we do 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.000
 quite different 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.829
 I needed a picture that I take 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.859

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:52.090

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:12.019

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.230

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.580
 we add that we say here that it 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.170
 our folders where we are, so to speak 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.970
 save html file 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.560
 but we do not save that here now 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.209

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:40.879

 a resonance has the picture here 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.709

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.629

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.379

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.599
 here is the picture 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:13.750
 I'm different now because of that 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:17.299

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.960
