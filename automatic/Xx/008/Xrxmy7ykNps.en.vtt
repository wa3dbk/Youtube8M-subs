00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 because we are in Mogul grain 600 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.050
 miles of beautiful northern horizon 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.690
 of Minas Gerais 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.980
 here in an area of â€‹â€‹one hectare 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.520
 we plan 150 seedlings in what we 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.119
 we call the method of ellen white pieces 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.400
 these seedlings were planted in 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.670
 system of consortium with other 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 legumes and grasses 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.280
 here we have 1 to 1 of fig where it was 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.120
 deployed around 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.510
 the manioc or the pigeon pea, and in that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.780
 interval of this row following the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.000
 that other row there. 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.700
 in this interval we will implement the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.059
 that will serve as material 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.629
 composting 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:03.180
 So these are these seedlings that were 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.000
 plants were dug cots of 90 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.930
 centimeters by 90 centimeters and 90 centimeters 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.330
 depth and then we use the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.280
 composting fills these holes and 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.170
 same time we put it with the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.140
 we put the compost 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.130
 we also put some nutrients from the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.100
 plants and singing these that the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.890
 gardening progression 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.930
 then that site is here in our 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.430
 beautiful lady rangel 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.509
 we can see an already planted hectare 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.360
 150 seedlings were planted now in the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.579
 rainy season as this region has a 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.740
 very prolonged period of drought and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.850
 we have also developed here the system of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.860
 irrigation 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.250
 today we will have irrigation for 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.250
 drip
