 martínez one day I had to give the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.220
 diagnosis to a patient and I did it with 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.460
 these words 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.940

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.870
 Hahaha 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.800
 in another case when 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.430
 another case of this book 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.830
 says the doctor appears one day in the 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.140
 office a patient with gangrene 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.200
 in advanced state 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.090
 fearful asks the actor doctor me 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.130

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.840
 a little 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.270
 so it goes on like this the book goes through 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.580
 countless chapters for example this 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.060
 chapter the frigidity to a subject of never 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.060
 finish 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.150
 dedicated chapter 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:45.640
 to gynecology obviously 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.410
 Dr. Martinez always said that the 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.440
 gynecologists are like the comics because 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.770
 they work where others have fun 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.770
 because 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.819
 for that reason although you seem to them 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.620
 lie 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:02.349
 all these anecdotes that I have told 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.749
 they really go to the clinics in 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.789
 the hospitals 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:08.439
 sometimes out of ignorance sometimes for 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.529
 negligence and when they ask me 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:13.930
 Worse ignorance or 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:16.020
 negligence I tell them I do not know neither 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.020
 interest 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.000
 now I feel access 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.820
 thank you thank you now yes then I'm going 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.550
 to fire 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.670
 I was a person very close to 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.720
 doctor martínez as you know me 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.720
 it was his refrigerator 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.540
 he always came to my ice cream store that day 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.520
 of samba are chocolates 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.720
 so, well, I 'm going to continue working 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.720
 I leave it 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.140
 so that it happens of rosario
