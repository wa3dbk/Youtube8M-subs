00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello and welcome to team of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 proteins for a motet this product in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 this video I represent and the whey 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.289
 teva gentry sion protein 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.000
 it's a product here abbas should there 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.640
 protein concentrate to call so 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.230
 delory basic protein here we have two 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.420
 distinctive elements on this product 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.710
 first of all ffa is known to do 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.359
 proteins it like for delicious 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.630
 what am I going to test during this 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.090
 test and in addition here we are on a web 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 enriched in honey brand summer estive I 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.510
 so which is supposed to improve the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.940
 digestion of the product that I see at 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 test also against the problem 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 pigat when we improve balls of 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.739
 product here that usually we're going to be 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.510
 obliged to reduce the dose a little 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.370
 of proteins to increase the dose 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.750
 including carbohydrates 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.449
 if what we find here because we are 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.489
 on a product that will have 67 % of 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.340
 protein which is pretty weak for 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.780
 a wave, however, had 18% of 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.550
 carbohydrates and 7% fat 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.260
 which, alas, is a bit hard for a 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.059
 wii so it's not necessarily a bit 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.010
 negative just keep it 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.330
 account in your food dish I 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.070
 also to morels and calculate the cost 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.680
 of the product 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.939
 so for the test I'm here on a 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 banid scent franck fanny fiery pear 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.030
 smoothie a 30 gram pod into 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.619
 5000 liters of water while the opening 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.610
 it smells very strongly vanilla and has 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.610
 produced or pear for now 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.619
 then no one has still sore moved by 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.360
 against there's no lumps the foam 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.350
 it now reducing putative but 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.390
 there are still not bad so I think 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.950
 that ideally we should leave 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.119
 rest a little bit the shaker to drink 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.270
 oh yes the room have against 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.270
 now 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.360
 it's not bad to not be enough 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.380
 loaded with sugar for my taste there is a 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.050
 very slight taste of ben ali 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.610
 a taste of fruit pear enough 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.770
 important so do not know where am I going 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.060
 did not feel new to you 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.310
 away the foam greatly diminished in 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.370
 when I thought so it's not at all 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.780
 it does not change it's a pretty light taste 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.340
 perhaps jérémy sweeter for me either 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.890
 but it would be enough to put less 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.990
 water but a corridor is not bad 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.620
 knowing that avanquest now ben 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.000
 I will see this protein during 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.050
 several days can so test 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.780
 in terms of assets if it goes well 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.580
 we'll meet a little later to 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.960
 following the video 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.000
 so little assessment I took several 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.970
 times this protein theory of the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.770
 federation I had a little fear 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.570
 with the digestive enzymes because 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.330
 they are supposed to improve the management 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.530
 of the product and the protein and so 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.680
 possibly also make it more 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.330
 effective but sometimes it can also be a 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.670
 little too much speeding up the question is 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.110
 asked some gastric problems 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.940
 on top of me i crawled out of these so 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.800
 rather a good point at this level there after 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.500
 I think the whole village has been busy not 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.670
 more pear taste is nice enough 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.980
 but for me maybe a little bit 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.209
 too light in sugar and for the foam in 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.130
 let's rest a few 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.780
 seconds the shaker to us is content 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.950
 so no worries and then no big 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.959
 words it can sometimes see small 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.150
 points so to conclude on this way 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.720
 presence of a digestive enzyme that 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.850
 help to assimilate the protein that is 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.989
 present and then a beautiful is nice 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.760
 even though he may not be sweet enough 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.410
 in my opinion now I heard myself 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.300
 loutraki drop once org for the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.070
 tests and reviews for any detail on this 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.959
 product on this test our consultations and 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.030
 of course all our test and especially 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.890
 do not forget to subscribe to our 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.780
 youtube channel your aware of 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.739
 all our videos as well the videos 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.850
 tests that exercise 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.850
 the program soon
