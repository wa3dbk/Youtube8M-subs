00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
pattern of mujin blue evolution mood and

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.049 
pattern of mujin blue evolution mood and
red<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.710> back<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.070> blue<00:00:11.280> again<00:00:11.580> you're

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
red and back to blue again you're

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.600 
red and back to blue again you're
thinking<00:00:12.420> way<00:00:12.599> should<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.650> back<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.190> blue

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
thinking way should this be back on blue

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.050 
thinking way should this be back on blue
but<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.780> decided<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> add<00:00:16.430> 20<00:00:17.430> more<00:00:17.580> battles<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
but I decided to add 20 more battles to

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.540 
but I decided to add 20 more battles to
the<00:00:18.150> mix<00:00:18.359> by<00:00:18.869> using<00:00:19.109> two<00:00:19.529> enemies<00:00:20.310> appear

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the mix by using two enemies appear

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.920 
the mix by using two enemies appear
screen<00:00:20.880> packs<00:00:21.090> because<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:21.810> much

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
screen packs because I have so much

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.080 
screen packs because I have so much
characters<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.789> pretty<00:00:23.970> much

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
characters that then I can pretty much

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.820 
characters that then I can pretty much
fit<00:00:24.449> all<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> ones<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.050> want<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.289> use<00:00:25.529> I

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
fit all the ones I want to use I

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.910 
fit all the ones I want to use I
actually<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.519> two<00:00:26.970> whole<00:00:27.330> screen<00:00:27.840> packs<00:00:28.140> you

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
actually have two whole screen packs you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.540 
actually have two whole screen packs you
can<00:00:29.039> believe<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.949> now<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:31.980> these<00:00:32.309> ones

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
can believe that so now for these ones

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.680 
can believe that so now for these ones
I'm<00:00:32.669> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.940> changing<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.540> little

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
I'm going to be changing it up a little

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.569 
I'm going to be changing it up a little
bit<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:35.070> way<00:00:35.190> I'm<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.520> doing

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
bit and the way I'm going to be doing

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
bit and the way I'm going to be doing
that<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> use<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.270> two<00:00:36.630> six-sided<00:00:37.170> dice

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that is the use of two six-sided dice

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.520 
that is the use of two six-sided dice
and<00:00:38.300> basically<00:00:39.300> depending<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.960> how<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.140> dice

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and basically depending on how the dice

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.590 
and basically depending on how the dice
land<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.040> will<00:00:41.129> either<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> single<00:00:41.820> single

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
land it will either be a single single

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.959 
land it will either be a single single
battle<00:00:42.840> sign<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.110> Valor<00:00:43.260> or<00:00:43.469> turns<00:00:43.860> battle<00:00:44.160> if

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
battle sign of Valor or turns battle if

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.810 
battle sign of Valor or turns battle if
the<00:00:45.840> total<00:00:46.110> sum<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> numbers<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.340> an<00:00:47.640> odd

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the total sum of the numbers is an odd

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.439 
the total sum of the numbers is an odd
number<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.239> will<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> simultaneous<00:00:50.270> in<00:00:51.270> goal

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
number it will be a simultaneous in goal

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.110 
number it will be a simultaneous in goal
now<00:00:51.840> even<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> seidel<00:00:52.620> battle<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:54.000> but

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
now even it's a seidel battle and it but

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.610 
now even it's a seidel battle and it but
if<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.660> happens<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> land<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
if it just so happens to land on the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.889 
if it just so happens to land on the
same<00:00:55.890> number<00:00:56.100> it'll<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> turns<00:00:57.090> battle<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
same number it'll be a turns battle so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.939 
same number it'll be a turns battle so
I'm<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.320> rolling<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.770> dice

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
I'm not going to be rolling two dice

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
I'm not going to be rolling two dice
right<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.000> let's<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.239> where<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.449> got<00:01:00.600> we

even right now it would have gotten
around<00:07:00.690> 7i<00:07:01.690> think<00:07:01.750> so<00:07:03.090> that's<00:07:04.090> that's<00:07:04.420> the

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
around 7i think so that's that's the

around 7i think so that's that's the
only<00:07:04.750> complaint<00:07:04.990> on<00:07:05.140> that<00:07:05.260> now<00:07:05.530> that<00:07:05.860> was<00:07:05.980> the

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
only complaint on that now that was the

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.430 
only complaint on that now that was the
pretty<00:07:06.280> good<00:07:06.520> turns<00:07:06.790> mal<00:07:07.000> using<00:07:07.390> them<00:07:07.510> usually

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440

the<00:07:08.740> wrist<00:07:08.980> behind<00:07:09.100> turns<00:07:09.820> now<00:07:10.000> sometimes<00:07:10.390> he

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.450 
the wrist behind turns now sometimes he

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.150 
the wrist behind turns now sometimes he
can<00:07:10.540> get<00:07:10.630> a<00:07:10.690> little<00:07:10.930> bit<00:07:11.110> boring<00:07:11.530> in<00:07:11.620> one<00:07:11.770> sided

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
can get a little bit boring in one sided

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.860 
can get a little bit boring in one sided
but<00:07:12.310> that<00:07:12.460> would<00:07:12.610> actually<00:07:12.790> wasn't<00:07:13.150> bad<00:07:13.480> that

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
but that would actually wasn't bad that

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.360 
but that would actually wasn't bad that
was<00:07:13.990> actually<00:07:14.140> that<00:07:14.800> was<00:07:14.920> pretty<00:07:15.100> good

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370
