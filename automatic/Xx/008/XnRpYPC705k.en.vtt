sport as you can see but we try to tone

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.890 
sport as you can see but we try to tone
it<00:02:23.570> down<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.930> little<00:02:24.170> bit<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:25.480> give<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.660> flavor

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
it down a little bit to give it a flavor

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.520 
it down a little bit to give it a flavor
of<00:02:27.050> how<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.410> used<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.860> be<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.450> 1960s<00:02:29.530> when

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
of how it used to be in the 1960s when

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.350 
of how it used to be in the 1960s when
people<00:02:30.920> just<00:02:31.100> used<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.490> wear<00:02:31.640> rugby<00:02:32.060> shirts

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
people just used to wear rugby shirts

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.550 
people just used to wear rugby shirts
and<00:02:32.750> leather<00:02:33.140> trousers<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.900> we<00:02:36.020> tried<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.350> give

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
and leather trousers so we tried to give

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.350 
and leather trousers so we tried to give
the<00:02:36.710> look<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.040> how<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.220> sport<00:02:37.640> used<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.150> play

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
the look of how the sport used to play

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.080 
the look of how the sport used to play
with<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.410> safety<00:02:40.070> protection<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.730> modern

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
with the safety protection of modern

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.940 
with the safety protection of modern
gear<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.700> machines<00:02:44.090> are<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.390> lot<00:02:44.600> more

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
gear and the machines are a lot more

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.230 
gear and the machines are a lot more
reliable<00:02:45.950> than<00:02:46.070> they<00:02:46.190> used<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.580> be<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.030> 60s

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
reliable than they used to be in the 60s

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.030 
reliable than they used to be in the 60s
there<00:02:47.600> were<00:02:47.690> mainly<00:02:47.900> old<00:02:48.200> British<00:02:48.590> machines

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
there were mainly old British machines

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.950 
there were mainly old British machines
which<00:02:49.520> weren't<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.970> most<00:02:50.150> reliable<00:02:50.480> things

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
which weren't the most reliable things

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.080 
which weren't the most reliable things
and<00:02:51.170> used<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.500> leak<00:02:51.740> oil<00:02:51.950> but<00:02:52.760> with<00:02:52.880> modern

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
and used to leak oil but with modern

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.360 
and used to leak oil but with modern
engineering<00:02:53.870> as<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.290> we<00:02:54.830> can<00:02:55.010> make<00:02:55.160> these

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
engineering as it is we can make these

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.730 
engineering as it is we can make these
bikes<00:02:55.670> quite<00:02:56.510> reliable<00:02:57.080> almost<00:02:57.470> like<00:02:57.710> a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
bikes quite reliable almost like a

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.310 
bikes quite reliable almost like a
modern<00:02:58.160> bike<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.150> still<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.780> still<00:03:00.110> quite

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
modern bike and the still is still quite

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.160 
modern bike and the still is still quite
a<00:03:00.350> quick<00:03:00.620> sport<00:03:01.040> but<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.510> track<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.930> track

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
a quick sport but the track the track

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.630 
a quick sport but the track the track
like<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.410> say<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.830> tracks<00:03:04.070> are<00:03:04.250> different<00:03:04.520> to

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
like I say the tracks are different to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.850 
like I say the tracks are different to
the<00:03:04.730> modern<00:03:05.000> track<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:05.540> they're<00:03:06.470> little<00:03:06.740> bit

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
the modern track so they're little bit

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.400 
the modern track so they're little bit
flatter<00:03:07.220> not<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.210> taxing<00:03:08.600> on<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.780> rider<00:03:09.110> or

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
flatter not so taxing on the rider or

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.530 
flatter not so taxing on the rider or
the<00:03:09.560> machine<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.670> consequently<00:03:11.360> we<00:03:11.510> have

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
the machine and consequently we have

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.660 
the machine and consequently we have
quite<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.900> few<00:03:12.200> quite<00:03:12.440> elderly<00:03:12.680> riders<00:03:13.430> taking

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670

but she's finding this quite quite a bit
more<00:03:41.540> difficult<00:03:41.600> because<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.440> bike<00:03:42.650> slides

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
more difficult because the bike slides

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.120 
more difficult because the bike slides
round<00:03:43.400> underneath<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:45.100> would<00:03:46.100> you

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.530 
round underneath you it just would you
certainly<00:03:46.640> don't<00:03:46.820> expect<00:03:47.000> when<00:03:47.420> you're

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
certainly don't expect when you're

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.479 
certainly don't expect when you're

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
riding on the tarmac but she's doing

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.010 
riding on the tarmac but she's doing
very<00:03:49.520> well<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.239> is<00:03:50.390> only<00:03:50.540> about<00:03:50.720> her

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
very well and this is only about her

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.130
