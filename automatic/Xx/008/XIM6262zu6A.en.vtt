after that get the screwdriver and you
prise<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.800> end<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.100> Part<00:00:44.370> B<00:00:45.079> a<00:00:46.079> bit<00:00:46.320> careful

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
prise the end of Part B a bit careful

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.630 
prise the end of Part B a bit careful
with<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:48.690> break<00:00:49.140> off<00:00:49.640> but

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
with this you can actually break off but

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
with this you can actually break off but
I<00:00:50.700> haven't<00:00:50.850> had<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.120> break<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.860> well<00:00:52.860> I've

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
I haven't had one break off well I've

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.540 
I haven't had one break off well I've
been<00:00:53.190> actually<00:00:53.550> bending<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.210> this

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
been actually bending it like this

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.189 
been actually bending it like this
there's<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:56.760> I've<00:00:56.850> done<00:00:57.000> earlier<00:00:58.820> right

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
there's one I've done earlier right

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:09.260 
there's one I've done earlier right
after<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:03.080> use<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.110> pliers<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:09.030> bend

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
after that use the pliers and you bend

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.940 
after that use the pliers and you bend
it<00:01:09.420> forwards<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.320> normally<00:01:10.740> do

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
it forwards like you would normally do

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.730 
it forwards like you would normally do
the<00:01:11.549> normal<00:01:11.909> type<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.330> ordinary<00:01:13.080> dog<00:01:13.350> earring

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the normal type of ordinary dog earring

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.950 
the normal type of ordinary dog earring
which<00:01:13.979> actually<00:01:14.400> works<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.360> nowhere<00:01:15.659> near<00:01:15.720> as

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
which actually works but nowhere near as

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.030 
which actually works but nowhere near as
well<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:18.530> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.680> look<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
well as this will if you look at the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.429 
well as this will if you look at the
angle<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:22.140> actually

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
angle on that you see it's actually

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.770 
angle on that you see it's actually
pointing<00:01:22.619> downwards<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.979> slightly<00:01:25.979> forwards

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
pointing downwards and slightly forwards

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
pointing downwards and slightly forwards
now<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.290> idea<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.130> keep<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
now the idea of this is to keep the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
now the idea of this is to keep the
rubber<00:01:29.759> actually<00:01:30.030> planted<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> glass

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
rubber actually planted on the glass

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
rubber actually planted on the glass
once<00:01:31.890> you're<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.310> around<00:01:32.610> windows<00:01:32.850> with

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
once you're going around windows with

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.539 
once you're going around windows with
rubber<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.290> will<00:01:34.409> keep<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.890> right<00:01:35.250> on

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
rubber on and it will keep it right on

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.310 
rubber on and it will keep it right on
the<00:01:35.759> edge<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.119> won't<00:01:36.329> actually<00:01:36.780> ride<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.170> over

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the edge it won't actually ride up over

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.120 
the edge it won't actually ride up over
the<00:01:37.710> rubber<00:01:37.920> itself<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> that's<00:01:39.840> how<00:01:40.770> your<00:01:40.950> dog

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the rubber itself so that's how your dog

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.940 
the rubber itself so that's how your dog
ear<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.210> worthwhile

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
ear and it's a really worthwhile

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.499 
ear and it's a really worthwhile
modification<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:45.710> okay<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.240> think

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
modification to do okay and I think

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
modification to do okay and I think
that's<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.439> I'll<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.310> check

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that's about it actually I'll just check

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.190 
that's about it actually I'll just check
see<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.060> I've<00:01:51.149> forgotten<00:01:51.390> anything<00:01:51.689> because<00:01:52.170> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
see if I've forgotten anything because I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
see if I've forgotten anything because I
often<00:01:53.009> will<00:01:53.159> forget<00:01:53.460> things<00:01:55.100> can<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.270> done

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
often will forget things can be done

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.719 
often will forget things can be done
virtually<00:01:57.600> any<00:01:58.079> channel<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.860> don't<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.670> about

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
virtually any channel I don't know about

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.330 
virtually any channel I don't know about
the<00:01:59.909> Sorbo<00:02:00.329> ones<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:00.869> I've<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the Sorbo ones but I've got one here of

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.940 
the Sorbo ones but I've got one here of
the<00:02:02.490> traditional<00:02:03.000> type<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.680> could<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the traditional type I could get the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.150 
the traditional type I could get the
thing<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:06.200> there<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.649> use<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
thing out there if you use the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.190 
thing out there if you use the
traditional<00:02:08.910> gear<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.360> one's<00:02:09.569> done<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:10.080> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
traditional gear that one's done as you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.900 
traditional gear that one's done as you
perhaps<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.489> really<00:02:11.520> big

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
perhaps see that it's a really big

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.599 
perhaps see that it's a really big
difference

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:13.609 
difference

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:17.240 
difference
if<00:02:14.609> you<00:02:15.450> Auto<00:02:15.659> fed<00:02:16.019> pole<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.650> mean<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.099> all

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
if you Auto fed pole I mean we all

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.699 
if you Auto fed pole I mean we all
perhaps<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:18.000> inside<00:02:18.569> jobs<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.260> still<00:02:19.530> use

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
perhaps have inside jobs so we still use

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.949 
perhaps have inside jobs so we still use
traditional<00:02:19.890> tools<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:21.090> modification

traditional tools and this modification
will<00:02:22.469> make<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.950> much<00:02:23.129> difference<00:02:23.420> if<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.569> see

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
will make so much difference if you see

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.099 
will make so much difference if you see
where<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.200> actual<00:02:25.680> tab<00:02:26.579> there<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.510> pointing

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
where the actual tab there is pointing

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.199 
where the actual tab there is pointing
right<00:02:28.140> into<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.890> corner<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:30.030> rubber

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
right into the corner of the rubber

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.360 
right into the corner of the rubber
blade<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.319> keeps<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.709> planted<00:02:32.129> on<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
blade and it keeps it planted on the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.940 
blade and it keeps it planted on the
glass<00:02:32.609> and<00:02:33.389> it's<00:02:33.540> an<00:02:33.689> absolutely<00:02:34.200> treat<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.859> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
glass and it's an absolutely treat of a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.159 
glass and it's an absolutely treat of a
mod<00:02:35.840> okay<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.760> think<00:02:38.760> that's<00:02:39.290> another<00:02:40.290> job<00:02:40.650> done
