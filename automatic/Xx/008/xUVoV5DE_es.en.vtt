00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
105 nonsense Akashi just made that - and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.069 
105 nonsense Akashi just made that - and
if<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.030> Kashi<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.450> would<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.840> hold

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
if I was like Kashi I would just hold

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.700 
if I was like Kashi I would just hold
the<00:01:46.200> ball<00:01:46.470> because<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.490> time<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.710> anything

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the ball because if time is anything

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.859 
the ball because if time is anything
like<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:50.700> close<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> ending<00:01:51.720> game

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
like if it's close to the ending game

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.590 
like if it's close to the ending game
you<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.740> hold<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> ball<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:54.060> while<00:01:54.149> so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you have to hold the ball for a while so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600 
you have to hold the ball for a while so
you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.869> win<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> game<00:01:55.350> fit<00:01:55.680> since<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.430> is

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you can win the game fit since this is

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.550 
you can win the game fit since this is
an<00:01:56.759> anime<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.600> has<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:57.930> action-packed

time rushing back and forth he's not

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.230 
time rushing back and forth he's not
gonna<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:06.000> that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
gonna do that

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.240 
gonna do that
obviously<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.590> would<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> smart

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
obviously but that would be the smart

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.589 
obviously but that would be the smart
move<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.080> he<00:02:10.770> tightened<00:02:11.280> he<00:02:11.760> lengthened

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
move to do so he tightened he lengthened

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.670 
move to do so he tightened he lengthened
the<00:02:12.750> gap<00:02:12.930> between<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the gap between the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.149 
the gap between the
course<00:02:13.920> once<00:02:14.280> again<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.510> think<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.159> this

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
course once again and I think that this

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.979 
course once again and I think that this
is<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> me<00:02:17.579> a<00:02:17.609> really<00:02:17.909> hard<00:02:18.030> game<00:02:18.269> for<00:02:18.450> setting

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
is a me a really hard game for setting

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.170 
is a me a really hard game for setting
to<00:02:19.109> win<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:19.469> I<00:02:19.530> think<00:02:19.920> they<00:02:20.129> still<00:02:20.489> overcome

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
to win but I think they still overcome

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.220 
to win but I think they still overcome

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
time overall I enjoyed this episode I

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.480 
time overall I enjoyed this episode I
think<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:31.139> team<00:04:31.410> setting<00:04:31.860> is<00:04:32.010> gonna<00:04:32.220> take

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
think that team setting is gonna take

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.180 
think that team setting is gonna take
the<00:04:32.639> win<00:04:32.880> for<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.300> season<00:04:33.870> finale<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.650> I

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
the win for the season finale and I

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.310 
the win for the season finale and I
think<00:04:35.430> akashi's<00:04:35.970> gonna<00:04:36.210> finally<00:04:36.690> witness

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
think akashi's gonna finally witness

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.379 
think akashi's gonna finally witness
loss<00:04:37.800> even<00:04:38.130> though<00:04:38.400> he's<00:04:38.580> back<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.060> his<00:04:39.180> true

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
loss even though he's back to his true

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.060 
loss even though he's back to his true
self<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.900> don't<00:04:40.320> think<00:04:40.470> he's<00:04:40.560> gonna<00:04:40.710> break<00:04:41.010> down

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070
