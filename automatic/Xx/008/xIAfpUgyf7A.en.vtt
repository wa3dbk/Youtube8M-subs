planning<00:00:44.879> things<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.649> understanding<00:00:46.649> that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
planning things and understanding that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.190

vehicles zipper interactive was able to

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.169 
vehicles zipper interactive was able to
increase<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.200> size<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.709> the<00:01:44.799> maps<00:01:45.099> what<00:01:45.939> was

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
increase the size of the maps what was

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.990 
increase the size of the maps what was
entire<00:01:46.750> Maps<00:01:47.259> in<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.590> first<00:01:47.860> two<00:01:48.069> games<00:01:48.099> now

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
entire Maps in the first two games now

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.899 
entire Maps in the first two games now
it's<00:01:49.509> just<00:01:49.659> an<00:01:49.840> area<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.739> much<00:01:51.039> larger<00:01:51.250> map

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
it's just an area of the much larger map

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.389 
it's just an area of the much larger map
this<00:01:52.720> makes<00:01:52.989> for<00:01:53.110> much<00:01:53.349> more<00:01:53.619> engrossing<00:01:54.009> in

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
this makes for much more engrossing in

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.550 
this makes for much more engrossing in
deep<00:01:54.640> missions<00:01:55.090> as<00:01:55.209> you<00:01:55.689> have<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.989> move<00:01:56.259> across
