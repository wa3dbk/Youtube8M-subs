 the manager will not transfuse I went not 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.280

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.900
 held not by the manager 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.909
 collapse that is, first I wanted 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.140

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.700

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.990
 allow will be if you are a manager and I 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.500
 now I will try not to notice it 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:54.710
 I will mark the increase and make a whole of it 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.960
 problem i would think so kind of why 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.210
 you don't want to shake the thread for the purpose 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.240
 feel like a goat like so 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.110
 nice talk and furious friend here 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.350
 valuable and now feels that's all that's 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.170
 dear and then it will be necessary that you and years 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.459
 asking how it went on 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.959
 the fun begins 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.690
 Ulyana experienced manager she rather 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.850
 problems but we are inexperienced rotate 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.819
 invent were tough negotiations on 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.580
 Syria we did not really talk like him 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.890
 ran we have nothing to talk about even 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.769
 forgets about what we agreed 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.940
 cheese as there is a place and start a doctor 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.269
 so it was very difficult even to us 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.209
 real boy you all see that 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.950
 so stuck there how close is the man himself 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.120
 there were three tough negotiations 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.579
 really for the sake of which just frankly 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.910
 think you just sat and he saw 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.910
 just scared to justify myself
