00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
I taught on the bike down a little bit

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.590 
I taught on the bike down a little bit
the<00:01:39.829> clutch<00:01:40.100> is<00:01:40.310> disengaged<00:01:40.850> automatically<00:01:41.570> I

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
the clutch is disengaged automatically I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.190 
the clutch is disengaged automatically I
down<00:01:42.350> shifted<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.890> second<00:01:43.280> gear<00:01:43.539> do<00:01:44.539> it<00:01:44.659> again

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
down shifted to second gear do it again

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.099 
down shifted to second gear do it again
now<00:01:46.039> I'm<00:01:46.189> in<00:01:46.310> first<00:01:46.549> if<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:47.719> give<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.079> little

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
now I'm in first if you give it a little

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.289 
now I'm in first if you give it a little
gas<00:01:48.439> as<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.890> do<00:01:49.069> that<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.700> clutch<00:01:50.000> will<00:01:50.179> do

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
gas as you do that the clutch will do

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.389 
gas as you do that the clutch will do
the<00:01:50.450> engine<00:01:50.750> braking<00:01:51.020> for<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:52.189> otherwise

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
if you want you could just downshift as

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.440 
if you want you could just downshift as
it<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.069> I'm<00:01:55.429> bringing<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.819> legs<00:01:56.030> down<00:01:56.179> here

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
techniques you're going to use there we

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.000 
techniques you're going to use there we
go<00:02:09.649> or<00:02:09.799> up<00:02:09.890> shift<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.250> again<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.590> remember<00:02:12.890> all

the<00:02:13.130> downshift<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.730> I've<00:02:13.819> been<00:02:13.940> doing

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
the downshift and I've been doing

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.910 
the downshift and I've been doing
manually<00:02:14.599> it<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:15.170> works<00:02:15.380> better<00:02:15.560> than<00:02:15.769> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
manually it just works better than the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.819 
manually it just works better than the
electric<00:02:16.250> shift<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:18.049> start<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.440> slow<00:02:18.650> down

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829
