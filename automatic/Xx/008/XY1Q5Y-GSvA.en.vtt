00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
consider is right now I believe the code

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.399 
consider is right now I believe the code
only<00:01:26.010> works<00:01:26.550> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> USA<00:01:27.510> I<00:01:27.720> think<00:01:28.230> they<00:01:28.350> were

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
only works in the USA I think they were

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.010 
only works in the USA I think they were
working<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.979> making<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.430> work<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.790> Canada<00:01:30.360> but

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
working on making it work in Canada but

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.640 
working on making it work in Canada but
if<00:01:31.350> you're<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> USA<00:01:32.600> I<00:01:33.600> mean<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> guess

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
if you're not in the USA I mean I guess

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.630 
if you're not in the USA I mean I guess
you<00:01:34.830> can<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> video<00:01:37.860> response<00:01:38.190> and
