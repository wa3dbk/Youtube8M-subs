00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
his face paint looks really good but uh

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.789 
his face paint looks really good but uh
his<00:01:21.270> eyes<00:01:21.540> are<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:21.900> off<00:01:22.170> centered<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
his eyes are a little off centered I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.760 
his eyes are a little off centered I
think<00:01:23.310> his<00:01:23.369> eyes<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:24.000> off<00:01:24.960> centered<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> I
