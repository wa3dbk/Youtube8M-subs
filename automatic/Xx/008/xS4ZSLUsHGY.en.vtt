00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.330
 the 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.320
 which 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.519
 It will not work like that 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.599
 for the latter, the viewer could test my name is Martin Kohler 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.719
 Photographers today I want to create a very special said a spokesman 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.189
 namely two world wars 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.790
 Siegmar once the 70 millimeters 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.539
 2 8 Mark lens 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.929
 and then again that only five millimeters Marc objectively 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.109
 I still have it 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.640
 Kurzmann take the hand 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.349
 that would be the two pieces of jewelry 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.609
 both lenses carry the addition Marko and that shows what both of them are 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.640
 objective particularly suitable 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.150
 "Marco Polo" Count that would always be if the scored scale of 1 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.030
 to 1 is needed for of course also including but so far go the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.110
 subjective like that 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.090
 Those who lose so big can picture those objective ones and that is 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.000
 Of course, it always ends when it comes to animals, small animals when it comes to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.890
 small plants or flowers parts goes 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.210
 UN overall very small items or very small motifs but you go 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.379
 Do not forget in the reboot photography 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.759
 ULZ photos are photographed or works of art are suitable 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.829
 very sharp objective excellent 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.829
 especially the distortion Spa plays a crucial role 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.920
 Of course, there is also a personal one besides these fields of application 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 Tip from me 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.850
 and that would be the use within portrait photography 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.330
 With such illustration states objective can be very beautiful and very clear 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.460
 Make portraits 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.070
 and when we're at the portrait, the circle closes 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.480
 Macro lens again 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.910
 This macro mode can be used very interesting 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.940
 within the details of a person who is making it out as, for example 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.930
 Mouth or eye areas 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.579
 however, from the age of 6, it is also a very good skin 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.619
 and also an equally great Mac 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.700
 because these are the obfuscators that must be the smallest Marcel Obama 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.490
 click on the photo 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.789
 another little tip to operate Hickmann an objectively right 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.790
 in a world the world has a focus in the majority of that is 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.900
 You can tell the objectively beforehand in which area the approximately 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.719
 photographed 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.090
 Unmatched as a much faster focusing the objective knows before 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.970
 about where the staggering will take place 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.440
 at 105 proves to be just in the hands there is also one more 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.360
 developed Focus de that means I can hide the focus here are out 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.209
 click 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.449
 and thus not the title when focusing with 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.859
 The extraordinary sharpness of both lenses can be those of you 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.659
 who are familiar with it from the respective MTF fact read the two 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.889
 are now displayed just look at it and here very clearly both 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.039
 Companies are crazy hot 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.539
 If you ask yourself which objective is the right one for you then you have 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:41.059
 with the 70 millimeter objectively a two-time winner namely Tibor and 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.850
 Either 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.410
 when that both statements has become this term 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.070
 and at 105 he had somewhat more comfort a little bit more flexibility what the 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.879
 Focal length affects 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.549
 Both lenses are from the DTAG Cry Sigma that it is the full frame 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.359
 Suitability so you can use both lenses no matter what sensory 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.430
 Northeimer is installed no matter whether ATSC or full format and again you can see 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.569
 otherwise there are these lenses for all standard camera car would have 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.109
 In terms of quality, both heritage comes from the particularly high-quality the X-series 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.329
 from Siegmar 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.629
 who is now spoiled for choice, nothing remains to say except 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.549
 to wish a nice day and 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.749
 the fish pass criminals 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.069
