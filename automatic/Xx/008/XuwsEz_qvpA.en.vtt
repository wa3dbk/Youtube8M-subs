have their speeds upgrade to 42 megabits

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.100 
have their speeds upgrade to 42 megabits
down<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:09.090> about<00:01:09.360> two-thirds<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.990> their

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
down to about two-thirds of their

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.570 
down to about two-thirds of their
subscriber<00:01:10.500> base<00:01:10.680> which<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:11.100> 140

subscriber base which is about 140
million<00:01:11.790> subscribers<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.049> pretty

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
million subscribers so that's pretty

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.810 
million subscribers so that's pretty
much<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.770> good<00:01:13.920> chunk<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.189> us<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:14.520> and

much a good chunk of us right here and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.690 
much a good chunk of us right here and
this<00:01:15.060> year<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.420> 2011<00:01:15.990> t-mobile<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.500> 25<00:01:17.250> 4g

lineup they didn't say too much about
what<00:01:20.460> devices<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.140> them

that's<00:02:33.570> pretty<00:02:33.720> much<00:02:33.870> different<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.260> most

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
that's pretty much different to most

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.630 
that's pretty much different to most

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
press event they mainly talked about

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.730 
press event they mainly talked about
their<00:02:35.760> hspa+<00:02:36.330> network<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.050> their<00:02:37.170> actual<00:02:37.560> you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
their hspa+ network and their actual you

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.050 
their hspa+ network and their actual you
know<00:02:37.830> network<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.490> stuff<00:02:38.640> like<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.850> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
know network and stuff like that and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.630 
know network and stuff like that and
their<00:02:39.390> goals<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.840> 2011<00:02:40.440> not<00:02:41.250> too<00:02:41.370> much<00:02:41.460> about

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
their goals in 2011 not too much about

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.460 
their goals in 2011 not too much about
the<00:02:41.760> actual<00:02:41.910> products<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:42.960> they<00:02:43.020> did<00:02:43.260> said<00:02:43.440> I

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
the actual products but they did said I

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.410 
the actual products but they did said I
have<00:02:43.590> 25<00:02:44.070> 4g<00:02:44.610> devices<00:02:44.700> coming<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.360> year

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
have 25 4g devices coming in this year

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.940 
have 25 4g devices coming in this year
so<00:02:45.690> that's<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.900> pretty<00:02:46.260> good<00:02:46.440> lineup<00:02:46.710> right

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
so that's a pretty good lineup right

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.930
