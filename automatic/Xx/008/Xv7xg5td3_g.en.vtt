00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.140 
guess you could say it's a very heavy
motorcycle<00:04:16.160> similar<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.639> thrust<00:04:16.940> in

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
motorcycle similar to the thrust in

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.550 
motorcycle similar to the thrust in
terms<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.539> looks<00:04:17.750> i<00:04:17.840> guess<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.079> could<00:04:18.229> say<00:04:18.380> a

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
terms of looks i guess you could say a

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.259 
terms of looks i guess you could say a
pause<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.220> front<00:04:19.489> end<00:04:19.669> looking<00:04:19.849> very<00:04:20.060> bulky

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
pause the front end looking very bulky

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.360 
pause the front end looking very bulky
there<00:04:20.539> as<00:04:20.659> well<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.109> i<00:04:21.169> guess<00:04:21.890> it's<00:04:22.070> up<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.190> you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
there as well and i guess it's up to you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.830 
there as well and i guess it's up to you
guys<00:04:22.430> if<00:04:22.669> you<00:04:22.729> want<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:22.909> pay<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:23.030> kind<00:04:23.599> of<00:04:23.719> a

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
guys if you want to pay that kind of a

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.470

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
heavy price

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.030 
heavy price
like<00:04:24.600> on<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.410> guess<00:04:25.650> we<00:04:25.740> will<00:04:25.860> have<00:04:25.920> to

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
like on it and I guess we will have to

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.500 
like on it and I guess we will have to
wait<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.340> see<00:04:26.370> how<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.670> see<00:04:26.940> how<00:04:27.090> fast<00:04:27.360> that

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
wait and see how to see how fast that

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.870 
wait and see how to see how fast that
this<00:04:27.690> truly<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.220> compared<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.700> other

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
this truly is compared to the other

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.450 
this truly is compared to the other
motorcycles<00:04:30.600> in<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:31.290> game<00:04:31.500> next<00:04:32.190> up<00:04:32.340> we<00:04:32.430> have

pricing at 2.2 million dollars and we

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.870 
pricing at 2.2 million dollars and we
will<00:04:46.080> truly<00:04:46.260> see<00:04:46.620> if<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.040> cost<00:04:47.280> is<00:04:47.430> worthy

will truly see if that cost is worthy

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.490 
will truly see if that cost is worthy
when<00:04:48.540> we<00:04:48.600> actually<00:04:48.720> take<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.080> up<00:04:49.170> against<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
today in this stream once again I'm

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.130 
today in this stream once again I'm
gonna<00:04:53.850> be<00:04:53.970> swimming<00:04:54.120> later<00:04:54.390> today<00:04:54.570> I'll

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.650 
gonna be swimming later today I'll
comparing<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.950> those<00:04:56.250> vehicles<00:04:56.640> now<00:04:57.030> after

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
comparing it to those vehicles now after

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.030 
comparing it to those vehicles now after
driving<00:04:57.870> around<00:04:58.230> for<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.470> bit<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.680> did<00:04:58.740> feel

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
driving around for a bit it did feel

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.860 
driving around for a bit it did feel
very<00:04:59.280> fast<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.730> very<00:04:59.790> I<00:05:00.060> can<00:05:00.420> handle<00:05:00.690> very

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
very fast and very I can handle very

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.750 
very fast and very I can handle very
well<00:05:00.900> as<00:05:01.140> well<00:05:01.350> so<00:05:01.650> in<00:05:02.070> my<00:05:02.250> opinion<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.700> do

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
well as well so in my opinion I do

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.070 
well as well so in my opinion I do
personally<00:05:03.090> think<00:05:03.510> this<00:05:03.660> would<00:05:03.900> be<00:05:03.990> the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
personally think this would be the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.870 
personally think this would be the
fastest<00:05:04.410> vehicle<00:05:04.590> but<00:05:04.920> once<00:05:05.070> again<00:05:05.220> we<00:05:05.730> will

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
fastest vehicle but once again we will

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.310 
fastest vehicle but once again we will
truly<00:05:06.120> be<00:05:06.240> putting<00:05:06.450> that<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.690> test<00:05:06.780> later

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
truly be putting that to the test later

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.650 
truly be putting that to the test later
