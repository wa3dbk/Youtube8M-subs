00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
yeah today i'm showing you guys how to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.320 
yeah today i'm showing you guys how to
farm<00:00:18.529> melons<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.949> best<00:00:20.580> way<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:20.970> my<00:00:21.090> opinion

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
farm melons the best way in my opinion

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.710 
farm melons the best way in my opinion
so<00:00:22.140> if<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:22.949> example<00:00:22.980> plant<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.029> melon<00:00:24.510> seed

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
so if you for example plant a melon seed

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.380 
so if you for example plant a melon seed
in<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.050> middle<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.410> four<00:00:25.650> blocks<00:00:26.090> yeah<00:00:27.090> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
in the middle of four blocks yeah that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.500 
in the middle of four blocks yeah that
cow<00:00:27.689> pissed<00:00:28.170> me<00:00:28.470> off<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.090> plant<00:00:30.390> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
cow pissed me off but if you plant a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.749 
cow pissed me off but if you plant a
seed<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> moolah<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.170> blacks<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.279> melon

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
seed in the moolah for blacks the melon

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.920 
seed in the moolah for blacks the melon
will<00:00:33.210> grow<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:34.829> four<00:00:35.130> blacks<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.690> site

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
will grow on the four blacks on the site

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.310 
will grow on the four blacks on the site
and<00:00:37.610> but<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:40.170> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
some examples right now so yeah here we

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.469 
some examples right now so yeah here we
go<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.710> got<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.220> farm<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.970> my<00:01:15.119> friend

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
go so here we got a farm for my friend

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
go so here we got a farm for my friend
it's<00:01:15.900> called<00:01:16.110> inside<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:18.020> he<00:01:19.020> made<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.460> little

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it's called inside and he made a little

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.490 
it's called inside and he made a little
bit<00:01:20.580> different<00:01:20.939> melon<00:01:21.270> farm<00:01:21.479> he<00:01:21.630> put<00:01:21.840> seeds<00:01:22.290> on

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
bit different melon farm he put seeds on

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.359 
bit different melon farm he put seeds on
both<00:01:22.710> sides<00:01:23.420> but<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.689> still<00:01:24.990> works<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.680> that's

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
both sides but it still works so that's

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.940 
both sides but it still works so that's
another<00:01:26.880> way<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.409> now<00:01:28.710> let's

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
another way you can do it but now let's

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.480 
another way you can do it but now let's
go<00:01:29.250> over<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:31.040> my<00:01:32.040> own<00:01:32.189> farms<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
go over to my own farms and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.870 
go over to my own farms and
I'll<00:01:33.579> fast-forward<00:01:34.329> that<00:01:34.960> real<00:01:35.500> quick<00:01:35.880> okay

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
I'll fast-forward that real quick okay

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.139 
I'll fast-forward that real quick okay
let's<00:01:37.180> run<00:01:39.450> yeah<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.479> built<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.290> huge<00:01:42.149> would

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
let's run yeah I built that huge would

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.870 
let's run yeah I built that huge would
lock<00:01:43.990> thingy<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:45.700> made<00:01:45.880> a<00:01:45.909> little<00:01:46.270> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
lock thingy and I made a little and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.039 
lock thingy and I made a little and
combinational<00:01:48.880> lock<00:01:49.060> door<00:01:49.299> but<00:01:49.600> in<00:01:49.869> ways

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
combinational lock door but in ways

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.800 
combinational lock door but in ways
there<00:01:50.110> is<00:01:51.070> my<00:01:51.280> form<00:01:51.640> it's<00:01:51.909> on<00:01:52.060> my<00:01:52.270> staircase<00:01:52.539> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
there is my form it's on my staircase I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.100 
there is my form it's on my staircase I
know<00:01:53.259> why<00:01:53.470> but<00:01:53.740> then<00:01:53.920> yeah<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.869> works

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
know why but then yeah and it works

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.190 
know why but then yeah and it works
great<00:01:56.259> it's<00:01:56.770> just<00:01:57.310> like<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:57.820> said<00:01:58.689> before<00:01:58.840> it's

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
great it's just like I said before it's

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.310 
great it's just like I said before it's
a<00:01:59.439> personal<00:02:00.340> tactic<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.119> think<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.600> works

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
a personal tactic and I think it works

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.370 
a personal tactic and I think it works
the<00:02:02.530> best<00:02:02.649> way<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:04.020> yeah<00:02:05.020> that's<00:02:05.229> basically

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the best way and yeah that's basically

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.639 
the best way and yeah that's basically
about<00:02:05.799> that<00:02:06.250> video<00:02:06.490> guys<00:02:06.970> I'll<00:02:07.899> hopefully
