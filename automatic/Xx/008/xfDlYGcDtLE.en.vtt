back to back and trying to figure out

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.670 
back to back and trying to figure out
what<00:00:14.820> really<00:00:15.330> works<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.839> me<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:15.990> mean<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> like

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
it but then I don't end up liking the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.870 
it but then I don't end up liking the
end<00:00:19.109> result<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:20.039> how<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.369> looks<00:00:20.490> with<00:00:20.670> all

end result I like how it looks with all

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.359 
end result I like how it looks with all
the<00:00:21.029> products<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.680> feel<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.100> it

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the products on it but I feel like it

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.720 
the products on it but I feel like it
dries<00:00:23.580> ugly<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:24.420> whatever<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.580> I've<00:00:26.580> been

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
dries ugly or whatever so I've been

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.279 
dries ugly or whatever so I've been
experimenting<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.599> couple<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:27.990> different

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
experimenting with a couple of different

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
experimenting with a couple of different
techniques<00:00:28.650> over<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.160> past<00:00:29.340> couple<00:00:29.550> days<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
techniques over the past couple days and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.930 
techniques over the past couple days and
I<00:00:30.510> think<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.590> I've<00:00:31.740> actually<00:00:32.070> got<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> down

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
I think that I've actually got it down

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.459 
I think that I've actually got it down
to<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.149> science<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.170> share<00:00:34.320> with

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
to a science so I'm going to share with

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.060

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and go into a second third fourth

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
and go into a second third fourth
