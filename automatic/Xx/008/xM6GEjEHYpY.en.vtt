00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.420
 you have to pass kids and we're good 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.209
 here in a video that the truth had 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.619
 more or less prepares and I for today and 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.919
 I wanted to explain a couple of things because 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:17.240
 you ask me how you get so much 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:19.619
 nuclear as they carry the arms I do not know what 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.509
 but what more really the truth 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 they ask me how I have so many chains 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.539
 of low both works double mega doubles 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.539
 low etcetera 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.900
 but in this way that you are seeing without 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.570
 rest there you are seeing chain of 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.610
 low on the first one I take the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.260
 truth and just kill me I wanted to get out 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.930
 another and I say good since we are then 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.610
 come and here I want to teach you a 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.350
 small as one a click of the kill 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.720
 simply the spam king that exists 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.970
 curse as you already know fixed me 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.170
 I usually take out the ultra low chain 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.059
 low 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.309
 go see now one with the shotgun 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.829
 but let's get the soles here if not 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.759
 like or clearly a bit of logic 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.399
 please and nothing is that they are bosc is not 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.799
 that is a bank is not that they are your friend 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.240
 none of those things just me 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.759
 I put a group we play measuring and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.259
 Usually these things come out as you are 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.720
 watching now I will see from another 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.850
 perspective the safest thing in which you 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.159
 see perfectly how the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.630
 Burn responsive he answers table with 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.970
 the meat is there 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.250
 just on the left side plugs and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:35.050
 you kill yourself I saw and I shot 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:40.790
 just one and that I think it cost 23 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:43.220
 4 you have seen that your hands were 67 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.120
 8 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.050
 9 10 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.060
 12 cetera etc and there jumps the this was my 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.680
 first low chain 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.730
 the truth that I was very happy to get out 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.420
 the and I already have like 887 out there I think that 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.030
 the 78 a spectacular streak with the cope 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:11.300
 it is without failure of saleh metal if it is that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:15.800
 strip and iron on the floor 415 67 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.230
 oh no no no it was 78 and there because 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.810
 this was not to get me the ultra low 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.430
 that the ultra low is very very dodgy and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.180
 killed the turkey c4 true that with me 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.040
 you take nonsense 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.240
 and there you are watching google work that 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.970
 it was the first one that I took out is like 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.920
 you are seeing the first and the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.660
 I pulled out richly and now I want to explain 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.220
 the respawn areas where you have to leave 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.750
 the tactical infections are going this 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.240
 group solution as you see I have left 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.620
 tactical distinction and I lie down here and 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.510
 I know that they are covering me as you see the 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.400
 green arrows on the right there are two 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.320
 allies one now comes to cover me to the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.110
 left and another one is going to be put inside 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.340
 where am I and how are you seeing damage 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.280
 machine guns because I 'm busted 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.220
 as you know it is 35 for missing 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.530
 in a good way you know and are watching the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.100
 bloodthirsty as it flows and will live there 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.420
 kill google works and good in this what 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.250
 What I want to tell you is that he took me out 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.610
 same departure low chain lower me 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.730
 ultra low super low turbo 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.460
 2 mega low I think it was 6 low turbo or 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.860
 so crazy now now I 'm going to see 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.630
 I'll probably go so you can see 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.030
 which is in the same game that I do not lie 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.530
 is watching through the air I take this out 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.630
 it's a low chain even if it does not look 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.430
 you can count it perfectly 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.170
 the little names on the left if you do not 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.450
 you believe it as you are seeing, they give me 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.460
 places aha and now I get streak 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.680
 ruthless that with only me the 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.750
 I found and I continue to continue to kill 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.160
 it is not true killing 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.450
 there jumps me ruthless righteous and 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.210
 finish where there is no give me the sheet 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.610
 but good that the pay time is the ultra 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.920
 low and how are you and what you wanted 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.200
 teach that it's not like I got it out 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.540
 as if it does not cost to position yourself in much 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.670
 for how are you seeing planting me 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.560
 kill more than a couple of them kill me 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.330
 so for you to see that it is not easy 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.400
 get an ultra low and a string of 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.430
 low followed and here I am seeing 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.740
 there the low chains follow and is 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.480
 there so you can see what it is that is not 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:11.460
 always easier and yes we attack you 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.960
 well because they are the banks we are going to 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.210
 see me kill my mother has already seen it 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.400
 fist this one mega low followed by a 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.709
 ultra low but the ultra low is also not 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.150
 see why the game was over but from 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.520
 I say so because I can count 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.190
 perfectly and put me to comments is 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.380
 lie what I say we go why 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.090
 is that I saw the badge is a mega low 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.920
 now a streak of seven followed 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.600
 although it seems that I do not think that 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.930
 killed five but do not look now you're going to 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.360
 see how the cover will come out 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:50.719
 crumbs there are one two three 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:52.939
 4 5 6 7 and 8 how is living 81 what 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:55.969
 environmental than how the game ends 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.740
 for not the round I do not get out and here you 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.090
 I leave with a clio bonus I hope that you 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.860
 have liked the video of the work and 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.169
 little chain and twist or how I 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.169
 I sack myself and good until the next video
