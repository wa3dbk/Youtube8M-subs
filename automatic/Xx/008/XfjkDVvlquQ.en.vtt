00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this early on in the game and the third

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.939 
this early on in the game and the third
thing<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.710> really

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
thing is that it was actually really

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
thing is that it was actually really
support<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.520> his<00:00:59.609> friend<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.210> game<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
support for his friend in this game so

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.849 
support for his friend in this game so
he<00:01:00.750> wasn't<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.170> actually<00:01:01.469> meant<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> be

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
he wasn't the one actually meant to be

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.470 
he wasn't the one actually meant to be
getting<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> insane<00:01:02.520> gameplay<00:01:03.000> most<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
getting the insane gameplay most the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.469 
getting the insane gameplay most the
kills<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.439> absolutely<00:01:05.010> crazy

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
kills which is just absolutely crazy

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.580 
kills which is just absolutely crazy
like<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.600> said<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.900> don't<00:01:07.020> normally<00:01:07.200> look<00:01:07.560> like

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
like we said we don't normally look like

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
like we said we don't normally look like
things<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> me<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:08.880> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
things like this to me but I think this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.210 
things like this to me but I think this
was<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> very<00:01:09.630> very<00:01:09.960> nice<00:01:10.200> exception<00:01:11.040> just

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
was a very very nice exception just

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
was a very very nice exception just
because<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.970> incredibly<00:01:12.630> lucky<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
because it was so incredibly lucky and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.990 
because it was so incredibly lucky and
so<00:01:13.290> ridiculously<00:01:14.070> random<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
so ridiculously random you know you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.340 
so ridiculously random you know you
never<00:01:15.210> expect<00:01:15.689> something<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
never expect something like this to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.749 
never expect something like this to
happen<00:01:16.530> especially<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.220> you're<00:01:17.369> only<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
happen especially when you're only in a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.219 
happen especially when you're only in a
three-man<00:01:18.090> part<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.540> normally<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.049> get

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
three-man part you know normally to get

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.170 
three-man part you know normally to get
fast<00:01:19.710> chemistry<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.610> we're<00:01:21.150> just

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
fast chemistry it's like this we're just
