discovered that the Manik invasion the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.589 
discovered that the Manik invasion the
minions<00:00:08.490> from<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.760> don't<00:00:09.030> have<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.240> timer<00:00:09.480> on

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
minions from that don't have a timer on

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.900 
minions from that don't have a timer on
them<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.080> they<00:00:10.830> will<00:00:11.010> usually<00:00:11.280> push<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.730> lane

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
them and they will usually push a lane

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.910 
them and they will usually push a lane
when<00:00:12.540> you're<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> mines<00:00:13.110> there<00:00:13.620> are<00:00:13.740> no

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
when you're in the mines there are no

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.240 
when you're in the mines there are no
lanes<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.969> me<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.809> mez<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.740> both<00:00:17.100> playing

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
lanes so me and mez are both playing

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.480 
lanes so me and mez are both playing

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.220 
Abaddon yes hello miss we're both esmad
and<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.820> am<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> mines<00:00:21.449> already<00:00:21.810> level<00:00:22.080> 10

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and I am in the mines already level 10

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.050 
and I am in the mines already level 10
he<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:22.800> getting<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.100> level<00:00:23.189> 10<00:00:23.490> now<00:00:23.730> we

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
he is just getting to level 10 now we

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.370 
he is just getting to level 10 now we
haven't<00:00:24.300> really<00:00:24.510> pushed<00:00:24.689> our<00:00:24.840> waves<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:25.230> so

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
haven't really pushed our waves up so

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.990 
haven't really pushed our waves up so
hopefully<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> game<00:00:25.949> won't<00:00:26.130> end<00:00:26.400> while<00:00:26.880> we're

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
hopefully the game won't end while we're

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.759 
hopefully the game won't end while we're
doing<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.390> we're<00:00:28.050> gonna<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.439> if<00:00:28.529> there's<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
doing this we're gonna see if there's a

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.580 
doing this we're gonna see if there's a
maximum<00:00:29.340> number<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.750> amount<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.320> minions

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
maximum number on the amount of minions

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.860 
maximum number on the amount of minions
you<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.189> spawn<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.690> gonna<00:00:33.780> be

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
you can spawn so this is gonna be

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.299 
you can spawn so this is gonna be
heavily<00:00:34.170> edited<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> hundred

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
heavily edited because it's a hundred

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.119 
heavily edited because it's a hundred
second<00:00:35.700> cooldown<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> we're<00:00:38.100> just

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
second cooldown on this so we're just

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.290 
second cooldown on this so we're just
going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> keep<00:00:38.489> swallowing<00:00:38.760> them<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.120> once

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
going to keep swallowing them and once

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.819 
going to keep swallowing them and once
we<00:00:39.450> hit<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> maximum<00:00:39.780> number<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.649> any

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
we hit a maximum number if there is any

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.200 
we hit a maximum number if there is any
or<00:00:41.040> they<00:00:41.190> start<00:00:41.370> disappearing<00:00:41.760> give<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
or they start disappearing give to a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.440 
or they start disappearing give to a
timeout<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.800> guess<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.430> go<00:00:45.120> into<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
timeout then I guess we go into the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.090 
timeout then I guess we go into the
mines<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> other<00:00:46.110> person's<00:00:46.469> side<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.980> see

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
mines on the other person's side and see

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.529 
mines on the other person's side and see
how<00:00:47.160> long<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.520> survive<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.420> you

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
how long we can survive all right you

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.630 
how long we can survive all right you
ready<00:00:48.629> somehow<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> feel<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.460> going

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
ready somehow I feel this is just going

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.720 
ready somehow I feel this is just going
to<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.270> game<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.899> let's<00:00:52.680> play<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.309> saw<00:00:53.460> some

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to be a game of let's play and saw some

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880 
to be a game of let's play and saw some
wags<00:00:54.120> outs<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:55.079> might<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:55.649> hoping

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
wags outs this might be I'm hoping

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.290 
wags outs this might be I'm hoping
that's<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> case<00:00:56.340> I'm<00:00:56.640> hoping<00:00:56.910> there's<00:00:57.090> no

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that's the case I'm hoping there's no

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.020 
that's the case I'm hoping there's no
limit<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.739> will<00:00:59.070> actually<00:00:59.250> happen

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
limit and that will actually happen

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.840 
limit and that will actually happen
