00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello guys welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.629
 video review by license 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.300
 iphoneitalia.com today I talk about oki un 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.719
 new tweak for the quick with paul su 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.719
 iphone 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.000
 hello guys well found like you 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.100
 I said today I talk to you about eyes that in 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.939
 actually that's not what you take when 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.160
 you have pain but it is or who in the sense aoki 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.739
 name this here and it's a tweak that 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.050
 allows you to quickly dial a 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.660
 message this way exactly 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.090
 as you have seen then just scroll 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.460
 call up the notification center in this 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.949
 way and then scroll like that until 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.190
 this screen is not revealed with 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.260
 this graphic effect is precisely of 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.150
 very very nice transition here 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.070
 we can enter the person's name 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.839
 that we want to achieve 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.089
 in this case I put it as usual 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.760
 my name may possibly 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.100
 add an image by choosing 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.979
 the last photo if you take a picture in 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.710
 this moment or if chosen in short by the 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.780
 library we do just that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.690
 let's take this stupid overview 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.530
 and pressing on clearly sends the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.000
 message is sent on the fly 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.410
 obviously if you send an image there 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.810
 will take a little more as we have seen 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.150
 you are sent a test only message there 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.920
 I will wait less now than the same 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.370
 message get me because so you 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.980
 I show the second function of 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.590
 few that is the quick reply then the 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.510
 quick response as you just see 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.430
 a notification arrived we have here the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.700
 reply button that allows us to 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.350
 quickly respond to the message 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.570
 always using this quick 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.640
 clear interface which consists 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.590
 be used on any screen 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.680
 as well as the quick answer you see 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.450
 now we are on safari and always in 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.060
 This way we can send ours 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.180
 imessage or message clearly if the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.110
 button and green as in the application 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.720
 send message button 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.980
 you will send a sms then to payment if 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.540
 the button will be blue instead you will send a 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.430
 message via imessage that will be 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.319
 therefore it can be sent for free either 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.290
 from iphone and ipod touch and ipad 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.519
 using the free service 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.349
 of apple 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.049
 another very interesting function of 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.520
 there are few silent modes we are 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.470
 already seeing this first 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.380
 conversation I don't know if you notice the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.640
 difference but this conversation 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.800
 compared to 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.950
 it is a little clearer in terms of graphics 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.680
 because it's a conversation we had 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.420
 set to silent practically 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.770
 doing so by scrolling towards 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.380
 right and activating the mode 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.050
 silent and as if activated 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.820
 function not to disturb just for that 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.680
 specific conversation then 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.990
 in short, we will activate the mode 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.390
 silent that will cause messages 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.840
 still arrive on our iphone but 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.030
 without having vibration alerts e 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.190
 notifications of any kind then the whole 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.630
 as if the non mode was active 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.670
 only to disturb the contact 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.650
 when you activate silent mode 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.110
 stealth mode is also activated 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.690
 so defined by the developer why 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.940
 when active it will practically deactivate 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.340
 then the writing indicator 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.720
 circle those dots that flow in 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.950
 low when we are writing a 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.590
 message is let's say the reading of 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.209
 messages therefore the fact that you see 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.850
 when we read a message it comes 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.010
 written here read or just as in 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.720
 this case delivered only without 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.060
 indication of readings as you can 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.769
 note also the icons of the 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.260
 contacts in the messages app 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.450
 clearly in this case I do not have 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.640
 icons because it is a test device and then 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.130
 because I honestly had some 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.440
 problem having many contacts on mine 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.049
 dream device in general about icloud 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.720
 it is actually to be said that or who 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.519
 it slows down a little when I went to 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.880
 load all the contract list ad 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.970
 example by pressing it then has looking for a 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.430
 new contact by pressing a I locked 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.320
 entirely with the hundreds of 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.560
 contacts I have now with eight 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.780
 in short, contracts are fine, but without them 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.940
 doubts something to watch out for 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.150
 especially if you have a device 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.500
 already a little dated with an a5 processor 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.539
 even previous be careful 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.070
 in short, if you have many contacts or who 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.710
 could be a little slow in the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.350
 upload them or who can be activated also in 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.430
 landscape mode you see has a graphic 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.020
 however optimized it supports chats of 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.250
 group so you can chat with 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.930
 more people in the same trip we say e 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.419
 supports sending video images 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.030
 and of animated gifts as I already had it 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.190
 announced well guys so this is it 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.350
 or who you can buy the price of 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.490
 $ 399 from the bigboss repository 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.199
 in cydia $ 399 is tantini force 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.300
 and for the features it offers this 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.400
 tweak that in the end is a simple one 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.130
 compound but let's say pay the 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.169
 really good technical realization if 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.360
 were it not precisely for which slowdowns 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.380
 of which I have spoken to you when we add 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.389
 a contact 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.979
 so if you are interested in fact 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.599
 you know where to buy it and how 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.520
 buy it in the video let me know 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.830
 via comments as usual 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.110
 what do you think about oki if you like it 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.130
 this tweak and we'll get back to the 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.720
 next video 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.590
