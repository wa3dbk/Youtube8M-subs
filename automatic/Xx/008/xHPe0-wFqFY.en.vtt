around it's actually a shortcut that
doesn't<00:02:34.560> require<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.370> mushroom<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.270> it's<00:02:36.360> a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
doesn't require a mushroom and it's a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.030 
doesn't require a mushroom and it's a
really<00:02:36.540> short<00:02:36.840> short<00:02:37.140> cut<00:02:37.350> it's<00:02:37.560> where<00:02:37.920> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
really short short cut it's where you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.040 
really short short cut it's where you
basically<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.550> jump<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> gap<00:02:39.300> kind<00:02:39.990> of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
basically just jump the gap kind of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.750 
basically just jump the gap kind of
early<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.350> it's<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.980> few<00:02:41.280> seconds<00:02:41.640> into

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
early on it's like a few seconds into

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.390 
early on it's like a few seconds into
the<00:02:41.910> race<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.930> get<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.230> shoot<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.860> gap<00:02:44.160> and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the race you get to shoot that gap and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.770 
the race you get to shoot that gap and
you<00:02:44.490> again<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.940> don't<00:02:45.060> even<00:02:45.210> need<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.420> mushroom

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780

time<00:02:50.190> trials<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.240> shoot<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.510> gap<00:02:51.810> with

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
time trials you can shoot the gap with

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.830 
time trials you can shoot the gap with
mushrooms<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.430> such<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.480> gap<00:02:54.660> at<00:02:54.810> the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
video but I used to love how you could

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.820 
video but I used to love how you could
jump<00:03:33.150> off<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.690> was<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.110> left<00:03:34.260> or<00:03:34.530> if<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.770> was

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
jump off it was to the left or if it was

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.440 
jump off it was to the left or if it was
mirror<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.340> was<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> right<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.240> could

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
mirror it was to the right you could

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.390 
mirror it was to the right you could
jump<00:03:36.720> off<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.230> first<00:03:37.560> part<00:03:37.770> of<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.920> level<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
jump off the first part of the level and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.760 
jump off the first part of the level and
basically<00:03:38.850> land<00:03:39.210> hon<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.840> could<00:03:40.200> forego<00:03:40.560> half

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770

you<00:03:42.930> did<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.170> correctly<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:44.040> other<00:03:44.160> part

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
you did it correctly on the other part

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.280 
you did it correctly on the other part
of<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.550> track<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.390> anyway<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.960> last

interested<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:51.990> getting<00:03:52.230> custom<00:03:52.650> tracks<00:03:52.920> for

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
interested in getting custom tracks for

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.780 
interested in getting custom tracks for
mkwii<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:55.020> know<00:03:55.770> I've<00:03:55.980> seen<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.280> few<00:03:56.400> videos

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
mkwii so I know I've seen a few videos

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.190 
mkwii so I know I've seen a few videos
and<00:03:57.210> such<00:03:57.390> where<00:03:57.570> people<00:03:57.840> did<00:03:58.020> their<00:03:58.050> own

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
and such where people did their own

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.930 
and such where people did their own
texture<00:03:58.770> hacks<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.190> guess<00:03:59.340> they<00:03:59.490> would<00:03:59.610> call<00:03:59.790> it

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
texture hacks I guess they would call it

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.030 
texture hacks I guess they would call it
but<00:04:00.450> make<00:04:00.810> their<00:04:01.020> own<00:04:01.050> kind<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.470> textures<00:04:01.860> and

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
but make their own kind of textures and

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.920 
but make their own kind of textures and
stuff<00:04:02.250> plays<00:04:02.640> off<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:02.970> other<00:04:03.330> courses<00:04:03.720> that

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
stuff plays off of other courses that

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.260 
stuff plays off of other courses that
exists<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.620> they<00:04:04.710> just<00:04:04.950> change<00:04:05.250> them<00:04:05.370> up<00:04:05.550> I'm

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
exists and they just change them up I'm

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.540 
exists and they just change them up I'm
not<00:04:06.540> really<00:04:06.720> into<00:04:07.500> tampering<00:04:08.040> with<00:04:08.070> my<00:04:08.310> game

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
not really into tampering with my game

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.610 
not really into tampering with my game
or<00:04:08.730> anything<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.330> will<00:04:09.720> say<00:04:09.990> however<00:04:10.170> that<00:04:10.440> I

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
or anything I will say however that I

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.230 
or anything I will say however that I
think<00:04:10.890> that<00:04:11.010> that's<00:04:11.100> really<00:04:11.340> cool<00:04:11.670> so<00:04:12.210> it's

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
think that that's really cool so it's

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.850 
think that that's really cool so it's
definitely<00:04:12.630> nothing<00:04:12.780> against<00:04:13.290> people<00:04:13.830> who

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
definitely nothing against people who

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.740 
definitely nothing against people who
you<00:04:14.280> know<00:04:14.310> make<00:04:14.610> their<00:04:14.790> own<00:04:14.820> textures<00:04:15.540> and

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
you know make their own textures and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.870 
you know make their own textures and
stuff<00:04:15.960> and<00:04:16.170> make<00:04:16.290> their<00:04:16.440> own<00:04:16.470> videos

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
stuff and make their own videos

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.280 
stuff and make their own videos
featuring<00:04:17.880> their<00:04:18.060> textures<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.750> whatnot<00:04:19.080> I

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
featuring their textures and whatnot I

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.599 
featuring their textures and whatnot I
think<00:04:19.710> that's<00:04:19.859> pretty<00:04:20.070> cool<00:04:20.220> because<00:04:20.400> that's

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
think that's pretty cool because that's

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.220 
think that's pretty cool because that's
a<00:04:20.700> way<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.000> they<00:04:21.150> can<00:04:21.210> take<00:04:21.450> mario<00:04:21.810> kart<00:04:22.080> wii

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
a way that they can take mario kart wii

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.950 
a way that they can take mario kart wii
and<00:04:22.500> further<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.520> game<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:24.090> maybe<00:04:24.419> make<00:04:24.720> some

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
and further the game and maybe make some

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.129 
and further the game and maybe make some
enjoyment<00:04:25.470> for

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
enjoyment for

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.959 
enjoyment for
those<00:04:26.319> people<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.919> I<00:04:27.460> don't<00:04:27.639> really<00:04:27.729> think

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:27.969 
those people and I don't really think

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.520 
those people and I don't really think
that<00:04:28.060> that's<00:04:28.150> hurting<00:04:28.629> anybody<00:04:28.960> whereas<00:04:29.379> my

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
that that's hurting anybody whereas my

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.290 
that that's hurting anybody whereas my
typical<00:04:29.949> stance<00:04:30.189> of<00:04:30.370> being<00:04:30.550> kind<00:04:30.729> of<00:04:30.879> anti

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
typical stance of being kind of anti

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.619 
typical stance of being kind of anti
hacker<00:04:31.599> is<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:33.460> actually<00:04:33.610> has<00:04:33.969> the<00:04:33.999> ability

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629 
hacker is that actually has the ability

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.499 
hacker is that actually has the ability
to<00:04:34.659> ruin<00:04:35.289> people's<00:04:35.740> gameplay<00:04:36.219> and<00:04:36.460> ruin<00:04:37.419> the

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
to ruin people's gameplay and ruin the

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.629 
to ruin people's gameplay and ruin the
fun<00:04:37.689> whereas<00:04:38.620> what<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.860> was<00:04:39.009> saying<00:04:39.249> is<00:04:39.430> that

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
fun whereas what I was saying is that

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.879 
fun whereas what I was saying is that
hacking<00:04:40.240> levels<00:04:40.810> or<00:04:41.110> basically<00:04:41.379> making<00:04:41.650> your

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
hacking levels or basically making your

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.249 
hacking levels or basically making your
own<00:04:41.919> textures<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.819> stuff<00:04:43.060> if<00:04:43.270> there<00:04:43.840> r<00:04:43.870> a

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
own textures and stuff if there r a

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.800 
own textures and stuff if there r a
Sibyl<00:04:44.620> basically<00:04:45.310> then<00:04:45.849> I<00:04:46.240> think<00:04:46.719> that

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
Sibyl basically then I think that

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.790 
Sibyl basically then I think that
they're<00:04:46.930> fine<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.139> I<00:04:47.439> think<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.710> that's

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
they're fine and I think that that's

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.129 
they're fine and I think that that's
great<00:04:48.099> it's<00:04:48.340> pretty<00:04:48.639> cool<00:04:48.789> but<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.270> myself<00:04:49.749> am

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
great it's pretty cool but I myself am

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.839 
great it's pretty cool but I myself am
not<00:04:50.409> really<00:04:50.710> interested<00:04:51.039> in<00:04:51.310> getting<00:04:51.639> any<00:04:51.759> I

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
not really interested in getting any I

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.179 
not really interested in getting any I
have<00:04:52.180> enough<00:04:52.449> fun<00:04:52.749> trying<00:04:53.469> to<00:04:53.620> master<00:04:54.039> the

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189 
have enough fun trying to master the

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.399 
have enough fun trying to master the
courses<00:04:54.610> which<00:04:54.789> I<00:04:54.939> have<00:04:55.270> not<00:04:55.419> done<00:04:55.719> by<00:04:56.229> any

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
courses which I have not done by any

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.679 
courses which I have not done by any
means<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:56.919> are<00:04:57.430> already<00:04:57.639> in<00:04:57.819> the<00:04:57.999> game<00:04:58.120> so

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689 
means that are already in the game so

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.149 
means that are already in the game so
hopefully<00:04:59.259> that<00:04:59.409> answers<00:04:59.710> both<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.009> odds
