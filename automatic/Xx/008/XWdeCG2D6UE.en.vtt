we're going to put a piece of paper on
here<00:02:57.670> paper<00:02:58.000> towel<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:59.079> gotta<00:02:59.290> remember

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
paper towel actually has a little bit of

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.170 
paper towel actually has a little bit of
weight<00:03:02.379> to<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.010> see<00:03:03.190> but<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.849> doesn't<00:03:04.030> look

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
weight to it you see but it doesn't look

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.119 
weight to it you see but it doesn't look
like<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.480> but<00:03:04.599> it<00:03:04.720> does<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:05.349> we're<00:03:05.410> going<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.650> 0

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
like it but it does but we're going to 0

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.640 
like it but it does but we're going to 0
here<00:03:06.519> just<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.910> be<00:03:06.940> safe<00:03:07.319> then<00:03:08.319> we'll<00:03:08.500> take<00:03:08.590> the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
here just to be safe then we'll take the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.080 
here just to be safe then we'll take the
can<00:03:08.889> of<00:03:09.010> tuna<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.400> we'll<00:03:09.670> put<00:03:09.849> it<00:03:09.940> on<00:03:10.060> here<00:03:10.329> and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
can of tuna and we'll put it on here and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.629 
can of tuna and we'll put it on here and
it's<00:03:14.940> 1480<00:03:15.940> grams<00:03:16.299> now<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:18.099> original

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
it's 1480 grams now so the original

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.240 
it's 1480 grams now so the original
weight<00:03:18.819> was<00:03:19.919> 1980<00:03:20.919> grams<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:22.120> now<00:03:22.299> it's<00:03:23.250> 1480

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
weight was 1980 grams and now it's 1480

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:32.099 
weight was 1980 grams and now it's 1480
so<00:03:25.349> 1980<00:03:26.349> minus<00:03:27.090> 1480<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.359> how<00:03:28.810> much<00:03:30.450> 500<00:03:31.450> grams

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
so 1980 minus 1480 is how much 500 grams

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.780 
so 1980 minus 1480 is how much 500 grams
that's<00:03:32.380> right<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:34.109> actually<00:03:35.109> one<00:03:36.010> pound<00:03:36.370> is

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
that's right so actually one pound is

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.319 
that's right so actually one pound is
454<00:03:39.790> grams<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:42.090> since<00:03:43.090> we<00:03:43.840> lost<00:03:44.079> 500<00:03:44.819> grams<00:03:45.819> of

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
454 grams so since we lost 500 grams of

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.580 
454 grams so since we lost 500 grams of
oil<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:47.410> means<00:03:47.709> there<00:03:48.579> was<00:03:48.700> over<00:03:49.419> a<00:03:49.599> pound<00:03:50.049> of

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
oil that means there was over a pound of

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.300 
oil that means there was over a pound of
oil<00:03:51.040> in<00:03:51.819> this<00:03:52.060> cat<00:03:52.329> that's<00:03:53.169> pretty<00:03:53.410> cool<00:03:53.560> all

oil in this cat that's pretty cool all

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.449 
oil in this cat that's pretty cool all
right<00:03:54.430> let's<00:03:54.669> make<00:03:54.849> it<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.269> let's<00:03:55.510> eat<00:03:55.780> it
