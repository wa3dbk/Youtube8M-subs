defensive offensive approach of slice

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.320 
defensive offensive approach of slice
we're<00:00:38.920> going<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.100> talk<00:00:39.220> about<00:00:39.250> two<00:00:39.730> main

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
we're going to talk about two main

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.700 
we're going to talk about two main
slices<00:00:40.780> that<00:00:40.960> I<00:00:41.019> want<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.230> talk<00:00:41.320> about<00:00:41.410> in<00:00:41.590> this

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
slices that I want to talk about in this

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.380 
slices that I want to talk about in this
one<00:00:41.890> so<00:00:42.220> you<00:00:42.280> have<00:00:42.400> a<00:00:42.460> different<00:00:42.879> contrast

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
one so you have a different contrast

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.600 
one so you have a different contrast
first<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.140> have<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.440> defensive<00:00:45.010> slice<00:00:45.220> where

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
first you have the defensive slice where

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.579 
first you have the defensive slice where
we<00:00:45.670> make<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.940> ball<00:00:46.120> float<00:00:46.570> that<00:00:47.019> you<00:00:47.170> use<00:00:47.379> to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
we make the ball float that you use to

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.110 
we make the ball float that you use to
slice<00:00:47.800> usually<00:00:48.160> when<00:00:48.280> you're<00:00:48.400> on<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.760> run<00:00:48.970> and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
slice usually when you're on the run and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.090 
slice usually when you're on the run and
you<00:00:49.150> want<00:00:49.360> to<00:00:49.449> buy<00:00:49.629> some<00:00:49.960> time<00:00:50.199> that's<00:00:50.739> great

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
you want to buy some time that's great

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.830 
you want to buy some time that's great
but<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.790> slice<00:00:52.000> I'm<00:00:52.210> talking<00:00:52.480> about<00:00:52.510> today<00:00:52.719> is

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
but the slice I'm talking about today is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.319 
but the slice I'm talking about today is
that<00:00:52.989> biting<00:00:53.530> knifing<00:00:54.370> slice<00:00:54.610> where<00:00:55.210> are<00:00:55.270> we

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
that biting knifing slice where are we

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.910 
that biting knifing slice where are we
going<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.539> use<00:00:55.690> this<00:00:55.840> this<00:00:56.200> is<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.440> great<00:00:56.680> way

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
going to use this this is a great way

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.680 
going to use this this is a great way
that<00:00:57.340> if<00:00:57.550> we're<00:00:57.730> in<00:00:57.789> a<00:00:57.850> topspin<00:00:58.390> backhand

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
that if we're in a topspin backhand

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.450 
that if we're in a topspin backhand
rally<00:00:59.110> whether<00:00:59.379> you're<00:00:59.500> two<00:00:59.770> hands<00:01:00.039> there<00:01:00.190> one

trying<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.330> get<00:01:31.450> under<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.960> ball<00:01:32.170> which<00:01:32.560> means

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
trying to get under the ball which means

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.899 
trying to get under the ball which means
they<00:01:32.890> can't<00:01:33.070> lift<00:01:33.250> it<00:01:33.400> you're<00:01:33.729> gonna<00:01:33.820> have

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
they can't lift it you're gonna have

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.640 
they can't lift it you're gonna have
more<00:01:34.210> opportunities<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.930> its<00:01:35.049> short<00:01:35.290> balls<00:01:35.470> in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
more opportunities to its short balls in

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.230 
more opportunities to its short balls in
the<00:01:35.770> middle<00:01:35.860> of<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.070> court<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.369> this<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.060> why

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
the middle of the court and this is why

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.690 
the middle of the court and this is why
you<00:01:37.689> need<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:37.930> learn<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.470> biting<00:01:38.799> nasty

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
you need to learn the biting nasty

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.520 
you need to learn the biting nasty
knifing<00:01:40.390> slice<00:01:40.720> okay

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
knifing slice okay

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.780 
knifing slice okay
might<00:01:41.740> be<00:01:41.860> exaggerating<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.369> little<00:01:42.400> bit<00:01:42.579> but

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
might be exaggerating a little bit but

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.090 
might be exaggerating a little bit but
let's<00:01:43.450> get<00:01:43.570> down<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.020> tactics<00:01:44.740> how<00:01:44.890> do<00:01:44.950> we

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
let's get down to the tactics how do we

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.249 
let's get down to the tactics how do we
do<00:01:45.250> this<00:01:45.400> so<00:01:46.090> we<00:01:46.270> first<00:01:46.450> have<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.689> change<00:01:46.810> our

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
do this so we first have to change our

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.080 
do this so we first have to change our
mindset<00:01:47.530> what<00:01:47.740> does<00:01:47.829> that<00:01:47.860> mean<00:01:48.159> well<00:01:48.640> first

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
mindset what does that mean well first

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.670 
mindset what does that mean well first
of<00:01:49.299> all<00:01:49.329> a<00:01:49.390> lot<00:01:49.630> of<00:01:49.689> people<00:01:49.810> think<00:01:50.229> when<00:01:50.590> you're

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
of all a lot of people think when you're

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.499 
of all a lot of people think when you're
hitting<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.920> slice<00:01:51.159> you've<00:01:51.579> got<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.759> hack<00:01:52.149> down

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
hitting a slice you've got a hack down

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.149 
hitting a slice you've got a hack down
it<00:01:52.689> they<00:01:52.780> think<00:01:52.840> lumberjack<00:01:53.500> I'm<00:01:53.619> chopping

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
it they think lumberjack I'm chopping

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.530 
it they think lumberjack I'm chopping
wood<00:01:54.280> well<00:01:54.520> that's<00:01:54.670> not<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.149> answer

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
wood well that's not the answer

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.380 
wood well that's not the answer
basically<00:01:56.500> it's<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.829> exact<00:01:57.100> opposite<00:01:57.820> okay

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
basically it's the exact opposite okay

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.330 
basically it's the exact opposite okay
what<00:01:58.630> we<00:01:58.720> want<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.079> have<00:01:59.170> this<00:01:59.290> biting<00:01:59.829> nasty

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
what we want to have this biting nasty

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.100 
what we want to have this biting nasty
slice<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.880> goes<00:02:01.060> through<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.509> court<00:02:01.750> you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
slice that goes through the court you

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.410 
slice that goes through the court you
know<00:02:02.259> pretty<00:02:02.770> low<00:02:03.009> over<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.189> net<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.640> we<00:02:04.270> need

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
know pretty low over the net is we need

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.600 
know pretty low over the net is we need
more<00:02:04.570> penetration<00:02:05.110> first<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.310> we<00:02:06.490> need

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
more penetration first and we need

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.840 
more penetration first and we need
underspin<00:02:07.360> or<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.709> backspin<00:02:08.709> second<00:02:09.459> or<00:02:09.790> a

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
underspin or a backspin second or a

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.650 
underspin or a backspin second or a
second<00:02:10.209> okay

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
second okay

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.289 
second okay
so<00:02:11.200> how<00:02:11.799> do<00:02:11.860> we<00:02:11.950> do<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.310> we<00:02:12.610> change<00:02:13.060> our

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
so how do we do this we change our

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.030 
so how do we do this we change our
mindset<00:02:13.660> first<00:02:14.049> we're<00:02:14.380> not<00:02:14.410> trying<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.769> hack

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
mindset first we're not trying to hack

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.080 
mindset first we're not trying to hack
through<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.310> ball<00:02:15.459> we're<00:02:15.760> actually<00:02:15.850> trying

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
through the ball we're actually trying

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.800 
through the ball we're actually trying
to<00:02:16.180> hit<00:02:16.750> through<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.230> ball<00:02:17.470> first<00:02:17.769> and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
to hit through the ball first and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.780 
to hit through the ball first and
add<00:02:18.959> some<00:02:19.200> backspin<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:20.250> changes<00:02:20.610> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
add some backspin so this changes the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.729 
add some backspin so this changes the
whole<00:02:21.030> dynamic<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.750> how<00:02:22.319> you're<00:02:22.470> gonna<00:02:22.530> hit

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
whole dynamic of how you're gonna hit

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.320 
whole dynamic of how you're gonna hit
this<00:02:22.830> ball<00:02:23.040> instead<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.670> really<00:02:24.000> coming<00:02:24.300> down

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
this ball instead of really coming down

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.680 
this ball instead of really coming down
on<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> ball<00:02:25.370> okay<00:02:26.370> yeah<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.270> has<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> lot<00:02:27.630> of

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
on the ball okay yeah it has a lot of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.690 
on the ball okay yeah it has a lot of
spin<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.319> but<00:02:28.680> what<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:28.950> really<00:02:29.280> want<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.550> do

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
spin on it but what we really want to do

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.089 
spin on it but what we really want to do
is<00:02:29.880> really<00:02:30.360> pull<00:02:30.720> through<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.170> ball<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.920> you

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
is really pull through the ball and you

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.070 
is really pull through the ball and you
can<00:02:32.220> see<00:02:32.370> how<00:02:32.459> that's<00:02:32.610> really<00:02:32.970> biting<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.750> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
can see how that's really biting and it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.250 
can see how that's really biting and it
has<00:02:34.170> more<00:02:34.349> force<00:02:34.739> behind<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.790> really

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
has more force behind it I can really

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.110 
has more force behind it I can really
okay<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:38.400> what<00:02:38.610> we<00:02:38.730> want<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.030> start

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
okay so really what we want to start

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.030 
okay so really what we want to start
doing<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.599> instead<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.110> hacking<00:02:40.500> down<00:02:40.800> on<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
doing is instead of hacking down on the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.830 
doing is instead of hacking down on the
ball<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:41.550> really<00:02:41.819> want<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.030> line<00:02:42.269> our<00:02:42.450> body<00:02:42.630> up

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
ball we really want to line our body up

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.410 
ball we really want to line our body up
to<00:02:43.080> pull<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.410> racket<00:02:43.830> through<00:02:44.130> okay<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.300> you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
to pull the racket through okay if you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.900 
to pull the racket through okay if you
really<00:02:45.750> watch<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.260> lot<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.769> professionals<00:02:47.220> when

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
really watch a lot of professionals when

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.640 
really watch a lot of professionals when
they're<00:02:48.030> slicing<00:02:48.269> during<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.019> ground<00:02:49.380> stroke

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
they're slicing during a ground stroke

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.590 
they're slicing during a ground stroke
you<00:02:49.980> see<00:02:50.160> them<00:02:50.310> really<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.000> racket<00:02:51.330> starts

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
you see them really the racket starts

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.240 
you see them really the racket starts
off<00:02:51.720> pretty<00:02:51.750> high<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.380> behind<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:53.040> when

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
off pretty high and behind but when

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.680 
off pretty high and behind but when
they're<00:02:53.400> starting<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.730> swing<00:02:54.030> down<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.600> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
they're starting to swing down on the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.420 
they're starting to swing down on the
racket<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.410> notice<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.799> they<00:02:55.920> get<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
racket you notice that they get to the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.330 
racket you notice that they get to the
level<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.910> ball<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.569> goes<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:58.340> okay

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
level of the ball and it goes out okay

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.039 
level of the ball and it goes out okay
now<00:02:59.819> again<00:02:59.940> there's<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.360> ton<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:00.900> different

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
now again there's a ton of different

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.690 
now again there's a ton of different
slices<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.680> might<00:03:01.830> see<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> return<00:03:02.220> slice

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
slices you might see a return slice

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.860 
slices you might see a return slice
which<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.299> little<00:03:03.510> bit<00:03:03.569> more<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.810> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
which is a little bit more of the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.059 
which is a little bit more of the
defensive<00:03:04.380> slice<00:03:04.560> you're<00:03:04.709> not<00:03:04.799> going<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:04.980> see

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
defensive slice you're not going to see

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.120 
defensive slice you're not going to see
the<00:03:05.190> long<00:03:05.790> finish<00:03:06.750> on<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.290> slice<00:03:07.500> compared<00:03:07.980> to

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the long finish on the slice compared to

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.740 
the long finish on the slice compared to
let's<00:03:08.580> say<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> biting<00:03:09.299> slice<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.599> we're

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
let's say a biting slice that we're

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.210 
let's say a biting slice that we're
talking<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.560> what<00:03:10.680> we<00:03:10.799> want<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.099> start

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
talking to so what we want to start

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.190 
talking to so what we want to start
thinking<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.580> we<00:03:11.940> got<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.209> almost<00:03:12.540> get<00:03:12.690> under

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
thinking is we got to almost get under

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.270 
thinking is we got to almost get under
the<00:03:13.319> ball<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.769> even<00:03:14.010> though<00:03:14.069> I'm<00:03:14.160> starting

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
the ball so even though I'm starting

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.789 
the ball so even though I'm starting
high<00:03:14.580> like<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.910> I'm<00:03:15.870> getting<00:03:16.140> under<00:03:16.769> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
high like this I'm getting under the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.740 
high like this I'm getting under the
ball<00:03:17.099> so<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.940> thing<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.209> want<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.390> do<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.599> start

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
ball so the thing we want to do is start

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.210 
ball so the thing we want to do is start
to<00:03:18.870> think<00:03:19.049> we<00:03:19.170> got<00:03:19.319> to<00:03:19.410> get<00:03:19.470> under<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> ball<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
to think we got to get under the ball a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.100 
to think we got to get under the ball a
little<00:03:20.310> bit<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.670> really<00:03:21.120> hit<00:03:21.540> through<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.900> I

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
little bit and really hit through it I

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.890 
little bit and really hit through it I
like<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.980> start<00:03:23.489> off<00:03:23.609> very<00:03:24.120> simply<00:03:24.600> when<00:03:24.840> we

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
like to start off very simply when we

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.960 
like to start off very simply when we
talk<00:03:25.079> about<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.769> slice<00:03:26.070> which<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.700> start<00:03:26.940> here

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
talk about the slice which is start here

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.060 
talk about the slice which is start here
and<00:03:27.359> just<00:03:27.420> focus<00:03:27.989> on<00:03:28.109> almost<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.739> volley

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
and just focus on almost like a volley

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.310 
and just focus on almost like a volley

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
mine did a great sliced video talking

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.750 
mine did a great sliced video talking
about<00:03:33.810> how<00:03:34.049> some<00:03:34.380> extended<00:03:34.920> volleys<00:03:35.340> totally

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
about how some extended volleys totally

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.280 
about how some extended volleys totally
right<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.329> know<00:03:36.420> on<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.660> volley<00:03:36.930> you're<00:03:37.170> not

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
right you know on a volley you're not

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.780 
right you know on a volley you're not
going<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.530> hack<00:03:37.709> down<00:03:37.980> on<00:03:38.100> your<00:03:38.220> volley<00:03:38.430> you're

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
going to hack down on your volley you're

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.849 
going to hack down on your volley you're
gonna<00:03:38.880> go<00:03:39.090> through<00:03:39.359> what<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.200> want<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.470> add<00:03:40.620> is

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
gonna go through what I want to add is

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.710 
gonna go through what I want to add is
making<00:03:41.130> sure<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.519> we<00:03:41.790> really<00:03:42.239> attack<00:03:42.690> the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
making sure that we really attack the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.979 
making sure that we really attack the
ball<00:03:43.200> through<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.829> think<00:03:44.340> hit<00:03:44.910> first<00:03:45.299> slice

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
ball through and think hit first slice

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.259 
ball through and think hit first slice
or<00:03:46.260> backspin<00:03:46.799> second<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.609> I'm<00:03:47.700> thinking<00:03:48.000> how

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
or backspin second so I'm thinking how

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.199 
or backspin second so I'm thinking how
can<00:03:48.329> i<00:03:48.480> really<00:03:48.690> hit<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.500> ball<00:03:49.769> first<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.760> add

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
can i really hit this ball first and add

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.110 
can i really hit this ball first and add
some<00:03:51.600> backspin<00:03:52.280> ii<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.579> i<00:03:53.609> want<00:03:53.819> to<00:03:53.880> show<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.030> a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
some backspin ii so i want to show you a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.819 
some backspin ii so i want to show you a
couple<00:03:54.269> demos<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.900> how<00:03:54.989> we're<00:03:55.500> going<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.650> do

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
couple demos of how we're going to do

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.770 
couple demos of how we're going to do
this<00:03:55.980> first<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.940> all<00:03:57.090> we're<00:03:57.450> going<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.600> make

this first of all we're going to make

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.330 
this first of all we're going to make
sure<00:03:58.019> we<00:03:58.139> get<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.410> racket<00:03:58.709> back<00:03:59.069> it's<00:03:59.310> really

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
sure we get that racket back it's really

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.009 
sure we get that racket back it's really
important<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.060> we<00:04:00.269> get<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.510> butt<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.930> the

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
important that we get the butt of the

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.900 
important that we get the butt of the
racket<00:04:01.380> back<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.859> gets<00:04:02.130> in<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.400> leverage

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
racket back this gets in that leverage

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.340 
racket back this gets in that leverage
position<00:04:03.090> where<00:04:03.690> i<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.900> really<00:04:04.079> start

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
position where i can really start

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.830 
position where i can really start
pulling<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> butt<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.459> racket<00:04:05.819> a<00:04:06.000> little

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
pulling the butt of the racket a little

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.509 
pulling the butt of the racket a little
bit<00:04:06.989> which<00:04:07.170> pulls<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.560> racket<00:04:07.950> head<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.250> lot

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
bit which pulls the racket head a lot

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.490 
bit which pulls the racket head a lot

the center of the chest and finishing
out<00:04:35.039> another<00:04:35.939> really<00:04:36.300> important<00:04:36.599> thing<00:04:36.719> is

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
out another really important thing is

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.110 
out another really important thing is
the<00:04:36.960> opposite<00:04:37.499> arm<00:04:37.740> opposite<00:04:38.520> arm<00:04:38.729> is<00:04:38.909> really

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the opposite arm opposite arm is really

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.159 
the opposite arm opposite arm is really
important<00:04:39.449> because<00:04:39.509> it<00:04:39.719> helps<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:39.960> keep<00:04:40.110> your

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
balance so we don't want to do this

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.029 
balance so we don't want to do this
because<00:04:42.930> we're<00:04:43.199> going<00:04:43.319> to<00:04:43.379> open<00:04:43.499> up<00:04:43.740> too<00:04:43.919> much

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
because we're going to open up too much

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.499 
because we're going to open up too much
you're<00:04:44.189> going<00:04:44.279> to<00:04:44.340> pull<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.580> ball<00:04:44.759> to<00:04:45.419> the

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
you're going to pull the ball to the

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.029 
you're going to pull the ball to the
right<00:04:45.659> we<00:04:46.080> want<00:04:46.229> to<00:04:46.289> really<00:04:46.409> make<00:04:46.590> sure<00:04:46.650> that

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
right we want to really make sure that

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.369 
right we want to really make sure that
opposite<00:04:47.699> arm<00:04:47.849> keeps<00:04:48.360> our<00:04:48.539> balance<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.259> we

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
opposite arm keeps our balance and we

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.230 
opposite arm keeps our balance and we
keep<00:04:49.590> almost<00:04:49.860> our<00:04:50.129> body<00:04:50.279> sideways<00:04:50.580> into<00:04:50.999> a

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
keep almost our body sideways into a

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.879 
keep almost our body sideways into a
finish<00:04:51.539> with<00:04:51.659> the<00:04:51.719> stroke<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.169> then<00:04:52.379> we<00:04:52.469> can

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
finish with the stroke and then we can

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.189 
finish with the stroke and then we can
recover<00:04:53.159> and<00:04:53.430> look<00:04:53.879> at<00:04:53.999> what<00:04:54.210> we<00:04:54.330> did<00:04:54.479> okay<00:04:55.050> so
