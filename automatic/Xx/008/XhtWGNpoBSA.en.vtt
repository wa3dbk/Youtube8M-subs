00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.660
 find the recipes 750 grams with 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.799
 samsung that i'm very very close this is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.839
 that she is the best way to do 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.340
 a whipped cream the siphon is really 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.830
 the faster you'll see it 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.230
 done in two minutes to men and to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.460
 hardly look at it we have six funds first 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.680
 very important thing 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.720
 we will put liquid cream 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.820
 well well cold in the fate of the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.529
 chord refrigerator and especially of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.630
 the whole one with 30% interest thanks to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:42.210
 that lighten its march - less well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:44.129
 ok here gold here it is done and there 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.750
 we're going to put icing on it's more 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.350
 easy because he's getting better cast and that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.940
 in the g 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.469
 but if you have caster sugar that's fine 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.329
 many times just the good the Czech is 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.260
 okay it never got to where ice and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.250
 oissel what are you doing in this 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.250
 meaning there I was just cracking vanilla 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.239
 you're going in fact you're going to recover that's it 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 the volume that grains that goes 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.570
 recover to what is very important 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.040
 in the recipe it's really 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 recovered that guys because otherwise 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.090
 you go to asperities so well 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.700
 as far as vanilla is concerned then 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.500
 be careful to remove the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.729
 seeds only strikes 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.439
 if you put a nice decor it can 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.869
 butcher the siphon of acquirers really 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.759
 really that that grains of agreement 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.390
 ok nickel 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.009
 look we just shut up and we 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.509
 will leave her two good hours at 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.850
 fridge 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.170
 ideally valence and let it infuse 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.470
 cold is first because we have 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.329
 not heated you saw we go first 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.400
 listened well I control me micro has 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.380
 okay to check okay you have 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.000
 may be good to check here for good 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.470
 divide the coming to melt the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.420
 sugar but not those of icing sugar and 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.840
 no problem even more is sugar 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.060
 semolina 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.259
 it's not a web mojito of the process 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.700
 check by a burrito that features 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.880
 tac tac tac hockey 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.780
 there we will put your acuity hit 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.970
 in the gas cartridges 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.310
 for m side well 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.170
 tac and we put two cartridges because 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.890
 I have a big siphon okay 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.950
 otherwise I was going to put siphon 2000 liters 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.920
 you will put a shocked cartridge 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.330
 ideally we will put an hour to two 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.890
 hours in the fridge really 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.210
 really to really give this little 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.240
 vanilla taste meet in two 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.800
 hours ago it's been two hours 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.920
 assume we have a siphon that is fine 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.980
 cold and there I leave the professional 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.520
 of the siphon she really becomes 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.440
 maybe down teper the var it's going 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.080
 great result with an audio attached here 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.720
 it is hyper abound to erged gaberic 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.040
 look at the vanilla seeds it's 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:52.280
 beautiful magnificent must I taste of 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.239
 after the best she is great 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.920
 light because she is really very 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.300
 very strong given thanks to your cartridges 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.360
 of gas as a friend so really 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.360
 now hasta luego to the next
