00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
here I'm going to sit down the key here

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
here I'm going to sit down the key here
we<00:01:01.710> want<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> keep<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.340> when<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.579> wet<00:01:02.820> before<00:01:03.030> we

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
we want to keep it when it wet before we

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.359 
we want to keep it when it wet before we
start<00:01:03.619> I'm<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> make<00:01:04.979> sure<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
start I'm going to make sure we get a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.480 
start I'm going to make sure we get a
good<00:01:05.430> bond<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:08.060> brushed<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> stucco

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
good bond I brushed some of the stucco

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.600 
good bond I brushed some of the stucco
into<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> key<00:01:12.479> physically<00:01:13.250> brush<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.460> in

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
into the key physically brush it in

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.890 
into the key physically brush it in
there<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.909> improves<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.570> adhesion

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.890 

so<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.890> edge<00:01:26.070> still<00:01:26.520> wet<00:01:26.900> start

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
so with with that edge still wet start

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
so with with that edge still wet start
packing<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> stucco<00:01:28.680> first<00:01:29.070> into<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.520> key

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
packing the stucco first into that key

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.630 
packing the stucco first into that key
and<00:01:30.799> then<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.100> start<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:34.280> going<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.430> in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and then you can start just going up in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.539 
and then you can start just going up in
there<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.320> some<00:01:38.630> flow<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.830> trick<00:01:44.399> is

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
there with some flow so and the trick is

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.940 
there with some flow so and the trick is
to<00:01:44.580> use<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.880> lot<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.149> muscle<00:01:45.539> just<00:01:45.690> really<00:01:46.020> work

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to use a lot of muscle just really work

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
to use a lot of muscle just really work
it<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.280> their<00:01:47.520> top<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> give<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> good

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it in their top going to give you a good

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.840 
it in their top going to give you a good
tight<00:01:49.170> bond<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.369> we're<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> put<00:01:50.729> this

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
tight bond so we're going to put this

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.539 
tight bond so we're going to put this
camera<00:01:51.240> town<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.690> curlies<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.289> job<00:01:52.470> done

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
camera town and curlies get the job done

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.180 
camera town and curlies get the job done
well<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.640> looks<00:01:53.819> like<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:55.619> universe<00:01:56.009> is

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
well it looks like the the universe is

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.100 
well it looks like the the universe is
working<00:01:56.550> correctly<00:01:56.759> today<00:01:57.330> because<00:01:57.720> it<00:01:57.929> did

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
working correctly today because it did

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.169 
working correctly today because it did
not<00:01:58.140> rain<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.250> me<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.429> managed<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.789> get<00:02:02.970> this

like this kind of hard to get into you

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.620 
like this kind of hard to get into you
can<00:02:45.269> get<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.570> there<00:02:45.780> too<00:02:46.019> if<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.670> float<00:02:47.670> floats

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
can get in there too if the float floats

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.250 
can get in there too if the float floats
too<00:02:48.959> big<00:02:50.030> also<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.150> don't<00:02:51.329> want<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
too big also you don't want it to the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.840 
too big also you don't want it to the
first<00:02:52.560> coating<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:53.160> really<00:02:53.400> don't<00:02:53.549> want<00:02:53.730> it

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
first coating you really don't want it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.160 
first coating you really don't want it
to<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:55.260> go<00:02:55.380> above<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:56.340> edge<00:02:56.579> here<00:02:56.930> go<00:02:57.930> out

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
to be to go above this edge here go out

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.710 
to be to go above this edge here go out
once<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.970> don't<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.209> don't<00:03:00.359> want<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.630> be

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
once you don't you don't want it to be

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.789 
once you don't you don't want it to be
sticking<00:03:01.019> out<00:03:01.140> there<00:03:01.320> otherwise<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.709> going

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
sticking out there otherwise it's going

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.220 
sticking out there otherwise it's going
to<00:03:01.890> get<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> bulge<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:03.930> starting<00:03:04.170> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
to get a bulge and so it's starting to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.449 
to get a bulge and so it's starting to
set<00:03:04.350> up<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.590> little<00:03:04.799> bit<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.100> we're<00:03:05.310> gonna

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
set up a little bit and we're gonna

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.080 
set up a little bit and we're gonna
we're<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> scratch<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:07.250> I've<00:03:08.250> got<00:03:08.489> this

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
we're going to scratch it I've got this

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.390 
we're going to scratch it I've got this
is<00:03:09.239> not<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.600> proper<00:03:09.840> scratcher<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.799> I've

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
is not the proper scratcher but I I've

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.870 
is not the proper scratcher but I I've
got<00:03:11.640> this<00:03:11.910> which<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:13.459> constraint<00:03:14.459> to

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
got this which is a constraint to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.420 
got this which is a constraint to
scratch<00:03:15.120> horizontal<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.100> gives<00:03:17.190> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
scratch horizontal so that gives the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.170 
scratch horizontal so that gives the
finish<00:03:18.299> coat<00:03:18.329> something<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.989> grab<00:03:19.620> on<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.190> shut

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
finish coat something to grab on to shut

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.340 
finish coat something to grab on to shut
the<00:03:21.239> camera<00:03:21.510> off<00:03:21.569> now<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.170> then<00:03:22.799> scratch<00:03:23.190> it

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
the camera off now and then scratch it

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.680 
the camera off now and then scratch it
so<00:03:25.980> we're<00:03:26.160> just<00:03:26.190> about<00:03:26.490> done<00:03:26.610> here<00:03:26.940> now<00:03:27.300> i'm

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
so we're just about done here now i'm

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.070 
so we're just about done here now i'm
using<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.670> one<00:03:29.670> coat<00:03:29.940> fighbird<00:03:30.980> stucco<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:33.080> the

using a one coat fighbird stucco and the
last<00:03:34.320> last<00:03:35.130> phase<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.790> job<00:03:36.030> here<00:03:36.360> is<00:03:37.220> taken

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
last last phase of the job here is taken

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.120 
last last phase of the job here is taken
that<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:39.110> sponge<00:03:40.110> float<00:03:40.970> get<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.060> pretty<00:03:42.240> dry

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
that the sponge float get it pretty dry

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.310 
that the sponge float get it pretty dry
and<00:03:44.130> this<00:03:44.460> is<00:03:44.610> what<00:03:45.800> this<00:03:46.800> is<00:03:46.890> what<00:03:46.950> makes<00:03:47.460> a

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
and this is what this is what makes a

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.860 
and this is what this is what makes a
makes<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.470> job<00:03:50.060> blend<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.300> you<00:03:51.450> know<00:03:51.540> we<00:03:51.660> have

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
to blend it in here so we don't want

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.580 
to blend it in here so we don't want
this<00:03:55.800> scratch<00:03:56.430> cook<00:03:56.730> higher<00:03:57.060> than<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.600> higher

this will be set up enough by a van so
it's<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:17.380> pretty<00:05:17.500> forgiving<00:05:18.240> finish<00:05:19.710> to<00:05:20.710> match

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
it's a pretty forgiving finish to match

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.040

what's<00:05:23.560> not<00:05:23.740> forgiving<00:05:24.250> is<00:05:24.400> this<00:05:24.690> power<00:05:25.690> we

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
what's not forgiving is this power we

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.540 
what's not forgiving is this power we
got<00:05:26.199> power<00:05:26.410> coming<00:05:26.770> in<00:05:27.840> from<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:28.990> street<00:05:29.550> come

got power coming in from the street come

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.830 
got power coming in from the street come
straight<00:05:30.850> in<00:05:30.880> here<00:05:31.090> there's<00:05:31.300> no<00:05:31.389> breaker<00:05:31.630> on

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840

this<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.639> keep<00:05:33.639> your<00:05:33.759> distance<00:05:34.030> best<00:05:34.930> off

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
this so keep your distance best off

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.350 
this so keep your distance best off
using<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:35.380> fiberglass<00:05:36.270> ladder<00:05:37.270> for<00:05:38.199> that
