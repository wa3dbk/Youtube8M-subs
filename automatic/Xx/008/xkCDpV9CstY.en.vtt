Joker<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.270> mm-hmm<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.860> funny<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.899> want

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
Joker you mm-hmm it's funny so you want

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.750 
Joker you mm-hmm it's funny so you want
to<00:00:49.230> take<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> candid<00:00:49.860> photo<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.280> your<00:00:50.460> friend

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.700 
to take a candid photo of your friend
but<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:51.239> simply<00:00:51.600> don't<00:00:51.780> understand<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
but they simply don't understand that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
but they simply don't understand that
because<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.399> them<00:00:53.520> raising<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.300> camera

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
because for them raising a camera

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.910 
because for them raising a camera
equates<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> same<00:00:55.379> cheese<00:00:55.770> time<00:01:00.859> they<00:01:01.859> think

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
equates the same cheese time they think

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.590 
equates the same cheese time they think
