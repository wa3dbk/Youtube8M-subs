lucky<00:03:38.849> in<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.480> case<00:03:39.780> remember<00:03:40.110> my

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
lucky in this case remember my

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.089 
lucky in this case remember my
motherboard<00:03:41.640> is<00:03:42.000> not<00:03:42.260> actually<00:03:43.260> created<00:03:43.890> for

motherboard is not actually created for
Windows<00:03:44.489> 8<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.599> might<00:03:45.780> work<00:03:46.080> if<00:03:46.409> I<00:03:47.250> go<00:03:47.430> to

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
Windows 8 but it might work if I go to

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.039 
Windows 8 but it might work if I go to
this<00:03:47.670> one<00:03:47.730> here<00:03:48.530> install<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.750> look<00:03:51.750> for<00:03:51.959> the

this one here install and look for the

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.660 
this one here install and look for the
setup<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:54.840> will<00:03:55.470> probably<00:03:55.890> work

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.730 

that<00:03:59.670> we<00:03:59.819> are<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.240> working<00:04:01.230> fine
