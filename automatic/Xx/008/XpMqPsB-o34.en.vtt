00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.579
 youtube has already tried all youtube 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.610

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.089
 that is the truth has not got me to 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.550

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.449
 I bring this 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.719
 Organic coconut oil I hope so 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.600
 see who is focusing is organic 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:08.259
 be very careful and notice what you say 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.630
 without the organic label and as it says in 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.570
 the title of the video today I bring you the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.860
 best kept secret to whiten 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.450
 the teeth really works I carry 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.060
 six days using it and it has 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.720
 worked a lot that's why I want 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.900
 tell them maybe later 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.570
 I do not know if I gave them a present if I gave them 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.970
 upload pictures or something so that 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.430
 see how neither before nor after but if you 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.070
 you want to try it like I see and 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.390
 buy it gets it worth it here 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.010
 in Mexico it's a bit expensive but 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.220
 I think it 's a very good one 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.370
 investment this little boat cost me 150 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.680
 weights but the truth is that he taught me 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.860
 matured a lot right now is between the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.200
 liquid and solid I was already put once 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.229
 totally liquid but I put it in 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.830
 refrigerators and it became solid again 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.650
 but now I have it in the bathroom because 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.830
 Well , I'm going to start telling you how 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.860
 I use it to whiten teeth 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.710
 good the coconut oil is super super 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.550
 good for the organism then in 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.710
 sand in the mouth what it does is kill 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.170
 all the bacteria for those who have 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.710
 ginger and tish for example gums 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.070
 inflamed red ones that hurt 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.470
 or that they bleed really kills all 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.220
 the bacteria that is an infection that 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.650
 I know if I'm wrong they correct me but if 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.630
 kill all the infection kills all the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.959
 bacteria that you have in your mouth gets 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.990
 like that between the teeth and it is 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.730
 as if havana deeply 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.209
 teeth then it will start to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.860
 whiten your teeth naturally 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.980
 whitening you does not mean like when 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.900
 you use products that you really 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.209
 they leave white teeth and they are not going to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.910
 return as your natural tone of your 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.530
 tooth the tooth in really is not 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.860
 White 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.620
 then we all have a view 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.959
 different tones of teeth for example 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.140
 I never had very white teeth 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.800
 I do not know why I suffer a lot, I do not 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.010
 I smoke I do not drink coffee or anything and one of 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.209
 the reasons that I believe is that he ate 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.130
 a lot of chocolate and like a lot of lemon 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.410
 but right now I said chocolate 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:41.260
 I will tell another thing one of the things 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.209
 that yellow yellow your teeth that 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.769
 we turn them yellow is chocolate 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.680
 for example all meals and drinks 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.690
 which are dark of dark color there 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.060
 to brush your teeth later because 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.610
 because if not other teeth tend to 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.620
 get yellow faster then 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.290
 whenever they eat food they are drinks 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.500
 of dark color you have to wash the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.050
 teeth ok now to use the oil 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.370
 of coconut and whiten your teeth the only thing 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.940
 what you are going to do is wash your teeth 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.070
 normal 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.459
 and this and everyone knows from 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.769
 children then you have already washed your teeth 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.840
 rinse you had here and now what you're going 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.930
 to do is this more open your oil 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.300
 coconut I'm going to do here is a bit 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.550
 disgusting if I'm going to accept it because 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.910
 me the consistency in which it enters the 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.540
 mouth and the milk becomes inside the 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.450
 I do not like mouth 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.710
 but with you doing it once a day there are 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.180
 to be constant obviously everything is 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.890
 record everything we want us to 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.890
 serve is constancy 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.280
 So, if we're going to drink, I'll take 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.280
 half a spoon 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.410
 you take and like half a spoonful and I'm going to 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.580
 put in your mouth and I'll hold it there 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.590
 between 10 and 15 minutes ok and let's do 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.280
 as well as 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.740
 as a mouthwash for what 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.780
 then kill all the bacteria and find 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.240
 everything I have to pull bad from 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.200
 our teeth that makes us 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.350
 put yellows ok 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.350
 and 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.740
 i 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.750
 and 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.750
 ah 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.480
 t 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.480
 i 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.900
 and 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.220
 and 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.220

 well already spent 15 minutes already I spit 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.220
 What I always do is rinse with 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.270
 water but right now I'm going back because 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.260
 I have to go to the bathroom and go in with water 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.360
 you spit everything and you must have 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.580
 record if you want to see results and 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.860

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.020
