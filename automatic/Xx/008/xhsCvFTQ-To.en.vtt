00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.390
 illustration is not necessarily only 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.330
 drawing has a time that many people 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.150
 confuse and think that being an illustrator 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.560
 sure list is the same no 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.700
 necessarily because it is the illustration 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 illustration is the act or effect of illustrating 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.340
 demonstrate and express if you explain 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.860
 highlight and be able to emphasize 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.440
 messages in a clear objective manner 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.399
 in order to transmit information in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 private 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.170
 see that in dictionary definition no 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.629
 says nothing about regarding the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.879
 drawing and still does not say anything to 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.520
 compliance with respect to the confined 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.410
 graphical surface your demonstration 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.609
 was most likely associated with 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.590
 cause of the press 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.600
 in the publishing market where it is used 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.729
 trations that contribute to the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.549
 information transmission of texts 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.280
 news stories and with the growth of 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.650
 press people specializing in 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.270
 illustrate matters and contribute to 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.549
 transmission of information messages 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.400
 ended up becoming a profession are 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.259
 so-called illustrators on the market 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.479
 most popularly known the idea is 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.790
 illustrator is very differentiated this 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.070
 media question but of course it is not 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.689
 just for this that in the next 15 years in the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.220
 graphic branch teachers are very 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.350
 used and most make the drawing 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.600
 precisely because if the intention is you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.729
 emphasize and corroborate to transfer 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.210
 certain information a way 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.610
 custom graphics- specific usage 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.829
 to assist in the construction of this 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.500
 communication is a way of 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.390
 very conducive to achieve this 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.030
 That's why a lot of people associate idea 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.950
 to be a professional designer to be a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.820
 illustrator is popular so the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.950
 people understand 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.049
 I've been told many times that it is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.100
 illustrator had once told me that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.020
 was a designer 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.450
 after all my bachelor's degree in 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.370
 it's serious and I'm a designer but when 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.870
 You 're in the middle you end up having to 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.570
 use the terms people are going to 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.940
 understand you know when you said that i was 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.800
 designer people did not understand what 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.210
 It means a lot of people thought I was 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.220
 hair stylist 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.060
 so today to put an end to it I 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.940
 I speak I am a designer illustrate help 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.070
 you use the drawing or expressions 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.010
 graphs in order to transmit and 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.630
 express yourself graphically and of course you 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.790
 can demonstrate without 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.590
 necessarily use the drawing and I 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.680
 I'll show you some examples. 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.050
 applied this book is from the publisher 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.120
 April is a collection of some 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.740
 grandes artistas graphics 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.880
 Brazilians 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.940
 see the illustration that for example this 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:04.690
 here was done with material gluing 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:07.690
 rubberized and see etec published 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.150
 as illustration is not a drawing is a 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.910
 way to graph 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.680
 using other materials 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.190
 see for example also 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.010
 this is literally a mock-up 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.530
 are pvc tubes the face with your stock 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.760
 fact is that it is applied as 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.760
 illustration in magazine 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.390
 this was another way for 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.170
 do illustration without necessarily 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.780
 use drawing here too 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.600
 this is a small sculpture of 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.709
 paper is not a drawing and here you 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.790
 you have been applied as an illustration 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.790
 on this page 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.810
 Anyway, I can not give you an idea. 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.420
 more or less that the illustration consists 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.890
 in the act of expressing express 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.800
 graphically to transmit a 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.830
 specific information and drawing is a 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.489
 of forms is perhaps one of the main 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.260
 the most exploited of them but with one of them 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.410
 and neither the drawing do you have the more 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.080
 several variations of graphic expression 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.250
 that you can currently use 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.850
 digital art dominates 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.920
 the addition of the receiving and 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.930
 everything else but there are still many 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.660
 artists doing work 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.900
 fully manual it here by 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.390
 mixed media and here one more example 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.370
 illustration of which did not use the 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:41.490
 drawing this here is a club and we now 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.190
 is that it was finally used as a 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.110
 distraction photographic assembly should be 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.880
 more familiar with you 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.100
 there is also another way to use the 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.500
 Enlightenment, then I hope to have 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.169
 clarified for you the difference that 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.660
 illustration is not necessarily drawing 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.850
 but rather that drawing is one of the ways 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.510
 to demonstrate 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.510
 So that's it we're talking about
