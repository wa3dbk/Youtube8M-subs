 buenaventura restaurant chef kasab 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.550
 and today we are going to prepare some tips 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.500
 Colombian food 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.440
 then the inherent ones are banana 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.170
 mature 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.760
 Paipa cheese previously or cheese 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.540
 peasant salt pepper wheat flour and 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.540
 some good sausages 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.530
 then the steps are the following 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.730
 we take the ripe bananas 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.559
 we remove the tips and cook them 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.880
 with shell in normal portions we go 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.590
 to do about six possible then 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.590
 we split about two bananas 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.449
 matches equal 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.060
 and we all put them to cook in water 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.610
 hot normally then already 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.040
 bananas have been cooked enough 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.060
 they are already tender they are already at their point 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.240
 it's time to take out the two take away the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.240
 shell 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.560
 we can be a bowl 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.260
 make a puree 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.120
 they are super hot 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.550
 but it is easy to detach in the 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.220
 shell 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.220
 and we proceed to macerate the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.800
 if we wish that for ipad like the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.800
 banana is hot is going to melt 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.500
 very easily and if it's going to mix with 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.020
 the puree 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.560
 It is prudent to put a little salt and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.560
 Pepper 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.629
 as it is sweet a little bit is added 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.629
 of sugar 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.150
 but we see everything very well 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.860
 we take our flour 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.860
 and we make our pretty 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.920

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.430
 Easy easy to prepare 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.060
 immediately after we have our balls 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.989

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.220

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:23.850
 a little stick and the fries 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.850
 after three minutes they are already fried 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.010
 then we realize how to 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.220
