Ametek steel horn motor so the quality

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.459 
Ametek steel horn motor so the quality
of<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.280> motor<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.600> lot<00:00:55.020> better<00:00:55.350> than

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
of this motor here is a lot better than

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.900 
of this motor here is a lot better than
what<00:00:55.739> you're<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.730> any

central vacuum system store so this is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.549 
central vacuum system store so this is
one<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> best<00:01:00.750> motors<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> can

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
one of the best motors that you can

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
one of the best motors that you can
possibly<00:01:02.070> put<00:01:02.670> inside<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.420> central<00:01:03.780> vacuum

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
possibly put inside of a central vacuum

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670 
possibly put inside of a central vacuum
system<00:01:05.659> now<00:01:06.659> also<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.409> being<00:01:07.619> a

commercial-grade<00:01:08.299> central<00:01:09.299> vacuum<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
commercial-grade central vacuum this is

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.550 
commercial-grade central vacuum this is
a<00:01:10.200> wide-body<00:01:11.010> unit<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.150> seven<00:01:13.080> gallon

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
a wide-body unit so it's a seven gallon

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.070 
a wide-body unit so it's a seven gallon
bucket<00:01:14.549> opposed<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.479> standard<00:01:15.840> five

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
right here has a HEPA filter rather than

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.109 
right here has a HEPA filter rather than
your<00:01:30.630> standard<00:01:31.020> microtext<00:01:31.860> filter<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
your standard microtext filter so the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.670 
your standard microtext filter so the
HEPA<00:01:33.299> filtration<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:34.560> bit

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
HEPA filtration is just a little bit

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.649 
HEPA filtration is just a little bit
better<00:01:34.829> added<00:01:35.520> filtration<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.299> those<00:01:36.450> that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
better added filtration for those that

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.359 
better added filtration for those that
have<00:01:36.840> allergies<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.350> asthma<00:01:37.560> inside<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
have allergies and asthma inside the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.200 
have allergies and asthma inside the
house<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.140> also<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> bag<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.369> bagless<00:01:41.759> model

house and also is a bag or bagless model

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.929 
house and also is a bag or bagless model
so<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.320> did<00:01:43.500> want<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.799> try<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
so if you did want to try out the the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
so if you did want to try out the the
bags<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> system<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.409> get<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> pack<00:01:46.860> of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
bags in the system you do get a pack of

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.969 
bags in the system you do get a pack of
three<00:01:47.220> bags<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.899> definitely<00:01:49.770> try

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
three bags so you can definitely try

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.950 
three bags so you can definitely try
them<00:01:50.070> out<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.579> also<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.270> found<00:01:51.570> down<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
them out but also if you found down the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.810 
them out but also if you found down the
road<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.439> didn't<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> use<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
road that you didn't want to use the the
