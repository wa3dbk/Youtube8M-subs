00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
onion I have to say it's a bad idea

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.330 
onion I have to say it's a bad idea
because<00:00:09.360> now<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.110> really<00:00:10.889> want<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.400> cry<00:00:12.920> so<00:00:13.920> I

because now I really want to cry so I

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.620 
because now I really want to cry so I
know<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.580> lot<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.059> are<00:00:15.120> probably<00:00:15.330> wondering

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
know a lot of you are probably wondering

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.620 
know a lot of you are probably wondering
why<00:00:16.049> did<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.320> choose<00:00:16.590> these<00:00:16.980> two<00:00:17.330> products<00:00:18.330> well

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
why did I choose these two products well

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.510 
why did I choose these two products well
I<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.230> been<00:00:19.410> doing<00:00:19.560> my<00:00:19.680> research<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
I have been doing my research for the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.090 
I have been doing my research for the
past<00:00:20.730> couple<00:00:21.000> months<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:22.350> noticed<00:00:22.859> that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
past couple months and I've noticed that

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.130 
past couple months and I've noticed that
these<00:00:23.910> two<00:00:24.140> two<00:00:25.140> are<00:00:25.500> very<00:00:26.160> common

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
these two two are very common

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140 
these two two are very common
denominator<00:00:28.140> when<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> comes<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.130> hair<00:00:29.670> growth

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
denominator when it comes to hair growth

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.290 
denominator when it comes to hair growth
they're<00:00:30.570> both<00:00:30.810> antifungal<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
they're both antifungal and

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.860 
they're both antifungal and
antibacterial<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.190> lot<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> people<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.660> wash

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
antibacterial so a lot of people we wash

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.069 
antibacterial so a lot of people we wash
our<00:00:37.110> hair<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:38.040> sometimes<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.450> bacteria<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
our hair but sometimes the bacteria is

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.740 
our hair but sometimes the bacteria is
still<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.710> no<00:00:41.040> matter<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.430> much<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:42.480> wash

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
still there no matter how much we wash

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.940 
still there no matter how much we wash
it<00:00:43.340> usually<00:00:44.340> goes<00:00:44.520> away<00:00:44.579> whenever<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.210> use<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
it usually goes away whenever we use a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
it usually goes away whenever we use a
cleansing<00:00:46.950> shampoo<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:47.879> cleansing<00:00:48.239> method

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
cleansing shampoo or cleansing method

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.680 
cleansing shampoo or cleansing method
but<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:50.010> me<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.820> tend<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> use<00:00:51.300> those

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
but like me I don't tend to use those

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.799 
but like me I don't tend to use those
kind<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.020> methods<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.239> figured<00:00:54.239> I'll<00:00:54.480> use

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
kind of methods so I figured I'll use

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
kind of methods so I figured I'll use
these<00:00:55.379> two<00:00:55.590> products<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.340> they're<00:00:57.210> very

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
these two products and they're very

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.319 
these two products and they're very
stimulating<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.859> used<00:00:59.160> onion<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.879> my<00:01:00.090> hair

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
about the scent but this is why I'm

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.020 
about the scent but this is why I'm
using<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.430> hot<00:01:14.610> six<00:01:14.939> oil<00:01:16.520> because<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.759> all

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
using the hot six oil because I have all

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.719 
using the hot six oil because I have all
these<00:01:18.420> wonderful<00:01:18.840> ingredients<00:01:19.729> especially

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
these wonderful ingredients especially

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.600 
these wonderful ingredients especially
sweet<00:01:21.390> almond<00:01:21.930> oil<00:01:22.170> which<00:01:22.950> gives<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.460> this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
sweet almond oil which gives it this

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.600 
sweet almond oil which gives it this
really<00:01:23.840> nice<00:01:24.840> smell<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.979> also<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> cherry

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
really nice smell and also the cherry

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.140 
really nice smell and also the cherry
bark<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:28.049> there's<00:01:28.380> another<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.340> believe

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
bark and there's another one I believe

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.910 
bark and there's another one I believe
it's<00:01:30.299> either<00:01:30.450> sage<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.670> sheep's<00:01:32.970> ro<00:01:33.920> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it's either sage or the sheep's ro it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.499 
it's either sage or the sheep's ro it
smells<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.520> good<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> figured<00:01:36.390> this

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
smells really good so I figured this

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.289 
smells really good so I figured this
will<00:01:36.689> help<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.140> mask<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:38.040> scent<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.970> oil

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
will help to mask the scent and this oil

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.480 
will help to mask the scent and this oil
is<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.110> know<00:01:40.259> bind<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.710> bottle<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.100> oil<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
is you know bind this bottle of oil is a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
is you know bind this bottle of oil is a
really<00:01:41.759> good<00:01:42.450> deal<00:01:42.780> because<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.439> all

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
really good deal because you get all

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.770 
really good deal because you get all
these<00:01:43.890> different<00:01:44.250> oils<00:01:44.640> all<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.390> bottle

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
these different oils all the one bottle

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
these different oils all the one bottle
as<00:01:45.960> opposed<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> buying<00:01:46.710> them<00:01:46.920> separately

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
as opposed to buying them separately

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.730 
as opposed to buying them separately
which<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.060> expensive<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.930> I'm<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.680> to
