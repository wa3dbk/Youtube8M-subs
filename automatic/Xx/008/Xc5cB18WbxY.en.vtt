00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
you can achieve this look with or

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.080

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
section from the very end and split it

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.180 
section from the very end and split it
into<00:02:39.040> three<00:02:39.220> pieces<00:02:40.740> this<00:02:41.740> parts<00:02:42.100> really

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
into three pieces this parts really

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.040 
into three pieces this parts really
tricky<00:02:42.820> because<00:02:42.940> you're<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.570> getting<00:02:43.900> it

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
tricky because you're just getting it

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.860 
tricky because you're just getting it
started<00:02:44.350> but<00:02:44.740> once<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.280> got<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.970> groove<00:02:46.270> it's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
started but once you got the groove it's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.460 
started but once you got the groove it's
really<00:02:47.290> easy<00:02:48.240> okay<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.600> go<00:02:49.870> ahead<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.170> braid

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
really easy okay so go ahead and braid

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.290 
really easy okay so go ahead and braid
it<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.709> few<00:02:50.890> times<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:53.820> now<00:02:54.820> you're<00:02:55.030> going<00:02:55.240> to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
it a few times and now you're going to

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.750 
it a few times and now you're going to
start<00:02:55.570> adding<00:02:55.810> hair<00:02:56.320> from<00:02:56.920> where<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.280> parted

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
start adding hair from where you parted

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.520 
start adding hair from where you parted
it<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.810> we're<00:02:58.900> going<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.080> take<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.320> from<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
it so we're going to take it from the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.460 
it so we're going to take it from the
farthest<00:02:59.980> end<00:03:00.360> make<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.390> whole<00:03:01.690> section<00:03:01.990> and

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
farthest end make a whole section and

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.160 
farthest end make a whole section and
add<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.280> your<00:03:03.580> break<00:03:03.820> just<00:03:04.690> like<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:04.990> would

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
add it to your break just like you would

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.040 
add it to your break just like you would
a<00:03:05.230> normal<00:03:05.320> French<00:03:05.830> braid<00:03:06.510> cross<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.750> over<00:03:07.840> and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
a normal French braid cross it over and

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.630 
a normal French braid cross it over and
do<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.560> same<00:03:08.800> thing<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.459> next<00:03:09.580> section

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
do the same thing to the next section

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.110 
do the same thing to the next section
making<00:03:12.640> vertical<00:03:13.500> sections<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.920> time<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.820> you

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
making vertical sections of time and you

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.910 
making vertical sections of time and you
can<00:03:19.300> decide<00:03:19.600> how<00:03:19.660> far<00:03:19.930> down<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.500> want<00:03:20.830> to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
can decide how far down you want to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.199 
can decide how far down you want to
bring<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.220> but<00:03:21.400> I'm<00:03:21.550> just<00:03:21.760> going<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.940> kind<00:03:22.150> of

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
bring it but I'm just going to kind of

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.120 
bring it but I'm just going to kind of
go<00:03:22.360> up<00:03:22.720> against<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.880> hairline<00:03:26.010> because<00:03:27.010> I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
go up against the hairline because I

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:35.250 
go up against the hairline because I
have<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.310> high<00:03:27.489> forehead<00:03:27.760> anyways<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:34.870> keep

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
have a high forehead anyways just keep

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.880 
have a high forehead anyways just keep
reading<00:03:36.570> it's<00:03:37.570> hard<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:37.930> get<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.290> hands

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
reading it's hard to get the hands

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.340 
reading it's hard to get the hands
placed<00:03:39.489> in<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.209> correct<00:03:40.330> position<00:03:40.630> at<00:03:41.080> first

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
placed in the correct position at first

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.020 
placed in the correct position at first
but<00:03:41.620> once<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:42.010> get<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.310> down<00:03:42.340> that's<00:03:42.700> really

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
but once you get it down that's really

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.990 
but once you get it down that's really
easy<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:45.480> just<00:03:46.480> want<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.900> go<00:03:48.000> horizontally

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
easy you just want to go horizontally

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.210 
easy you just want to go horizontally
all<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.480> way<00:03:49.709> across<00:03:50.709> your<00:03:50.980> forehead

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.030 

and<00:03:58.020> you<00:03:59.020> can<00:03:59.200> decide<00:03:59.470> where<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.770> want<00:03:59.920> to<00:04:00.010> end

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
and you can decide where you want to end

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.270 
and you can decide where you want to end
it<00:04:00.660> I'm<00:04:01.660> going<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.320> braid<00:04:02.710> mine<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:02.950> little

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
it I'm going to braid mine a little

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.140 
it I'm going to braid mine a little
further<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.540> side<00:04:05.460> because<00:04:06.460> when<00:04:07.030> you

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
further on this side because when you

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.270 
further on this side because when you
run<00:04:07.330> out<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.540> hair<00:04:07.990> from<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.530> sections<00:04:09.040> you're

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
run out of hair from the sections you're

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.070 
run out of hair from the sections you're
going<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.490> end<00:04:09.760> with<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.300> last<00:04:10.510> three<00:04:10.840> pieces

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
going to end with the last three pieces

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.670 
going to end with the last three pieces
again<00:04:11.530> just<00:04:11.950> continue<00:04:12.190> like<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.760> normal<00:04:13.360> braid

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
again just continue like a normal braid

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.259 
again just continue like a normal braid
and<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:15.370> can<00:04:15.520> decide<00:04:15.730> you<00:04:15.940> want<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.150> bring

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269
