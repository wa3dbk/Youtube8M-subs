selection<00:00:50.830> here<00:00:50.980> today<00:00:51.160> but<00:00:51.520> I<00:00:51.640> think<00:00:51.879> it<00:00:52.000> did

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
selection here today but I think it did

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.640 
selection here today but I think it did
and<00:00:52.480> Rick<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.720> I<00:00:52.809> were<00:00:52.960> talking<00:00:53.260> about<00:00:53.470> this

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
and Rick and I were talking about this

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.040 
and Rick and I were talking about this
just<00:00:53.710> before<00:00:54.190> we<00:00:54.580> came<00:00:54.730> on<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.059> air<00:00:55.090> I<00:00:55.449> think

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
just before we came on the air I think

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.420 
just before we came on the air I think
this<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.379> player<00:00:56.590> that<00:00:56.739> they<00:00:56.890> really<00:00:57.220> need

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
this is a player that they really need

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.550 
this is a player that they really need
to<00:00:57.460> have<00:00:57.580> he<00:00:57.940> is<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.090> very<00:00:58.570> strong<00:00:59.050> physical

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
player on the inside and I think he

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.400 
player on the inside and I think he
would<00:01:01.420> agree<00:01:01.480> with<00:01:01.750> this<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:02.050> one<00:01:02.200> of<00:01:02.290> those

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
is you know he's played on his club

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.240 
is you know he's played on his club
that's<00:01:37.000> really<00:01:37.380> used<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.560> three-point<00:01:39.040> goal

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
that's really used the three-point goal

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.800 
that's really used the three-point goal
they<00:01:39.400> had<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.549> lot<00:01:39.760> of<00:01:39.790> guys<00:01:40.030> at<00:01:40.270> Las<00:01:40.420> Vegas

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
they had a lot of guys at Las Vegas

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.359 
they had a lot of guys at Las Vegas
tonight<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.320> shoot<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.650> three-point<00:01:41.920> goal

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
tonight to shoot the three-point goal

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.250 
tonight to shoot the three-point goal
and<00:01:42.580> I<00:01:42.640> think<00:01:42.939> that<00:01:43.090> overshadowed<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.869> saddle

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
and I think that overshadowed a saddle

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.050 
and I think that overshadowed a saddle
his<00:01:44.409> accomplishments<00:01:45.100> he's<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.520> much<00:01:45.850> better

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
his accomplishments he's a much better

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.700 
his accomplishments he's a much better
player<00:01:46.390> on<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.659> inside<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.260> think<00:01:47.470> he<00:01:47.560> was

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
player on the inside and I think he was

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.560 
player on the inside and I think he was
given<00:01:47.950> credit<00:01:48.070> for<00:01:48.490> his<00:01:48.909> just<00:01:49.119> if<00:01:49.240> he<00:01:49.360> played

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
given credit for his just if he played

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.470

to<00:02:12.500> see<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.920> think<00:02:13.400> now<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> offseason

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
to see I think now in the offseason

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.700 
to see I think now in the offseason
whether<00:02:14.390> or<00:02:14.540> not<00:02:14.600> Walter<00:02:14.840> Davis<00:02:15.140> stays<00:02:15.500> with

down<00:02:19.220> there<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.730> think<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.360> other<00:02:20.450> thing<00:02:20.630> that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
down there I think the other thing that

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.150 
down there I think the other thing that
makes<00:02:20.900> him<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.140> nice<00:02:21.320> player<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.710> pick<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:22.040> this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160
