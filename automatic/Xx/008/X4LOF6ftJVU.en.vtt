00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Allam Zedan Checker: khalid marbou 

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.544
 I came here to introduce you 

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:15.828
 PhotoCat. 

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:17.931
 It's a restricted camera and a plane. 

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:20.170
 Before I do that, I would like to tell you a little about 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.344
 Their source, and their motivation. 

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:23.839
 So I was born in Russia, 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.948
 Three years ago, in 2011, 

00:00:26.948 --> 00:00:29.734
 There were Russian federal elections. 

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.819
 Many irregularities have been reported, 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:33.476
 People went out to protest, 

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:37.170
 Which was very unlikely in Russia. 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.755
 No one really knew 

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:40.839
 How important was the protest, 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.253
 Because, regardless of the reasons, 

00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:44.256
 The global media largely ignored them. 

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:46.319
 Now, there was a group of photographers 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.637
 Who sent aircraft cameras as a hobby - 

00:00:49.637 --> 00:00:52.550
 Usually imagine things as a sphinx 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.318
 The pyramids - coincidentally that were 

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:57.973
 At the corner of the street, fly the camera 

00:00:57.973 --> 00:00:59.749
 They took some photographs, 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.326
 Some panorama pictures of this demonstration. 

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:04.159
 A fully independent entity, 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.218
 A completely random incident, 

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:09.886
 The picture, when I saw it, really shocked me. 

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:11.460
 This is a panorama picture. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.975
 So in one picture, 

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:16.769
 You can already see the scope of this event - 

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:19.838
 Only numbers of people, 

00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:22.525
 Colors, signs. 

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:26.366
 You can not consider this trivial. 

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.368
 All in one picture, what I really enjoy. 

00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:31.427
 I believe that in the future, 

00:01:31.427 --> 00:01:33.913
 The press and many other professions, 

00:01:33.913 --> 00:01:36.432
 There are aircraft cameras are already common abroad, 

00:01:36.432 --> 00:01:39.873
 But I think that if you wait for a few months, or a few years, 

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.910
 It will be a requirement 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.755
 For many professions. 

00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:45.994
 This is something that can be understood. It is a unique view. 

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:49.483
 Nothing illustrates this range, for example, 

00:01:49.483 --> 00:01:52.507
 Within the context, in the same way as these. 

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:54.925
 But there are some obstacles, which are fairly simple 

00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:56.962
 And a rather important task. 

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:58.211
 First is the command of the aircraft. 

00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:02.136
 For this picture, they flew the camera, 

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:06.962
 A 5 kg device with a single lens reflex camera under it. 

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:11.438
 It's a bit heavy, a lot of bends, sharp things. 

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:13.868
 It's something that winds up not quite comfortable, 

00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:15.345
 Maybe also because of the operator. 

00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:18.907
 In fact, you can see this in the background of the pilot's shirt, written on it, 

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:20.966
 "No questions so landing" 

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:22.850
 In Russian and English, 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.224
 Because people are curious, they will follow you, 

00:02:25.224 --> 00:02:27.732
 Then you lose your focus and things may happen. 

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:29.947
 These young people are wonderful. They are professional; 

00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:32.940
 They are very cautious in what they do. 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.549
 So in the protests, you may have noticed, 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.407
 The cameras flew over the river and were somehow safe. 

00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:41.411
 But this does not necessarily apply to 

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.120
 All people and all circumstances, 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.517
 So we have to make flying easier. 

00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:47.799
 The other problem is the laws, 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.825
 Or, more accurately, lack of good laws. 

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:52.738
 For many good reasons, it is difficult 

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.860
 Introducing the laws of adult, 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.911
 To regulate the order of the aircraft cameras. 

00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:58.939
 So we already have cameras. 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.945
 I'm sure everyone here has a smart phone with a camera, right? 

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:03.447
 There are many, many of them. 

00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:05.621
 You hear attacks on people who have Google glasses. 

00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.321
 You hear, in fact, how an amateur was attacked, 

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.222
 Of UAV pilots two weeks ago 

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.348
 Because he was flying one near the beach. 

00:03:12.348 --> 00:03:14.575
 These are some personal contributions that I did not expect. 

00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:17.267
 Just yesterday, a young man attacked me 

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:19.818
 Claiming that I was filming him. 

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:22.517
 I was checking my email here - 

00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:26.160
 Easy way to get contributions in order to talk to you. 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.939
 But I think there are better solutions. 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.908
 I think we have to calm the situation. 

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:33.249
 We have to come up with reasonable solutions 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:34.926
 Addressing privacy issues 

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:37.726
 Safety and accountability problems 

00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:41.539
 But also provide us with that view. 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.722
 This is one possible solution. 

00:03:44.722 --> 00:03:47.403
 This is the photo. 

00:03:47.403 --> 00:03:49.526
 Well, let me see, it's a multi-fan raft, 

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:53.834
 But it is distinguished that there is a bond. 

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.928
 It is literally a dog tie. It is very comfortable. 

00:03:56.928 --> 00:03:59.155
 What is remarkable about this is that, 

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.539
 To tweak it, there is no joystick games, nothing like that. 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.877
 Just turn it on 

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:06.511
 And indicate the direction in which they wish to fly. 

00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.850
 Give it a little twist. 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.592
 That kind of communication. 

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:15.969
 And here she flies. 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.935
 (clap) 

00:04:25.396 --> 00:04:27.377
 So the interaction is very simple. 

00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:29.333
 She is like a flying pet. 

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.594
 It only provides you with a certain angle, 

00:04:31.594 --> 00:04:33.670
 If you go with her, 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.316
 In fact, it will naturally infect me. 

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:38.455
 Certainly, we can develop on them. 

00:04:38.455 --> 00:04:41.025
 This steering wheel has some electronic plugins. 

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.859
 You can turn it on. 

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:48.080
 Now, it's like telling your dog to fly low, 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.638
 If you have a similar dog, then I can press a button 

00:04:50.638 --> 00:04:53.281
 And manipulating them rather easily. 

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:55.970
 So I am now changing their place. 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.747
 It is indeed safe. 

00:04:57.747 --> 00:05:00.430
 I do not know what about you young people in the first row - 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.674
 (Laughter) - But at least initially, 

00:05:02.674 --> 00:05:04.789
 You agree that you feel safer 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.717
 Because there is a tactful connection. 

00:05:06.717 --> 00:05:08.345
 Direct preview is tough, right? 

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:10.157
 Things are not going well all the time. 

00:05:10.157 --> 00:05:11.347
 But in any case, 

00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:13.216
 In fact this thing will prevent that thing 

00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:14.882
 From entering you. 

00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:16.970
 In addition, they tell you immediately 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.998
 That I am the person in charge of this device. 

00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:21.518
 You do not have to search who controls it. 

00:05:21.518 --> 00:05:24.285
 Now, I can assure you that it is very easy, 

00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:27.300
 But I think it's a really good way to prove it 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.359
 He took one another 

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:34.364
 And their water. 

00:05:34.364 --> 00:05:37.647
 If you can do it directly on the platform, 

00:05:37.647 --> 00:05:39.910
 Then I can show you all 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.965
 In five minutes how do you occupy one of these devices. 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.666
 So now we have two eyes in heaven. (clap) 

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:59.746
 And now the ingenuity lies in their return. 

00:05:59.746 --> 00:06:02.668
 (Laughter) 

00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:06.255
 So my question to you is, 

00:06:06.255 --> 00:06:08.000
 Well, it's a nice solution, 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.130
 It is very receptive and safe. 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.671
 What will you use for it? 

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:15.420
 What purpose would you use this camera for in your life? 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.734
 thank you. 

00:06:17.734 --> 00:06:21.734
 (clap)
