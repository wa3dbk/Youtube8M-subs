up<00:06:47.140> maturing<00:06:47.620> past<00:06:47.860> that<00:06:48.160> because<00:06:48.340> the<00:06:48.820> amount

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
up maturing past that because the amount

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.500 
up maturing past that because the amount
of<00:06:49.630> progression<00:06:50.350> between<00:06:50.770> 10-day<00:06:51.670> and<00:06:52.030> acid

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
of progression between 10-day and acid

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.020

rap<00:06:52.720> to<00:06:53.140> me<00:06:53.260> in<00:06:53.380> my<00:06:53.500> opinion<00:06:53.800> is<00:06:53.950> great<00:06:54.340> and<00:06:54.610> if

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
rap to me in my opinion is great and if

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.260

he<00:06:55.150> can<00:06:55.330> create<00:06:55.570> as<00:06:55.840> wide<00:06:56.410> a<00:06:56.440> gap<00:06:56.800> between<00:06:57.270> acid

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
he can create as wide a gap between acid

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.000 
he can create as wide a gap between acid
rap<00:06:58.480> and<00:06:58.780> whatever<00:06:58.990> he<00:06:59.140> does<00:06:59.290> after<00:06:59.440> that<00:06:59.590> I

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010
