00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
we can get 64 people for this it's going

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
to be an awesome tournament

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.620 
to be an awesome tournament
and<00:02:09.390> 64<00:02:10.110> people<00:02:10.350> isn't<00:02:11.010> that<00:02:11.070> many<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.790> 32

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
and 64 people isn't that many and 32

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.630 
and 64 people isn't that many and 32
people<00:02:12.840> should<00:02:13.170> be<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.560> definite<00:02:14.070> lock<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.460> think

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
people should be a definite lock I think

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.880 
people should be a definite lock I think
here<00:02:14.820> he<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.030> 10<00:02:15.270> signed<00:02:15.540> up<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.900> that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
here he is 10 signed up and that

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.430 
here he is 10 signed up and that
shouldn't<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> problem<00:02:17.340> at<00:02:17.730> all<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.440> let's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
shouldn't be a problem at all so let's

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.270 
shouldn't be a problem at all so let's
do<00:02:19.590> math<00:02:19.770> quick<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.190> we<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.730> 64<00:02:21.300> people<00:02:21.570> enter

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
do math quick if we have 64 people enter

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.710 
do math quick if we have 64 people enter
64<00:02:23.280> x<00:02:23.820> 20<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.430> 1280<00:02:26.430> dollars<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.210> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
64 x 20 that is 1280 dollars so the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.440 
64 x 20 that is 1280 dollars so the
extra<00:02:28.050> 280<00:02:28.740> will<00:02:28.920> probably<00:02:29.370> go<00:02:29.580> towards<00:02:30.240> like

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
extra 280 will probably go towards like

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.350 
extra 280 will probably go towards like
I<00:02:30.720> don't<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.320> something<00:02:31.680> else<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.220> um<00:02:32.490> and

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
I don't know something else but um and

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.810 
I don't know something else but um and
that<00:02:33.390> being<00:02:33.930> said<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.890> would<00:02:35.670> be

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
that being said to like I would be

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.050 
that being said to like I would be
willing<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.600> pay<00:02:37.110> extra<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:38.520> make<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.820> happen

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
willing to pay extra to make this happen

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.510 
willing to pay extra to make this happen
like<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.200> gets<00:02:40.440> bumped<00:02:40.770> up<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.920> fifty

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
like if it gets bumped up to fifty

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.430 
like if it gets bumped up to fifty
dollars<00:02:41.880> apiece<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.990> way<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.230> prize

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
dollars apiece so that way the prize

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.050 
dollars apiece so that way the prize
money's<00:02:43.800> better<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.250> overall<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.760> makes<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
money's better and overall it makes it a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.400 
money's better and overall it makes it a
better<00:02:45.150> tournament<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.780> would<00:02:45.960> definitely<00:02:46.050> be
