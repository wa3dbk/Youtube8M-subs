00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
today and let's go ahead and have a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.990 
today and let's go ahead and have a
quick<00:00:16.289> look<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.800> them<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.820> see

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
quick look at them here so you can see

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.670 
quick look at them here so you can see
we're<00:00:18.150> at<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> bus<00:00:18.630> station<00:00:18.810> again<00:00:19.199> on<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
we're at the bus station again on the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.439 
we're at the bus station again on the
bus<00:00:20.250> map<00:00:20.490> which<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.910> lot<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.150> people<00:00:21.210> are

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
bus map which a lot of people are

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.000 
bus map which a lot of people are
calling<00:00:21.539> transit<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> guess<00:00:22.619> we'll<00:00:22.769> go<00:00:22.890> with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
calling transit so I guess we'll go with

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.160 
calling transit so I guess we'll go with
that<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.189> now<00:00:23.359> until<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.570> proven

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
that for now until we are proven

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.750 
that for now until we are proven
otherwise<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.680> transit<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.250> will<00:00:26.369> say<00:00:26.550> for

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
otherwise so transit we will say for

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.609 
otherwise so transit we will say for
this<00:00:26.849> map<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.199> draw<00:00:28.410> your<00:00:28.560> attention

this map so just to draw your attention
to<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.160> code<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.519> things<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.240> first<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.660> all

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
to a code of things on that first of all

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.110 
to a code of things on that first of all
if<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.349> go<00:00:31.500> ahead<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.070> look<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.700> where<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
if you go ahead and look at where the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700 
if you go ahead and look at where the
bus<00:00:33.329> driver<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:34.020> lot<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.350> people<00:00:34.590> thought

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
a bit of a look at the zombie driver and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
a bit of a look at the zombie driver and
a<00:00:53.010> small<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> look<00:00:53.670> inside<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.270> bus

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
a small bit of a look inside the bus

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.779 
a small bit of a look inside the bus

indicating that they can't climb in as
we<00:01:00.660> saw<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.109> trailer<00:01:01.289> where<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:01.890> started

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
we saw in the trailer where they started

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.619

the<00:01:07.080> side<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> window<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.920> right<00:01:08.220> hand

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the side of a window on the right hand

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.359 
the side of a window on the right hand
side<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.909> bus<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.510> well<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.250> not

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
side the bus there as well and we do not

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.890 
side the bus there as well and we do not
see<00:01:11.580> any<00:01:11.700> characters<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> bus<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
see any characters in the bus at the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.620 
see any characters in the bus at the
moment<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.640> it's<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.210> screenshot

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
moment so it's just for screenshot

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.120 
moment so it's just for screenshot
purposes<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.799> tell<00:01:16.979> myself

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
purposes and they do not tell myself

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.410 
purposes and they do not tell myself
it's<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> original<00:01:17.580> characters<00:01:18.180> not

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it's the original characters not

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's the original characters not
although<00:01:18.600> i'd<00:01:18.930> say<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> would<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> then

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
although i'd say it would be and then

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.730 
although i'd say it would be and then
you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.930> front<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> bus<00:01:22.530> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
you can see on the front of the bus it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.760 
you can see on the front of the bus it
has<00:01:22.950> out<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.640> service<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.470> not<00:01:25.470> sure<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:25.680> that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
has out of service and not sure was that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.960 
has out of service and not sure was that
have<00:01:25.920> too<00:01:26.070> much<00:01:26.189> relevant<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:26.700> i<00:01:26.759> thought<00:01:26.909> i

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
have too much relevant but i thought i

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.460

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.560 
mentioned in any way and then you can
see<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> sort<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.280> battering<00:01:29.700> ram<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> top

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
see a sort of battering ram at the top

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.300 
see a sort of battering ram at the top
of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> bus<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.860> probably<00:01:32.040> when<00:01:32.280> you

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
of the bus so this is probably when you

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.710 
of the bus so this is probably when you
actually<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> bus<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
actually get on the bus if you have to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.030 
actually get on the bus if you have to
pay<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> bus<00:01:34.500> or<00:01:34.680> whatever<00:01:34.740> like

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
pay to get on the bus or whatever like

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.530 
pay to get on the bus or whatever like
that<00:01:35.250> pay<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.700> points<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that pay some points to get on it and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.600 
that pay some points to get on it and
this<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.350> batters<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
this will actually batters from the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.100 
this will actually batters from the
zombies<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.150> front<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> way

probably best described up and the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.719 
probably best described up and the
zombies<00:02:04.170> actually<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.619> hired<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.009> time<00:02:05.250> as

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
zombies actually have hired this time as

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.910 
zombies actually have hired this time as
far<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.060> I'm<00:02:06.180> aware<00:02:06.240> none<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.380> maps<00:02:07.619> except

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
far as I'm aware none of the maps except

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160 
far as I'm aware none of the maps except
for<00:02:08.039> shangri-la<00:02:08.399> with<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> girls<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.660> hair

and then you can see
I am<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.710> them<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.040> straitjacket<00:02:14.580> to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
second picture that was released okay

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.000 
second picture that was released okay
guys<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:42.930> here's<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.260> second<00:02:43.590> picture<00:02:43.770> that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
was released it does look like a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.360 
was released it does look like a
different<00:02:45.870> map<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.340> definitely

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
different map so that is definitely

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.580 
different map so that is definitely
something<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:48.240> note<00:02:48.420> here<00:02:48.570> I'll<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.750> flick

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
something to note here I'll just flick

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.800 
something to note here I'll just flick
between<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.070> two<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.239> atmospheres

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
is this a new map you can see like a

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.100 
is this a new map you can see like a
broken<00:02:56.250> bridge<00:02:56.459> there<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.880> power<00:02:57.360> generator<00:02:57.690> in

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
broken bridge there a power generator in

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.390 
broken bridge there a power generator in
the<00:02:58.170> background<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:58.800> some<00:02:58.980> electricity

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the background with some electricity

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.840 
the background with some electricity
coming<00:02:59.760> out<00:02:59.910> of<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.930> crashed<00:03:01.850> I'm

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
coming out of it and then a crashed I'm

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.190 
coming out of it and then a crashed I'm
not<00:03:03.090> sure<00:03:03.180> what<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.300> call<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.540> don't<00:03:03.989> think<00:03:04.140> it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
not sure what you call it don't think it

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.080 
not sure what you call it don't think it
was<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> fire<00:03:04.739> truck<00:03:05.070> but<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.400> some<00:03:05.850> kind<00:03:06.030> of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
was a fire truck but it's some kind of

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.510 
was a fire truck but it's some kind of
truck<00:03:06.360> right<00:03:06.570> there<00:03:06.770> so<00:03:07.770> let<00:03:08.070> me<00:03:08.100> go<00:03:08.310> ahead<00:03:08.340> and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
truck right there so let me go ahead and

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.250 
truck right there so let me go ahead and
some<00:03:09.180> popped<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> screen<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.050> aside

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
some popped on the screen that aside

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.630 
some popped on the screen that aside
about<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:10.920> they<00:03:11.220> can<00:03:11.370> see<00:03:11.489> some

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
about that but and they can see some

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.220 
about that but and they can see some
chains<00:03:11.970> on<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.450> broken<00:03:12.780> bridge<00:03:12.870> there<00:03:13.140> as

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
chains on the broken bridge there as

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.680 
chains on the broken bridge there as
well<00:03:13.380> but<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:14.040> same<00:03:14.280> attire<00:03:14.700> for<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
well but is the same attire for the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.479 
well but is the same attire for the
zombie<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.170> I'm<00:03:16.260> not<00:03:16.410> sure<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.130> new<00:03:17.310> map

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
zombie so I'm not sure is it a new map

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.699 
zombie so I'm not sure is it a new map
or<00:03:17.670> not<00:03:17.820> but<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.060> does<00:03:18.239> look<00:03:18.269> different<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
or not but it does look different to the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.070 
or not but it does look different to the
to<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.340> scene<00:03:20.610> where<00:03:20.940> we<00:03:21.120> saw<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.870> bus

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
to the scene where we saw just the bus

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.720 
to the scene where we saw just the bus
stop<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.410> maybe<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:22.920> an<00:03:23.040> extended<00:03:23.400> part<00:03:23.610> of

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
stop but maybe just an extended part of

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.370 
stop but maybe just an extended part of
the<00:03:23.790> map<00:03:23.940> i'm<00:03:24.090> not<00:03:24.239> too<00:03:24.360> sure<00:03:24.390> yet<00:03:24.690> let<00:03:24.900> me<00:03:25.230> know

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
the map i'm not too sure yet let me know

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.890 
the map i'm not too sure yet let me know
what<00:03:25.590> your<00:03:25.769> theories<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.390> your<00:03:27.390> ideas<00:03:27.750> are

to the bottom left here i'm i'm going to

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.590 
to the bottom left here i'm i'm going to
zoom<00:03:42.269> in<00:03:42.600> on<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.380> see<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.560> zombie<00:03:43.980> and

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
zoom in on it you can see a zombie and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.370 
zoom in on it you can see a zombie and
everything<00:03:45.600> around<00:03:45.810> them<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.140> kind<00:03:46.260> of

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
everything around them is kind of

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.960 
everything around them is kind of
blurred<00:03:46.680> out<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.160> i'm<00:03:47.280> not<00:03:47.400> sure<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.700> this<00:03:47.820> a

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
blurred out so i'm not sure is this a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.020 
blurred out so i'm not sure is this a
new<00:03:48.209> zombie<00:03:48.630> maybe<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.989> really<00:03:49.350> fast<00:03:49.650> one

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
new zombie maybe a really fast one

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.060 
new zombie maybe a really fast one
because<00:03:51.030> he<00:03:51.330> can<00:03:51.450> see<00:03:51.600> some<00:03:51.810> kind<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.170> some

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
because he can see some kind of some

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.410 
because he can see some kind of some
kind<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.280> lines<00:03:53.580> coming<00:03:53.910> off<00:03:54.030> I'm<00:03:54.180> not<00:03:54.299> sure

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
kind of lines coming off I'm not sure

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.789 
kind of lines coming off I'm not sure
how<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.570> describe<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:55.080> but<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.350> know<00:03:55.380> if<00:03:55.739> you

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
how to describe that but you know if you

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.110 
how to describe that but you know if you
see<00:03:56.100> something<00:03:56.280> going<00:03:56.489> really<00:03:56.610> fast<00:03:56.790> like<00:03:56.970> in

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
see something going really fast like in

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.340 
see something going really fast like in
the<00:03:57.209> cartoon<00:03:57.540> or<00:03:57.660> something<00:03:57.690> low<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.080> lines

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
the cartoon or something low the lines

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.259 
the cartoon or something low the lines
come<00:03:58.560> out<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.739> back<00:03:58.860> room<00:03:59.100> as<00:03:59.250> he's<00:03:59.850> moving

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
really really fast so I'm not sure is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.780
