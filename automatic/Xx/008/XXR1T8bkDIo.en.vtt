00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 first training is also in 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.549
 observation of knowledge then 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.379
 I have already spoken with some 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.349
 players some groups of players not 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.420
 everyone obviously because the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 time is so short but 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.560
 I intend to do it anyway so 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.850
 here I had a good feeling about these on 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.119
 his first workouts that's 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.119
 clear 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.130
 the upcoming match is a match that will be 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.990
 necessarily delicate for different 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 standard reasons has sometimes been difficult 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.750
 against the teams 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.460
 I would say less well ranked they 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.480
 have to react they did that there is 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.899
 had some movements in the workforce 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.520
 so yes I am I am very conscious 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.140
 context and importance of good 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 negotiate this first match and the others 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.149
 necessarily that the objective I say after 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.590
 taking core knowledge is 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.870
 see what is possible what can 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.010
 improve 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.050
 maybe to have a little more like 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.719
 you say consistency in the game 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.329
 Here you have hurt I'll give it 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.100
 that I will give everything you 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.899
 I have spent moments 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 difficult 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.610
 and that's about going out with your head up and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.610
 stronger 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.090
 and I know that I know what I am 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.010
 physically able I'm fine I 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.350
 believe rhythm 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.750
 match after match and it shows on the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.380
 tac is already after four months without 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.870
 dialect 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.580
 it was not it was not 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.420
 bad we're not here to make 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.970
 moods but no one is with a 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.880
 new coach if we go on the lover 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.590
 direction with the same ambitions 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.030
 cost a mission to think me what 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.260
 I wish we did the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.050
 best match possible and that all 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.729
 world be happy at the end so that's 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.170
 not jose against the fans it's 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.840
 standard against micron and I think that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.970
 those who know me know very well 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.560
 how good this club is for me 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.440
 how much I already explained my 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.170
 start and how I feel that 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.550
 with the players with I will say the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.110
 staff and with the people who 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.810
 take care of the standard is necessarily 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.270
 those who are eminently concerned 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.459
 supporters but we hang on instead 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.320
 blue possible that's all that's all and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.000
 for sabah I will do as I did 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.610
 first time I will put my experience 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.860
 my heart my guts and hours of 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.860
 work and I hope for joy that's it
