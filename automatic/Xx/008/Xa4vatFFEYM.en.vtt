00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.680
 the idea leads to running different reasons 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.600
 someone wants to lose weight 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.899
 someone wants to relieve tension 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.099
 after a hard day 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.379
 sensible people start zhogin kazbek 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:11.449
 bektursunov 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.369
 many so all remain and this 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.029
 great it is great they have already done 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.380
 decisive step forward and out of the line 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.300
 a pillar 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.089
 people who don't even know what sport is 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.069
 but there is a big category 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.269
 who think and what to do next 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.540
 maybe something can be done 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.570
 to their 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.440
 will advance even more 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.160
 this piece of paper 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.550
 starting number 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.550
 gives you a pass to the noble 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.860
 as soon as we declare 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.110
 competition will become the face of sports goals 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.240
 we become athletes 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.260
 never mind 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.630
 are you worth the task to run out the top ten with 30 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.140
 minutes overlap half 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.930
 quickest show us a kilometer whether 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.180
 just finish the marathon 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.890
 we are an athlete 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.100
 sport can give a lot of very good 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.820
 at least I can list 3 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 gorgeous bonus 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.100
 the first is of course 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.960
 experiences experiences 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.580
 sports that will get cues 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.980
 workouts and of course competitions 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.410
 little on earth can be compared to 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.540
 protecting no 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.820
 cool body work 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.340
 the second is of course not playing and writing 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.290
 health 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.150
 for the average man it is simply incomprehensible 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.360
 yesterday you ate ate handed five 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.140
 in a year or six months you are beauty for 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 personal record for deliveries this is 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.880
 wonders sports training 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.439
 and the third is of course self-discipline them 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.789
 ability to plan your 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.770
 life is a sport for this one hundred 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.910
 percent 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.040
 but I want to say absolute 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.720
 absolutely not worth 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.010
 everything about the sports side and 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.980
 runs include only someone who passed the press 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.280
 120 130 I have already said, but because 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.070
 in school poverty slave and of course got 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.369
 approval after consultation at 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.430
 cardiologist 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.130
 running is a very hard sport I don't want 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.370
 so that someone destroyed the health they increased 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.909
 him during trainings in belgium 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.180
 for those who still gave sports 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.469
 running direction 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.839
 who was he to devote further lessons 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.839
 school asteros experts 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.689
