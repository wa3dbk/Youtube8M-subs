00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.250
 hi i'm duke 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.580
 today I want to talk to you about magic wars wars 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.590
 is a game like league of legends or dota 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.529
 2 then get out of the mind el 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.990
 classic magic this is a way one 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.539
 pvp game is played in four against 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.019
 four and for now we are still in alpha 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.210
 a really very immature alpha is one of the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.310
 games with more bugs than I ever have 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.130
 seen you know that this is saying a lot 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.190
 but also incredibly fun 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.260
 I say it is the game with the most bugs because a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 this point is practically impossible 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.149
 not even entering a server continues to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 giving problems continues to grow by 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.379
 everything happens 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.539
 however this is the game you play 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.160
 I was saying 4 against 4 and for those who wo n't know 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.530
 nothing more magical 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.989
 I explain to you in a moment what are the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.960
 then we base ourselves with eight keys of the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.219
 keyboard we can summon here eight 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.550
 different elements 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.710
 we can combine these elements up to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.250
 at 3 at a time in the normal game they were 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.229
 as many as five water are only three because the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 pvp needs to be balanced a little more 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.560
 tight the game starts and needs 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.180
 conquer three spawn points for 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.630
 it is not necessary to conquer these spompo 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.070
 simply go and position yourself in 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.159
 these in circles we see now 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 these rock circles and staying there 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.939
 enough time we can 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.740
 conquer them now they are hunting us 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.070
 those with numerous where they are 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.990
 opponents when we conquered 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.240
 all three of these spawn circles that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 there are in the map and killed all the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.110
 our adversaries and they can no longer 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.710
 answer will reappear that we have 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.990
 won 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.899
 to do this we need to use 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 the right combinations of magic and make them 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.170
 so damage 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.590
 we can also protect ourselves by evoking the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.299
 shields and therefore there is the foundation of 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.530
 skill is strong enough 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.799
 in this game because we have to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.439
 First of all, be quick in the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.210
 create magic to harm our own 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.550
 opponents we must have a good one 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.970
 reaction to see the elements that 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.220
 they are combining to attack us and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.890
 faster than them to create a shield 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.170
 suitable to defend itself then eg 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.750
 I can create the basic shield that I do 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.290
 protects from all rays but from none 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.260
 physical shot such as if 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.720
 I relaunch with a rock that passes 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.790
 through the shield besides all this 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.740
 we can also upload skills 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.080
 specials that are continuing to 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.600
 change in any peace such as these 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.400
 abilities allow us to 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.950
 teleport to resurrect gods 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.520
 our companions or even how 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.140
 what you see now to summon one 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.660
 meteor storm that rains from 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.180
 heaven and do crazy damage must 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.440
 just run away when we see them later 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.900
 there is also the evocation of death which 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.970
 appears almost from nothing and arrives with the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.550
 his ax hits the nearest enemy 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.470
 and it makes almost 100 percent though ad 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.750
 example we can protect ourselves from death 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.810
 so with a shield of a certain type it is 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.090
 a whole attack and defend yourself 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.440
 there the dead woman is married in the middle and does not know 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.980
 what to do because nobody is there anymore 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.230
 then hit the air with this video 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.269
 I just wanted to give an idea of 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.330
 what is the game the game is 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.920
 affordable but costs 13 euros 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.050
 monthly I advise you not to 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.300
 take it for as long as I'm having fun 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.280
 because now it's really too full of bugs 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.380
 depending on your connection to 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.480
 depending on your computer 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.360
 you really couldn't play it yes 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.640
 you have to wait five minutes minimum 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.709
 to enter a game then cascia 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.390
 really wait at least some 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.320
 week we see how they improve 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.060
 patch 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.280
 I will however continue to post videos 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.069
 when I can enter a server 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.439
 why 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.249
 so I'm really enjoying this 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:03.760
 it was magical wars presale in 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:06.909
 alpha on steam at 13 euros and next 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.120
 days we will see how really this game 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.469
 played in a whole game thanks for 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.909
 having been trade we see in the 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.909
 next video hello to all
