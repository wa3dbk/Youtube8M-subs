00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.470
 speaks guys line operating in Brazil 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.610
 Here Andrew health usually with another 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.170
 episode and we're here with a version 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.500
 it was who we were going to do 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.850
 the hilton was attacking is because the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.810
 sound procedure is good here on the ship 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:31.040
 zoom procedure is good at this enemy 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 But it did not go very fast since 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.579
 rio thani here I made the outline to catch 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.579
 he in front 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:53.410
 so this was a good use of the loop right that 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:01:04.320
 is called the English youtube not turn 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:04.320
 and you can see there the plane crashes is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:18.009
 using this loop tactic right I 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.570
 I 'll go forward and I'll show you 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:26.380
 now a tactic of the other of June in 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.640
 bonn cool, this time it's going to be 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.640
 foo fighters 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.799
 here is just to show even some 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.799
 scenes and attacking and destroying some 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.260
 here an example of zoom embu breaks the 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.260
 fighter 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.710
 is that it did not zoom well but I was 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.820
 actually much faster than 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.550
 opponent is this is one of the benefits of 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:07.270
 advantages overturning the other was head-on 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:10.180
 critical me is almost played in a good 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:14.280
 my glue here and still get another 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.280
 front with a goal of mine and another in the front 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:37.240
 but the sony legend but another was not much 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.270
 well an example of that in with five more 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.060
 I used the attitude of speed 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.240
 how fighter an airplane is like a 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.790
 very strong and continuous structure. 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.669
 also strong those strategies that 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.290
 make the ideal positions good is not there 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.990
 tip and until the next 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.990
 people are importing in brazil or
