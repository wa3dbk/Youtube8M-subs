00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
chance for a direct hit which is the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.010 
chance for a direct hit which is the
double<00:04:27.330> damage<00:04:27.630> crit

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.059 
double damage crit
hit<00:04:28.229> so<00:04:28.949> dart<00:04:29.729> fader<00:04:30.030> on<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:30.810> shuttle

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
hit so dart fader on this shuttle

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.770 
hit so dart fader on this shuttle
amazing<00:04:32.069> dart<00:04:32.490> fader<00:04:32.729> on<00:04:32.910> any<00:04:33.120> ship<00:04:33.569> with<00:04:33.750> a

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
amazing dart fader on any ship with a

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.379 
amazing dart fader on any ship with a
crew<00:04:33.840> slot<00:04:34.319> is<00:04:34.800> amazing<00:04:35.400> but<00:04:35.550> most

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
crew slot is amazing but most

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.730 
crew slot is amazing but most
specifically<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.080> shuttle<00:04:37.440> because<00:04:37.530> the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
specifically the shuttle because the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.249 
specifically the shuttle because the
shuttle<00:04:38.039> has<00:04:38.159> a<00:04:38.190> lot<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.430> hit<00:04:38.639> points<00:04:38.669> so<00:04:39.259> you

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
shuttle has a lot of hit points so you

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.279 
shuttle has a lot of hit points so you
can<00:04:40.470> use<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.949> ability<00:04:41.099> a<00:04:41.610> lot<00:04:41.849> of<00:04:42.360> times<00:04:42.659> now

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
can use that ability a lot of times now

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.550 
can use that ability a lot of times now
the<00:04:43.770> dart<00:04:44.009> fader<00:04:44.250> card<00:04:44.580> is<00:04:44.940> going<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.780> make<00:04:46.349> it

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
the dart fader card is going to make it

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.100 
the dart fader card is going to make it
a<00:04:46.680> really<00:04:46.979> juicy<00:04:47.370> target<00:04:47.819> so<00:04:48.419> you<00:04:48.509> got<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.960> make

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
a really juicy target so you got to make

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.640 
a really juicy target so you got to make
sure<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:51.389> shuttle<00:04:51.750> has<00:04:51.870> at<00:04:51.990> least<00:04:52.110> some

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
sure that the shuttle has at least some

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.430 
sure that the shuttle has at least some
protection<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.699> do<00:04:53.819> that<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.419> take<00:04:54.449> the

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
protection and to do that you take the

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.559 
protection and to do that you take the
rebel<00:04:55.830> captive<00:04:56.340> let's<00:04:56.849> see<00:04:57.030> if<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.210> wants<00:04:57.449> to

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
rebel captive let's see if it wants to

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.899 
rebel captive let's see if it wants to
focus<00:04:58.080> there<00:04:58.409> we<00:04:58.530> go<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:59.129> rebel<00:04:59.430> captive<00:04:59.789> is

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
focus there we go the rebel captive is

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.029 
focus there we go the rebel captive is
an<00:04:59.970> imperial<00:05:00.419> only<00:05:00.690> card<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.139> says<00:05:01.409> once<00:05:01.770> per

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
round the first ship that éclairs you as

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.140 
round the first ship that éclairs you as
the<00:05:04.349> target<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.800> an<00:05:04.889> attack<00:05:05.150> immediately

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
the target of an attack immediately

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.089 
the target of an attack immediately
receives<00:05:06.569> one<00:05:06.840> stressed<00:05:07.199> out<00:05:07.380> can<00:05:07.560> three

points<00:05:08.490> as<00:05:08.639> well<00:05:09.210> as<00:05:09.270> dart<00:05:09.720> failure<00:05:10.110> so<00:05:11.210> that

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
points as well as dart failure so that

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.089 
points as well as dart failure so that

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.749 
shell you want to get it off the board
really<00:05:20.880> quickly<00:05:21.419> but<00:05:22.139> it's<00:05:22.289> going<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:22.620> be<00:05:22.830> well

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
really quickly but it's going to be well

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.089 
really quickly but it's going to be well
let's<00:05:24.330> keep<00:05:24.479> it<00:05:24.630> in<00:05:24.750> flavor<00:05:25.050> it's<00:05:25.710> going<00:05:25.949> to<00:05:26.009> be

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
let's keep it in flavor it's going to be

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.830 
let's keep it in flavor it's going to be
a<00:05:26.129> stressful<00:05:26.580> endeavor<00:05:27.090> because<00:05:27.629> there's<00:05:27.780> a

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
a stressful endeavor because there's a

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.559 
a stressful endeavor because there's a
rebel<00:05:27.990> captain<00:05:28.469> on<00:05:28.590> board<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:30.030> every<00:05:30.270> time

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
rebel captain on board so every time

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.649 
rebel captain on board so every time
your<00:05:31.199> ship<00:05:31.530> attacks<00:05:31.949> this<00:05:32.159> one<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:33.120> almost

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
your ship attacks this one you almost

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.510 
your ship attacks this one you almost
guarantee<00:05:34.229> he<00:05:34.469> can't<00:05:34.710> attack<00:05:35.039> you<00:05:35.250> another

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
guarantee he can't attack you another

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.520 
guarantee he can't attack you another
the<00:05:36.360> second<00:05:36.750> time<00:05:36.900> because<00:05:37.169> he<00:05:37.289> can't

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
the second time because he can't

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.580 
the second time because he can't
Corrigan<00:05:37.979> turn<00:05:38.190> because<00:05:38.460> he<00:05:38.550> has<00:05:38.699> that<00:05:38.880> stress

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
Corrigan turn because he has that stress

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.490 
Corrigan turn because he has that stress
so<00:05:40.590> yeah<00:05:40.770> a<00:05:40.800> great<00:05:41.280> defensive<00:05:42.030> card<00:05:42.500> coupled

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
so yeah a great defensive card coupled

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.800 
so yeah a great defensive card coupled
with<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.770> fact<00:05:43.800> that<00:05:44.370> you<00:05:44.909> want<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.389> kill<00:05:45.630> the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
with the fact that you want to kill the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.350 
with the fact that you want to kill the
shuttle<00:05:46.199> but<00:05:46.650> really<00:05:47.279> you<00:05:47.370> can't<00:05:47.699> that<00:05:48.090> easy

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
shuttle but really you can't that easy

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.019 
shuttle but really you can't that easy
because<00:05:49.139> you<00:05:49.319> have<00:05:49.469> to<00:05:49.590> be<00:05:49.710> invest<00:05:50.009> a<00:05:50.190> lot<00:05:50.460> you

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
because you have to be invest a lot you

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.490 
because you have to be invest a lot you
can<00:05:51.210> you're<00:05:51.659> going<00:05:51.779> to<00:05:51.900> have<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.110> take<00:05:52.229> up<00:05:52.409> a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
when I hated it when it came across me

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.860 
when I hated it when it came across me
in<00:06:03.930> a<00:06:04.050> tournament<00:06:04.370> but<00:06:05.370> it<00:06:06.090> gave<00:06:06.330> me<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.659> sort
