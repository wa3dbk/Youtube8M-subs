00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
wave 30 which was a massively awesome

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.290 
wave 30 which was a massively awesome
juggernaut<00:00:22.619> round<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.010> then<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.250> 31<00:00:23.730> we

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.120 
juggernaut round and then with 31 we
made<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.689> wave<00:00:24.869> 31<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.500> was<00:00:25.619> pretty<00:00:25.830> epic

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
made it to wave 31 it was pretty epic

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.460 
made it to wave 31 it was pretty epic
our<00:00:26.609> actual<00:00:27.150> leaderboard<00:00:27.630> tours<00:00:27.869> are<00:00:28.080> pretty

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
our actual leaderboard tours are pretty

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
our actual leaderboard tours are pretty
insane<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.460> map<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.269> cannot

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
insane for this map I actually cannot

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.440 
insane for this map I actually cannot
believe<00:00:30.810> myself<00:00:31.820> like<00:00:32.820> when<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.059> both<00:00:33.270> saw

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
believe myself like when we both saw

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.000 
believe myself like when we both saw
leader<00:00:33.660> board<00:00:33.840> scores<00:00:34.020> were<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.320> holy<00:00:34.530> crap

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
leader board scores were like holy crap

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.520 
leader board scores were like holy crap
really<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:35.850> way<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.030> 30<00:00:36.180> 31<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.440> I'm

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
really just for way of 30 31 and so I'm

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
really just for way of 30 31 and so I'm
thinking<00:00:37.890> actually<00:00:38.070> about<00:00:38.969> bringing<00:00:39.329> back

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
thinking actually about bringing back

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.560 
thinking actually about bringing back
the<00:00:39.750> black<00:00:40.440> ops<00:00:40.649> zombies<00:00:41.129> wave<00:00:41.460> 30<00:00:42.090> plus

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the black ops zombies wave 30 plus

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
the black ops zombies wave 30 plus
montage<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.710> i'm<00:00:43.980> thinking<00:00:44.219> i<00:00:44.309> could

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
montage because i'm thinking i could

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.770 
montage because i'm thinking i could
probably<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:45.059> survival<00:00:45.420> mode<00:00:45.570> for

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
probably do that for survival mode for

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
probably do that for survival mode for
mono<00:00:45.930> 43<00:00:46.379> because<00:00:46.789> myself<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> 6<00:00:48.090> saying<00:00:48.300> are

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
mono 43 because myself in a 6 saying are

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.779 
mono 43 because myself in a 6 saying are
pretty<00:00:48.989> much<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.710> beast<00:00:50.250> mode<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.730> all

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
pretty much going beast mode and all

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.100 
pretty much going beast mode and all
these<00:00:50.969> maps<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.510> getting<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:51.930> good

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
these maps and getting really good

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.740 
these maps and getting really good
scores<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.500> them<00:00:53.059> now<00:00:54.059> obviously<00:00:54.210> we'd<00:00:54.660> have

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
scores on them now obviously we'd have

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
scores on them now obviously we'd have
to<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.899> lucky<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.530> those<00:00:55.649> scores

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
to get lucky and get to those scores

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.189 
to get lucky and get to those scores
again<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> hopefully<00:00:57.449> even<00:00:57.719> beat<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
again and hopefully even beat them a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.630 
again and hopefully even beat them a
little<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.949> i<00:00:59.039> wasn't<00:00:59.219> recording

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
little more because i wasn't recording

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310 
little more because i wasn't recording
for<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.820> those<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.300> yeah<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.079> pretty<00:01:01.199> much

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
for all those but yeah it's pretty much

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200 
for all those but yeah it's pretty much
it<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.920> i'm<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:02.969> into

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
get an extra bonus like 500 and then if

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.560 
get an extra bonus like 500 and then if
you<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.490> again<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> thousand<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you do it again you like a thousand and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.719 
you do it again you like a thousand and
then<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.439> don't<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.579> lot

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
then I really don't do it I do it a lot

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.219 
then I really don't do it I do it a lot
but<00:02:00.180> yeah<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> usually<00:02:00.600> can't<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
but yeah I usually can't go to the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.350 
but yeah I usually can't go to the
thousand<00:02:01.710> point<00:02:01.920> bonus<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:03.299> really

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
thousand point bonus so I don't really

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.639 
thousand point bonus so I don't really
know<00:02:03.570> what's<00:02:03.719> after<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.079> would<00:02:04.439> guess

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
know what's after that I would guess

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.230 
know what's after that I would guess
1500<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:05.549> two<00:02:05.670> thousand<00:02:06.030> I'm<00:02:06.090> just

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
1500 and then two thousand I'm just

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.949 
1500 and then two thousand I'm just
assuming<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:06.810> go<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.020> by<00:02:07.140> 100<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.619> each<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
assuming they go up by 100 of each so I

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.940 
assuming they go up by 100 of each so I
really<00:02:09.959> don't<00:02:10.080> know<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.410> I'm<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
really don't know so I'm for the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.949 
really don't know so I'm for the
juggernaut<00:02:11.459> round<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.840> is

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
juggernaut round what you want to do is

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.550 
juggernaut round what you want to do is
usually<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.260> buy

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
usually just buy

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.500 
usually just buy
predator<00:02:13.980> missile<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.489> then<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.420> your

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
predator missile and then you and your

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.760 
predator missile and then you and your
team<00:02:15.660> meant<00:02:15.810> both<00:02:15.900> by<00:02:16.110> /<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.440> muzzle<00:02:16.739> and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
team meant both by / to the muzzle and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.130 
team meant both by / to the muzzle and
you<00:02:16.920> both<00:02:17.099> use<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.790> different<00:02:18.750> jug<00:02:18.959> and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
you both use it on a different jug and

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.690 
you both use it on a different jug and
if<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.709> could<00:02:19.830> try<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.099> get<00:02:20.220> them<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.520> both

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
if you could try and get them like both

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.010 
if you could try and get them like both
together<00:02:20.849> all<00:02:21.239> through<00:02:21.420> them<00:02:21.540> together<00:02:21.660> and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
together all through them together and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.210 
together all through them together and
like<00:02:22.260> take<00:02:22.440> them<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.650> with<00:02:22.770> one<00:02:22.890> part<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
like take them out with one part of the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.800 
like take them out with one part of the
missile<00:02:23.459> that'd<00:02:23.880> be<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.970> really<00:02:24.180> keen<00:02:24.569> idea

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
missile that'd be a really keen idea

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.229 
missile that'd be a really keen idea
otherwise<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.010> came<00:02:26.190> there<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.120> could

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
otherwise it came there but you could

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.570 
otherwise it came there but you could
also<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.860> first<00:02:28.860> your<00:02:29.130> team<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.430> uses

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
also just like first your team that uses

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.800 
also just like first your team that uses
one<00:02:29.819> takes<00:02:30.090> one<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.330> them<00:02:30.420> out<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.780> year

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
one takes one of them out in a year

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.240 
one takes one of them out in a year
other<00:02:31.260> team<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.530> use<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.890> old<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.099> takes

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
other team that use of the old one takes

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.100 
other team that use of the old one takes
second<00:02:32.459> one<00:02:32.550> out<00:02:32.640> any<00:02:33.420> boats<00:02:33.599> use<00:02:33.870> teamwork

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
second one out any boats use teamwork

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.960 
second one out any boats use teamwork
take<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> third<00:02:34.739> one<00:02:34.920> out<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.730> best<00:02:35.910> way

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
take the third one out and the best way

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.670 
take the third one out and the best way
obviously<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.630> deal<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:36.870> juggernaut<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.470> to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
obviously the deal with juggernaut is to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.530 
obviously the deal with juggernaut is to
just<00:02:37.920> shoot<00:02:38.220> their<00:02:38.519> head<00:02:38.819> obviously<00:02:39.420> that's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
just shoot their head obviously that's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.479 
just shoot their head obviously that's
the<00:02:39.660> best<00:02:39.840> way<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.050> kill<00:02:40.230> them<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:41.099> head<00:02:41.280> shot

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
the best way to kill them just head shot

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.750 
the best way to kill them just head shot
them<00:02:42.349> start<00:02:43.349> at<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> cough<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:44.130> takes<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.489> lot

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
them start at the cough it takes a lot

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.449 
them start at the cough it takes a lot
in<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.030> high<00:02:45.300> rounds<00:02:45.600> like<00:02:45.720> 1331<00:02:46.200> or<00:02:46.500> anything

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
in the high rounds like 1331 or anything

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.199 
in the high rounds like 1331 or anything
above<00:02:47.670> 30<00:02:47.850> really<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:49.170> once<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.040> do<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.310> he

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
above 30 really but once you do it he

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.789 
above 30 really but once you do it he
goes<00:02:51.360> down<00:02:51.510> pretty<00:02:51.750> easily<00:02:51.989> he<00:02:52.380> goes<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.769> I

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
goes down pretty easily he goes in I

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.050 
goes down pretty easily he goes in I
mean<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.160> much<00:02:53.310> faster<00:02:53.489> than<00:02:53.730> shooting<00:02:53.910> him

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
mean it's much faster than shooting him

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.759 
mean it's much faster than shooting him
like<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.870> crotch<00:02:55.290> or<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> know

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
like in the in the crotch or you know

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.680 
like in the in the crotch or you know
the<00:02:55.860> chest<00:02:56.069> or<00:02:56.130> anything<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.910> also<00:02:57.450> another
