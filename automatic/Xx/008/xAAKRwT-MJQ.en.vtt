00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
after 5am so i think i'll probably be

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
after 5am so i think i'll probably be
getting<00:01:36.000> up<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.689> four<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.409> chugging

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
getting up at like four and chugging

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
getting up at like four and chugging
down<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.250> bunch<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.670> water<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.210> eating

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
down a bunch of water and eating

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.289 
down a bunch of water and eating
something<00:01:40.009> because<00:01:41.009> i<00:01:41.549> don't<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:42.149> i'll<00:01:42.270> be

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
something because i don't think i'll be

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.980 
something because i don't think i'll be
able<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.840> go<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.619> long<00:01:43.890> without<00:01:44.720> drinking<00:01:45.720> at

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
able to go that long without drinking at

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.100 
able to go that long without drinking at
least<00:01:46.229> drinking<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.310> mean<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.240> just

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
least drinking because I mean I I just

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.600 
least drinking because I mean I I just
drank<00:01:49.320> water<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:49.799> day<00:01:49.829> long<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.189> would<00:01:50.490> be

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
drank water all day long that would be

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.209 
drank water all day long that would be
really<00:01:50.909> hard<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> not<00:01:51.570> drink<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.950> amount

really hard to not drink for that amount

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.340 
really hard to not drink for that amount
of<00:01:53.340> time<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.210> I'll<00:01:54.329> probably<00:01:54.450> wake<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.079> four

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
