DJI<00:02:55.680> has<00:02:56.100> given<00:02:56.820> us<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.030> solution<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:58.070> and

DJI has given us a solution to that and
it<00:02:59.850> enables<00:03:00.780> us<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.020> then<00:03:01.470> take<00:03:01.770> HD<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.490> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
it enables us to then take HD out of the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.699 
it enables us to then take HD out of the

receiver<00:03:07.860> side<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> compact<00:03:08.910> unit

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
receiver side we have a compact unit

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.650 
receiver side we have a compact unit
with<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> built<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.590> battery<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.910> turns<00:03:12.209> on<00:03:12.420> much

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
the same as our phantom 2 so you're

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.260 
the same as our phantom 2 so you're
going<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.280> go<00:03:14.400> ahead<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.760> push<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.060> button

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
going to go ahead and push that button

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.850 
going to go ahead and push that button
once<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.959> we'll<00:03:16.110> get<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.260> battery<00:03:16.620> status

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
once and we'll get a battery status

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.770 
once and we'll get a battery status
indication<00:03:17.519> we<00:03:17.640> push<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.940> again<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.420> hold<00:03:18.600> it

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
indication we push it again and hold it

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.330 
indication we push it again and hold it
and<00:03:18.900> we'll<00:03:19.170> go<00:03:19.470> ahead<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.860> light<00:03:20.010> up<00:03:20.130> all<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
and we'll go ahead and light up all the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.060 
and we'll go ahead and light up all the
lights<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.820> unit<00:03:21.060> will<00:03:21.180> turn<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.950> when<00:03:22.950> we

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
lights and the unit will turn on when we

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.410 
lights and the unit will turn on when we
turn<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.550> unit<00:03:23.880> we'll<00:03:23.970> obviously

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
turn on that unit we'll obviously

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
battery connector that we can hook up so

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.280 
battery connector that we can hook up so
once<00:04:40.970> we<00:04:41.090> power<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.690> give<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:41.840> canvas

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
once we power it and give it canvas

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.070 
once we power it and give it canvas
information<00:04:43.120> we<00:04:44.120> then<00:04:44.360> are<00:04:44.390> going<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.660> hook<00:04:44.870> up

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
picking the right HDMI cable we go ahead

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:13.240 
picking the right HDMI cable we go ahead
and<00:05:06.320> plug<00:05:06.560> that<00:05:06.590> into<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:11.600> transmitter<00:05:12.250> this

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
and plug that into the transmitter this

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.860 
and plug that into the transmitter this
will<00:05:13.460> then<00:05:13.610> go<00:05:13.790> and<00:05:13.940> hook<00:05:14.060> down<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:14.510> camera

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
will then go and hook down to the camera

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.060 
will then go and hook down to the camera
and<00:05:15.140> give<00:05:15.440> us<00:05:15.530> our<00:05:15.680> video<00:05:16.220> feed<00:05:17.890> one<00:05:18.890> of<00:05:19.010> the

for receivers and other equipment they

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.070 
for receivers and other equipment they
might<00:06:01.820> have<00:06:01.970> onboard<00:06:02.390> that<00:06:02.419> we<00:06:02.570> normally<00:06:02.690> fly

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
might have onboard that we normally fly

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.210

with<00:06:04.510> this<00:06:05.510> feature<00:06:05.780> makes<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.620> system<00:06:06.830> much

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
with this feature makes the system much

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.840 
with this feature makes the system much
more<00:06:07.400> streamlined<00:06:07.669> and<00:06:08.210> clean<00:06:08.630> it<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:10.160> gets

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
more streamlined and clean it it gets

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.730 
more streamlined and clean it it gets
rid<00:06:11.150> of<00:06:11.180> any<00:06:11.479> kind<00:06:11.780> of<00:06:11.960> issue<00:06:12.140> or<00:06:12.289> problem<00:06:12.440> you

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
rid of any kind of issue or problem you

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.130 
rid of any kind of issue or problem you
might<00:06:12.979> find<00:06:13.280> with<00:06:13.669> RF<00:06:14.150> interference<00:06:14.360> going<00:06:14.990> on

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
might find with RF interference going on

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.540 
might find with RF interference going on
on<00:06:15.289> the<00:06:15.380> aircraft<00:06:15.830> or<00:06:15.979> that<00:06:16.070> question<00:06:16.430> that

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
on the aircraft or that question that

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.090 
on the aircraft or that question that
all<00:06:16.700> of<00:06:16.789> us

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
all of us

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.800 
all of us
in<00:06:17.430> our<00:06:17.520> head<00:06:17.760> you<00:06:17.970> know<00:06:18.090> is<00:06:18.300> this<00:06:18.510> device

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
in our head you know is this device

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.100 
in our head you know is this device
going<00:06:19.080> to<00:06:19.140> interfere<00:06:19.470> with<00:06:19.620> that<00:06:19.680> device<00:06:20.070> so

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
going to interfere with that device so

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.170 
going to interfere with that device so
streamlining<00:06:22.110> down<00:06:22.350> to<00:06:22.530> one<00:06:22.680> device<00:06:23.010> is<00:06:23.340> a

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
streamlining down to one device is a

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.900 
streamlining down to one device is a
huge<00:06:24.780> leap<00:06:24.960> forward<00:06:25.260> and<00:06:25.710> our<00:06:26.460> ability<00:06:26.880> to

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
huge leap forward and our ability to

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.420 
huge leap forward and our ability to
