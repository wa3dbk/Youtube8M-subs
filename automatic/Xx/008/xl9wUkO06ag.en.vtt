best for me I think was elusive I think
was<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.430> loser<00:01:21.700> program<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.500> because<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:24.310> was

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
was a loser program and because it was

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.539 
was a loser program and because it was
digital<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.689> it<00:01:26.049> was<00:01:26.200> something<00:01:26.950> small<00:01:27.520> you

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
digital and it was something small you

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.580 
digital and it was something small you
can<00:01:27.820> carry<00:01:28.000> around<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:29.049> weight<00:01:29.200> watchers

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
can carry around the weight watchers

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.459 
can carry around the weight watchers
book<00:01:29.859> I<00:01:30.250> don't<00:01:31.179> like<00:01:31.329> them<00:01:31.539> much<00:01:31.600> because<00:01:32.259> you

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
book I don't like them much because you
