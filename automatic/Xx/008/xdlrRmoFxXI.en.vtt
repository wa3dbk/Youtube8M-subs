00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.129
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.950
 welcome to this new video in the 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.589
 which one I'm going to show you how you can remove 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.530
 advertising and what has been 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:14.769
 the internet pages in general what 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.420
 What YouTube is the ads and 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.210
 also the commercial ones that then 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.060
 appear here and also on other pages 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.939
 like for example mediafire all this 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.769
 type of ads that you can put here 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.910
 which is sometimes a bit annoying 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.009
 because what you want is 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.100
 would start a video quickly and then you 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.530
 this appears and you have to wait 5 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.199
 Annoying seconds 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.019
 and so to play the video that you want 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.230
 see it the truth is that this is very 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.530
 annoying to me the truth I do not like for 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.120
 nothing but good I bring you here a 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.850
 small video 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.600
 can solve this kind of problem 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.340
 If you do not like advertising 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.030
 what we are going to use is a 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.159
 application a google extension 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.350
 chrome I think it's also for 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.690
 mozilla firefox so then those that 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.259
 they have mozilla firefox they are going to 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.840
 complements and there look for the extension 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.270
 that I 'm going to show you next 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.630
 good in case of google chrome we're going 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.350
 to this part of here 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.640
 is the box of options 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.490
 we go to options and look for the option 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.490
 that says configuration 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 we click there and we go to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.350
 where it says extensions in extensions 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.869
 I can appear good because the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.460
 extensions obviously we have 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.360
 we simply give it here where it says 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:54.360
 get more extensions and we will open 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 google chrome web store page 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.590
 google chrome how to call it and good 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.450
 Well here is a search engine 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.240
 obviously applications extensions 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.330
 as you want to call it and here we are going to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.940
 look for the next one for the next 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.940
 extension is called a blog 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.400
 we search 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:25.480
 and we are going to this one 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.980
 that says simply to white that is the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.690
 which has five stars is very 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.870
 important because this one is 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.270
 It is the plus but it is not so good 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.310
 how is it 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.840
 and apart as it says here that it is the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.629
 most popular 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.540
 and process obviously obviously simply 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.840
 we give here where it says free 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.829
 and we give it to us this window and 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.829
 we give in add 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.860
 if I 'm not going to start downloading 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.750
 and it is added automatically without need 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.970
 to restart the browser 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.910
 here it says that it was already installed 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.450
 and here we already opened a small icon in 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.530
 way of road sign with one hand 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.980
 with a hand that like stop but 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.240
 well we can close this and here 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:26.290
 we see that the blog is already enabled 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.350
 and well, these ads 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.910
 if we update here 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.910
 well we update here 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.980
 the ads are gone 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.990
 as you could see the ads have been 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.650
 gone here there's nothing there is nothing and 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.069
 we update the page 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.380
 main of youtube 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.710
 there is nothing 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.700
 neither 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.370
 that's the way with any page 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.530
 also for saying you want 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.360
 download something 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.360
 and so 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.580
 appears there is a lot of advertising or 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.250
 pop-ups and even also 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.250
 which are the ones that you click on a 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.710
 link and they suddenly open a page 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.660
 that you do not want that is for this too 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.630
 serves this extension of google chrome 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.850
 that as I said before, 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.180
 is for mozilla firefox so they can 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.820
 try it with your favorite browser 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.590
 and well, this is today's video 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.870
