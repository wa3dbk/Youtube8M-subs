thought<00:02:14.400> about<00:02:14.459> today's<00:02:14.940> demonstration<00:02:15.560> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
thought about today's demonstration it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.650 
thought about today's demonstration it
was<00:02:16.709> way<00:02:17.370> more<00:02:17.400> realistic<00:02:17.910> than<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.360> thought<00:02:18.599> it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
was way more realistic than I thought it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.170 
was way more realistic than I thought it
would<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.380> was<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.890> mean<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.670> didn't<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.090> think

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
would be it was I mean I didn't I think

would be it was I mean I didn't I think
the<00:02:21.569> entire<00:02:21.870> time<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.170> would<00:02:22.410> know<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.160> was

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the entire time I would know that it was

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.780 
the entire time I would know that it was
fake<00:02:23.549> but<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.180> don't<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.720> really<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.790> don't

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
