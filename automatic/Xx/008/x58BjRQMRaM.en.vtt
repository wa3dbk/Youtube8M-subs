do the unboxing of this wireless
ethernet<00:00:06.779> adapter<00:00:07.319> from<00:00:08.069> issues<00:00:08.610> known<00:00:09.059> as

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
ethernet adapter from issues known as

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.100 
ethernet adapter from issues known as
the<00:00:09.420> EA<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.019> 66<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.429> looks<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:12.110> modern

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
the EA and 66 and it looks like modern

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.450 
the EA and 66 and it looks like modern
Brahman<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.210> it<00:00:15.210> has<00:00:15.420> actually<00:00:15.660> three<00:00:16.109> modes

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
Brahman and it has actually three modes

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.849 
Brahman and it has actually three modes
you<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.699> use<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.660> access<00:00:19.289> point<00:00:19.560> as<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
you can use it like a access point as a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.400 
you can use it like a access point as a
Ethernet<00:00:20.670> adapter<00:00:21.180> or<00:00:21.390> just<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> normal

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
Ethernet adapter or just like a normal

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.460 
Ethernet adapter or just like a normal
repeater<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.300> work<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.779> both<00:00:24.810> bands

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
repeater and this can work in both bands

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.170 
repeater and this can work in both bands
that's<00:00:25.800> two<00:00:26.010> point<00:00:26.250> four<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.640> five<00:00:26.970> minutes

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
that's two point four and five minutes

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.740 
that's two point four and five minutes
but<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.720> not<00:00:27.930> concurrent<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:30.269> supports

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
but it's not concurrent and it supports

I<00:01:36.420> said<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:36.960> use<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.380> product<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:38.310> three

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
I said we can use this product in three

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
I said we can use this product in three
different<00:01:39.030> modes<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.810> first<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
different modes the first one is the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.130 
different modes the first one is the
access<00:01:40.920> point<00:01:41.490> mode<00:01:41.579> wait<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.540> example<00:01:42.990> let's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
access point mode wait for example let's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.560 
access point mode wait for example let's
say<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:44.030> what<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.180> say<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
say you just have your what do you say a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.200 
say you just have your what do you say a
wireless<00:01:46.140> router<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.220> standard<00:01:47.729> router<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
wireless router or a standard router you

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.539 
wireless router or a standard router you
can<00:01:48.240> connect<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:50.009> thereby<00:01:50.369> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
can connect to this and that thereby you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.910 
can connect to this and that thereby you
can<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> Wi-Fi<00:01:51.540> connection<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.680> also

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
can get a Wi-Fi connection you can also

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.179 
can get a Wi-Fi connection you can also
use<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> Ethernet<00:01:54.270> adapter<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.189> in

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
use it like a Ethernet adapter and in

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.370 
use it like a Ethernet adapter and in
this<00:01:56.399> mode<00:01:56.579> let's<00:01:56.820> assume<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.170> an

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
this mode let's assume that you have an

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.770 
this mode let's assume that you have an
old<00:01:58.680> computer<00:01:58.950> which<00:01:59.700> does<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.329> Wi-Fi

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
old computer which does not have Wi-Fi

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.660 
old computer which does not have Wi-Fi
and<00:02:01.020> now<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.560> want<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> ship<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.219> computer<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and now you want to ship that computer a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.609 
and now you want to ship that computer a
different<00:02:03.000> place<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.869> different

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
different place and in that different
