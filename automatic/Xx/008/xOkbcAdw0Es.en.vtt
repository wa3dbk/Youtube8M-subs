okay<00:00:00.930> in<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.110> segment<00:00:01.319> we<00:00:01.589> recover

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
okay in this segment we recover

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.249 
okay in this segment we recover
compressing<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.850> caliper<00:00:03.060> and<00:00:03.750> what<00:00:04.080> do<00:00:04.140> I'm

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
compressing the caliper and what do I'm

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.360 
compressing the caliper and what do I'm
referring<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.730> caliper<00:00:06.950> I'll<00:00:07.950> see<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.280> on

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
referring to is a caliper I'll see it on

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.339 
referring to is a caliper I'll see it on
there<00:00:08.550> as<00:00:08.670> your<00:00:09.360> brake<00:00:09.570> pads<00:00:09.780> are<00:00:10.050> wearing

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
there as your brake pads are wearing

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.129 
there as your brake pads are wearing
down<00:00:10.610> this<00:00:11.610> caliper<00:00:12.090> piston<00:00:12.269> has<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.019> keep

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
down this caliper piston has to keep

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.860 
down this caliper piston has to keep
traveling<00:00:13.349> out<00:00:13.650> further<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.130> further<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
traveling out further and further and

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.090 
traveling out further and further and
when<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:15.960> let<00:00:16.139> off<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.410> brake<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.770> caliper

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
when you let off the brake the caliper

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.920 
when you let off the brake the caliper
doesn't<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.730> piston<00:00:18.090> doesn't<00:00:18.390> come<00:00:18.510> back<00:00:18.660> in

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
doesn't the piston doesn't come back in

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.900 
doesn't the piston doesn't come back in
it<00:00:19.350> stays<00:00:19.740> roughly<00:00:20.279> right<00:00:20.550> there<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.850> just

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it stays roughly right there it just

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.490 
it stays roughly right there it just
doesn't<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.449> pressure<00:00:21.750> against<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
doesn't have pressure against it and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.590 
doesn't have pressure against it and
that<00:00:23.279> ensures<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.029> brake<00:00:24.180> pads<00:00:24.449> are

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
that ensures that the brake pads are

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.359 
that ensures that the brake pads are
right<00:00:24.750> there<00:00:24.930> tight<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> good

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
right there tight so you get a good

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.339 
right there tight so you get a good
swift<00:00:26.789> clean<00:00:27.269> braking<00:00:27.689> action<00:00:27.869> every<00:00:28.199> time

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
swift clean braking action every time

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.560 
swift clean braking action every time
you<00:00:28.439> apply<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> brakes<00:00:29.060> but<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.390> brake

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
you apply the brakes but as the brake

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.110 
you apply the brakes but as the brake
pads<00:00:30.599> wear<00:00:30.960> down<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.800> caliper<00:00:32.099> extends<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
pads wear down and a caliper extends the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.459 
pads wear down and a caliper extends the
piston<00:00:33.510> extends<00:00:33.840> further<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.320> further

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
piston extends further and further

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.350 
piston extends further and further
outward<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.399> order<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:35.910> room<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
outward in order to have room for the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660 
outward in order to have room for the
new<00:00:36.570> pass<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.350> need<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> compress<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.190> piston

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
new pass we need to compress this piston

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.229 
new pass we need to compress this piston
back<00:00:38.820> into<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> caliper<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:41.730> using<00:00:41.969> just

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
back into the caliper I like using just

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.380 
back into the caliper I like using just
a<00:00:42.360> large<00:00:42.840> pair<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> pliers<00:00:43.789> you<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.820> use<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> C

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
a large pair of pliers you can use a C

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.220 
a large pair of pliers you can use a C
clamp<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.160> works<00:00:47.160> real<00:00:47.460> well<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:48.510> good<00:00:49.020> way<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
clamp that works real well a good way to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.720 
clamp that works real well a good way to
compress<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.190> take<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> old

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
compress it if you take one of the old

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.930 
compress it if you take one of the old
pads<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:53.010> we'll<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.460> lay<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.850> there

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
pads and we'll just lay it in there

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.180 
pads and we'll just lay it in there
across<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> piston<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.739> gives<00:00:55.949> us<00:00:56.039> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
across the piston and that gives us a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.299 
across the piston and that gives us a
large<00:00:56.460> surface<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:58.020> push<00:00:58.260> against<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
large surface to push against and it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.250 
large surface to push against and it
also<00:00:59.460> helps<00:00:59.910> ensure<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.960> pressure

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
also helps ensure that the pressure

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.170 
also helps ensure that the pressure
we're<00:01:01.469> using<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.890> push<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.399> applied<00:01:02.940> evenly

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
we're using to push it is applied evenly

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.450 
we're using to push it is applied evenly
across<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.809> piston<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> piston<00:01:05.189> doesn't

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
across the piston so the piston doesn't

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.730 
across the piston so the piston doesn't
want<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> bind<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.659> we're<00:01:06.840> compressing<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
want to bind that we're compressing it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440 
want to bind that we're compressing it
back<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> essentially<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.210> we're<00:01:09.330> going

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
back in and essentially what we're going

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
back in and essentially what we're going
to<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.200> compress<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.920> we're

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
to do when we compress this in we're

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
to do when we compress this in we're
pushing<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.790> fluid<00:01:11.970> back<00:01:12.360> through<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> brake

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
pushing the fluid back through the brake

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.950 
pushing the fluid back through the brake
line<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.770> into<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.310> master<00:01:14.670> cylinder

line and back into the master cylinder

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
line and back into the master cylinder
now<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.520> lot<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> times<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.150> your

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
now a lot of times when you have your

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
now a lot of times when you have your
car<00:01:18.509> serviced<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.110> people<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.710> checking

this<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.400> happy<00:01:41.759> you'll<00:01:42.030> know

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
this so if you see is happy you'll know

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
this so if you see is happy you'll know
why<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> happened<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> understand<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.579> it's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
why I happened to understand and it's

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.160 
why I happened to understand and it's
just<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> fact<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.840> somebody's

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
just because the fact that somebody's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.859 
just because the fact that somebody's
topped<00:01:46.409> off<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.820> master<00:01:47.820> cylinder<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.329> your

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
topped off your master cylinder if your

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.010 
topped off your master cylinder if your
master<00:01:49.110> cylinder<00:01:49.470> level<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> low<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.869> not

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
master cylinder level is low but not

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.410 
master cylinder level is low but not
below<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.560> add<00:01:52.649> line<00:01:52.890> never<00:01:53.369> add<00:01:53.640> brake<00:01:54.030> fluid

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
below the add line never add brake fluid

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
below the add line never add brake fluid
that's<00:01:54.840> usually<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.259> an<00:01:55.530> indication<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that's usually just an indication that

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
that's usually just an indication that
your<00:01:56.759> brake<00:01:56.909> pads<00:01:57.090> are<00:01:57.299> getting<00:01:57.570> worn<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
your brake pads are getting worn and the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.069 
your brake pads are getting worn and the
Pistons<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.250> traveled<00:01:59.670> outward<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.240> your

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
Pistons have traveled outward and your

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.810 
Pistons have traveled outward and your
brake<00:02:01.259> fluid<00:02:01.290> isn't<00:02:01.799> necessarily<00:02:02.250> leaking

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
brake fluid isn't necessarily leaking

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.940 
brake fluid isn't necessarily leaking
it's<00:02:03.000> being<00:02:03.659> held<00:02:03.930> down<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.530> caliper

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
it's being held down here in the caliper

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.789 
it's being held down here in the caliper
right<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:05.280> instead<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> reservoir

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.259 

so<00:02:11.799> I'll<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:12.010> get<00:02:12.129> my<00:02:12.250> plier<00:02:12.519> setup<00:02:13.060> to

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
so I'll just get my plier setup to

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.039 
so I'll just get my plier setup to
adjust<00:02:13.659> for<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:15.239> large<00:02:16.239> enough<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.540> get<00:02:16.720> around

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
adjust for a large enough to get around

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.210 
adjust for a large enough to get around
