00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.560
 frank from android next at mwc 2014 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.900
 we're on the stand of that, though 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.750
 Chinese manufacturer shows here 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.540
 current flagship the n1 yes that is 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.130
 a big device has a 50 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.320
 inches in the diagonal measure that 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.190
 full hd display speak the resolution is 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.130
 1920 x 1080 we have 2 gb ram in here 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.579
 built 16 or 32 gigabytes internal 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.890
 Storage 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.430
 as an operating system android comes to 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.190
 use in the version 4.2 the ua of 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.140
 otto is called karla os, but there is 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.450
 as you may have is also a 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.280
 Variation on the saline john j already 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.890
 preinstalled is such a kind of special 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.830
 edition as processor comes here 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.420
 snapdragon 600 for use with 1 7 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.190
 gigahertz is not the latest model 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.860
 but you see that everything is going well 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.869
 fluently yes I already said that is 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.780
 a relatively large device also weighs 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.750
 according to 213 grams but also has 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.579
 some interesting features we like that 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.250
 not yet seen with other devices 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.299
 For one, this is a capacitive one 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.240
 back 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.700
 that means here you can with your finger 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.920
 also on it around vision and accordingly 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.450
 so move the homescreens here 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 or the icons in the app store and the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.560
 is a very interesting and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.570
 unique feature 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.520
 you have to be careful, though 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.200
 one does not trigger that because 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.420
 Unfortunately, that happens every now and then the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.420
 we have just noticed and 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.640
 I'll show you the here again 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.720
 settings 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.200
 that is a bit weird now 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.979
 can not high vision here 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.020
 What else do we have? Of course we have 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.299
 this camera up here as well 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.840
 in particular as that one the 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.520
 the 3 can rotate this is a 13 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.229
 megapixel modules and you can here 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.119
 so to speak the front to one 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.849
 synonymous convert front camera there is mine 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.140
 cameraman what she says hello and 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.030
 that is actually a whole 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.890
 interesting mechanism so you can 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.140
 Yes, also set different angles 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.150
 but the locks including one in this 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.959
 angle locks it in noticeably 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.130
 and of course in the starting position 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.680
 that is also a very interesting one 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.850
 thing who is often self ice making 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.860
 certainly appreciate this feature 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.830
 know there are accessories as well 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.450
 so-called optics control that is a 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.280
 small button we can do here now 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.319
 unfortunately not show because there can 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.310
 one also, so to speak, from afar the 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.860
 press release button yes so much first 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.330
 once to 1 1 is a whole 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.700
 interesting device with some 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.950
 exciting functions that we still have 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.380
 did not see me personally 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.390
 it's almost a bit too big my galaxy 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.660
 note 3 has 5.7 inches 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.340
 but that is very very powerful and 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.900
 it might be too heavy 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.970
 be that in your pants pocket too 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.500
 get so much sacrifice 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.299
 I'm frank from android next if 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.739
