for you guys today in the first step is
to<00:00:17.190> actually<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.850> be<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> use<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.420> grip

this<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.470> first<00:00:19.680> call<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.920> duty<00:00:20.189> where

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
this is the first call of duty where

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.410 
this is the first call of duty where
I've<00:00:20.430> noticed<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> group<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.119> actually

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
I've noticed the group is actually

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.060 
I've noticed the group is actually
viable<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.869> every<00:00:22.170> type<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.410> weapon<00:00:22.859> it's

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
viable on every type of weapon it's

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.950 
viable on every type of weapon it's
really<00:00:23.609> good<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.850> smgs<00:00:24.390> especially<00:00:24.810> because

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
really good on smgs especially because

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
really good on smgs especially because
the<00:00:25.080> SMGs<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.769> game<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.099> no<00:00:26.340> range<00:00:26.640> so

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the SMGs in this game have no range so

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.009 
the SMGs in this game have no range so
you<00:00:26.939> got<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.150> try<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.930> this

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
you got to try it out just like in this

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.720 
you got to try it out just like in this
game<00:00:28.230> play<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.890> also<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.340> good<00:00:29.550> with

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
game play it's also really good with

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.339 
game play it's also really good with
assault<00:00:30.090> rifles<00:00:30.150> assault<00:00:30.750> rifles<00:00:31.080> don't<00:00:31.230> have

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
assault rifles assault rifles don't have

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.080 
assault rifles assault rifles don't have
them<00:00:31.500> much<00:00:31.650> recoil<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.820> you

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
them much recoil but when you can you

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
them much recoil but when you can you
know<00:00:33.149> take<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.570> small<00:00:34.079> amount<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.410> recoil<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
know take a small amount of recoil and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.470 
know take a small amount of recoil and
lessen<00:00:35.130> even<00:00:35.430> more<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.820> makes<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> gun<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
lessen even more that makes the gun of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.360 
lessen even more that makes the gun of
course<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.110> lot<00:00:37.140> better<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.710> by<00:00:37.890> taking<00:00:38.100> one

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
course a lot better just by taking one

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.740 
course a lot better just by taking one
point<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:38.820> create<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> class<00:00:39.390> I'm<00:00:39.540> putting

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
point I do create a class I'm putting

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.090 
point I do create a class I'm putting
the<00:00:39.840> grip<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.739> also<00:00:40.860> works

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the grip on and then it also works

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.650 
the grip on and then it also works
really<00:00:41.219> well<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.579> shotguns<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.210> even<00:00:42.480> guns

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
really well on shotguns and even guns

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
really well on shotguns and even guns
like<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> em1<00:00:43.350> laser<00:00:43.829> gun<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:45.000> helps

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
like the em1 laser gun it really helps

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
like the em1 laser gun it really helps
on<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> being<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> heavy<00:00:46.020> weapon<00:00:46.170> even<00:00:46.559> though

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
on that being a heavy weapon even though

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:47.840 
on that being a heavy weapon even though
it<00:00:46.890> doesn't<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.280> much<00:00:47.489> recoil

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it doesn't have that much recoil

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.130 
it doesn't have that much recoil
actually<00:00:48.300> makes<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.539> difference<00:00:48.809> i<00:00:48.930> would

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
actually makes a difference i would

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.330 
actually makes a difference i would
suggest<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.559> guys<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.860> trying<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> improve

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
it like a 12 or something right now it

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.840 
it like a 12 or something right now it
goes<00:00:55.140> 1<00:00:55.379> through<00:00:55.559> 20<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> people<00:00:56.550> say

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the higher the sensitivity you play on

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.389 
the higher the sensitivity you play on
the<00:00:58.500> better<00:00:58.710> player<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.370> is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
totally not true you see players like

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.869 
totally not true you see players like
Nate<00:01:01.050> rotten<00:01:01.379> scum<00:01:01.620> being<00:01:01.829> closer<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.640> play

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
Nate rotten scum being closer they play

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.189 
Nate rotten scum being closer they play
on<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> three<00:01:03.449> or<00:01:03.570> four<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:03.930> really

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
on like a three or four which is really

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.359 
on like a three or four which is really
true<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> actually<00:01:04.830> does<00:01:04.949> make<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.159> big

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
true it actually does make a big

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.100 
true it actually does make a big
difference<00:01:05.400> also<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> would<00:01:06.420> suggest<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.930> guys
