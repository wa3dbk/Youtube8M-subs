00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.970
 importance of a Terran 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100

 You discovered well, we'll have to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.510
 hire some celebrity to sing 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.770

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.360
 plane to Paris if you buy a dress and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.890
 place and present 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.170
 besides this food that neither the attractions 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.709
 here you can leave us combined 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.279
 We found it here at the right time. Let's see. 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:17.310
 how much will the private yacht cost for 

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:20.719
 a four-hour cart and a car 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.029
 new with this pretty big big bow 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.969
 and will cost a little more than two 

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:29.389
 million and if we convert this 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.389
 our currency 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.469
 without a ribbon loop 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.930
 our second option is wonderful because 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.610
 We did not go into a major store. 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.870
 because there you will love it all 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.270
 we will certainly see what we have here 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.360

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.400
 the writing film 31 do not quite know what 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.470
 I mean, but it must be really cool because 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:08.590
 there were a lot of those in the store what 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:12.040
 I do not know, but we will take who 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.930
 Is this what you fill with doses 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.760
 and then we beat the best compare the two 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.490
 fall to the ground I suddenly found this 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.420
 very cool star 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:27.640
 I'll certainly get some candy to be able to 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.650
 star right now then little miss 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.489
 I think we hide now for 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:47.850
 surprise surprise with what reads 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:50.380
 ari una 8 hackers argue for this 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.620
 nobody ever jumped on me in my 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.620
 birthday 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.519

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.030
 hot dog runs out of peanuts 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.470
 ice cream before we open we will have 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.549
 another certainty 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.549
 Happy Birthday 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.330
 we forget the artistic attractions without 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:29.280
 problems with someone who is 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.280
 there he is there on his birthday 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.820
