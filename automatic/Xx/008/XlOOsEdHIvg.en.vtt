00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.390
 we take the oyster this the knife opens 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.069
 oysters or an oyster opener we take a 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.840
 rag that you have to protect well 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.720
 hands we put the oyster here 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.760
 in the middle of the cloth you have seen that 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.850
 I use the rag as well as to protect 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.800
 the fingers because that is done for 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.860
 next if you go the knife of 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.810
 this way it does not hurt you is the hand and 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.060
 now let's introduce the knife in 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.619
 this part of here in the form of a pyramid 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.660
 on the tip of the oyster not on the part 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.270
 round that if not we do not open it in this 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.460
 part of here and so very carefully 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.730
 sometimes you have to do a lot of bone strength 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.970
 what care and with acts of stress and look 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.970
 how good 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.470
 see how wonderful you have seen it 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.130
 they smell like we did in the fish shop and 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:01.090
 they are already perfect and now with everything 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.400
 We invite you to prepare 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.830
 my friend cristina arrived today in aid 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.070
 we throw a little bit of this something like 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.020
 half of each here we have a little bit of 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.479
 green olive a little bit of capers 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.280
 and a little bit of spring onion that 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.290
 now in the spring there are 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.290
 take advantage of this wonder that grows 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:28.729
 and from that time and here the chive and it's 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.280
 who enjoys going to have a garden cited in 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.790
 home 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.790
 the fresh herbs 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.970
 and some new like that the last string 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.660
 the best ones for me that asked me for a 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.179
 chicken pasta dish 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.300
 so I made a menu of dishes that 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:57.110
 I had already done and suddenly it 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.520
 there was a duck lasagna and nothing 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.010
 in the end they chose that dish and it touched me 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.950
 try it because all right 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:11.670

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.670
