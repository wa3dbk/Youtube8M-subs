00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:09.509
 and I can not stand it anymore 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.509
 goodbye 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.299
 and these are my last words not 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.700
 I want you to cut me I leave you my 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.130
 last song only for you to listen to 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.710
 I'm sick of everything from the just routine 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.050
 tired of not being able to make sense of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.210
 life I still do not feel like wanting 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 die find me somewhere where 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.250
 to be able to debate me of memories in the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.890
 my grandfather's face died because pussy had 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.320
 that doing it as you can see life is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.600
 very simple to be born grow and die something 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.610
 undeniably, the days go by 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.440
 hours pass the minutes I get to 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.780
 writing there is no inspiration to fuck me and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.760
 point I have a life ahead or that 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.010
 they say many and think my friends the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.230
 Most pretend they do not know what to do because 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.870
 you say think many times and sancho 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.239
 just for pretending to be all about 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.280
 asshole without criteria I see wide 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.289
 because I feel rap there are no mysteries 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.839
 are my last words never better 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.710
 said rap is more than just a simple 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.170
 whim 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.810
 I cry for everything no longer amaze me do what 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.030
 I will not get any achievement 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.220
 things of closed lives with no way out 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.200
 thinking in those moments the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.810
 best of my life 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.939
 and that appears to satiate this pain a 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.009
 voice in my head whispered me to the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.409
 thinker I am not the frame of the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.719
 word both consolidate death me 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.000
 flame teaches me its output no matter what 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.310
 that speaks no matter what he writes inside 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 a few hours my body will be lifeless 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.990
 my grandfather tells me to come up with the most 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.789
 beyond heaven I think it will be the best 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.369
 what I want is not I take the gun and 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.770
 he pulled the trigger goodbye everyone is my 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.170
 suicide note I take the gun and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.740
 he pulled the trigger goodbye everyone is my 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.740
 suicide note 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.990
 ah
