really didn't seem to do much of
anything<00:00:46.430> at<00:00:47.299> that<00:00:47.479> time<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:47.930> could<00:00:48.140> barely

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
anything at that time I could barely

anything at that time I could barely
walk<00:00:48.739> across<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:49.370> street<00:00:49.699> and<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:51.909> obviously

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
walk across the street and the obviously

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.209 
walk across the street and the obviously
passive<00:00:53.780> pain

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.920 

in<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.000> beginning

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
and I had to sit a chair to be able to

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.190 
and I had to sit a chair to be able to
sleep<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.600> those<00:01:06.900> 10<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.320> 15<00:01:07.650> minutes<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:09.200> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
sleep for those 10 or 15 minutes and it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.310 
sleep for those 10 or 15 minutes and it
was<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:11.190> discouraging<00:01:11.840> very<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.960> fact<00:01:13.140> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
was very discouraging very in fact I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.010 
was very discouraging very in fact I
wanted<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> die<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.940> was<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.840> was<00:01:15.930> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
wanted to die it was so it was so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.390 
wanted to die it was so it was so
intense<00:01:16.620> that<00:01:17.010> I<00:01:18.050> didn't<00:01:19.050> want<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:20.280> was

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
intense that I didn't want that it was

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.720 
intense that I didn't want that it was
not<00:01:20.580> there<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:20.940> not<00:01:21.150> life<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.320> even<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
not there was not life and even with the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.820 
not there was not life and even with the
traditional<00:01:24.300> treatments<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.110> seemed<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
traditional treatments that seemed to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.640 
traditional treatments that seemed to
help<00:01:26.220> somewhat<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.810> was<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:29.040> relief

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.280 

a<00:01:34.770> year<00:01:35.460> ago<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.910> August<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.510> never<00:01:36.900> did<00:01:37.140> this

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
a year ago in August I never did this

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.460 
a year ago in August I never did this
themselves<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.600> after<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:39.870> three<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.170> four

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
themselves and after about three or four

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.930 
themselves and after about three or four
months<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.890> started<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.340> notice<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
months I started to notice the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.700 
months I started to notice the
difference<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.590> can't<00:01:44.130> say<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.550> 100%

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
difference so I can't say that I'm 100%

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.360 
difference so I can't say that I'm 100%
but<00:01:46.710> for<00:01:47.490> what<00:01:47.760> it<00:01:47.850> was<00:01:48.060> -<00:01:48.510> what<00:01:48.660> I<00:01:48.720> am<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.410> I<00:01:50.070> got

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
but for what it was - what I am is I got

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.960 
but for what it was - what I am is I got
my<00:01:50.400> life<00:01:50.640> back<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:53.300> watch<00:01:54.300> I<00:01:54.690> can<00:01:55.970> I'm
