so what we're going to do right here is
we're<00:00:26.849> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> use<00:00:27.119> our<00:00:27.210> ultimate<00:00:27.689> just

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
we're going to use our ultimate just

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.810 
we're going to use our ultimate just
like<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.590> right<00:00:29.010> when<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.220> gets<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
like this I right when it gets to the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.070 
like this I right when it gets to the
end<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:30.090> there<00:00:30.150> we're<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> use<00:00:30.869> this

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
end right there we're going to use this

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.020 
end right there we're going to use this
and<00:00:31.289> look<00:00:31.710> at<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.399> now<00:00:32.550> throw<00:00:32.880> out

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
and look at that we can now throw out

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.569 
and look at that we can now throw out
fireballs<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.020> goop<00:00:34.860> whenever<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.460> would

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
fireballs and the goop whenever we would

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.220 
fireballs and the goop whenever we would
like<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.210> accidentally<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.020> gold

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
like to we accidentally and get the gold

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
like to we accidentally and get the gold
mine<00:00:37.410> there<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.100> yeah<00:00:38.309> basically<00:00:38.550> what's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
mine there but yeah basically what's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.850 
mine there but yeah basically what's
going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> happen<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.050> long<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.710> get

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
going to happen is as long as you get

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.340 
going to happen is as long as you get
that<00:00:40.920> reflex<00:00:41.460> block<00:00:41.610> off<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.090> during<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
that reflex block off on during the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
that reflex block off on during the
transition<00:00:44.219> between<00:00:44.460> charging<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.329> your

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
transition between charging up your

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.150 
transition between charging up your
ultimate<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.710> using<00:00:47.039> your

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
ultimate and then actually using your

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.740 
ultimate and then actually using your
ultimate<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.210> actually<00:00:48.360> allow<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
ultimate then it will actually allow you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.569 
ultimate then it will actually allow you
to<00:00:48.960> use<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.110> abilities<00:00:49.620> during<00:00:50.100> your

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
to use your abilities during your

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.560 
to use your abilities during your
alternate<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.270> something<00:00:51.420> that's

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.569 
alternate which is something that's
really<00:00:51.809> cool<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.350> don't<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.649> very<00:00:53.399> many

pretty<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.840> nobody<00:01:04.019> knows<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.559> he's

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
pretty much nobody knows because he's

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980

obviously<00:01:05.159> deaf<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.090> high<00:01:06.210> e<00:01:06.240> lo<00:01:06.540> player<00:01:06.780> so

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
obviously deaf and a high e lo player so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.109 
obviously deaf and a high e lo player so
he<00:01:07.020> knows<00:01:07.260> all<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.650> cool<00:01:07.860> stuff<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.340> we

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
he knows all this cool stuff that we

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.149 
he knows all this cool stuff that we
couldn't<00:01:09.390> possibly<00:01:09.930> think<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> other

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
couldn't possibly think of but the other

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.390 
couldn't possibly think of but the other
thing<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.369> he<00:01:11.549> told<00:01:11.760> me<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.240> scarf<00:01:12.659> is

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
thing that he told me is that scarf is

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.190 
thing that he told me is that scarf is
probably<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.509> nerfed<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
probably going to be not nerfed but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
probably going to be not nerfed but
tweet<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:17.820> happen

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
tweet so that this can actually happen

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
tweet so that this can actually happen
and<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.960> reason<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and the reason for that is that if it

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.490 
and the reason for that is that if it
says<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> actual<00:01:21.600> ability<00:01:22.080> tag<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
says it in the actual ability tag it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.960 
says it in the actual ability tag it
just<00:01:22.890> shouldn't<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.220> able<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.610> done<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
just shouldn't be able to be done in the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
just shouldn't be able to be done in the
game<00:01:24.119> even<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.869> he<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> certain<00:01:25.770> type<00:01:26.189> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
game even if he do a certain type of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
game even if he do a certain type of
actives<00:01:26.970> along<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:27.960> ability<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> try
