00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.900 

great<00:01:01.710> thing<00:01:01.859> about<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.100> suppressor<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> -

great thing about this suppressor is -

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.780 
great thing about this suppressor is -
it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> quick<00:01:03.390> release<00:01:04.159> that<00:01:05.159> goes<00:01:05.369> right<00:01:05.729> on

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it's a quick release that goes right on

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.530 
it's a quick release that goes right on
to<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> flash<00:01:06.630> guard<00:01:07.760> you'll<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:09.180> next

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
to the flash guard you'll see in my next

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.899 
to the flash guard you'll see in my next
video<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.200> I'm<00:01:10.590> used<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> same<00:01:11.250> suppressor

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
video that I'm used the same suppressor

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:20.560 
video that I'm used the same suppressor
for<00:01:12.840> my<00:01:13.049> mp4<00:01:15.409> this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.850> with<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> suppressor

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.940 

so<00:01:22.340> some<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> difference<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.950> as

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
so some of the difference on it is as

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.700 
so some of the difference on it is as
you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.159> hear<00:01:26.549> without<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.119> suppressor<00:01:27.710> on

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you can hear without the suppressor on

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710 
you can hear without the suppressor on
that<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> got<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> lot<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.729> noise<00:01:29.970> from<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that you got a lot of noise from the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.069 
that you got a lot of noise from the
shell<00:01:31.170> itself<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> course<00:01:33.079> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
shell itself and then of course the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.499 
shell itself and then of course the
noise<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.799> broke<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> sound<00:01:35.250> barrier<00:01:35.509> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
noise as it broke the sound barrier the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.670 
noise as it broke the sound barrier the
next<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> show<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
next one I'm going to show you is a

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
next one I'm going to show you is a
subsonic<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.189> traveling<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:41.850> about<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
subsonic and it's traveling at about a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.100 
subsonic and it's traveling at about a
thousand<00:01:42.750> fifty<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.170> course<00:01:43.380> 1070<00:01:44.689> hit<00:01:45.689> sonic

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
thousand fifty of course 1070 hit sonic

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.370 
thousand fifty of course 1070 hit sonic
so<00:01:46.590> you're<00:01:46.860> gonna<00:01:46.950> hear<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:48.049> sound<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.259> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
so you're gonna hear the sound of it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.350 
so you're gonna hear the sound of it
breaking<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.770> sound<00:01:49.979> barrier<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
breaking the sound barrier so this is a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
breaking the sound barrier so this is a
subsonic<00:01:52.140> round<00:01:52.530> without<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.009> suppressor

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
subsonic round without the suppressor

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.359 
subsonic round without the suppressor
over

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.450 

so<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.969> about<00:02:00.149> as<00:02:00.299> loud<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> other<00:02:00.929> one

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
so just about as loud as the other one

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.840 
so just about as loud as the other one
this<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.789> subsonic<00:02:04.310> again<00:02:05.310> shooting<00:02:05.700> at

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
this is the subsonic again shooting at

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.819 
this is the subsonic again shooting at
about<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> thousand<00:02:06.630> fifty<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.500> below<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
about a thousand fifty so just below the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.830 
about a thousand fifty so just below the
thousand<00:02:08.220> sixty<00:02:10.970> subsonic<00:02:11.970> with<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
thousand sixty subsonic with the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.839 
thousand sixty subsonic with the
suppressor<00:02:17.330> obviously<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.540> lot<00:02:19.019> quieter<00:02:19.849> so

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
suppressor obviously a lot quieter so

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.220 
suppressor obviously a lot quieter so
two<00:02:21.480> things<00:02:23.480> suppressor<00:02:24.480> from<00:02:24.660> coastal<00:02:25.049> gun

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
two things suppressor from coastal gun

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.940 
two things suppressor from coastal gun
love<00:02:25.620> it

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950

my sig 522 great clinker never jams for

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.750 
my sig 522 great clinker never jams for
a<00:02:33.599> think<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.739> one<00:02:35.099> this<00:02:35.280> was<00:02:35.489> not<00:02:35.640> the

tactical of course cuz it's got the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.460 
tactical of course cuz it's got the
plastic<00:02:37.799> grip<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.840> believe<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.019> one<00:02:40.260> on
