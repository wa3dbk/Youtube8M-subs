00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.489

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.649
 humans live in germany meatless 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.629
 the vegetarians appreciate and themselves 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.629
 wti days in canteens can already 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.070
 work pretty well 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.109
 who meat eater from the veggie day 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.329
 It has to be hard to convince 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.670
 That's why chef Frank Planitz is looking for 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.250
 the morning at 7 at the biohof 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.239
 the best gourds from wonderful that 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.530
 The quality does not like to be around 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.780
 He has 1,200 employees in today 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.399
 his canteen supply with fresh 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.950
 Products from the region 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.560
 I do not need vegetables what is coming from Peru 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.420
 Chile or where else does that come from? 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.040
 what is happening in the region right now 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.910
 We want to bring that to the plate 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.670
 I think we have short distances 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.230
 reduce the co2 emissions because 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.030
 Sustainability is also that 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.760
 Business objective of the company in which he 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.770
 the company juwi works at mainz 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.280
 makes a billion euros in sales per 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 year 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.690
 with wind power and renewable energies 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.270
 For two years there is every one here 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.610
 Tuesday a patch day the chefs 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.830
 Frank Baranowski and Jens Kottke have 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.720
 formerly cooked in starred restaurants at 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.640
 juwi in the canteen, they first had to 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.700
 convince the staff once 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.890
 the first reaction was not meat 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.630
 i'm not going to eat there i picked it up 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.940
 by writing down things like 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.620
 those from home know the number 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.480
 also has know spinach heat 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.480
 potatoes or and fried eggs or 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.159
 Cauliflower with white sauce and 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.409
 potatoes easy 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.759
 is very down to earth and that they are 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.950
 Not at home if they were 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.770
 even once a week no meat 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.200
 Eat four dishes plus salad bar there 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.759
 it today to choose the bio hokkaido 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.060
 pumpkin with herbs from the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.860
 Company garden pasta 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.549
 potato pancakes and soy sliced 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.250
 most people enjoy the concept 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.840
 does not hurt and is somewhere for 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.459
 a good cause i think at the 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.989
 good house because it is not difficult to 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.349
 to give up meat one day in the 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.790
 week 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.010
 we also tasted a lot 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.440
 good head some men go then 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.270
 Let's take a look, but I 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.790
 have here 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.360
 Today, the chefs have 850 dishes 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.580
 sold 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.140
 By the way, that's more than one 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.880
 Meat day makes a patch day 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.490
 of course not a vegetarian, though 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.380
 even the group of vegans will 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.790
 bigger vegan that's not just the ones 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.710
 but do without fish and meat 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.870
 Do not eat anything that comes from animals 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.410
 So no eggs no milk no 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.300
 dairy products of a trendsetter 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.310
 this is the bestselling author attila 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.230
 hildmann he sells vegan cookbooks 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.000
 soja as cut bread mr Hiltmann 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.690
 nice evening what is so great about it 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.910
 to eat vegetable 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.640
 that is a very complex topic 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.110
 for me it was 35 kilograms 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.330
 weight lost by a 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.650
 but I got a better body feeling 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.570
 are of course also aspects such as 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.060
 For example, I do not have mass animal husbandry 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.530
 especially worth supportive and there 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.610
 can one agree with vegan between 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.680
 to put signs 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.209
 they feel healthier since then 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.010
 they make him believe twelve years 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.070
 me and many vegans say that yes you 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.910
 lives longer and you feel stronger 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.160
 On the other hand, one could say 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.930
 it is also because vegan others 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.080
 People are body-conscious people 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.380
 who do not smoke do not drink alcohol 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.730
 and therefore they also feel better 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.290
 So I think I already say that 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.510
 can that still be a vegan just a lot 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.580
 body pattern is i'm doing for example 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.340
 triathlon sport and just as the eighth 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.739
 what I use to guide my body 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.660
 for example, figures of tea or drink 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.190
 less alcohol is certainly one 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.720
 aspect but basically it is 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.900
 Of course, that way through vegan 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.570
 nutrition above all very many vitamins 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.670
 Adds antioxidants to the body and that 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.650
 is certainly then measurable but 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.419
 like a gallerist, that too 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.830
 certain basic substances are missing or 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.229
 just do not eat this food 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.450
 get that is completely correct you have to 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.310
 especially pay attention to vitamin b12 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.410
 You can not plant that through 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.419
 lead but we should note that 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.200
 the billions 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.479
 food supplement market not 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.669
 because of a few vegans exists 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.140
 but because the normal one is normal 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.220
 German, unfortunately, too 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.290
 feeds unbalanced 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.740
 if i put her on a glass of good now 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.110
 red wine and a four cheese pizza 1 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.810
 if you say joyfully no thanks 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.270
 I have a carrot with me 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.919
 the offer would of course welcome the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.660
 I would not eat cheese pizza now 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.470
 but maybe a bit of that 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.729
 take red wine 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.960
 Well, thank you for the conversation 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.069
 attila hildmann all the best 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.069
 Thank you very much in the evening
