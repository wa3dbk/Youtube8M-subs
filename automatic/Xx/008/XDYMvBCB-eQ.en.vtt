added as a trailer I do not use a
trailer<00:01:03.570> hook<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.229> because<00:01:04.500> they'll

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
trailer hook with this because they'll

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.170 
trailer hook with this because they'll
interfere<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> tail<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:06.000> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
interfere with the tail but what this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.640 
interfere with the tail but what this
allows<00:01:06.420> me<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:06.930> gives<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.439> bait<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
allows me to do is gives the bait a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.399 
allows me to do is gives the bait a
completely<00:01:08.369> different<00:01:08.670> profile<00:01:09.119> matches<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
completely different profile matches the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.039 
completely different profile matches the
bait<00:01:10.619> fish<00:01:10.890> usually<00:01:11.280> perfectly<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> it'll

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
bait fish usually perfectly and it'll

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.350 
bait fish usually perfectly and it'll
allow<00:01:13.200> me<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.860> able<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.189> slow<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.060> bait

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
allow me to be able to slow that bait

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.710 
allow me to be able to slow that bait
down<00:01:15.659> without<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.409> rolling<00:01:16.939> which<00:01:17.939> really

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
down without it rolling which really

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.359 
down without it rolling which really
causes<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.229> lot<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> violent<00:01:19.890> strikes<00:01:20.100> for

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
causes a lot of violent strikes for

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.950 
causes a lot of violent strikes for
those<00:01:20.490> fish<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.939> are<00:01:21.030> reluctant<00:01:21.330> now

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
those fish that are reluctant now

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.749 
those fish that are reluctant now
whenever<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.470> start<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> morning<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
whenever I start out in the morning I

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.820 
whenever I start out in the morning I
will<00:01:23.909> take<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.479> bait<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.290> fish<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
will take this bait and I fish it on a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.539 
will take this bait and I fish it on a
7-foot<00:01:26.520> medium<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> heavy<00:01:27.600> action<00:01:27.930> rod<00:01:28.549> like

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
7-foot medium to heavy action rod like

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.520 
7-foot medium to heavy action rod like
this<00:01:29.579> carrot<00:01:30.030> stick<00:01:30.240> micro<00:01:30.689> guide<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> team

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
this carrot stick micro guide and a team

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.740 
this carrot stick micro guide and a team

lose high-speed retrieve reel and the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.260 
lose high-speed retrieve reel and the
reason<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.259> pair<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.970> I'll<00:01:36.090> go

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
reason I pair it with this and I'll go

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.690 
reason I pair it with this and I'll go
braid<00:01:36.630> or<00:01:36.960> fluorocarbon<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:38.130> depends<00:01:38.579> on

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
braid or fluorocarbon just depends on

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.240 
braid or fluorocarbon just depends on
how<00:01:38.939> heavy<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> vegetation<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.200> around<00:01:40.560> now

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
how heavy the vegetation I'm around now

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.819 
how heavy the vegetation I'm around now
the<00:01:42.210> reason<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.079> equipment<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the reason I do this equipment is

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.620 
the reason I do this equipment is
because<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.399> effortless<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.360> cover

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
because it's effortless and I can cover

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.060 
because it's effortless and I can cover
a<00:01:45.720> lot<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:45.990> ground<00:01:46.110> with<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.680> make<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> lot

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
a lot of ground with it and make a lot

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
a lot of ground with it and make a lot
of<00:01:47.220> cast<00:01:47.490> very<00:01:47.790> quickly<00:01:48.149> paying<00:01:48.570> specific

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
of cast very quickly paying specific

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.840 
of cast very quickly paying specific
attention<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.649> where<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:49.979> bites<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.520> coming

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
attention to where the bites are coming

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.789

depending on how I want the bait to fall

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.080 
depending on how I want the bait to fall
but<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:08.040> couple<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.580> really<00:03:08.880> cool

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
but the couple of the really cool

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.270 
but the couple of the really cool
features<00:03:09.150> about<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.080> video<00:03:10.500> why<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.710> throw<00:03:11.160> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
features about this video why I throw it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.820 
features about this video why I throw it
is<00:03:11.400> it's<00:03:11.790> heavy<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.360> can<00:03:12.810> punch<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.350> about<00:03:13.560> any

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
is it's heavy I can punch just about any

vegetation<00:03:14.490> matted<00:03:15.360> isolated<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:16.739> got<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
vegetation matted isolated it's got the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.010 
vegetation matted isolated it's got the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
triple rattle backs in it so it's got

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.260 
triple rattle backs in it so it's got
rattling<00:03:19.620> capabilities<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.730> it's<00:03:21.060> got<00:03:21.239> a

so<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.880> if<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.209> choose<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:25.050> use<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> bigger

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
so that if I choose to use a bigger

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.660 
so that if I choose to use a bigger
trailer<00:03:26.190> like<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.670> zoom<00:03:27.680> chunk<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:29.489> can

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
trailer like this zoom chunk you can

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.910 
trailer like this zoom chunk you can
hook<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.030> fat<00:03:30.270> by<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:30.810> threading<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.320> on<00:03:31.500> and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
smaller profile which is what I'm after

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.500 
smaller profile which is what I'm after
in<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.070> fall<00:03:44.280> because<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.640> lot<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:44.970> times<00:03:45.300> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
in the fall because a lot of times the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.360 
in the fall because a lot of times the
shad<00:03:45.750> are<00:03:45.989> small<00:03:46.320> or<00:03:46.830> if<00:03:47.010> you're<00:03:47.160> around

they<00:03:49.709> tend<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.070> be<00:03:50.220> smaller<00:03:50.280> size<00:03:50.970> so

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
they tend to be smaller size so

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.130 
they tend to be smaller size so
