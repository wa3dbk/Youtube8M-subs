limits at night you really like to know
what<00:00:13.410> you're<00:00:13.559> doing<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.670> generally<00:00:15.509> speaking

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
what you're doing so generally speaking

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.710 
what you're doing so generally speaking
this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.440> an<00:00:16.710> easy<00:00:16.890> fix<00:00:17.300> I'll<00:00:18.300> show<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.570> what

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
this is an easy fix I'll show you what

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.080 
this is an easy fix I'll show you what
the<00:00:18.810> problem<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:20.670> if<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.820> come<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the problem is so if you come to the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.640 
the problem is so if you come to the
back<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.420> boat<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.869> item<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.529> you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
back you boat this item here is you

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.320 
back you boat this item here is you
should<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.890> able<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.130> pick<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.400> both

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
should be able to pick up both

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.849 
should be able to pick up both
manufacturers<00:00:24.930> throw<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.380> thing<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.710> your

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
manufacturers throw this thing on your

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.080 
manufacturers throw this thing on your
with<00:00:25.949> no<00:00:26.099> regard<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.580> where<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.910> going<00:00:27.029> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
with no regard to where it's going to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
with no regard to where it's going to
sit<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> trailer<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.349> odds<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.400> this

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
sit on the trailer so odds are on this

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
sit on the trailer so odds are on this
boat<00:00:29.760> came<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> trick<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.840> happened<00:00:31.170> is

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
boat came on the trick what happened is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.709 
boat came on the trick what happened is
this<00:00:31.769> thing<00:00:32.009> got<00:00:32.160> flipped<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.570> hit

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
this thing got flipped up or you hit

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.209 
this thing got flipped up or you hit
something<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.200> water<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.710> designed<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
something in the water it's designed to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.370 
something in the water it's designed to
flip<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.730> rather<00:00:36.030> than<00:00:36.210> break<00:00:36.480> off<00:00:36.690> they<00:00:37.200> do

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
flip up rather than break off they do

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.770 
flip up rather than break off they do
break<00:00:37.620> off<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:39.030> idea<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.719> will

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
break off but the idea is that it will

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.650 
break off but the idea is that it will
flip<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.200> first<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.180> you<00:00:42.180> should<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.480> spread

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
flip up first so you should be spread

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.690 
flip up first so you should be spread
out<00:00:42.780> murmurs<00:00:42.960> bad<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:44.070> working<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.520> should

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
out murmurs bad or not working I should

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420 
out murmurs bad or not working I should
say<00:00:44.879> flip<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.750> thing<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.710> odds<00:00:47.160> are

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
say flip this thing down and odds are

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.369 
say flip this thing down and odds are
it'll<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:47.730> it'll<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.210> fine<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.110> other<00:00:49.140> thing

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
it'll be it'll be fine the other thing

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
it'll be it'll be fine the other thing
to<00:00:49.500> watch<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.149> weeds<00:00:51.390> or

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to watch for is if there are weeds or

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.850 
to watch for is if there are weeds or
anything<00:00:51.930> caught<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.440> thing<00:00:52.649> it'll

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
anything caught up on this thing it'll

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.240 
anything caught up on this thing it'll
do<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> same<00:00:53.129> thing<00:00:54.320> same<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.710> hose<00:00:55.949> so

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
do the same thing same with this hose so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.770 
do the same thing same with this hose so
I<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.489> let's<00:00:56.670> say<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> flip<00:00:57.300> down<00:00:57.600> each

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I get let's say you flip down each

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.590 
I get let's say you flip down each
parameter<00:00:57.989> does<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.649> work<00:00:58.890> still<00:00:59.300> the<00:01:00.300> only

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
parameter does not work still the only

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.599 
parameter does not work still the only
real<00:01:00.750> components<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> these<00:01:01.590> things<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:02.190> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
real components of these things are it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.509 
real components of these things are it
picks<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.149> water<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.870> water<00:01:04.199> actually<00:01:04.890> goes

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
picks up water this water actually goes

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.789 
picks up water this water actually goes
all<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.820> way<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.420> boat<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
all the way up to your boat to the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
all the way up to your boat to the
speedometer<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.060> pull<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.420> hose<00:01:09.659> off

the back your speedometer and you when
you're<00:01:11.850> moving<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.240> don't<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.720> water

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you're moving you don't have water

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.440 
you're moving you don't have water
coming<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.979> there's<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> break<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
coming out of it there's a break in the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.320 
coming out of it there's a break in the
line<00:01:15.509> somewhere<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.259> kinked<00:01:16.770> or<00:01:17.330> often

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
line somewhere it's kinked or often

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.570

pulls<00:01:20.850> off<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.259> those<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:23.009> things<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
pulls off of this so those are things to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.920 
pulls off of this so those are things to
look<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:24.860> most<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:26.159> speedometers<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
look for most all speedometers of you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.469 
look for most all speedometers of you
know<00:01:28.189> there<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.310> GPS<00:01:29.670> ones<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.450> are

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
know there are GPS ones there are

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.300 
know there are GPS ones there are
digital<00:01:30.990> ones<00:01:31.170> there<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.409> newer<00:01:31.680> style<00:01:32.070> ones

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
digital ones there are newer style ones

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.490 
digital ones there are newer style ones
but<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:32.909> you've<00:01:33.150> got<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.689> style<00:01:34.110> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
but if you've got this style it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.190 
but if you've got this style it's
generally<00:01:35.340> speaking<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.240> your<00:01:37.020> hose

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
generally speaking it's this your hose

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.910 
generally speaking it's this your hose
in<00:01:37.500> your<00:01:37.560> gauge<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:40.350> say<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.680> gauge

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
in your gauge and I would say your gauge
