00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.980 

for<00:00:01.140> tonight's<00:00:01.500> unboxing

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:17.090 

we<00:00:06.830> have<00:00:07.010> in<00:00:07.730> tina<00:00:09.940> racing<00:00:11.410> top-end<00:00:12.410> kick

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:30.200 

for<00:00:18.100> a<00:00:18.130> 2001<00:00:19.080> Yamaha<00:00:20.400> yz250<00:00:24.539> ring

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:42.590 

very<00:00:31.210> well<00:00:31.360> packaged<00:00:34.530> cocaine<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:38.140> contains

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:01:09.770 

this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.560 

the<00:01:10.780> piston<00:01:11.290> pin<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.510> circlips

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.180 

brand-new<00:01:19.790> peg<00:01:21.410> assembly

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.970 

I<00:01:26.250> think

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
I think

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:36.660 
I think
this<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:28.970> separate<00:01:29.360> is<00:01:30.140> it's<00:01:30.590> more<00:01:30.830> durable<00:01:31.340> in

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.980 

if<00:01:37.030> this<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.420> damaged<00:01:37.900> just<00:01:38.680> replace<00:01:39.340> this

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
if this is damaged just replace this

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.670 
if this is damaged just replace this
rather<00:01:40.990> than<00:01:41.229> overhead

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.520 

very<00:01:46.680> very<00:01:48.770> close<00:01:49.770> tolerances<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.440> if<00:01:52.440> you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
very very close tolerances that if you

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.200 
very very close tolerances that if you
don't<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.950> perfectly<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:56.610> will<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.940> do

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
don't have it perfectly it will not do

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.969 
don't have it perfectly it will not do
it

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.740 

looks<00:02:04.399> like<00:02:04.579> a<00:02:04.670> very<00:02:04.850> well-made

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.950 

set<00:02:08.350> up<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.710> far

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:23.059 

no<00:02:14.560> longer<00:02:14.710> itself

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.559 

the<00:02:23.519> way<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.969> comes<00:02:24.120> with

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.990 

in<00:02:26.930> power<00:02:27.200> out

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.840 

I<00:02:32.780> was<00:02:33.780> getting<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.200> dirt<00:02:34.470> bike<00:02:34.850> already

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
I was getting that dirt bike already

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:45.089 
I was getting that dirt bike already
apart

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.790 

I<00:02:45.959> didn't<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.049> don't<00:02:47.260> know<00:02:47.379> how<00:02:47.579> they<00:02:48.579> took

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
I didn't I don't know how they took

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.190 
I didn't I don't know how they took
the<00:02:50.220> power<00:02:50.460> valve<00:02:50.760> off<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.960> screw

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.830 

that<00:02:55.739> goes<00:02:55.920> right<00:02:56.160> here

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.380 

there's<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:03.170> holding<00:03:04.170> pin<00:03:04.830> somewhere

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
there's a a holding pin somewhere

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.930 
there's a a holding pin somewhere
I<00:03:06.420> don't<00:03:07.080> know<00:03:07.170> right<00:03:07.350> now<00:03:07.380> it's<00:03:07.890> not

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.870 

assembled<00:03:12.320> but<00:03:13.320> there's<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.620> spot<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.460> the<00:03:14.580> arm

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
assembled but there's a spot in the arm

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.440 
assembled but there's a spot in the arm
the<00:03:15.780> linkage<00:03:16.050> arm<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:17.970> put<00:03:18.210> like<00:03:18.330> an

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the linkage arm that you put like an

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.840 
the linkage arm that you put like an
allen<00:03:18.690> wrench<00:03:18.720> or<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.110> screwdriver<00:03:19.380> in<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.730> you

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
allen wrench or a screwdriver in and you

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.720 
allen wrench or a screwdriver in and you
hold<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.300> while<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.830> either<00:03:22.830> torque<00:03:23.250> or

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
hold it while you either torque or

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.420 
hold it while you either torque or
loosen<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.390> screw<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:28.100> thank<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.370> you

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
loosen that screw and thank you so you

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.620 
loosen that screw and thank you so you
don't<00:03:30.350> spend<00:03:31.820> part<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.090> pollens<00:03:33.480> out

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
don't spend part of the pollens out

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.980 
don't spend part of the pollens out
somewhere<00:03:34.380> too<00:03:35.190> much<00:03:35.370> torque<00:03:35.730> on<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:35.990> and

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
somewhere too much torque on it and

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.260 
somewhere too much torque on it and
overextending<00:03:37.740> it

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.740 

so<00:03:40.720> hoping<00:03:40.930> by<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:42.030> new<00:03:43.030> power<00:03:43.240> valves<00:03:45.750> that

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
so hoping by the new power valves that

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.750 
so hoping by the new power valves that
anything<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.320> could<00:03:47.530> have<00:03:47.620> been<00:03:47.710> damaged<00:03:48.040> is

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
anything that could have been damaged is

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:59.440 
anything that could have been damaged is
being<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:49.090> place

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.000 

this<00:04:00.080> looks<00:04:00.290> like<00:04:00.410> it's<00:04:00.590> better<00:04:01.459> made<00:04:01.730> than

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
this looks like it's better made than

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:14.970 
this looks like it's better made than
the<00:04:04.010> stock<00:04:04.280> cylinder<00:04:09.730> also<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:10.879> here<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.450> have

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.819 

dowel<00:04:15.980> pins<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.549> go<00:04:17.229> in<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.410> top<00:04:18.620> of<00:04:18.769> the

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
dowel pins that go in the top of the

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.800 
dowel pins that go in the top of the
cylinder

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:39.809 

studs<00:04:25.810> for<00:04:26.290> about<00:04:26.860> me<00:04:27.010> cylinder

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.269 

not<00:04:40.330> exactly<00:04:40.689> sure<00:04:40.960> what<00:04:41.199> these<00:04:41.379> spring<00:04:42.009> clips

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 
not exactly sure what these spring clips

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:51.190 
not exactly sure what these spring clips
before

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:05:01.770 

and<00:04:53.330> lastly<00:04:55.190> bunch<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.310> stickers

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.160 

three<00:05:08.580> directions<00:05:09.580> -<00:05:10.390> I<00:05:10.780> see

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
three directions - I see

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.149 
three directions - I see
try<00:05:11.620> reading

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
try reading

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.189 
try reading
because<00:05:13.759> this<00:05:13.939> company<00:05:14.360> is

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.820 

I<00:05:18.229> was<00:05:18.889> he<00:05:18.979> tell<00:05:19.159> you

I was he tell you

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.100 
I was he tell you
and<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:22.650> translation<00:05:24.659> really<00:05:25.659> isn't<00:05:25.810> that

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
and the translation really isn't that

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:33.409 
and the translation really isn't that
good

00:05:44.130 --> 00:06:07.659 

don't<00:05:44.790> take<00:05:45.120> it<00:05:45.150> out<00:05:45.510> from<00:05:46.220> developing

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.520 

I<00:06:07.699> was<00:06:08.300> really<00:06:08.449> hoping<00:06:08.659> to<00:06:08.930> install<00:06:09.379> this

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
I was really hoping to install this

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:18.679 
I was really hoping to install this
today<00:06:10.719> you<00:06:11.719> got<00:06:11.900> yesterday<00:06:12.349> it<00:06:12.439> was<00:06:12.560> late

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
the highest temperature ones today is 10

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:32.840 
the highest temperature ones today is 10
and<00:06:24.520> as<00:06:24.670> parents
