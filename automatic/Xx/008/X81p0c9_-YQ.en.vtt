00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
this material right here this is

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340 
this material right here this is
actually<00:01:25.619> 3m<00:01:26.130> reflective<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> tongue

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
actually 3m reflective and in the tongue

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
actually 3m reflective and in the tongue
or<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> toe<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.549> box<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> 3m

reflective so this kind of this is kind

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.649 
reflective so this kind of this is kind
of<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> reason<00:01:33.030> why<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> got<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> shoe<00:01:33.630> I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
of the reason why I got the shoe I
really<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.290> kind<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.619> textured<00:01:35.430> look

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
really like this kind of textured look

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.319 
really like this kind of textured look
across<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.710> digital<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.759> don't

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
across it like like a digital I don't

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.490 
across it like like a digital I don't
know<00:01:39.479> what<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> heck<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> tree<00:01:40.079> or<00:01:40.259> something<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
know what the heck a tree or something I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
know what the heck a tree or something I
don't<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.979> supposed<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.369> but

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
don't know what it's supposed to be but

don't know what it's supposed to be but

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
kind of that that along with this kind

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.969 
kind of that that along with this kind
of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> icy<00:01:47.790> blue<00:01:48.149> bottom<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:48.659> this

iridescent sort of material on the upper

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.330 
iridescent sort of material on the upper
I<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.470> thought<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> looked<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
I just thought it looked like kind of a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.550 
I just thought it looked like kind of a
cool<00:01:53.369> shoe<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.090> had<00:01:54.899> him<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.110> my<00:01:55.140> car<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.470> I

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
sometimes sometimes it's not a good

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.990 
sometimes sometimes it's not a good
thing<00:02:03.659> though<00:02:03.780> because<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.579> impulsively<00:02:05.579> buy

there's like there's so many other

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.930 
there's like there's so many other
sneakers<00:02:09.330> coming<00:02:09.599> out<00:02:09.690> soon<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.760> yeah<00:02:11.760> it's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
sneakers coming out soon so yeah it's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940 
sneakers coming out soon so yeah it's
it's<00:02:12.330> not<00:02:12.510> always<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.870> great<00:02:13.050> thing<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.709> do

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it's not always a great thing to do

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
it's not always a great thing to do
I<00:02:14.010> don't<00:02:14.310> recommend<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.849> too<00:02:15.690> often<00:02:15.870> but

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
I don't recommend it too often but

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.320 
I don't recommend it too often but
sometimes<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.250> ends<00:02:17.430> up<00:02:17.489> being<00:02:17.910> good<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.269> this

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
sometimes it ends up being good and this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.640 
sometimes it ends up being good and this
is<00:02:18.390> kind<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.080> those<00:02:19.170> pairs<00:02:19.470> where<00:02:19.620> I

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
is kind of one of those pairs where I

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.740 
is kind of one of those pairs where I
think<00:02:19.860> yeah<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.489> was<00:02:20.849> worth<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.150> regardless<00:02:21.569> of

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
think yeah it was worth it regardless of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.990 
think yeah it was worth it regardless of
any<00:02:22.170> hype<00:02:22.410> or<00:02:22.590> anything<00:02:22.739> like<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
any hype or anything like that it's a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.759 
any hype or anything like that it's a
cool<00:02:24.150> looking<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.480> my<00:02:24.690> opinion<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.620> only

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
cool looking to my opinion the only

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.160 
cool looking to my opinion the only
thing<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.010> I'd<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.430> say<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.790> upper

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
thing is I'd have to say is on the upper

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.199 
thing is I'd have to say is on the upper
you<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:28.379> this<00:02:28.470> materials<00:02:28.860> kind<00:02:29.010> of

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
you can see this materials kind of

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.190 
you can see this materials kind of
definitely<00:02:30.209> reflective<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.959> or<00:02:31.080> not

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
definitely reflective and or not

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.020 
definitely reflective and or not
reflective<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:31.830> kind<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.670> looks<00:02:32.819> at<00:02:32.910> me

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
reflective but kind of it looks at me

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.130 
reflective but kind of it looks at me
arriving<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.599> reminds<00:02:33.810> me<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.019> an<00:02:34.080> old

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
arriving so it reminds me of an old

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.780 
arriving so it reminds me of an old
hologram<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.160> would<00:02:35.310> actually<00:02:35.670> be<00:02:35.760> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
hologram and that would actually be a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.940 
hologram and that would actually be a
dope<00:02:36.000> shoe<00:02:36.330> take<00:02:36.840> note<00:02:37.080> Nike<00:02:37.440> or<00:02:37.560> somebody

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
dope shoe take note Nike or somebody

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.059 
dope shoe take note Nike or somebody
Jordan<00:02:38.340> Brand<00:02:38.459> make<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.269> shoe<00:02:39.780> upper<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.769> that

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
Jordan Brand make a shoe upper that that

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.559 
Jordan Brand make a shoe upper that that
when<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.340> move<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:41.849> it's<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.540> a

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
when you move it like this it's like a

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.390 
when you move it like this it's like a
hologram<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.200> back<00:02:43.379> in<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> day<00:02:43.739> when<00:02:44.280> you'd

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
hologram like back in the day when you'd

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.070 
hologram like back in the day when you'd
have<00:02:44.580> like<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.209> Transformers<00:02:45.599> there<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.049> a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
have like the Transformers there have a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.960 
have like the Transformers there have a
transformer<00:02:46.560> logo<00:02:46.830> on<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.190> then<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> tilt

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
transformer logo on it and then you tilt

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.729 
transformer logo on it and then you tilt
it<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.420> would<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.870> would<00:02:48.959> be<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
it and it would be it would be the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.110 
it and it would be it would be the
Autobots<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.549> tilted<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.000> would

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
Autobots and then you tilted it would

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.729 
Autobots and then you tilted it would
turn<00:02:51.239> into<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.450> Decepticon<00:02:52.049> logo<00:02:52.200> dude<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.650> was

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
turn into a Decepticon logo dude it was

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.449 
turn into a Decepticon logo dude it was
so<00:02:52.950> rad

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
so rad

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.800 
so rad
that<00:02:53.760> would<00:02:53.849> be<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.180> cool<00:02:54.390> if<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.599> could<00:02:54.750> do

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that would be so cool if you could do

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.680 
that would be so cool if you could do
that<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.079> an<00:02:55.170> upper<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.829> specific<00:02:56.489> shoe<00:02:56.690> one

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
that on an upper on a specific shoe one

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.699 
that on an upper on a specific shoe one
of<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.840> shoes<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.170> think<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.500> they<00:02:58.590> can

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
of the shoes I think that they can

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.289 
of the shoes I think that they can
probably<00:02:58.860> pull<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.190> off<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.579> LeBron<00:02:59.819> 11

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
probably pull it off on is LeBron 11

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.000 
probably pull it off on is LeBron 11
because<00:03:00.540> there's<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.200> many<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.709> just

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
because there's so many like just

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.610 
because there's so many like just
regular<00:03:02.519> parts<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.810> shoe<00:03:04.049> where<00:03:04.290> they<00:03:04.440> can

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
regular parts on the shoe where they can

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.400 
regular parts on the shoe where they can
actually<00:03:04.739> make<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.569> do<00:03:06.569> that<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:06.930> that's<00:03:07.349> just

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
actually make it do that but that's just

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.140 
actually make it do that but that's just
my<00:03:07.620> two<00:03:07.680> cents<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.250> material<00:03:08.760> again<00:03:08.940> if<00:03:09.090> you

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
my two cents this material again if you

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.479 
my two cents this material again if you
look<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:09.480> close<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.930> looks<00:03:09.989> like<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:11.160> sort

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
look it up close it looks like that sort

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.640 
look it up close it looks like that sort
of<00:03:11.579> thing<00:03:11.780> that's<00:03:12.780> hard<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.049> tell<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.349> picture

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
of thing that's hard to tell in picture

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.350 
of thing that's hard to tell in picture
but<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:14.340> kind<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.549> gives<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.060> kind<00:03:15.329> of

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
but it kind of gives you that kind of

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.120 
but it kind of gives you that kind of
vibe<00:03:15.810> actually<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.650> really<00:03:16.739> doesn't<00:03:17.069> look

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
vibe actually it really doesn't look

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.039 
vibe actually it really doesn't look
like<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.120> camera<00:03:18.480> but

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
like that in the in the camera but

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.900 
like that in the in the camera but
hopefully<00:03:19.950> guys<00:03:20.069> know<00:03:20.370> what<00:03:20.459> I'm<00:03:20.519> saying<00:03:20.790> you

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
hopefully guys know what I'm saying you

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.280 
hopefully guys know what I'm saying you
know<00:03:20.940> what<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.150> mean<00:03:21.329> when<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.720> when<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.139> move

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
know what I mean when you when you move

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.280 
know what I mean when you when you move
it<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:22.709> changes<00:03:23.130> shapes<00:03:24.079> but<00:03:25.079> this

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
it in it just changes shapes but this

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.520 
it in it just changes shapes but this
material<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.190> kind<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.519> like<00:03:27.510> off<00:03:27.750> for<00:03:28.230> this

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
material is kind of like off for this

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.710 
material is kind of like off for this
because<00:03:28.889> you<00:03:28.980> can<00:03:29.100> see<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.670> kind<00:03:30.660> of

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
because you can see it like it kind of

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.830 
because you can see it like it kind of
indents<00:03:31.079> in<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.680> it's<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:32.160> not<00:03:32.690> it's<00:03:33.690> not

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
indents in and it's it's not it's not

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.050 
indents in and it's it's not it's not
very<00:03:34.079> smooth<00:03:34.530> like<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.220> makes<00:03:35.579> it<00:03:35.730> kind<00:03:35.910> of

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
very smooth like it makes it kind of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.900 
very smooth like it makes it kind of
wrinkled<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.600> stuff<00:03:36.870> across<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:37.920> other<00:03:38.790> than

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
wrinkled and stuff across so other than

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.300 
wrinkled and stuff across so other than
that<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.420> it's<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.380> looks<00:03:40.440> cool<00:03:40.829> at

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
that it's it's it's it looks cool at

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.009 
that it's it's it's it looks cool at
least<00:03:41.519> my<00:03:41.639> opinion<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.150> then<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
least my opinion and then you have the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.410 
least my opinion and then you have the
3m<00:03:43.530> reflective<00:03:43.650> across<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.400> toe<00:03:44.730> box<00:03:44.970> area<00:03:45.180> as

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
3m reflective across the toe box area as

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.270 
3m reflective across the toe box area as
well<00:03:45.600> which<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.560> don't<00:03:46.620> think<00:03:46.859> would<00:03:46.950> would

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
well which I don't think would would

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.620 
well which I don't think would would
cost<00:03:47.459> too<00:03:47.639> much<00:03:47.670> creasing<00:03:48.150> on<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.299> shoe<00:03:48.450> because

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
cost too much creasing on a shoe because

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.479 
cost too much creasing on a shoe because
of<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> way<00:03:49.109> that<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.859> was<00:03:50.040> actually<00:03:50.220> put

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
of the way that that it was actually put

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.479 
of the way that that it was actually put
together<00:03:50.609> just<00:03:51.540> small<00:03:52.200> toe<00:03:52.380> box<00:03:52.620> kind<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.250> Airy

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489

together just small toe box kind of Airy
right<00:03:53.730> here<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.060> then<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.660> bunch<00:03:55.019> of<00:03:55.139> stuff

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
right here and then a bunch of stuff

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.640
