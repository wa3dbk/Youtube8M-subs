00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.540 

I<00:00:00.089> guess<00:00:01.079> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.439> smart<00:00:01.709> physics<00:00:02.070> problem

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
I guess this is smart physics problem

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:14.150 
I guess this is smart physics problem
the<00:00:02.909> polarization<00:00:04.670> okay<00:00:07.130> so<00:00:08.130> we<00:00:08.670> have<00:00:13.130> we<00:00:14.130> have

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the polarization okay so we have we have

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.920 
the polarization okay so we have we have
a<00:00:14.610> stack<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.030> three<00:00:15.240> linear<00:00:16.490> polarizers<00:00:17.930> one

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
a stack of three linear polarizers one

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.859 
a stack of three linear polarizers one
two<00:00:19.109> three<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:20.160> get<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> ratio<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
two three you get the ratio of the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.950 
two three you get the ratio of the
intensity<00:00:22.789> three<00:00:23.789> over<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.840> initial

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
intensity three over the initial

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.920 
intensity three over the initial
intensity<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.220> equal<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:27.720> gave

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
intensity it's equal to this they gave

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.299 
intensity it's equal to this they gave
us<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> initial<00:00:28.550> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> initial<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> first

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
us the initial of the initial the first

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.600 
us the initial of the initial the first
angle<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> second<00:00:33.030> angle<00:00:33.420> okay<00:00:34.460> all<00:00:35.460> right

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
angle on the second angle okay all right

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.790 
angle on the second angle okay all right
so<00:00:36.410> we<00:00:37.410> saw<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.800> problem<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.020> the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.950 

intensity<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.100> which<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.000> after<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.570> gets<00:00:45.809> out

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
intensity one which is after it gets out

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.729 
intensity one which is after it gets out
of<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.219> will<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.210> equal<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.110 

high<00:00:52.739> initial<00:00:53.280> over<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.590> okay<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.090> all<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
high initial over to okay so all the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.860 
high initial over to okay so all the
lights<00:00:57.510> will<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.750> coming<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.410> different

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
lights will be coming in different

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
lights will be coming in different
shapes<00:01:00.870> or<00:01:01.199> whatever<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.789> only<00:01:03.000> thing

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
shapes or whatever but the only thing

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570 
shapes or whatever but the only thing
that's<00:01:03.600> gonna<00:01:03.809> pass<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.070> only

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
that's gonna pass it's the one with only

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.050 
that's gonna pass it's the one with only
this<00:01:08.299> with<00:01:09.299> only<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.900> 60<00:01:10.530> degrees<00:01:11.030> with<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
this with only like 60 degrees with the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.590 
this with only like 60 degrees with the
axis<00:01:12.630> okay<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.729> gonna<00:01:14.939> look<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.210> this

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
axis okay so it's gonna look like this

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.219 
axis okay so it's gonna look like this
when<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.900> comes<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:18.020> okay

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
when it comes out of it okay

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.850 
when it comes out of it okay
that's<00:01:20.009> how<00:01:20.189> gonna<00:01:20.430> look<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.820> kinda<00:01:21.740> okay<00:01:22.740> so

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that's how gonna look like kinda okay so

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.160 
that's how gonna look like kinda okay so
draw<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> we're<00:01:27.360> looking<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
draw one here so we're looking at this

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.740 
draw one here so we're looking at this
angle<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.890> let's<00:01:29.430> go<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.670> Phi<00:01:31.009> okay<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:33.479> we

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
angle here let's go to Phi okay and we

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.149 
angle here let's go to Phi okay and we
know<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.020> angle<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.650> theta<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> Phi

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
know this angle it's theta so the Phi

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.480 
know this angle it's theta so the Phi
will<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.520> equal<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:40.369> theta<00:01:41.369> 2<00:01:42.680> minus<00:01:43.680> theta<00:01:44.780> 1

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
will be equal to theta 2 minus theta 1

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.800 
will be equal to theta 2 minus theta 1
okay<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:49.310> we're<00:01:50.310> looking<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.000> 2<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.270> 2<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
okay so now we're looking at I 2 I 2 is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.069 
okay so now we're looking at I 2 I 2 is
after<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.290> passes<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.950> guy<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> 2<00:01:54.509> will<00:01:54.930> be

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
after it passes this guy so I 2 will be

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:04.459 
after it passes this guy so I 2 will be
equal<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:57.079> 1<00:01:59.509> then<00:02:01.009> cosine<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:12.360 

theta<00:02:05.469> 2<00:02:05.770> minus<00:02:05.799> theta<00:02:06.369> 1<00:02:07.920> squared<00:02:08.920> okay<00:02:11.370> all

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
theta 2 minus theta 1 squared okay all

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.930 
theta 2 minus theta 1 squared okay all
right<00:02:12.519> now<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:12.849> this<00:02:13.269> guy<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.010> now<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.910> only

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
right now for this guy so now the only

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.270 
right now for this guy so now the only
light<00:02:16.390> that's<00:02:16.630> gonna<00:02:16.900> pass<00:02:17.170> after<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:18.010> guy

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
light that's gonna pass after this guy

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.210 
light that's gonna pass after this guy
is<00:02:18.660> gonna<00:02:19.660> look<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:21.900> okay<00:02:23.069> do<00:02:24.069> the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
is gonna look like this okay do the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.850 
is gonna look like this okay do the
direct<00:02:24.519> transmitters<00:02:25.300> or<00:02:25.900> transmissions<00:02:26.680> or

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
direct transmitters or transmissions or

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.880 
direct transmitters or transmissions or
whatever<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:28.090> only<00:02:28.360> in<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:28.810> way<00:02:29.050> can<00:02:29.319> only

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
whatever it's only in this way can only

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.690 
whatever it's only in this way can only
pass<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.340> light<00:02:30.519> that<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.940> with<00:02:31.269> an<00:02:31.390> angle

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.289 

theta<00:02:36.700> 2<00:02:37.060> okay<00:02:38.430> okay<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:41.459> let's<00:02:42.459> draw<00:02:42.880> this<00:02:43.030> guy

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
theta 2 okay okay so let's draw this guy

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.910 
theta 2 okay okay so let's draw this guy
now<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:46.959> guy<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:50.470> whole<00:02:50.650> thing

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
now it's so this guy is the whole thing

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.839 
now it's so this guy is the whole thing
is<00:02:51.630> Theta<00:02:52.630> 2<00:02:55.019> okay<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.680> we<00:02:57.220> want<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.700> guy

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
is Theta 2 okay and we want this guy

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.089 
is Theta 2 okay and we want this guy
here<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.640> same<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.209> now<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.630> 3<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.410> 3<00:03:03.010> is

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
here so it's the same so now I 3 I 3 is

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.199 
here so it's the same so now I 3 I 3 is
what<00:03:03.430> goes<00:03:03.849> through<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.519> 3<00:03:06.970> will<00:03:07.060> be

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
what goes through this so I 3 will be

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:17.400 
what goes through this so I 3 will be
equal<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.720> 2<00:03:09.569> cosine<00:03:10.569> of<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:12.510> theta<00:03:13.510> 2<00:03:16.410> minus

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
equal to I 2 cosine of the theta 2 minus

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.300 
equal to I 2 cosine of the theta 2 minus
theta<00:03:20.130> 3

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.340 

theta<00:03:24.940> 2<00:03:25.180> minus<00:03:25.210> theta<00:03:25.510> 3<00:03:26.250> okay<00:03:27.870> all<00:03:28.870> right<00:03:29.020> so

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
theta 2 minus theta 3 okay all right so

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.040 
theta 2 minus theta 3 okay all right so
let's<00:03:29.680> plug<00:03:30.130> in<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.520> I<00:03:30.940> 1<00:03:31.360> in<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.720> equation

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
let's plug in the I 1 in this equation

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.290 
let's plug in the I 1 in this equation
here<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:32.850> we'll<00:03:33.850> get<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.330> 2<00:03:34.740> will<00:03:35.740> be<00:03:35.920> equal<00:03:35.950> to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
here so we'll get I 2 will be equal to

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.730 
here so we'll get I 2 will be equal to
then<00:03:37.300> I<00:03:37.480> 1<00:03:37.690> is<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.080> initial<00:03:38.620> over<00:03:39.610> 2<00:03:40.440> cosine<00:03:41.440> of

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
then I 1 is I initial over 2 cosine of

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.070 
then I 1 is I initial over 2 cosine of
theta<00:03:42.700> 2<00:03:43.090> minus<00:03:43.120> theta<00:03:43.660> 1<00:03:45.030> squared<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.930> then

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
theta 2 minus theta 1 squared and then

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.490 
theta 2 minus theta 1 squared and then
decide<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.709> plug<00:03:48.040> in<00:03:48.160> at<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.880> guy<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:50.140> it's<00:03:50.260> a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
decide to plug in at this guy so it's a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.449 
decide to plug in at this guy so it's a
3<00:03:50.890> will<00:03:51.070> be<00:03:51.220> equal<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:52.140> choose<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:53.590> naught

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
3 will be equal to I choose I naught

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.720 
3 will be equal to I choose I naught

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
over 2 cosine of theta minus theta 2

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.390 
over 2 cosine of theta minus theta 2
minus<00:04:00.760> theta<00:04:01.150> 1<00:04:01.390> squared<00:04:01.930> times<00:04:05.130> cosine<00:04:06.130> of

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
theta 2 minus theta 3 okay squirt all

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.280 
theta 2 minus theta 3 okay squirt all
right<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:12.910> since<00:04:13.120> we<00:04:13.330> know<00:04:13.450> this<00:04:13.600> ratio<00:04:13.900> let's

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
right so since we know this ratio let's

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.560 
right so since we know this ratio let's
take<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.650> ratio<00:04:15.010> because<00:04:15.910> we<00:04:16.090> need<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.390> find

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
take the ratio because we need to find

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.690 
take the ratio because we need to find
theta<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.350> question<00:04:17.709> is<00:04:17.859> only<00:04:18.070> asking<00:04:18.370> about

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
theta the question is only asking about

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.090 
theta the question is only asking about
theta<00:04:19.090> 3<00:04:20.010> okay<00:04:21.450> all<00:04:22.450> right<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:24.990> let's<00:04:25.990> take<00:04:26.260> so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
theta 3 okay all right so let's take so

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:35.190 
theta 3 okay all right so let's take so
it's<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.520> 3<00:04:28.120> over<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:29.190> naught<00:04:31.229> so<00:04:32.229> it's<00:04:32.350> 2<00:04:34.200> and

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
it's I 3 over I naught so it's 2 and

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.750 
it's I 3 over I naught so it's 2 and
then<00:04:36.070> we<00:04:36.520> have<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:37.030> guy<00:04:37.270> which<00:04:37.479> is<00:04:37.630> cosine<00:04:37.930> of

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
then we have this guy which is cosine of

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.219 
then we have this guy which is cosine of
theta<00:04:39.760> 2<00:04:40.150> minus<00:04:40.180> theta<00:04:40.630> 1<00:04:43.140> squared<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:46.229> yeah

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
theta 2 minus theta 1 squared and yeah

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.820 
theta 2 minus theta 1 squared and yeah
we<00:04:47.470> got<00:04:47.620> everything<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:48.550> now<00:04:48.729> it's<00:04:49.830> square

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
we got everything so now it's square

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
we got everything so now it's square
root<00:04:52.229> okay<00:04:54.870> so<00:04:55.870> then<00:04:56.110> we<00:04:56.200> will<00:04:56.320> get<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.860> cosine

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
root okay so then we will get the cosine

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:06.750 
root okay so then we will get the cosine
of<00:04:57.880> theta<00:04:58.780> 2<00:04:59.200> minus<00:04:59.229> theta<00:04:59.740> 3<00:05:01.500> okay<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:06.070> let's

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
of theta 2 minus theta 3 okay so let's

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.980 
of theta 2 minus theta 3 okay so let's
plug<00:05:07.060> in<00:05:07.240> numbers<00:05:08.250> 2<00:05:09.250> times<00:05:09.750> point<00:05:10.750> zero<00:05:11.340> 2

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
plug in numbers 2 times point zero 2

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.940 
plug in numbers 2 times point zero 2
this<00:05:13.990> is<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.200> ratio<00:05:15.240> divided<00:05:16.240> by<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.950> cosine

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
this is the ratio divided by the cosine

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:28.439 
this is the ratio divided by the cosine
of<00:05:19.169> 130<00:05:20.970> minus<00:05:22.290> theta<00:05:23.290> 1<00:05:23.410> theta<00:05:24.040> 1<00:05:24.220> was<00:05:24.580> 60<00:05:25.620> okay

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
of 130 minus theta 1 theta 1 was 60 okay

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:34.879 
of 130 minus theta 1 theta 1 was 60 okay
squared<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:30.340> square<00:05:30.729> root<00:05:33.210> then<00:05:34.210> after<00:05:34.569> that

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
squared this square root then after that

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.920 
squared this square root then after that
take<00:05:35.889> the<00:05:37.289> cosine<00:05:38.289> inverse<00:05:38.620> of<00:05:39.419> your<00:05:40.419> answer

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
take the cosine inverse of your answer

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.360 
take the cosine inverse of your answer
from<00:05:41.110> this<00:05:41.349> guy<00:05:41.849> plug<00:05:42.849> it<00:05:42.969> in<00:05:43.089> here<00:05:43.389> and<00:05:44.370> then

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
from this guy plug it in here and then

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.200 
from this guy plug it in here and then
the<00:05:45.639> answer<00:05:46.210> you<00:05:46.629> get<00:05:46.900> from<00:05:47.169> this<00:05:47.999> it's<00:05:48.999> going

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
the answer you get from this it's going

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.279 
the answer you get from this it's going
to<00:05:49.300> be<00:05:49.389> equal<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:51.509> theta<00:05:52.509> 2<00:05:52.749> minus<00:05:52.990> theta<00:05:53.559> 3<00:05:54.490> ok

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
to be equal to theta 2 minus theta 3 ok

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.350 
to be equal to theta 2 minus theta 3 ok
so<00:05:56.289> then<00:05:56.469> take<00:05:56.949> theta<00:05:57.219> 3<00:05:57.580> to<00:05:57.729> the<00:05:57.849> other<00:05:57.999> side

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
so then take theta 3 to the other side

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.260 
so then take theta 3 to the other side
there<00:05:59.349> are<00:05:59.499> 3<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.949> other<00:05:59.979> side<00:06:00.430> so<00:06:01.120> it's

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
there are 3 to the other side so it's

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.170 
there are 3 to the other side so it's
theta<00:06:01.569> 2<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:02.139> I'll<00:06:02.860> call<00:06:03.189> this<00:06:03.400> angle<00:06:03.879> here<00:06:04.060> is

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
theta 2 and I'll call this angle here is

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:12.329 
theta 2 and I'll call this angle here is
PI<00:06:04.509> minus<00:06:04.779> Phi<00:06:06.060> ok<00:06:07.979> so<00:06:10.439> so<00:06:11.439> my<00:06:11.589> Phi<00:06:11.889> in<00:06:12.159> this

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
PI minus Phi ok so so my Phi in this

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.379 
PI minus Phi ok so so my Phi in this
great<00:06:12.669> and<00:06:12.909> then<00:06:13.089> and<00:06:13.419> this<00:06:13.689> problem<00:06:14.110> was

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
great and then and this problem was

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.929 
great and then and this problem was
fifty<00:06:16.389> four<00:06:16.659> point<00:06:17.020> two<00:06:17.379> one

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:17.939 
fifty four point two one

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:26.149 
fifty four point two one
then<00:06:18.939> minus<00:06:19.479> 130<00:06:20.110> I<00:06:22.560> mean<00:06:23.560> my<00:06:24.460> theta<00:06:24.729> three<00:06:25.240> was

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
then minus 130 I mean my theta three was

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:31.189 
then minus 130 I mean my theta three was
seventy<00:06:27.159> five<00:06:27.339> point<00:06:27.639> seven<00:06:27.939> eight<00:06:28.589> degrees

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
seventy five point seven eight degrees

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.550 
seventy five point seven eight degrees
all<00:06:32.199> right

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
all right

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.050 
all right
hope<00:06:32.860> this<00:06:33.009> hope<00:06:33.249> and<00:06:33.779> good<00:06:34.779> luck
