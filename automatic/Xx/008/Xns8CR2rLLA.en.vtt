00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
assuming that this is for like the dull

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.920 
assuming that this is for like the dull
parts<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.930> this

parts and this is for like really this
is<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.350> kind<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> sharp<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.490> just

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
is for like kind of sharp and you just

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.560 
is for like kind of sharp and you just
want<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.820> kind<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.180> sure<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.479> really

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570

notice<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.840> thing

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
notice that there is a little thing

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.210 
notice that there is a little thing
right<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.649> don't<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
right here and you don't really have to

right here and you don't really have to
worry<00:01:50.310> about<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.820> unless<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
worry about this unless you have a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.160 
worry about this unless you have a
serrated<00:01:51.840> edge<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.880> once<00:01:53.880> i<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.149> d<00:01:54.960> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
serrated edge and once i get my d to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.959 
serrated edge and once i get my d to
extreme<00:01:55.890> series<00:01:56.280> i'll<00:01:56.460> show<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> guys<00:01:56.759> how<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
extreme series i'll show you guys how to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.480 
extreme series i'll show you guys how to
do<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> close<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.130> up

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
do that but it's going to close this up

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
do that but it's going to close this up
and<00:01:59.850> we're<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> use<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.469> part<00:02:01.740> first

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and we're going to use this part first

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.880 
and we're going to use this part first
so<00:02:02.790> what<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.590> grab<00:02:04.770> my

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
so what I like to do like to grab my

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.679 
so what I like to do like to grab my
blade<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.340> don't<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.909> serrated<00:02:06.240> edge<00:02:06.479> as

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
blade I don't have a serrated edge as

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.630 
blade I don't have a serrated edge as
you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.259> straight<00:02:07.560> blade<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you can see it's a straight blade so

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850 
you can see it's a straight blade so
there<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:08.940> no<00:02:09.270> serration<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.679> have<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
there is no serration if you do have a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.290 
there is no serration if you do have a
serrated<00:02:11.129> edge<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.489> want<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> start<00:02:11.910> where

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
serrated edge you want to start where

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.630 
serrated edge you want to start where
the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.309 
the
eration<00:02:12.910> ends<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:13.480> say<00:02:13.750> if<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.960> serration

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
eration ends so say if the serration

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.020 
eration ends so say if the serration
goes<00:02:14.530> up<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.550> want<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.760> start<00:02:15.910> it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
goes up to this you want to start it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.510 
goes up to this you want to start it
over<00:02:16.150> here<00:02:16.630> because<00:02:17.470> if<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:17.830> do<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.220> with

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
over here because if you do that with

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.580 
over here because if you do that with
the<00:02:18.640> serrations<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.690> serration<00:02:20.020> have<00:02:20.200> curves

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
the serrations the serration have curves

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.730 
the serrations the serration have curves
in<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> blade<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.220> it's<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.850> make<00:02:21.940> it

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
in the blade and it's going to make it

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.800 
in the blade and it's going to make it
the<00:02:23.740> serrations<00:02:24.220> kind<00:02:24.490> of<00:02:24.580> useless<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.630> that's

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
the serrations kind of useless so that's

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.660 
the serrations kind of useless so that's
what<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.410> know<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:26.680> tool<00:02:26.920> comes<00:02:27.190> into<00:02:27.459> play

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
would want to use it with the dull side

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.240 
would want to use it with the dull side
so<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.120> small<00:03:46.420> end<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:47.019> kind<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.440> like<00:03:47.650> what<00:03:48.220> I

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
so the small end so kind of like what I

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.949 
so the small end so kind of like what I
like<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.519> remember<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.150> silver<00:03:49.450> end<00:03:49.750> is

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
like to remember is the silver end is

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.740 
like to remember is the silver end is
the<00:03:50.079> dull<00:03:50.260> one<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.769> black<00:03:50.950> end<00:03:51.250> is<00:03:51.750> for

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
the dull one and the black end is for

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.699 
the dull one and the black end is for
not<00:03:53.500> dull<00:03:53.739> but<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.370> still<00:03:54.640> need<00:03:54.820> to<00:03:54.850> sharpen<00:03:55.060> it

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
not dull but I still need to sharpen it

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.620 
not dull but I still need to sharpen it
so<00:03:56.709> I<00:03:56.739> mean<00:03:56.950> it's<00:03:57.100> really<00:03:57.760> simple<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.150> sharpen

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
so I mean it's really simple to sharpen

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.539 
so I mean it's really simple to sharpen
a<00:03:58.660> knife<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:59.230> mean<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.799> could<00:03:59.980> get<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.310> stone

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
a knife I mean you could get the stone

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.640 
a knife I mean you could get the stone
obviously<00:04:01.239> but<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:01.630> mean<00:04:01.870> stone<00:04:02.140> does<00:04:02.350> cause<00:04:02.620> a

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
obviously but I mean stone does cause a

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.670 
obviously but I mean stone does cause a
little<00:04:03.040> bit<00:04:03.280> more<00:04:03.459> work<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:05.140> think<00:04:05.410> that

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
little bit more work and I think that

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.500 
little bit more work and I think that
personally<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.430> way<00:04:06.670> is<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.030> best<00:04:07.209> and

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
personally this way is the best and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.690 
personally this way is the best and
easiest<00:04:07.690> way<00:04:07.989> it's<00:04:08.709> kind<00:04:08.890> of<00:04:08.980> like<00:04:09.160> personally

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
easiest way it's kind of like personally

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.789 
easiest way it's kind of like personally
