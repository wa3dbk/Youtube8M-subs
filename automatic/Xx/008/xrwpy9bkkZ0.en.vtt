00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
all that nonsense and you pretty much

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.480 
all that nonsense and you pretty much
start<00:00:27.570> around<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.230> zombies<00:00:28.769> keep<00:00:29.010> coming<00:00:29.369> out

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
start around and zombies keep coming out

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.310

you<00:00:29.970> kill<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> zombies<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.929> if<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.080> last

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you kill the zombies and if you last

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.010 
you kill the zombies and if you last
level<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.149> last<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.540> next<00:00:33.719> wave

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
level one and if you last the next wave

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.290 
level one and if you last the next wave
will<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.290> level<00:00:34.559> two<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.250> kind<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.640> it's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
will be level two it's kind of like it's

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.990 
will be level two it's kind of like it's
kind<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:37.100> zombies<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.309> cod<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
kind of like zombies on cod so if you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.130 
kind of like zombies on cod so if you
play<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.570> pretty<00:00:39.690> much<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> same

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
play that it's pretty much the same

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.650 
play that it's pretty much the same
thing<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.559> guess<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.980> got<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.129> defend

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
thing and I guess you just got to defend

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.209 
thing and I guess you just got to defend
the<00:00:42.660> cake<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.200> guess<00:00:43.590> that's<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.100> all

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the cake I guess that's what it's all

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.639 
the cake I guess that's what it's all
about<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:45.510> pretty<00:00:45.750> simple<00:00:46.050> that's

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
about but it's pretty simple that's

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.810 
about but it's pretty simple that's
pretty<00:00:46.860> much<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.610> it'll<00:00:47.789> be
