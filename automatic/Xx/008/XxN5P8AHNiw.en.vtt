00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
so Joyner knives are something that are

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.220 
so Joyner knives are something that are
tough<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.430> get<00:00:05.790> as<00:00:05.940> sharp<00:00:06.270> as<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.720> really<00:00:06.990> want

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
tough to get as sharp as you really want

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.669 
tough to get as sharp as you really want
them<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.440> be<00:00:07.970> by<00:00:08.970> yourself<00:00:09.290> there's<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.380> local

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
them to be by yourself there's a local

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.830 
them to be by yourself there's a local
sharpening<00:00:11.370> service<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.120> I've<00:00:12.240> sent<00:00:12.660> them

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
sharpening service that I've sent them

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.480 
sharpening service that I've sent them
out<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.429> got<00:00:14.429> them<00:00:14.639> back<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.240> wasn't<00:00:15.929> very

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
out to got them back and I wasn't very

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.830 
out to got them back and I wasn't very
satisfied<00:00:17.490> with<00:00:17.730> how<00:00:17.850> sharp<00:00:18.210> they<00:00:18.390> got<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> it

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
satisfied with how sharp they got and it

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.090 
satisfied with how sharp they got and it
seems<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.170> they<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.560> put<00:00:19.740> them<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
seems like they just put them to a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.779 
seems like they just put them to a
grinder<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.850> get<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> bevel<00:00:21.449> right<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.789> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
grinder to get the bevel right and the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.609 
grinder to get the bevel right and the
edge<00:00:23.970> was<00:00:24.269> only<00:00:24.510> where<00:00:24.660> near<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:24.930> sharp<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.439> it

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
edge was only where near as sharp as it

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.529 
edge was only where near as sharp as it
takes<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.070> get<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> good<00:00:26.550> edge<00:00:26.730> from<00:00:27.359> your

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
takes to get a good edge from your

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.070 
takes to get a good edge from your
jointer

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
jointer

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.060 
jointer
so<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.250> basically<00:00:30.109> stole<00:00:31.109> an<00:00:31.349> idea<00:00:31.710> off<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
so I basically stole an idea off the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.610 
so I basically stole an idea off the
internet<00:00:32.369> there's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> fellow<00:00:32.969> who<00:00:33.210> makes

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
internet there's a fellow who makes

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.049 
internet there's a fellow who makes
blocks<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:34.920> these<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.520> Teflon<00:00:35.760> or

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
blocks like these out of Teflon or

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.280 
blocks like these out of Teflon or
plastic<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:36.930> something<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.590> oh<00:00:38.960> hi<00:00:39.960> fleece

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
internet who made these blocks for

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.200 
internet who made these blocks for
sharpening<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.829> Teflon<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.460> plastic<00:01:03.090> or

sharpening of Teflon or plastic or
something<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.970> angle<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:08.540> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
something and this angle here is the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.300 
something and this angle here is the
precise<00:01:10.080> angle<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:11.640> blade<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.310> this

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
precise angle of your blade and this

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.780 
precise angle of your blade and this
clamp<00:01:14.790> holds<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.110> knife<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.560> place<00:01:16.860> while<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
clamp holds the knife in place while you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.600 
clamp holds the knife in place while you
take<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.360> water<00:01:18.990> stone<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.040> should<00:01:20.430> say<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
take a water stone or I should say a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.280 
take a water stone or I should say a
series<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.150> different<00:01:21.540> grits<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.080> water

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
series of different grits of water

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.980 
series of different grits of water
stones<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.700> rub<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.119> over<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> top<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.720> it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
stones and you rub it over the top of it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.980 
stones and you rub it over the top of it
like<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.200> until<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.549> sharp<00:01:29.240> doing<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.600> with

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
like that until it's sharp doing it with

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.249 
like that until it's sharp doing it with
wood<00:01:31.759> had<00:01:32.759> an<00:01:32.939> engineer<00:01:33.450> point<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> me

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
wood had an engineer point out to me

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
wood had an engineer point out to me
that<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.500> might<00:01:34.619> not<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.159> precise<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that it might not be as precise as you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.550 
that it might not be as precise as you
need<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.770> with<00:01:37.770> jointer<00:01:38.640> knives<00:01:39.560> because

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
need to be with jointer knives because

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.819 
need to be with jointer knives because
this<00:01:40.829> edge<00:01:41.070> has<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.640> dead<00:01:42.090> flat<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> think

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
this edge has to be dead flat so I think

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.760 
this edge has to be dead flat so I think
it's<00:01:44.310> good<00:01:44.549> enough<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:44.880> touching<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.020> but

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it's good enough for touching it up but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.380 
it's good enough for touching it up but
I<00:01:46.799> think<00:01:46.920> from<00:01:47.280> time<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.700> time<00:01:47.729> I'll<00:01:48.119> still

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
I think from time to time I'll still

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
I think from time to time I'll still
have<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> send<00:01:49.020> them<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.770> bevel

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
have to send them out to get that bevel

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.319 
have to send them out to get that bevel
ground<00:01:50.759> down<00:01:51.110> I've<00:01:52.110> done<00:01:52.979> these<00:01:53.189> knives

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
ground down I've done these knives

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
ground down I've done these knives
it's<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:54.990> spare<00:01:55.320> set<00:01:55.619> I've<00:01:55.770> done<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> probably

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
it's my spare set I've done it probably

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.660 
it's my spare set I've done it probably
three<00:01:56.969> times<00:01:57.210> or<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.200> jig<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.490> get

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
three times or so on this jig and I get

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.639 
three times or so on this jig and I get
good<00:01:59.850> results<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> real<00:02:01.020> good<00:02:01.200> edge<00:02:01.380> off

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
good results I get a real good edge off

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.470 
good results I get a real good edge off
it<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.850> thought<00:02:03.180> I'd<00:02:03.329> share<00:02:04.170> this

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
it so I just thought I'd share this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:14.650 
it so I just thought I'd share this
method<00:02:05.810> with<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.730> start<00:02:13.970> off<00:02:14.120> with<00:02:14.270> my

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
method with you so you start off with my

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.040 
method with you so you start off with my
course<00:02:15.380> stone<00:02:16.030> not<00:02:17.030> sure<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.540> grid<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.900> this

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
course stone not sure the grid of this

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.920 
course stone not sure the grid of this

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
in this and I can see where I'm actually

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.390 
in this and I can see where I'm actually
cutting<00:02:56.090> where<00:02:56.600> I'm<00:02:56.780> wearing<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.890> away<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.370> I

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
cutting where I'm wearing it away and I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.460 
cutting where I'm wearing it away and I
want<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.790> line<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.210> be<00:02:59.630> even<00:03:00.080> all<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.350> way

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470

across

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.720 

so<00:03:10.110> before<00:03:10.590> proceeding<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.340> want<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.550> wipe

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
so before proceeding you want to wipe

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.840 
so before proceeding you want to wipe
off<00:03:12.000> all<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.600> stuff<00:03:13.460> because<00:03:14.460> that'll

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
off all this stuff because that'll

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.790 
off all this stuff because that'll
contain<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.600> coarse<00:03:15.960> grit<00:03:16.290> on<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.710> and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
contain that coarse grit on there and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.360 
contain that coarse grit on there and
you<00:03:16.920> don't<00:03:17.100> want<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:18.500> moving<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.070> next

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
you don't want it moving on to the next

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:28.850 
you don't want it moving on to the next
phase<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:26.550> now<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.730> got<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> two-sided<00:03:27.990> Japanese

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
phase so now I got a two-sided Japanese

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.580 
phase so now I got a two-sided Japanese
stone<00:03:31.880> kind<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.940> corresponds<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.660> soft

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
stone kind of corresponds to soft

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.610 
stone kind of corresponds to soft
Arkansas<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.610> hard<00:03:35.850> Arkansas<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:37.320> course<00:03:37.530> you

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620

Arkansas and hard Arkansas of course you
can't<00:03:37.830> be<00:03:37.980> Arkansas<00:03:38.550> if<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.940> Japanese

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
can't be Arkansas if it's a Japanese

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:52.820
