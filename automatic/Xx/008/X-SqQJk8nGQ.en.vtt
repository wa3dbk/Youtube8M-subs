00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.710
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.170
 a new video I'm after the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.120
 the owl and today I show you how 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.170
 you could be such a gossip and that is 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.630
 from this new app by snap i 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.279
 Vegan leather I'm so mistaken 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.980
 a bit of cardboard and songs 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.160
 but mix and I have all now 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.660
 colors of it I have everything there now and 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.859
 That's why there is a project again 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.410
 its app heartfelt that you guys 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.820
 wonder it makes quite funny I 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.170
 My girlfriend asked if I have one 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.469
 idea what can you do with it and so 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.940
 who said a clap yeah the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.950
 is not right yet 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 That's why I sewed this class 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.850
 here is a team on top 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.660
 The whole thing has flowers because I am 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.710
 gossip gossip clap a clutch 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.879
 without a handle always rather impractical 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.680
 The whole thing can then with a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.570
 open and close magnetic lock 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 or is really great idea to make 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.190
 it's really fast and then longer 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.899
 but just go and for the gossip 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.489
 you do not need much and that is 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.990
 but also here a piece of the snap 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.939
 I've already washed those before 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.200
 because that is recommended on a site 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.350
 and then gets the fact already so 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.180
 a leather look then you need 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.939
 every case a piece of cotton for 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.409
 on top of that would have to be in june but 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.180
 I 'm here for one now 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.780
 Decorative thicker can be what fabric 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.869
 decided 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.570
 and then you can need one here 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.920
 hook if you have an end there 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.520
 want to have or a little 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 girl 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.880
 you need a magnetic lock there 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.829
 can also be in the camp snap what advantages 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.710
 of course she wants to have it 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.020
 your sewing machine a ruler and a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.180
 scissors so then we come already to 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.930
 cut and I have mine mine 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.490
 piece cut to 50 x 30 cm 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.899
 Just clark it like this 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 together then you see the big that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.920
 somebody is after you can do that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.350
 virtually tackle individually yourself 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.030
 I'm still cutting the price off and on 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.490
 then come to 30 centimeters that was 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.200
 otherwise so wide the small brush against 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.670
 the side dashing but not away then 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.920
 I can still use a lot of ash 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.659
 For that I have to mess me up first 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.129
 I want that galleria 1 inch 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.289
 wide is that means I cut myself 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.270
 now here two centimeters apfalter one 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.790
 once in the middle and I need 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.760
 two pieces of it 120 in rheinnÃ¤he and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.020
 120 requests arrived next 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.760
 I can think of a piece of my 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.129
 fabric tailored to the top and bottom 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.319
 about 2 cm longer than mine 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.670
 daughter before I have to accept that 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.739
 but first up the magnetic lock 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.150
 then attach it to the uglier one 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.690
 Cloister of and in the fabric 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.690
 disappears 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.099
 so now we come to it too 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.540
 to take the fabric on the bag at 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.099
 best you work out the complete 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.170
 rand even as a very small piece 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.090
 inside so that does not matter 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.099
 franz and think of that too 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.540
 Front can take the fabric one to two times 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.970
 just hit it with it 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.920
 beautiful knew you then stuck the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.780
 once graze around 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.000
 and then you can too 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.530
 Approved along sewing fits that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.200
 they knew at the top and bottom 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.150
 the folded material with a diseased 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.040
 almost what you can do here as well 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.079
 is that you the pieces for the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.790
 I never got that 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.620
 once said the piece is shared 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.420
 about ten inches long and that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.620
 others are a lot longer but there you have to 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.629
 Just look her how long have it 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.819
 I wanted and I just go here now 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:31.220
 with a nice deco stings over and 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.220
 sew the two sides together individually 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.930
 so far so good now is missing 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.730
 not much what's next 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.370
 I'm that I'm already 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.870
 times in shape kink and then me the 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.090
 place for the lower magnetic lock 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.190
 Mark the upper one once 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.040
 shot relatively firmly on ours 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.320
 press brand and then be small 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.690
 hole and here I can 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.690
 just attach the bottom decision 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.890
 and now comes the last one 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.390
 step take your short munich 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.580
 and pack that up a bit 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.650
 between the bag on one side where 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.090
 her after that the correct answer i 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.940
 find me all this now someone like this 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.010
 round clip and now you go 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.230
 just the two sides of the bag 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.030
 once firmly in the beginning and at the end well 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.450
 lock and then should also in the 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.890
 principle already done now I just take 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.960
 even the longer side of the line 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.490
 once together if you all 40 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.860
 you can of course you too 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.840
 glue and I then attach the whole 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.700
 Just on the hook should be something like that 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.530
 long gossip when you're done 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.030
 I hope I had a lot of fun 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.500
 watch and maybe even after 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.540
 take if it's done after sends 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.760

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.060
 the comments 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.100
 if you already worked with the sap 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.380
 did you find the material knows it yes 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.810
 not so super super easy to work with 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.000
 but already not quite good and 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.560
 it's just a funny material and 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 what you did with it or what 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.770

 tinker our against that does not have to 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.050
 necessarily be sewn
