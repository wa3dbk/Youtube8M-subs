00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.170
 good people today we are here in another one 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.750
 sort of a boxing that is going to have a 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.260
 tutorial and what we are going to show you is 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.300
 how to run gta 5 in the tetris 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.970
 of old hand tetris that never played it 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.100
 that goes to batteries and we all know it with 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.380
 the buttons and all good the first thing that 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.470
 we must continue to ask the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.620
 just today from belarus 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.210
 I think it would be the box the box is that 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:43.420
 would contain or the console that you have to 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:46.150
 adapt is the ss s710 software that is 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.460
 the supreme control box which the 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.170
 let's connect using another device 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.769
 which is as if it were a little box 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.510
 then every one of this is connected 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.879
 Here is what makes me 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.430
 interference between the east module of 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.670
 control 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.460
 and what would be the tetris lead to this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 we're going to plug it in here back, not what 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.240
 can i show because in the genre 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.920
 destiny but well that go this goes and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.390
 comes this little box with a 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.900
 transformer as a humble 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.250
 unbranded transformer because you want 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.740
 we plug in the transformer here and go 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.350
 to enter the eye tab with the chips 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.440
 He is a bastard and is the record the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.690
 let's introduce here 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.090
 with a little to her once she enters 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.490
 we see how it starts to work 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.570
 for what is missing is playing here good and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.009
 we see how the light that marks 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.159
 the one that is on is because it is 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:52.719
 on and now finally we are missing 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.409
 lying here is common usb cable that all 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.439
 we know 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.299
 that will be a spectacular tune 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.230
 we plug it into this cable and the house 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.990
 crazy 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.990
 and for everything 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.539
 good as you will notice a good cut because 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.980
 the light was cut off so it's already 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.319
 Plugged in perfectly in the cable 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.819
 usb inside the crazy little box that makes 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.519
 interface with the controller box 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.959
 supreme and finally we will have 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.459
 plug it 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.859
 albert and game over here it just looks 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.939
 perfect as it comes here comes is 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.650
 plugged in once so we have to 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.150
 leave it about 15 minutes for the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.069
 Software finishes moving to install 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.109
 finally we also need like 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.650
 it came and also what the game would be 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.760
 own not in gt hd full from rockstar 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.909
 let's open it this is totally 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.210
 again they realize they have the facet of 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.440
 security 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.440
 let's open it 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.880
 let's open it 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:57.330
 let's open for the mother to leave 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.780

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.510
 new 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.760
 and this is going to be inserted once it 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.230
 install the software with one thing that 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.260
 software the controller and another one is that 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.270
 when we can move the game itself a 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.200
 Once the software is installed, we will 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.569
 proceed to place it 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.940
 to place them if you do not leave it to the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.970
 place them as I said in case you do not 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.040
 where we proceed to see if it looks has been 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.800
 on fire to see you in case you 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.710
 do not walk we proceed to your planet 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.330

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.060
 high speed interactive cartridge 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.190
 of regeneration and once we shall 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.720
 wait approximately 15 minutes until 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.330
 that is finished passes the software and 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.610
 we come back when the game is already good and 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.380
 finally we are here in gta 5 we see 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.670
 how it says how this machine moves it 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.560
 we do not see that the frames per second is 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.000
 we can run, we can miss the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.290

 yellow button on the top right 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.300
 there we go down to the lady we see that the 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.640
 camera can be moved the same without any 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.980
