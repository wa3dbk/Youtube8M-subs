00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and I

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.710 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and I
touched<00:00:02.460> over<00:00:02.700> this<00:00:02.790> topic<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.210> little<00:00:03.240> bit<00:00:03.600> in

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
touched over this topic a little bit in

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.960 
touched over this topic a little bit in
a<00:00:03.780> commentary<00:00:04.230> but<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:04.950> wanted<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.430> go<00:00:05.580> just<00:00:05.879> a

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
a commentary but I wanted to go just a

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.340 
a commentary but I wanted to go just a
bit<00:00:06.000> more<00:00:06.299> in<00:00:06.420> depth<00:00:06.629> when<00:00:06.839> it<00:00:06.960> comes<00:00:07.170> to

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
bit more in depth when it comes to

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.180 
bit more in depth when it comes to
fighting<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:07.980> no<00:00:08.069> reason<00:00:08.490> let's<00:00:09.330> get<00:00:09.480> started

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
fighting for no reason let's get started

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.470 
fighting for no reason let's get started
now<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.250> thing<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.269> reality

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
now the thing is is that in reality

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.860 
now the thing is is that in reality
kills<00:00:13.110> alone<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:14.309> not<00:00:14.490> really<00:00:15.120> increase<00:00:15.690> your

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
kills alone do not really increase your

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.760 
kills alone do not really increase your
lead<00:00:16.020> by<00:00:16.230> very<00:00:16.500> much<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.130> full-on<00:00:18.170> 045<00:00:19.170> ace<00:00:19.439> is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
lead by very much a full-on 045 ace is

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.670 
lead by very much a full-on 045 ace is
going<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.340> get<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.730> around<00:00:21.090> 2,000<00:00:22.050> raw<00:00:22.260> gold

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
going to get you around 2,000 raw gold

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.310 
going to get you around 2,000 raw gold
whereas<00:00:23.550> objectives<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.240> towers<00:00:24.720> dragons

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
whereas objectives like towers dragons

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.500 
whereas objectives like towers dragons
and<00:00:25.529> barons<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:26.430> only<00:00:26.820> create<00:00:27.090> loads<00:00:27.359> of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and barons not only create loads of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.269 
and barons not only create loads of
pressure<00:00:27.810> while<00:00:28.140> also<00:00:28.380> opening<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> map

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
pressure while also opening up the map

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.429 
pressure while also opening up the map
for<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:30.150> also<00:00:30.359> give<00:00:30.630> comparable<00:00:31.050> gold

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
for you they also give comparable gold

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.160 
for you they also give comparable gold
amounts<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> decent<00:00:32.219> number<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.669> kills<00:00:33.170> but

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
amounts to a decent number of kills but

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.900 
amounts to a decent number of kills but
of<00:00:34.290> course<00:00:34.559> kills<00:00:35.010> lead<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.880> getting

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
of course kills lead to you getting

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.130 
of course kills lead to you getting
those<00:00:36.420> objectives<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.370> always<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.840> true

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
those objectives but not always the true

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
those objectives but not always the true
power<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.530> kills<00:00:40.950> lies<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> fact<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
power of kills lies in the fact that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.900 
power of kills lies in the fact that
they<00:00:42.629> directly<00:00:43.170> lead<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.680> objectives<00:00:44.280> but

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
they directly lead to objectives but

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.369 
they directly lead to objectives but
when<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.450> prepare<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.200> fight

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
when you do not prepare for fight

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.830 
when you do not prepare for fight
properly<00:00:46.739> even<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.940> win<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.360> fight<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
properly even if you win the fight it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.139 
properly even if you win the fight it
will<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.530> result<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.309> big<00:00:50.489> advantage<00:00:51.000> over

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
will not result in a big advantage over

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.910 
will not result in a big advantage over
your<00:00:51.390> opponent<00:00:51.449> because<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:52.500> not<00:00:52.680> be

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
your opponent because you will not be

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.549 
your opponent because you will not be
able<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.250> take<00:00:53.430> objectives<00:00:54.320> fighting<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
able to take objectives fighting for a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.729 
able to take objectives fighting for a
reason<00:00:56.329> maximizes<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> potential<00:00:58.079> reward<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
reason maximizes the potential reward of

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.610 
reason maximizes the potential reward of
a<00:00:58.920> fight<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.690> you<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.020> by<00:01:01.379> positioning

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
a fight and you do this by positioning

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.020 
a fight and you do this by positioning
your<00:01:02.010> team<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.850> take

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
your team so that you can take

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.329 
your team so that you can take
objectives<00:01:03.600> after<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> fight<00:01:04.290> usually<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
objectives after a fight usually this

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.460 
objectives after a fight usually this
means<00:01:05.519> pushing<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.270> lanes<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.290> can

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
means pushing out your lanes or it can

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.050 
means pushing out your lanes or it can
mean<00:01:07.500> fighting<00:01:07.979> your<00:01:08.130> dragon<00:01:08.490> or<00:01:08.580> Baron<00:01:08.820> but

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
mean fighting your dragon or Baron but

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.609 
mean fighting your dragon or Baron but
that<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.600> bit<00:01:09.750> riskier<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.500> gives

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
that is a little bit riskier as it gives

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.230 
that is a little bit riskier as it gives
your<00:01:10.740> opponent<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> same<00:01:11.490> option<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.030> they

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
your opponent the same option if they

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.539 
your opponent the same option if they
beat<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> fight<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.130> mostly

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
beat you in the fight but what it mostly

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.719 
beat you in the fight but what it mostly
means<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.630> stop<00:01:16.049> going<00:01:16.350> mid<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:17.040> no<00:01:17.220> reason

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
means is to stop going mid for no reason

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.030 
means is to stop going mid for no reason
so<00:01:18.450> many<00:01:18.479> teams<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.140> push<00:01:19.439> mid<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.920> they

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
so many teams just push mid when they

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.649 
so many teams just push mid when they
don't<00:01:20.189> know<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:21.420> there's<00:01:21.600> no

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
don't know what to do when there's no

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.539 
don't know what to do when there's no
objective<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.470> because<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> siege<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.400> not

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
objective there because the siege is not

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.310 
objective there because the siege is not
something<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.150> break<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:24.810> perhaps<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
something they can break or perhaps the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.719 
something they can break or perhaps the
inhibit<00:01:25.680> already<00:01:25.950> down<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.340> something<00:01:26.549> like

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
inhibit already down or something like

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.179 
inhibit already down or something like
that<00:01:26.790> push<00:01:27.720> side<00:01:27.990> lanes<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.560> fight<00:01:28.799> near<00:01:29.009> them

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that push side lanes and fight near them

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.010 
that push side lanes and fight near them
and<00:01:29.340> increase<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.030> overall<00:01:30.210> map<00:01:30.689> pressure

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
and increase the overall map pressure

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.640 
and increase the overall map pressure
you<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.740> your<00:01:32.070> opponents<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you have on your opponents and so you

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.249 
you have on your opponents and so you
almost<00:01:35.130> never<00:01:35.579> want<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.479> fight<00:01:36.720> where

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
almost never want to be in a fight where

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.780 
almost never want to be in a fight where
you<00:01:37.290> cannot<00:01:37.799> use<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.220> fight<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> take

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you cannot use the fight to take

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.149 
you cannot use the fight to take
objectives<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.630> come<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.110> top<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
objectives if you come out on top the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.859 
objectives if you come out on top the
only<00:01:41.430> situation<00:01:41.640> where<00:01:42.119> you're<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.750> be

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
only situation where you're going to be

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
only situation where you're going to be
forced<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.490> your<00:01:44.610> team<00:01:44.850> is

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
forced to do that is if your team is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.210 
forced to do that is if your team is
already<00:01:45.210> behind<00:01:45.689> by<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> pretty<00:01:46.590> significant

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
already behind by a pretty significant

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.219 
already behind by a pretty significant
amount<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> game<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.329> has<00:01:48.689> lost<00:01:48.990> map

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
amount in the game and has lost map

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.080 
amount in the game and has lost map
control<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.920> that's<00:01:50.369> why<00:01:50.549> losing<00:01:50.939> map

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
control and that's why losing map

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
control and that's why losing map
control<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.750> significant<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
control is so significant because it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.679 
control is so significant because it
costs<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> ability<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.149> fight<00:01:54.479> over

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
costs you the ability to fight over

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.440 
costs you the ability to fight over
objectives<00:01:55.579> biting<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.790> no<00:01:56.909> reason<00:01:57.329> is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
objectives biting for no reason is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.840 
objectives biting for no reason is
incredibly<00:01:58.170> inefficient<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> main

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
incredibly inefficient and it's the main

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
incredibly inefficient and it's the main
reason<00:02:00.210> why<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.479> see<00:02:00.630> bronze<00:02:00.930> games<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.500> stuff

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
reason why we see bronze games and stuff

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.230 
reason why we see bronze games and stuff
like<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.860> rack<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.700> even<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> hundred

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
like that rack up to even a hundred

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.590 
like that rack up to even a hundred
kills<00:02:03.689> or<00:02:03.899> more<00:02:04.229> while<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> LCS<00:02:05.549> games<00:02:05.880> rarely

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
kills or more while the LCS games rarely

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.380 
kills or more while the LCS games rarely
ever<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.409> above<00:02:07.799> 30<00:02:08.190> kills<00:02:08.520> while<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> good

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
ever go above 30 kills while a good

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.990 
ever go above 30 kills while a good
portion<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.899> them<00:02:10.080> even<00:02:10.259> stay<00:02:10.739> below<00:02:10.979> 20<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.790> 10

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
portion of them even stay below 20 to 10

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.380 
portion of them even stay below 20 to 10
kills<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.200> when

kills and when

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.420 
kills and when
do<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.660> properly<00:02:14.020> your<00:02:14.440> plays<00:02:14.680> become<00:02:15.040> so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
do this properly your plays become so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.120 
do this properly your plays become so
efficient<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.330> every<00:02:16.870> advantage<00:02:17.260> makes<00:02:17.680> such

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
efficient and every advantage makes such

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.980 
efficient and every advantage makes such
a<00:02:18.400> bigger<00:02:18.910> difference<00:02:19.270> than<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.810> would

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
a bigger difference than it would

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.680 
a bigger difference than it would
normally<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.740> can<00:02:21.220> turn<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.430> close<00:02:21.790> game<00:02:22.060> into

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
normally and can turn a close game into

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.449 
normally and can turn a close game into
an<00:02:22.810> easy<00:02:23.080> stomp<00:02:23.620> because<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.069> all<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
an easy stomp because of all the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.610 
an easy stomp because of all the
pressure<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:26.020> creates<00:02:26.350> such

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
pressure you have and that creates such

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.949 
pressure you have and that creates such
a<00:02:26.650> big<00:02:26.890> advantage<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:28.030> much<00:02:28.209> more<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.720> than<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
a big advantage so much more so than the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.080 
a big advantage so much more so than the
actual<00:02:29.170> gold<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.860> would<00:02:30.010> get<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:33.090> that's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
actual gold you would get and that's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.520 
actual gold you would get and that's
