 west palm beach with a phrase at the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.410
 inches and of course as he told them 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.350
 high lizette accumulated over the region 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.210
 depends on the country already surpassing almost 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.950
 an inch and a half rain 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.840
 continue to notice on the radar 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.120
 the heavy rains are still pouring 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.650
 portions of miami-dade portions of the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.930
 Bay of Biscayne and of course 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.150
 sporadic and intermittent downpours 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.010
 towards the brawer county region all 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.650
 those downpours will continue all thanks 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.900
 to a front band is stationary the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.640
 which continues to leave a lot of humidity to 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.420
 across the entire region and of course 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.070
 we have 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 here what we are watching in the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.549
 tropic for now bringing strong 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.740
 rains to the entire region of the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.420
 Yucatan peninsula and the center 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.950
 national hurricane is being given a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.590
 50 percent chance of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.259
 development already during the next 24 a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.259
 48 hours of course we here in 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.210
 telemundo51 we will continue to monitor this 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.009
 very very closely anyway what 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.170
 we will directly affect 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.140
 us here for the next two 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.149
 days would be this frontal band which 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.940
 it will be pretty pretty stationary 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.140
 for Monday on Tuesday so no 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.200
 save that for water tomorrow 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.810
 they will definitely need it 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.299
 I have them all until night 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.710
 the forecasts from the time already in the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.710
 segment of time we continue with more 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.830
 and good night, I hope you are 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.350
 enjoying tonight although it has been 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.000
 a slightly rainy night along 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.100
 all south florida in fact with 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.890
 high accumulated rainfall in some 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.510
 regions we started the segment of the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.100
 time by taking a brief look at the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.830
 atmospheric conditions throughout 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.170
 the entire Caribbean basin we noticed 75 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.780
 degrees for CamagÃ¼ey Cuba of course 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.940
 in kingston jamaica with 82 degrees and 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.940
 we noticed is located where most 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.300
 part of the cloudiness affecting large 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.550
 part of the western portion of Cuba and 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.860
 course all the southern portion of the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.300
 florida we noticed a lot of strong cloudiness 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.550
 downpours which will continue to fall 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.170
 We have a low pressure system on 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.700
 which continues to develop and the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.650
 national hurricane center is giving 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.860
 50 percent development during 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.840
 the next 24 to 48 hours and we 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.030
 here we will continue to monitor this 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.190
 system for now we care about 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.320
 a stationary band which continues 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.790
 leaving a lot of strong cloudiness 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.230
 downpours throughout the south of 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.600
 the florida so a lot of caution 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.940
 especially during night hours and 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.610
 also for the next two days already 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.190
 that the rains continue 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.630
 throughout the entire region the radar 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.220
 during the last six hours we 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.660
 shows the strong storms which 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.090
 affected portions of miami dade 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.210
 also strong storms affecting 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.070
 portions of south broward county 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.990
 while west ham beach is nothing more 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.950
 is left with some showers very very 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.300
 scattered 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.520
 Currently temperatures are quite 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.320
 fresh thanks to all this cloudiness 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.120
 which has caused these temperatures to 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.540
 stay very fresh even during the day 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.430
 at the maximum today he barely reached about 82 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.810
 degrees the rains will continue in the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.180
 course of the night so 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.760
 caution accumulated rain in 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.310
 the forecast for the next 24 hours 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.930
 we noticed that already for this Monday by the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.420
 night we would be talking possibly 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.640
 of accumulated highs some portions of 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.050
 miami dade also towards the region of 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.780
 the keys we would be talking about 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.120
 accumulated up to 3 inches so 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.310
 caution some southern portions of 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.920
 broward and north of miami-dade up to 2 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.050
 inches and of course decrease the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.610
 cumulative of eventual 20 makes portions 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.400
 from west bromvich and of course towards the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.630
 also keycorp and ney region 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.460
 anyway you have to continue 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.550
 exercising great caution 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.040
 there is a flood warning for 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.380
 portions of miami dade and also of 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.540
 brawer until 12 and 15 tonight 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.160
 the maritime forecast caution 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.600
 also not only for 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.670
 small markings during 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.760
 next 24 hours but also for the 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.920
 bathers as there will be a high risk of 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.850
 rip currents throughout all 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.870
 the caution beach portion this Monday 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.390
 we will continue with the same lot of breeze 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.130
 throughout the day high gusts the 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.630
 which can reach up to 25 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.430
 miles per hour 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.630
 sporadic storms but if the rain 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.400
 it will be quite present 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.530
 intermittently the temperatures will 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.050
 will be in the low range of the 80s 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.870
 degrees on Tuesday 84 degrees the downpours 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.790
 continue to start approaching a band 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.190
 frontal already by the middle of this week 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.990
 labor and of course the conditions 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.510
 they cleave wit have the temperatures 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.010
 in the low range of 80 degrees 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.410
 thankfully so these are 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.710
 excellent news seems to be that the 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.990
 mother nature will bring us some 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.300
 cool now to finish this week 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.370
 labor and temperatures for the 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.270
 Wednesday night and Thursday 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.940
 tomorrow we would be 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.120
 minimum temperatures in the low range to 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.710
 half of the 60 degrees and of course 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.750
 increases the possibility of rain 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.360
 already for the beginning of the next end of 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.340
 week I wish you a very happy evening 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.340
 course an excellent work week
