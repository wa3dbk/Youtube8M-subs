00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.940
 so that you the following video I show 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.820
 you guys like you on your mac pro and also 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.929
 at your new mac pro or each 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:17.199
 other mac with two lan interfaces 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.820
 this one joins together so the 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:24.789
 two lan ethernet ports to one 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.640
 merge virtual port and thus 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.960
 a significantly faster data throughput 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.960
 reached volume 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.170
 very briefly to explain the whole name 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.450
 also link aggregation comes from 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.070
 the company cisco and was originally 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.150
 designed for it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.480
 two ethernet switches as fast as possible 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.820
 to connect or even to each other 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.980
 surfers as fast as possible in the network 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.710
 reachable and the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.739
 to double data throughput means 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.840
 Do you have a 100 megabit and another 100? 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.200
 megabit network card you have 200 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.820
 Megabit theoretically you have two 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.100
 gigabit ethernet ports and the new one 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.650
 mac pro or even the old mac pro 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.170
 then you have two gigabit and like that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.869
 I'll show you now for now 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.110
 I go to the system settings go 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.259
 then in network and you see i have 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.550
 here at my mac pro ethernet 1 and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.720
 ethernet 2 like that does not matter 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.360
 both are currently with a fritz box 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.020
 connected with two different ip 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.330
 addresses 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.640
 I do not want that, I want it now 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.440
 create a port where both 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.560
 bundled together 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.290
 For this I click on the gear say 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.030
 Manage virtual connections and 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.030
 create me with the plus here a new one 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.900
 I choose this connection bundling 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:06.030
 ethernet 1 and ipad 2 gives the whole 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:10.070
 then say a name and say create 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.110
 finished afterwards is my ethernet 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.570
 bundling here too I 've got connected 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.420
 just an ip-address and in the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.000
 Other options I see that just the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.209
 connection name ethernet bundling means 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.220
 where it misspelled here 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.720
 Therefore, we rename the whole thing once 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.080
 rename say and now fits too 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.660
 again 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.790
 I go back to the other options 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:40.890
 and she just in derry finds bundling 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.400
 ethernet 1 and ethernet 2 are connected 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.900
 I have an IP address and that was 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.490
 it that i say use it once 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.980
 the name here now synonymous correctly 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.530
 is also displayed in the other 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.740
 options and therefore I have the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.680
 fastest possible data throughput for 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.890
 my mac so in my case the mac 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.490
 per achieved and theoretically have two 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.330
 gigabit with my two 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.540
 network connections please pay attention 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.220
 a fact if you have active switches 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.390
 then you have to use the left one 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.120
 also activate creation on this trip 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.010
 That's from model to model 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.380
 different and unfortunately it does not have to 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.540
 with every hardware you use 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.230
 I have one here 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.780
 active manager cisco switched at the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.640
 I have the two ports for now 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.190
 link aggregation enabled and like you 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.780
 See, that works too, I hope you 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.390
 The video is helpful and I hope 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.400
 you can do it if you two 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.489
 ethernet connections have this easy 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.640
 bundle and higher data throughput 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.170
 to reach 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.200
 I would be glad if you also in 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.959
 a channel looks over 320 more 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.030
 videos around the topic apple and his 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.620
 chips station but would be great then 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.959
 you are always up to date 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.989
 stand of my videos finds me too 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.000
 facebook google + and twitter if you're there 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.480
 times vorbeischaut would be great as well 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.910
 my website www.vox.de not only the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.829
 videos a complete video list and 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.549
 more content just times 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.769
 drop by 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.450
 I say thank you very much 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.600
 for watching and see you next time 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.600
 ciao
