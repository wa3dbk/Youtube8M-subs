00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.020
 Well, we have daily profits 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.580
 Portuguese say that raúl jiménez 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.990
 could be intended sought by the 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.570
 port lord autumn valley has 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.339
 conditions to reach the divisions 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.049
 aside is a league that would come 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.910
 well get first not usually the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.440
 Portuguese league French league the league 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.390
 Dutch are the good leagues for 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.130
 settle down consolidate and then 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.740
 try to give the jump to a league 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.030
 more important now one thing is to get 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.320
 and another thing is to become the 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.880
 reference of attack this team 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.260
 used to big forwards like 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.330
 Radamel Falcao Garcia as a jackson 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.599
 martínez that is a very very situation 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.250
 different 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.739
 I think he 's a very footballer 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.420
 complete that can top off head 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.730
 accommodate with the two profiles works 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.589
 well of post and with all due respect for 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.059
 francisco fonseca if he can reach 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.559
 a team like the benfica 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.539
 raúl jiménez has better conditions 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.699
 football and it's not personal with the 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.010
 kikin to be able to stand out in a league like 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.449
 I think that the elements and also the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.579
 character has you remember that in 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.829
 america are few forwards that have 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.659
 had the opportunity to participate as 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.850
 headlines miguel herrera gave it to him and he 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.070
 he stayed he stands out with friendly teams 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.509
 of the network please steal the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.259
 kikin fonseca with respect to what has 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.780
 said the Lord because good merchant of 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.569
 agreement is shameless it also has good 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.670
 then we steal alvarito for myself yes yes 

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:17.509

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.789
 what you want 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.640
 - the portfolio finally has conditions 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:26.420
 physical and football and mental 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.920
 succeed there in portugal I think that 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.470
 a good step would be a good 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.970
 platform but I do not know if to generate or 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.799
 get to occupy it 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.510
 falcao start the physical theme will not have 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.040
 to work far beyond qualities 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.140
 why but I think if you still 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.970
 missing to be able to eventually arrive in 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.110
 English football I think yes meditate 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.390
 work the physical but it happens to all 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.770
 Mexicans go to Europe spa 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.980
 liquefied and already with that recipes 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.980
 eyes 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.880
 then we all agree that it has 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.290
 conditions at least for portugal and 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.020
 sure we hope it becomes a reality 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.340
