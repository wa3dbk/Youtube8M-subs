00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
attacking mid and then the team of the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.060 
attacking mid and then the team of the
season<00:04:35.390> man<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.720> up<00:04:35.870> front<00:04:36.140> so<00:04:36.290> if<00:04:36.620> I<00:04:36.890> win

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
guys they had polio and I think rule

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.180

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
albiol back there in defense so

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.160 
albiol back there in defense so

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
obviously not a very quick defense and

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.810
