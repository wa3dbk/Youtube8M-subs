for<00:00:20.970> at<00:00:21.060> least<00:00:21.210> two<00:00:21.570> kinds<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.230> shimmies<00:00:22.679> that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
for at least two kinds of shimmies that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.769

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
belly dancer you're just getting started

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.420 
belly dancer you're just getting started
you<00:00:29.669> want<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> perfect<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:31.140> shimmy<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:32.189> we

you<00:00:35.550> two<00:00:35.820> different<00:00:36.210> kinds<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.990> give<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.740> a

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
you two different kinds and give you a

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.470 
you two different kinds and give you a
couple<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.280> different<00:00:38.700> tips<00:00:38.970> that<00:00:39.150> will<00:00:39.420> make

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
couple of different tips that will make

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.240 
couple of different tips that will make
it<00:00:39.750> easier<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.230> you

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.020 

after<00:00:47.250> you've<00:00:47.429> stretched<00:00:47.989> we<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.170> begin

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
after you've stretched we can begin

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.099 
after you've stretched we can begin
practicing<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> two<00:00:51.390> different<00:00:51.719> kinds<00:00:52.019> of

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
practicing the two different kinds of

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.779 
practicing the two different kinds of
shimmies<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.769> what<00:00:53.339> is<00:00:53.429> called<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
shimmies here what is called the

Egyptian shimmy which is really from the

Egyptian shimmy which is really from the
means<00:00:56.089> belly<00:00:57.089> dance<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.899> bit<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
means belly dance it's a bit of a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.099 
means belly dance it's a bit of a
misnomer<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.210> created

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
misnomer there because it's not created

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.859 
misnomer there because it's not created
from<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.769> belly<00:01:01.979> that's<00:01:02.610> just<00:01:02.969> where<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
from the belly that's just where the

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.190 
from the belly that's just where the
motion<00:01:04.259> shows<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.489> energy<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> transferred

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
motion shows up as energy is transferred

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.889 
motion shows up as energy is transferred
through<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.619> floor<00:01:08.149> as<00:01:09.149> potential<00:01:09.750> energy

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
through the floor as potential energy

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.260

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.460 

so<00:02:34.730> that's<00:02:34.939> the<00:02:35.209> Egyptians<00:02:35.810> shimmy<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.319> you

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
so that's the Egyptians shimmy and you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.500 
so that's the Egyptians shimmy and you
can<00:02:36.620> say<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.040> for<00:02:37.220> quite<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.489> long<00:02:37.730> time<00:02:38.030> it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
can say that for quite a long time it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.809 
can say that for quite a long time it
should<00:02:38.900> not<00:02:39.079> hurt<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.129> it's<00:02:40.310> really<00:02:40.579> about

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
should not hurt and it's really about

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.929 
should not hurt and it's really about
how<00:02:41.510> much<00:02:41.709> extension<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:42.829> can<00:02:42.860> get<00:02:43.189> forward

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
how much extension you can get forward

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.509 
how much extension you can get forward
in<00:02:44.060> back<00:02:44.269> take<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.230> from<00:02:45.560> one<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.069> my<00:02:46.250> teachers

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519

I'm<00:02:57.709> doing<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.069> hip<00:02:58.280> shimmy<00:02:58.579> it's<00:02:59.299> a<00:02:59.420> slightly

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
I'm doing the hip shimmy it's a slightly

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.690 
I'm doing the hip shimmy it's a slightly

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
different posture when I think about

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.649 
different posture when I think about
pulling<00:03:02.689> the<00:03:02.989> pelvis<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.680> SB<00:03:04.430> tail<00:03:05.120> dog<00:03:05.390> goes

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
slightly and do you just a very very

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.330 
slightly and do you just a very very
light<00:03:09.890> sit<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:11.480> way<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.560> energy<00:03:13.010> is

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
actually living transfers more right and

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.180 
still working but there's not the sense
of<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.599> legs<00:03:20.900> going<00:03:21.230> forward<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.769> back<00:03:21.950> as

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.730 
the best way to get used to both of them
it's<00:03:36.520> actually<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.030> do<00:03:37.240> them<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.840> tandem<00:03:38.260> and
