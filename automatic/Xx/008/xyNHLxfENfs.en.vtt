the team's response immediately after
that<00:00:11.540> you<00:00:12.540> know<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.690> think<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.049> dynasty<00:00:13.410> still

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
that you know I think the dynasty still

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.990 
that you know I think the dynasty still
there<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:14.070> find<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.429> four<00:00:14.639> tournaments

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
there we find a four tournaments

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.849 
there we find a four tournaments
together<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.750> made<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.080> finals<00:00:16.440> everyone

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
together and we made the finals everyone

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.099 
together and we made the finals everyone
you<00:00:17.460> know<00:00:17.550> second<00:00:18.029> three<00:00:18.150> times<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:18.720> out<00:00:18.900> they

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
you know second three times all out they

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
you know second three times all out they
can<00:00:19.350> win<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.980> Grand<00:00:20.189> Chamber<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:21.090> know

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
can win the Grand Chamber of you know

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.300 
can win the Grand Chamber of you know
world<00:00:21.330> championships<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.260> think<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.160> say

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
world championships so I think to say

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.679 
world championships so I think to say
that<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> dynasties<00:00:23.939> killed<00:00:24.180> maybe<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> win

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
that the dynasties killed maybe the win

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.029 
that the dynasties killed maybe the win
streaks<00:00:24.930> killed<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.920> have

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
streaks killed but I think that we have

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.560 
streaks killed but I think that we have
a<00:00:26.430> lot<00:00:26.609> more<00:00:26.699> tournaments<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.480> we

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
then use W to obviously the coincidence

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.990 
then use W to obviously the coincidence
event<00:00:49.829> would<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:49.950> completely<00:00:50.430> different<00:00:50.789> sets
