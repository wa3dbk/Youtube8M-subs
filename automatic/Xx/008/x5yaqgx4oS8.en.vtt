 it is said that the photo ccoo file of the device has been modified and has been 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.390
 we apply a change we accept illicit 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 we started to run the program 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.720
 the face as we see 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.320
 the simplest way as if we were talking just a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.970

 is connecting 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 positive 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.370
 once it reads the system configuration 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.899
 in this the mayor 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.270
 in it the applications that should 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.540

 when this happens 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.929
 what we have to do 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.819
 take out the battery and do the process 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.729
 without the battery until you ask us 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:33.889
