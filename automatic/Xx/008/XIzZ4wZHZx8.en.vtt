00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.660
 I'm just going to explain the steps 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.730
 what do you want to know about the 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.070
 making what we do here this 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.980
 is a footwear factory one of the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.980
 First steps is to choose the material to 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.160
 use the second step is to do the 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.599
 design which is commissioned by the designer 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.810
 of good footwear then once designed 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:37.420
 the model is proceeded to cut the 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:41.930
 material with the model that was chosen 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.390
 after cutting is sent to the seam 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.870
 which is in the shoemaker's jargon is said 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.829
 has stopped has stopped footwear the cut 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.690
 here is all done inside the factory 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.260
 has the special machine just 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.510
 to cut footwear 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.309
 and then I made him send the sewing is a 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.739
 work that is done outside the factory 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.080
 once the sewing or the 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.750
 shoe making returns to the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.149
 factory and here is followed with the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.110
 following steps the preparation carries a 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:17.289
 step not that this is the buttress of 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.080
 wet shoe in a material to make it 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.630
 more flexible at the time of assembly that 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.899
 goes in on the heel part in the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.539
 shoe case and then good 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.580
 when going to the armed the same machine 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.220
 does all the pressure to make the shoe 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.100
 be armed before hitting 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.649
 you proceed to pass on the basis of the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.200
 the base to use is passed the glue 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.810
 a time period longer 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.119
 bake it to dry because 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.369
 then that comes back to life with the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.610
 heat of the machine in the gluing 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.080
 then that glue is passed and then 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.819
 we proceed to the gluing 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.459
 depends on the material you have to 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.480
 ironing there is not that there is a machine that 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.850
 proceeds 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.970
 the material and ironing it so that 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.210
 the completion of the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.910
 shoe is in the packaging part it 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.280
 burn all the threads they pass the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.550
 ointments according to the colors for 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.960
 that the shoe ends neatly in the box 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:25.610
 [Music] 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.980
 It's good to know how to know 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.660
 do these things that put a 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.820
 Pitt shoe puts it on and as if nothing 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.010
 interesting we saw in the note that the 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.580
 final is a very craft work 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.410
 yes yes where one is there with the detail 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.170
 on the other hand we saw boots things that the 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.540
 first boot that he used for lady he 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.730
 he made for the queen victory in a thousand 840 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.870
 So far no one was wearing boots 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.880
 after the queen began to be 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.650
 broken seems to have become fashionable and 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.960
 women started wearing water boots 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.880
 you know that the first templates that you 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.830
 they used to go gogh of the foot between him 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.630
 has shoes to protect the leg 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.530
 to say a way that feels 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.240
 cork because long way to say 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.440
 and it has stayed for nothing was quite 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.440
 good complex
