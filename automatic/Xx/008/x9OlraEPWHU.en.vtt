just announced last week which makes
this<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.850> guess<00:00:24.570> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> obsolete<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.830> lot

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this I guess kind of obsolete a lot

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.089 
this I guess kind of obsolete a lot
cheaper<00:00:26.580> which<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.660> why<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.470> still<00:00:28.619> one

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
cheaper which is why this is still one

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.400 
cheaper which is why this is still one
awesome<00:00:29.670> point-and-shoot<00:00:30.539> camera<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.109> one

primarily<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.199> gh4<00:01:04.559> which<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.339> recording<00:01:05.820> this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
primarily my gh4 which is recording this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.510 
primarily my gh4 which is recording this
video<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.470> sometimes<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.310> too

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
video right now but sometimes it is too

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.460 
video right now but sometimes it is too
big<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.790> me<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> carry<00:01:09.450> around<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
big for me to carry around and I

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890 
big for me to carry around and I
naturally<00:01:10.770> want<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.520> smaller<00:01:12.180> pocket-sized

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
naturally want a smaller pocket-sized

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.219 
naturally want a smaller pocket-sized
camera<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.890> fit<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.689> my<00:01:15.689> pocket<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
camera that I can fit into my pocket I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.359 
camera that I can fit into my pocket I
guess<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> rx100<00:01:18.450> mark<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.290> mark<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.920> mark

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
guess so the rx100 mark one mark to mark

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.550 
guess so the rx100 mark one mark to mark
three<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.450> course<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> upcoming<00:01:22.350> mark

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
three and of course the upcoming mark

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.499 
three and of course the upcoming mark
four<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> top<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> line<00:01:24.060> pointing

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
four are the top of the line pointing

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.320 
four are the top of the line pointing
sheets<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:25.049> Sony<00:01:25.409> some<00:01:26.280> specs<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.939> got<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
sheets from Sony some specs it's got a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.179 
sheets from Sony some specs it's got a
one<00:01:27.600> inch<00:01:27.840> sensor<00:01:28.110> twenty<00:01:28.860> point<00:01:29.130> one

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
one inch sensor twenty point one

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.850 
one inch sensor twenty point one
megapixels<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.659> means<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> lets<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> lot

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
megapixels that means it lets in a lot

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
megapixels that means it lets in a lot
of<00:01:31.890> light<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.490> its<00:01:32.640> size<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:33.240> well<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> 24<00:01:34.320> to

external microphone but it's something

get<00:05:14.130> too<00:05:14.340> much<00:05:14.490> on<00:05:14.699> this<00:05:14.880> it<00:05:15.120> is<00:05:15.330> cheaper<00:05:15.750> now

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
get too much on this it is cheaper now

get too much on this it is cheaper now
because<00:05:16.289> it's<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.560> bit<00:05:16.740> older<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.430> I<00:05:17.729> think

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
because it's a bit older and I think

this<00:05:18.270> is<00:05:18.449> an<00:05:18.570> awesome<00:05:18.810> investment<00:05:19.260> in<00:05:19.889> terms

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
this is an awesome investment in terms

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.860 
this is an awesome investment in terms
of<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.400> camera<00:05:20.849> if<00:05:21.000> you're<00:05:21.389> looking<00:05:21.659> for

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
something this small and compact so that

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.810 
something this small and compact so that
was<00:05:26.190> my<00:05:26.340> review<00:05:26.370> of<00:05:26.789> the<00:05:27.510> rx100<00:05:28.349> mark<00:05:29.039> 3<00:05:29.520> in<00:05:29.760> my
