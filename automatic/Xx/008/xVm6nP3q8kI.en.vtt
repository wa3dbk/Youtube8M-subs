 column 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.610
 and so let's deal with it by 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:37.320

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.090

 you need to log in first to the control panel 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.790
 if your control panel has this 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.090
 kind of need to switch i prefer 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.100
 so change the category to large or 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.940
