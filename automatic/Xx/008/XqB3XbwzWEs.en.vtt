slightly more clustered if Reggie can
hit<00:01:42.210> more<00:01:42.570> than<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.960> driven<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.560> his

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
hit more than just driven with his

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.460 
hit more than just driven with his
shockwave<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:45.060> easy<00:01:45.360> hit<00:01:45.810> his<00:01:46.020> ult<00:01:46.290> at

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
shockwave and have easy hit his ult at

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.380 
shockwave and have easy hit his ult at
all<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:47.220> would<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.430> been<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:47.670> easy<00:01:47.939> victory

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
