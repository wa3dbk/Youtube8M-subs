00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.649
 here we have the quad box he had now 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.059
 2 1 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.790
 we have time here and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.460
 performance limitations for those 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.240
 to just starting it for example 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.949
 You can work the time at 0 5 or 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 select one second 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.380
 I take one now, for example 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.480
 second and try a delle 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.630
 expand without letting go of the button 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.320
 So the device I have to be self-employed 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.320
 turn off 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.829
 now had turned off and the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.649
 accordingly, if we do that on four 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.660
 seconds the maximum what my time 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.879
 attitude is like us four 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.480
 make seconds then that turns off 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.870
 gets off after four seconds as well 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.899
 we have performance settings eg 20 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.899
 percent is the smallest and at 100 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.820
 percent is the biggest though 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.080
 you have to pay attention to that when 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.049
 one on 100 percent 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.150
 the device can be adjusted by the im 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.510
 father so the paint both in the car 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.360
 spend like that and they may have 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.970
 noticed that it is the device as well as scene 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.400
 of yourself while it is on can 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.220
 to thereby prevent that first time 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.610
 set to four seconds and advises 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.829
 accounts so shall you do not want that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.900
 the device with itself gives pips cells if 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.900
 it is always on 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.880
 turn on if currently at 4 seconds 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.790
 So I'm up to now and it 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.189
 no longer sounds like that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.680
 because now you can continue with the device 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.280
 So have the time set as 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.180
 one likes to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.050
 There are also the uni 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.610
 for time span so that you yourself 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.660
 Decides how long to press the button 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.220
 pushes and exactly 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.500
 You also have to pay attention when you do that 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.300
 device and another 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.420
 attitude to power for example the 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.630
 time up to 20 percent remained then 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.310
 the device will beep so with 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.810
 turn off and turn on again 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.660
 then it will be fit again 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.630
 Noises against so if someone wants 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.850
 you do not have to do that yourself 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.720
 first set to four seconds and 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.209
 only then turn on 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.270
 so now times like for example at 40 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.950
 percent so I have no time 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.930
 I have to limit myself 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.580
 roller coaster is a button make so 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:46.370
 that the paint is not burned 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:50.180
 the metal increases so i am 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:55.010
 Of course no profi but it shows 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.840
 that that works so that would be there 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.350
 sitting and they wanted the idea money 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.350
 date back to
