reason<00:01:37.740> why<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.009> should<00:01:38.159> lose<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.729> honest

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
reason why they should lose to be honest

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.780 
reason why they should lose to be honest
and<00:01:39.740> we'll<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.920> how<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:41.220> how<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:41.549> have

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.399 
and we'll see how they how they have
this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> shield<00:01:42.390> looms<00:01:42.630> um<00:01:42.930> but

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this is the shield looms um but

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.710 
this is the shield looms um but
definitely<00:01:43.560> they're<00:01:43.920> adding<00:01:44.460> some<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
definitely they're adding some that that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.690 
definitely they're adding some that that
element<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.350> them<00:01:46.560> being<00:01:46.860> able<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> combust<00:01:47.549> at
