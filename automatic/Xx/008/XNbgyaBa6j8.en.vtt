00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.530 
phone isn't really zooming into very
well<00:02:31.569> but<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:33.340> definitely<00:02:33.519> does<00:02:33.849> say<00:02:34.030> Hogwarts

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540

very top so that is really really
detailed<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.620> heavy<00:02:42.569> can't<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:44.260> can't<00:02:44.530> just

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
detailed and heavy can't you can't just

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.430 
detailed and heavy can't you can't just
see<00:02:45.220> into<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.579> cab<00:02:45.849> which<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.599> still<00:02:46.959> again

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
see into the cab which is still again

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.629 
see into the cab which is still again
really<00:02:47.680> detailed<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:50.290> it's<00:02:50.560> really<00:02:51.310> really

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
really detailed and it's really really

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.059 
really detailed and it's really really
heavy<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.630> quite<00:02:52.870> surprising<00:02:53.049> how<00:02:53.650> heavy<00:02:53.920> it

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
heavy it's quite surprising how heavy it

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.970 
heavy it's quite surprising how heavy it
is<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.049> that's<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.590> loco<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:58.120> got<00:02:58.269> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
is and so that's the loco it's got the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.099 
is and so that's the loco it's got the
Dutchman's<00:03:00.450> normal<00:03:01.450> batsman's<00:03:01.840> caught

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
Dutchman's normal batsman's caught

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.409 
Dutchman's normal batsman's caught
coupling<00:03:02.709> on<00:03:02.799> it<00:03:02.980> as<00:03:03.700> well<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:07.090> means<00:03:07.269> the

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
coupling on it as well that means the

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.960 
coupling on it as well that means the
tender<00:03:08.040> she's<00:03:09.040> actually<00:03:09.310> quite<00:03:09.700> light

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
tender she's actually quite light

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.610 
tender she's actually quite light
compared<00:03:10.450> compared<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.139> loco<00:03:11.440> but

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
compared compared to the loco but

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.360 
compared compared to the loco but
obviously<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:11.980> locos<00:03:12.340> got<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.900> motor<00:03:13.900> in<00:03:14.200> it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
obviously the locos got the motor in it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.300 
obviously the locos got the motor in it
and<00:03:15.370> yeah<00:03:15.519> yeah<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.239> motor<00:03:16.419> at<00:03:16.599> story<00:03:17.310> and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
and yeah yeah the motor at story and

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.220 
and yeah yeah the motor at story and
I've<00:03:18.459> just<00:03:18.639> um<00:03:18.970> opening<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.660> box<00:03:19.930> I've
