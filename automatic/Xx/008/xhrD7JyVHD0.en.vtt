didn't<00:05:47.120> have<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:47.270> rampart<00:05:47.870> to<00:05:47.900> fall<00:05:48.140> back<00:05:48.350> on

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.800 
didn't have a rampart to fall back on
I<00:05:48.800> guess<00:05:49.340> that<00:05:49.520> added<00:05:49.880> memory<00:05:50.030> went<00:05:50.450> towards

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
I guess that added memory went towards

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.810 
I guess that added memory went towards
frames<00:05:51.260> and<00:05:51.530> sprites<00:05:51.860> rather<00:05:52.160> than<00:05:52.400> speed

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
frames and sprites rather than speed

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.600 
frames and sprites rather than speed
like<00:05:53.390> I<00:05:53.510> said<00:05:53.810> this<00:05:54.140> isn't<00:05:54.410> a<00:05:54.620> huge<00:05:54.830> gripe<00:05:55.100> but

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610

Saturn from an untimely death though I'd
like<00:07:22.320> to<00:07:22.470> think<00:07:22.680> it<00:07:22.800> would<00:07:22.920> have<00:07:23.010> gone<00:07:23.190> out

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
like to think it would have gone out

like to think it would have gone out
with<00:07:23.430> a<00:07:23.580> bit<00:07:23.850> more<00:07:23.880> respect<00:07:24.060> than<00:07:24.720> what<00:07:24.960> it

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
with a bit more respect than what it

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.080 
with a bit more respect than what it

received here in the States but that's

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.629 
received here in the States but that's
what<00:07:27.270> I<00:07:27.300> get<00:07:27.390> for<00:07:27.690> thinking
