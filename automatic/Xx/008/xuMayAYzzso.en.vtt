okay<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.750> that's<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.260> sumitcan<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.489> Mount<00:00:53.850> st.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
okay so that's the sumitcan of Mount st.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.360 
okay so that's the sumitcan of Mount st.
Phillip<00:00:55.339> and<00:00:56.339> according<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.420> sign<00:00:58.370> Mount

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
Phillip and according to the sign Mount

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
Phillip and according to the sign Mount
Saint<00:00:59.580> Philip<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.769> 1556<00:01:01.769> meters<00:01:02.870> now<00:01:03.870> bear<00:01:04.170> in

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
Saint Philip is 1556 meters now bear in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.010 
Saint Philip is 1556 meters now bear in
mind<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.680> GPS<00:01:05.220> was<00:01:05.460> only<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> calibrated<00:01:06.450> 24

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
mind this GPS was only a calibrated 24

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.270 
mind this GPS was only a calibrated 24
hours<00:01:07.320> ago<00:01:07.440> so<00:01:09.080> as<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.409> see<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.830> 15

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
hours ago so as you can see it's 15

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.060 
hours ago so as you can see it's 15
meters<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:15.110> okay<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.280> my<00:01:17.280> Garmin<00:01:17.670> GPS<00:01:17.850> is

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
meters out okay so my Garmin GPS is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.609 
meters out okay so my Garmin GPS is
amazingly<00:01:20.070> already<00:01:20.580> reading<00:01:21.110> almost<00:01:22.110> exactly

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
amazingly already reading almost exactly

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
amazingly already reading almost exactly
and<00:01:22.890> bear<00:01:23.219> in<00:01:23.340> mind<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.729> Garmin<00:01:24.180> GPS<00:01:24.329> hasn't

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
and bear in mind the Garmin GPS hasn't

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
and bear in mind the Garmin GPS hasn't
been<00:01:25.110> calibrated<00:01:25.789> for<00:01:26.789> a<00:01:26.820> few<00:01:27.060> months<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
been calibrated for a few months and the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
been calibrated for a few months and the
santé<00:01:29.280> watch<00:01:29.520> was<00:01:29.729> only<00:01:29.969> calibrated

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
santé watch was only calibrated

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.389 
santé watch was only calibrated
yesterday<00:01:32.539> and<00:01:33.539> what<00:01:33.689> Apocrypha<00:01:34.259> Matt<00:01:34.439> gives

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
yesterday and what Apocrypha Matt gives

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.499 
yesterday and what Apocrypha Matt gives
a<00:01:35.490> different<00:01:35.850> reading<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> says<00:01:36.359> that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
a different reading and says that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.760 
a different reading and says that
apparently<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> summit<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.909> 1565<00:01:38.909> meters

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
apparently the summit is 1565 meters

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.539 
apparently the summit is 1565 meters
anyway<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:41.070> I'm<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:41.990> is

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
anyway what I'm going to do now is

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
anyway what I'm going to do now is
recalibrate<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.600> Sun<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:45.960> watch<00:01:46.170> I'll<00:01:46.350> just

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
recalibrate the Sun so watch I'll just

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.789 
recalibrate the Sun so watch I'll just
show<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.710> how<00:01:46.859> to<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:48.560> have<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.679> hold

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
show you how to do that I have to hold

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.630 
show you how to do that I have to hold
down<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> next<00:01:50.520> button<00:01:50.729> go<00:01:51.179> into<00:01:51.420> options<00:01:51.810> I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
down the next button go into options I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.810 
down the next button go into options I
have<00:01:53.640> an<00:01:53.759> activity<00:01:54.060> running<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.469> moment

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
have an activity running at the moment

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.069 
have an activity running at the moment
so<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.210> into<00:01:57.329> altitude<00:01:58.939> and<00:02:00.079> we'll

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
so I'm going into altitude and we'll

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.130 
so I'm going into altitude and we'll
assume<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.710> sign<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.310> correct<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.990> I'll

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
assume that the sign is correct and I'll

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:14.130 
assume that the sign is correct and I'll
set<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.619> altitude<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:07.220> 1556<00:02:08.220> meters

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.120 

okay<00:02:15.140> there<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:16.240> 1556<00:02:17.240> meters<00:02:17.690> as<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.920> sign

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
okay there it is 1556 meters as the sign

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.620 
okay there it is 1556 meters as the sign
says<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:21.500> lock<00:02:21.710> the<00:02:21.860> keypad

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
says just lock the keypad

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.840 
says just lock the keypad
in<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.750> meantime<00:02:23.960> I'm<00:02:24.350> just<00:02:24.380> also<00:02:25.840> going<00:02:26.840> to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
in the meantime I'm just also going to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.090 
in the meantime I'm just also going to
calibrate<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:32.230> Garmin<00:02:33.230> GPS<00:02:33.380> I'll<00:02:33.800> just<00:02:33.950> have

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
calibrate the Garmin GPS I'll just have

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.240 
calibrate the Garmin GPS I'll just have
to<00:02:34.220> remember<00:02:34.430> how<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.670> do<00:02:34.910> this<00:02:35.590> set<00:02:36.590> elevation

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
to remember how to do this set elevation

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:51.140 
to remember how to do this set elevation
there<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:41.410> 1556<00:02:42.410> meters

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150 

what

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
what

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.580 
what
already<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.240> garmin<00:02:54.570> gps<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:55.170> slightly

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
already the garmin gps is slightly

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.530 
already the garmin gps is slightly
altered<00:02:56.100> that's<00:02:56.400> probably<00:02:56.820> just<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.300> do<00:02:57.420> with

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
altered that's probably just to do with

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.300 
altered that's probably just to do with
air<00:02:57.690> pressure

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
air pressure

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.020 
air pressure
so<00:02:59.840> both<00:03:00.840> gps<00:03:01.710> is<00:03:01.890> will<00:03:02.010> both<00:03:02.190> ultimate<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:03.000> a

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
so both gps is will both ultimate is a

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.970 
so both gps is will both ultimate is a
reading<00:03:03.510> almost<00:03:03.870> exactly<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.500> same<00:03:04.560> at<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
reading almost exactly the same at the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.740 
reading almost exactly the same at the
moment<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:05.970> we're<00:03:06.090> going<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:06.270> go<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.660> an

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
moment but we're going to go for an

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.300 
moment but we're going to go for an
hour's<00:03:07.110> hike<00:03:07.140> right<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.860> another

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
hour's hike right now to another

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.810 
hour's hike right now to another
mountain<00:03:08.550> peak<00:03:09.000> just<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.990> see<00:03:10.290> if<00:03:10.820> both

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
mountain peak just to see if both

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.150 
mountain peak just to see if both
devices<00:03:13.280> can<00:03:14.280> read<00:03:15.260> accurately<00:03:16.260> at<00:03:16.950> less

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
devices can read accurately at less

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:48.140 
devices can read accurately at less
Peaks<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.850> off<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:25.020> go<00:03:46.490> as<00:03:47.490> you<00:03:47.580> can<00:03:47.700> see<00:03:47.970> we've

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
Peaks and off we go as you can see we've

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.420 
Peaks and off we go as you can see we've
been<00:03:48.180> heading<00:03:48.600> downhill<00:03:48.900> down<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.040> mountain

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.800 

soon<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:53.550> watch<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.970> reading<00:03:54.240> slightly<00:03:54.600> lower

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
soon so watch is reading slightly lower

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.130 
soon so watch is reading slightly lower
and<00:03:55.620> altitude<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:57.390> be<00:03:57.480> actually<00:03:57.750> completely

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
and altitude to be actually completely

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.140 
and altitude to be actually completely
shortly<00:03:58.560> exact<00:03:59.250> up<00:03:59.370> until<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.670> forget<00:03:59.820> it's<00:04:00.090> a

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
shortly exact up until I forget it's a

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.490 
shortly exact up until I forget it's a
part<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.360> your<00:04:00.480> map<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:00.630> just<00:04:00.870> read<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.260> lines

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
part of your map and just read the lines

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.720 
part of your map and just read the lines
but<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.740> course<00:04:01.920> even<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.400> varying

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
but of course even that is varying

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.290 
but of course even that is varying
slightly<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:04.530> problem<00:04:04.770> with<00:04:05.090> trying<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.120> read

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
slightly the problem with trying to read

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.600 
slightly the problem with trying to read
altitude<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.840> with<00:04:07.140> an<00:04:08.040> altimeter<00:04:08.400> that's

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
altitude it with an altimeter that's

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.830 
altitude it with an altimeter that's
running<00:04:08.760> off<00:04:08.880> air<00:04:09.000> pressure<00:04:09.240> here<00:04:09.450> she<00:04:09.810> is

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
running off air pressure here she is
