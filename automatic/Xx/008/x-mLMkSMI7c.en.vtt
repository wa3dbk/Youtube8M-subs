that was a good swing and a good shot
and<00:00:13.710> one<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> things<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.849> helped<00:00:15.210> me

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
and one of the things that helped me

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.200 
and one of the things that helped me
accomplish<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.529> what<00:00:17.310> i<00:00:17.340> call<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.940> three

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
accomplish that is what i call the three

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.980 
accomplish that is what i call the three
points<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.779> separation<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.060> from

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
points of separation and that is from

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.769 
points of separation and that is from
the<00:00:22.020> transition<00:00:22.890> from<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> back<00:00:23.640> swing<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the transition from the back swing to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.529 
the transition from the back swing to
the<00:00:24.810> downswing<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.460> three<00:00:26.760> points<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.420> i'm

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the downswing the three points that i'm

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.980 
the downswing the three points that i'm
going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.810> help<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.619> cover<00:00:29.160> our<00:00:29.990> number

going to help you with cover our number

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.180 
going to help you with cover our number
one<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:32.000> your<00:00:33.000> left<00:00:33.329> knee<00:00:33.980> separating<00:00:34.980> from

one is your left knee separating from
your<00:00:35.910> right<00:00:36.180> knee<00:00:36.450> that's<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.770> first<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
your right knee that's the first and the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.479 
your right knee that's the first and the
main<00:00:38.730> move<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.899> second<00:00:40.350> point<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.710> separation

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
main move the second point of separation

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.069 
main move the second point of separation
is<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.660> your<00:00:43.129> hands<00:00:44.600> separate<00:00:45.600> from<00:00:45.899> your

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
is that your hands separate from your

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.040 
is that your hands separate from your
right<00:00:46.289> shoulder<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.480> when<00:00:48.480> your<00:00:48.629> hands

separate from your right shoulder your
left<00:00:52.050> shoulder<00:00:52.579> separates<00:00:53.579> from<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:54.090> chin

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
left shoulder separates from your chin

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
left shoulder separates from your chin
those<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> three<00:00:56.640> points<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.629> help<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
those are the three points that help you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.420 
those are the three points that help you
transition<00:00:58.920> from<00:00:59.430> your<00:01:00.030> backswing<00:01:01.219> into<00:01:02.219> your

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
transition from your backswing into your

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.899 
transition from your backswing into your
downswing<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.070> also

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
downswing and when you do that that also

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.109 
downswing and when you do that that also
helps<00:01:06.299> generate<00:01:06.659> your<00:01:07.200> power<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:09.000> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
helps generate your power so when you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.140 
helps generate your power so when you
start<00:01:09.390> out<00:01:09.630> working<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.670> start<00:01:11.670> with

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
start out working on this start with

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.890 
start out working on this start with
small<00:01:12.330> wedge<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.650> pit<00:01:13.890> shots<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.640> start<00:01:15.600> with

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
small wedge and pit shots and start with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.410 
small wedge and pit shots and start with
the<00:01:16.110> left<00:01:16.350> knee<00:01:16.619> first<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the left knee first when you get to the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.140 
the left knee first when you get to the
top<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.869> backswing<00:01:19.619> allow<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.820> left

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
top of your backswing allow your left

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.260 
top of your backswing allow your left
knee<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.420> separate<00:01:22.380> from<00:01:22.710> your<00:01:22.890> right<00:01:23.270> making

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
knee to separate from your right making

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.810 
knee to separate from your right making
small<00:01:24.630> practice<00:01:25.229> swings<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:25.979> hitting

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
small practice swings and then hitting

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.310 
small practice swings and then hitting
pitch<00:01:27.180> shots<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.680> would<00:01:28.890> work<00:01:29.130> on

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
pitch shots then I would work on

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.730 
pitch shots then I would work on
allowing<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.619> hands<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:33.210> fall<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
allowing your hands to fall so that the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.350 
allowing your hands to fall so that the
distance<00:01:35.100> between<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.729> hands<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.240> your

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
distance between your hands and your

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.020 
distance between your hands and your
right<00:01:36.570> shoulder<00:01:37.020> gets<00:01:37.170> greater<00:01:37.700> then<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
right shoulder gets greater then as you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.719 
right shoulder gets greater then as you
do<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.450> you'll<00:01:40.020> notice<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.950> left

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
do that you'll notice that your left

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.109 
do that you'll notice that your left
shoulder<00:01:42.170> separates<00:01:43.170> from<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.649> chin<00:01:44.119> so

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
shoulder separates from your chin so

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.719 
shoulder separates from your chin so
when<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> put<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.810> three<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.140> these<00:01:46.350> together

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
when you put all three of these together

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.780 
when you put all three of these together
with<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> left<00:01:48.180> knee<00:01:48.420> being<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.990> first<00:01:49.290> move

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
with the left knee being the first move

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.580
