00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:04.110 

it<00:02:54.620> gave<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.159> a<00:02:55.250> little<00:02:55.640> bit<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.239> color

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.760 

off<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.540> bat<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.750> can<00:03:05.990> tell<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.349> do<00:03:06.470> not

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
off the bat I can tell you that I do not

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.890 
off the bat I can tell you that I do not
like<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.190> little<00:03:07.459> sponge<00:03:07.910> applicator<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.540> mean

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
like the little sponge applicator I mean

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.740 
like the little sponge applicator I mean
I<00:03:09.020> see<00:03:09.230> no<00:03:09.349> purpose<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.550> it<00:03:11.540> doesn't

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
I see no purpose to it and it it doesn't

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.199 
I see no purpose to it and it it doesn't
really<00:03:11.959> even<00:03:12.170> add<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.530> lot<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.099> color<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:14.060> guys

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
really even add a lot of color you guys

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.339 
really even add a lot of color you guys
can<00:03:14.480> see<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.390> pencil<00:03:17.780> it's<00:03:17.930> actually

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
can see that so the pencil it's actually

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.650 
can see that so the pencil it's actually
really<00:03:18.560> pigmented<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.270> have<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.510> be

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
really pigmented so you have to be

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:31.750 
really pigmented so you have to be
really<00:03:21.110> careful

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:47.050 

you

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.820 

this<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:48.080> how<00:03:48.470> my<00:03:48.830> eyebrows<00:03:49.250> look<00:03:49.400> right<00:03:50.239> here

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
this is how my eyebrows look right here

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.850 
this is how my eyebrows look right here
um<00:03:52.209> they<00:03:53.209> look<00:03:53.360> kind<00:03:53.599> of<00:03:53.660> harsh<00:03:53.900> on<00:03:54.110> camera<00:03:54.590> but

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
um they look kind of harsh on camera but

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.380 
um they look kind of harsh on camera but
they're<00:03:55.069> not<00:03:55.190> actually<00:03:55.430> like<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:55.819> in<00:03:56.120> person

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
they're not actually like that in person

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.930 
they're not actually like that in person
on<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.440> pencil<00:03:57.860> I<00:03:58.010> feel<00:03:58.220> like<00:03:58.310> you<00:03:58.430> have<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.670> be

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
on the pencil I feel like you have to be

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.850 
on the pencil I feel like you have to be
really<00:03:59.270> careful<00:03:59.450> because<00:03:59.690> it<00:04:00.050> does<00:04:00.230> apply<00:04:00.560> a

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
really careful because it does apply a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.170 
really careful because it does apply a
lot<00:04:01.190> if<00:04:01.400> you're<00:04:01.550> not<00:04:01.670> careful<00:04:01.849> so<00:04:02.090> you

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
lot if you're not careful so you

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.080 
lot if you're not careful so you
definitely<00:04:02.599> have<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.380> do<00:04:03.500> light<00:04:03.830> strokes<00:04:04.370> but

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
definitely have to do light strokes but

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.670 
definitely have to do light strokes but
honestly<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.450> think<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.750> sponge<00:04:06.080> applicator

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
honestly I think the sponge applicator

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.490 
honestly I think the sponge applicator
it<00:04:07.069> did<00:04:07.640> not<00:04:07.760> work<00:04:07.970> for<00:04:08.030> me<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.720> does<00:04:09.050> apply<00:04:09.410> a

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
it did not work for me it does apply a

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.710 
it did not work for me it does apply a
little<00:04:09.950> bit<00:04:10.069> of<00:04:10.190> color<00:04:10.519> but<00:04:10.910> it's<00:04:11.209> not<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.420> big

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
little bit of color but it's not a big

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.479 
little bit of color but it's not a big
difference<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.530> can<00:04:12.709> definitely<00:04:13.130> do<00:04:13.340> your

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
difference you can definitely do your

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.330 
difference you can definitely do your
eyebrows<00:04:13.849> just<00:04:14.030> with<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.870> UM<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.140> pencil<00:04:16.070> by

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
eyebrows just with the UM the pencil by

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.460 
eyebrows just with the UM the pencil by
itself<00:04:16.609> honestly<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.510> would<00:04:17.780> pass<00:04:18.079> on<00:04:18.320> this

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
itself honestly I would pass on this

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.610 
itself honestly I would pass on this
pencil<00:04:19.010> is<00:04:19.040> great<00:04:19.669> um<00:04:20.030> again<00:04:20.900> i<00:04:21.139> think<00:04:21.200> i<00:04:21.470> got

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
pencil is great um again i think i got

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.030 
pencil is great um again i think i got
it<00:04:21.680> for<00:04:22.100> less<00:04:22.460> than<00:04:22.490> 10<00:04:22.850> bucks<00:04:23.350> so<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.680> wasn't<00:04:24.979> a

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
it for less than 10 bucks so it wasn't a

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.450 
it for less than 10 bucks so it wasn't a
bad<00:04:25.190> price<00:04:25.639> however<00:04:26.389> I<00:04:27.160> feel<00:04:28.160> like<00:04:28.220> you're

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
bad price however I feel like you're

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.909 
bad price however I feel like you're
paying<00:04:28.760> for<00:04:29.150> something<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.840> half<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.770> it

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
paying for something that half of it

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.219 
paying for something that half of it
doesn't<00:04:31.190> work<00:04:31.490> for<00:04:31.940> about<00:04:32.180> two<00:04:32.570> more<00:04:32.780> dollars

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
doesn't work for about two more dollars

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.150 
doesn't work for about two more dollars
