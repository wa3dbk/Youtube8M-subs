the<00:03:47.690> Eldar<00:03:48.079> you<00:03:48.799> know<00:03:48.919> what<00:03:49.099> I'm<00:03:49.250> going<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.459> be

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
the Eldar you know what I'm going to be

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.189 
the Eldar you know what I'm going to be
completely<00:03:50.150> honest<00:03:50.569> with<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:50.930> when<00:03:51.049> you

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
completely honest with you when you

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.240 
completely honest with you when you
start<00:03:51.620> getting<00:03:51.799> to<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.549> level<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.359> beer<00:03:53.959> I

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
start getting to this level of beer I

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.909 
start getting to this level of beer I
think<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.400> really<00:03:55.699> all<00:03:56.090> boils<00:03:56.120> down<00:03:56.690> to

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
think it really all boils down to

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.580 
think it really all boils down to
preference<00:03:57.919> I<00:03:58.449> think<00:03:59.449> that<00:03:59.690> hops<00:04:00.049> lamb<00:04:00.319> is

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
preference I think that hops lamb is

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.189 
preference I think that hops lamb is
still<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:01.250> best<00:04:01.459> beer<00:04:01.699> out<00:04:01.940> there<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.419> think

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199 
still the best beer out there I think

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.020 
still the best beer out there I think
this<00:04:03.379> is<00:04:03.560> probably<00:04:03.889> about<00:04:04.280> as<00:04:04.579> close<00:04:04.970> as

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
this is probably about as close as

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.659 
this is probably about as close as
you're<00:04:05.359> going<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.540> get<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:07.310> if<00:04:07.549> you

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
you're going to get to that and if you

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.000 
you're going to get to that and if you
think<00:04:07.940> that<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:08.239> is<00:04:08.449> better<00:04:08.629> whatever<00:04:09.530> you

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
think that this is better whatever you

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.930 
think that this is better whatever you
know<00:04:10.129> I<00:04:10.160> don't<00:04:10.430> care<00:04:10.699> it's<00:04:12.280> it's<00:04:13.280> subjective

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
know I don't care it's it's subjective

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.990 
know I don't care it's it's subjective
and<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.989> think<00:04:15.260> that<00:04:15.379> this<00:04:15.530> beer<00:04:15.949> is<00:04:16.130> absolutely

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
and I think that this beer is absolutely

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.509 
and I think that this beer is absolutely
amazing<00:04:17.539> if<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.229> had<00:04:18.409> to<00:04:18.530> score<00:04:18.829> I'm<00:04:19.099> going<00:04:19.430> to
