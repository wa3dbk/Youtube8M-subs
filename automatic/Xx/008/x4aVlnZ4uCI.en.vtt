now this is a very well used engine

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.460 
now this is a very well used engine
meaning<00:00:31.450> they<00:00:31.510> use<00:00:31.630> this<00:00:31.750> in<00:00:31.900> virtually<00:00:32.260> every

platform of the mercedes-benz models

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.540 
platform of the mercedes-benz models
especially<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:34.930> old<00:00:35.050> five<00:00:35.170> year<00:00:35.550> very

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
especially the old five year very

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.710 
especially the old five year very
dependable<00:00:36.940> obviously<00:00:37.300> that's<00:00:37.450> one<00:00:37.570> of<00:00:37.630> the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
dependable obviously that's one of the

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.790 
dependable obviously that's one of the
reasons<00:00:37.930> they've<00:00:38.050> used<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.379> across<00:00:38.590> the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
reasons they've used it across the

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.280 
reasons they've used it across the
entire<00:00:39.070> platform<00:00:39.520> line<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.870> this<00:00:41.020> is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
entire platform line but this is

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.430 
entire platform line but this is
connected<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.640> 7-speed<00:00:43.449> automatic<00:00:43.570> which

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
connected to the 7-speed automatic which

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.110 
connected to the 7-speed automatic which
is<00:00:44.559> routed<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:44.830> the<00:00:44.949> rear<00:00:45.100> wheels<00:00:45.250> 7-speed

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
is routed to the rear wheels 7-speed

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.030 
is routed to the rear wheels 7-speed
gave<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.600> huge<00:00:46.960> bump<00:00:47.230> in<00:00:47.320> off-the-line

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
gave a huge bump in off-the-line

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.070 
gave a huge bump in off-the-line
acceleration<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.879> also<00:00:49.150> in<00:00:49.600> fuel<00:00:49.900> economy

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
acceleration and also in fuel economy

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.350 
acceleration and also in fuel economy
because<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:50.620> have<00:00:50.739> two<00:00:51.010> extra<00:00:51.250> ratios<00:00:51.670> on<00:00:52.120> top

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
because you have two extra ratios on top

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.360 
because you have two extra ratios on top
of<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.570> 5-speed<00:00:52.900> automatic<00:00:53.050> but<00:00:54.040> this<00:00:54.219> really

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
of the 5-speed automatic but this really

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.280 
of the 5-speed automatic but this really
is<00:00:54.520> immaculate<00:00:54.969> it's<00:00:55.090> covered<00:00:55.329> 35,000<00:00:56.170> miles

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
is immaculate it's covered 35,000 miles

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.290 
is immaculate it's covered 35,000 miles
in<00:00:56.440> its<00:00:56.559> lifetime<00:00:56.739> but<00:00:57.579> you<00:00:57.820> know<00:00:57.910> for<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.090> black

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
in its lifetime but you know for a black

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.580 
in its lifetime but you know for a black
pane<00:00:58.570> car<00:00:58.809> obviously<00:00:58.989> this<00:00:59.260> car<00:00:59.440> has<00:00:59.530> been

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
pane car obviously this car has been

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.260 
pane car obviously this car has been
very<00:00:59.829> well<00:01:00.010> loved<00:01:00.280> we'll<00:01:00.790> take<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:00.969> look<00:01:01.180> up

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
very well loved we'll take a look up

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.189 
very well loved we'll take a look up
close<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.390> rear<00:01:04.570> with<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.809> top<00:01:05.050> down

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
close in the rear with the top down

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.690 
close in the rear with the top down
you'll<00:01:05.379> actually<00:01:05.500> find<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.979> hardtop<00:01:06.280> still

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
you'll actually find the hardtop still

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.219 
you'll actually find the hardtop still
right<00:01:06.910> here<00:01:07.090> now<00:01:07.539> I<00:01:07.570> know<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:07.869> probably<00:01:08.110> looks

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
right here now I know it probably looks

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.660 
right here now I know it probably looks
like<00:01:08.289> it<00:01:08.440> takes<00:01:08.590> up<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.740> entire<00:01:08.830> cargo<00:01:09.399> area

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
like it takes up the entire cargo area

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.139 
like it takes up the entire cargo area
but<00:01:09.850> really<00:01:10.119> when<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.300> hit<00:01:10.420> this<00:01:10.539> button<00:01:10.750> here

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
but really when you hit this button here

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.100 
but really when you hit this button here
it'll<00:01:13.149> actually<00:01:13.420> raise<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.780> up<00:01:13.960> you<00:01:14.080> can

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
it'll actually raise that up you can

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.389 
it'll actually raise that up you can
move<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.440> luggage<00:01:14.560> cover<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.130> actually

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
move the luggage cover and you actually

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.770 
move the luggage cover and you actually
have<00:01:15.490> access<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.030> decent<00:01:16.210> amount<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.660> space

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
have access to a decent amount of space

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.779 
have access to a decent amount of space
under<00:01:17.170> here<00:01:17.200> but<00:01:18.130> really<00:01:18.340> simple<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.670> use

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
under here but really simple to use

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.639 
under here but really simple to use
obviously<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.420> full<00:01:19.600> power<00:01:19.810> folding<00:01:20.200> hardtop

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
obviously the full power folding hardtop

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.889 
obviously the full power folding hardtop
when<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.729> top<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.210> up<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:22.570> really<00:01:22.750> have<00:01:22.840> a

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
when the top is up you really have a

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.300 
when the top is up you really have a
gigantic<00:01:23.289> trunk<00:01:23.649> because<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:23.860> top<00:01:24.039> doesn't

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
gigantic trunk because the top doesn't

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.700 
gigantic trunk because the top doesn't
take<00:01:24.399> up<00:01:24.550> any<00:01:24.610> more<00:01:24.880> room<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:26.140> really<00:01:26.409> simple

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
take up any more room but really simple

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.160 
take up any more room but really simple
to<00:01:26.770> use

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to use

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.120 
to use
interior<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.470> SL<00:01:29.740> is<00:01:29.799> virtually

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
interior on the SL is virtually

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.890 
interior on the SL is virtually
immaculate<00:01:30.750> obviously<00:01:31.750> it's<00:01:31.869> the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
immaculate obviously it's the

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.359 
immaculate obviously it's the
mercedes-benz<00:01:32.320> it's<00:01:32.650> all<00:01:32.740> about<00:01:32.860> comfort<00:01:33.070> and

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
mercedes-benz it's all about comfort and

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.800 
mercedes-benz it's all about comfort and
convenience<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:33.939> stepping<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:34.630> really

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
convenience so stepping in is really

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.960 
convenience so stepping in is really
simple<00:01:35.170> dual<00:01:36.010> power<00:01:36.220> seats<00:01:36.369> on<00:01:36.549> both<00:01:36.700> sides

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
simple dual power seats on both sides

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.359 
simple dual power seats on both sides
and<00:01:37.119> you<00:01:37.210> do<00:01:37.330> have<00:01:37.450> active<00:01:37.869> ventilation<00:01:38.369> which

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
and you do have active ventilation which

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.620 
and you do have active ventilation which
basically<00:01:39.700> you've<00:01:39.909> got<00:01:39.939> a<00:01:40.060> pulse<00:01:40.299> function

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
basically you've got a pulse function

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.570 
basically you've got a pulse function
here<00:01:40.750> which<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.020> small<00:01:41.380> lower<00:01:42.040> back<00:01:42.220> lumbar

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
here which is a small lower back lumbar

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.980 
here which is a small lower back lumbar
massage<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.119> then<00:01:43.600> pneumatically

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
massage and then pneumatically

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.499 
massage and then pneumatically
adjustable<00:01:44.560> bolsters<00:01:45.119> we've<00:01:46.119> got<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.270> seat

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
adjustable bolsters we've got a seat

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.670 
adjustable bolsters we've got a seat
bottom<00:01:46.750> adjustments

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
bottom adjustments

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.679 
bottom adjustments
you<00:01:48.009> really<00:01:48.250> can't<00:01:48.490> not<00:01:48.909> find<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.390> best
