00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.420
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.400
 I am Alexey and today to his attention 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.730
 wanted to introduce my new video to 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.890
 video on the game spintires over vrola again 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.740
 review mods and today on the review we 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.079
 968m is pretty good pretty 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.449
 nimble car replaces it UAZ not 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.460
 Multiplayer works and achievement is 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.620
 one workaround by which 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.600
 Actually we play with Vlad 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.060
 multiplayer with mods that is it on 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.790
 I think there is a video channel like 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.540
 make the modules accordingly 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.610
 in multiplayer 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.280
 I do not know write in the comments if 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.340
 want to see such a video from me 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.200
 you need it or not, in principle, it 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.540
 the guide is pretty detailed but if you 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.000
 just want to see me write to 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.880
 comments i will make sure that 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.310
 actually speaking about this model 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.409
 the model is not quite good myself 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.939
 a little bit scared away these stretched 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.150
 stretched textures seem to me possible 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:13.150
 It was to pick them a little better and here 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.710
 such a frosted glass 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.600
 could make it a little bit 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.620
 transparent when viewed from behind in principle 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.950
 there are no problems here 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.290
 here is the way and the position of the new position 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:30.040
 new camera which is added for what 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.040
 so we are very loud 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.560
 happens 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.880
 so this is what i started i already started 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.830
 show all of these 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.170
 animated parts by the way yes that's when 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.729
 we will lead the stars to the tilde you heard 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.229
 everything here is our own sounds 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.440
 let's actually start the time I 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.200
 started and show you how the doors open 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.820
 and stuff like that but you can fold it and 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.390
 flour is the same naturally then we are not 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.570
 close 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.090
 at us they will close see thought not 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.939
 closes we can open the doors and we can 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.500
 open her busy this tank ok 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.270
 let's muffle so she doesn't just like that 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.179
 rattled really strong act 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.729
 on the nerves and see what addons we have 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.430
 here there is something i can do on the door 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.799
 install windows full well these 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.600
 here you can also add them completely 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.970
 right this beast can be done 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.350
 driver will put all the drivers 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.360
 familiar is tommy from gta wai city 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.610
 pretty cool looks very closely 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.860
 then we will look at the animated 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.500
 on or not in the trunk can be put 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.600
 tanks you can put the frame can 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.790
 put meguri from them put ahead 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.820
 you can put just such a body can 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.859
 put a bench there is a topic like a 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.989
 under the trailer but you need to put first 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.120
 This tractor, that is, we will install it 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.920
 us the answer is put on a trailer which 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.549
 carries 500 repair points and one point 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.570
 the garage 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.160
 but you can also put an awning and for 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.090
 paschka we can still do it 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.299
 accordingly we start the engine 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.810
 raise here the spare tire be hanging around 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.910
 further if we have three options 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.660
 wheels but it is better to leave these 3 since 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.579
 they are similar to the trailer ok let's 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.850
 I'll start the car by closing it all 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.850
 a business 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.840
 such to be able to board something does not close 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.670
 so you should probably go there for the paschka 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.840
 take off most likely where she gene gene 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:29.850
 Gene we get started before and personally 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.640
 we this for pasochku just did put 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.040
 here we have it and put it well 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.960
 Well so we let it gets dark, I probably 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.290
 Matan time a little forward to make it 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.540
 morning so it's fine ok 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.890
 everything is now light but not to 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.560
 sorry gasoline but it's all garbage 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.900
 Now we will ride here to here with us 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.780
 on refuel sounds of course fire and 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:00.450
 at all 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:02.310
 smokes still so professional so and 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.780
 all the same fear for what will be again 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.160
 interrupt let's do at least the game 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.890
 so here did but because it is well 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.690
 unreal sounds some loud think 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.270
 so it is normal to be heard as well, that 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.520
 we are now on the map volcano i 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.320
 hooked on a trailer let's day 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.930
 just take a look let's see how he is rushing 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.970
 on the road what damage is there 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.430
 what kind of animation is there 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.360
 Well, this is our first slide 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.710
 pick many without any problems 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.220
 even the numbers here are Russian nothing 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.420
 imagine how we accelerate 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.560
 and we came to some lake but I don't know 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.050
 will we drive at all here or is there something 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.950
 much fear 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:49.740
 so we already have a dangerous water level 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:54.150
 See rushing slowly on rushing like 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:57.120
 would not get up here yet principle in real life 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.710
 this car is very very very good 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.770
 permeability ie she will come at all 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.360
 almost everywhere I think you can 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.820
 It was in the game to make a little cross 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.400
 a little more and it would be worth adding as 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:13.460
 I think at least one set 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.540
 very high tires like like 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.820
 was on the jeep on the sixty-ninth 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.259
 if I'm not mistaken 69th somehow so 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.270
 called lose 9a 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.150
 there was such a rubber tundra she 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.860
 and called on it in principle but Lane 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.350
 pretty good and meanwhile we are here 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.630
 by the way stuck but it's nice 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.910
 reason to check and winch which is here 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.259
 we are also present so well for 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:42.350
 cling f press to get us so 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:45.669
 the main thing here now is not to turn over like that 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.729
 baby, we uncouple why we are not going 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:52.310
 so we safely pulled back so 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.260
 no no no no no we sort of go mud 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.150
 flies as you see yes through the body 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.570
 that is, well, I think it is yes spintires 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.710
 ok so there again with us 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.449
 it happened we were stuck again yes Ñ‘-mine 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.729
 so no well let's do it one last time 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.050
 try to catch the winch is not necessary 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.020
 still get out of here somehow 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.599
 lest I spend the night here in this pit 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.510
 wow, how far excellent and we are just 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.310
 Now there and tighten all super at 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.500
 mud there is nonsense ok but with water not 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.070
 some very nonsense arises not 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.930
 can he either swim in the water I don't know 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.650
 all the same probably should add more 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.720
 cross him so well and here he is 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.240
 In general, I was stuck like this 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.289
 us lighting works in principle i 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.590
 I think you can 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:41.479
 review finish I think that this whole 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.639
 my cat is strong because of purely because 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.500
 trailer that is, if it is dumped from me 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.770
 calmly the car comes out of here trailer 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.889
 all the same heavy and almost all 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.840
 cars that have trailer add-ons 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:56.150
 it is difficult to pull 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.870
 somewhere off-road and so as a trailer 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.900
 still gives 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:03.130
 weight and the car almost everywhere 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.930
 well stuck so well what am i 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.120
 I think on this beautiful place in 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.820
 wonderful seaside location map 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:15.139
 volcano can finish the review on this 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.849
