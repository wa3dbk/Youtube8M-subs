 through this terminal door number of 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.920
 and if he could not achieve his goal it was 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.680
 because he collided with that police car 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.000
 that still remains in the scene is the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.960
 woman who today put on alert the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.089
 authorities at the airport 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.220

 through the door of the terminal is in 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.039
 that right moment when the alarms are 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.260
 fired when hitting a car of the 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.449
 police and it was where he got off the vehicle 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.489
 and he started screaming possibly in a 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.649
 Arabic language they did not understand what 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.289
 he was saying but he did manage to say in 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.940
 English that she had explosives in her 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:08.770
 the person 's attention was raised and 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.390
 quickly the authorities cleared 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.039
 the area when you hear the word bomb 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.440
 agents went to the scene 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.280
 federal and county governments and the 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.799
 bomb squad and they managed 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.990
 and be able to detect that there were no bombs and 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.180
 at this moment is already stopped is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.729
 in custody interviewed to see what 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.590
 charges are pending for several 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.090
 hours the researchers reviewed the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.369
 suspect car who until the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.830
 moment has not been identified but 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.330
 could have Arab ancestry what 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.610
 yes we know it is a teaching talk about 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.560
 the white race approximately between 30 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.360
 and 35 years after dissipate 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.670
 airport threat restarted its 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.290
 activities in a normal way although the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.750
 concern between passengers and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.560
 workers was the ink that would work 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.360
 inside 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.770
 no employee knew anything but we are 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.800
 very safe because we have security 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.740
 obviously I feel fear you do not know if 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.020
 one is involved in that part pleasure 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.899
 Well, you can really be affected in 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.670
 a safe site because for me they are cases 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.440
 isolated is not something that is very 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.060
 recurrent that happens at every moment according to 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.800
 several witnesses who preferred not to leave 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.140
 on camera the suspect when getting off the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.880

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.610

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.970
 happened that at first it was 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.400
 headed by the county police of 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.900
 miami dade is now being carried by
