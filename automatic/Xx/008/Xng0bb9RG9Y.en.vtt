00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello my name is not going on I am 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.670
 table tennis trainer from Bonn and the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.009
 Today's video is about it 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.460
 in which position we have table 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.460
 should stand 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.290
 We should concrete 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.300
 rather in the backhand side say 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.670
 we tend to be in the middle or even more 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.220
 available or if you are very forward 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.199
 maybe she dominates the way 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.000
 return 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.590
 First of all , I want to be there 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.410
 which player type you differ 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.790
 Be with an offensive player where you 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.070
 you should be very curtain oriented 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.930
 the table half not poisonous christi um 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.460
 parties but at least 60 40 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.590
 that means when you have the effort 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.750
 so if you play the return 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.239
 should not be on the midline either 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.479
 were more in the backhand side 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:12.440
 so you in the exchange zone forehand 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:15.340
 if you are a material player 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.840
 or blog counterplayer here 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.440
 available backspace very evenly 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.570
 plays then you can be very centered 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.540
 play because then the distances are too 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.280
 both sides equal and you have then 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.850
 No more problems that we have a corner 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.049
 open country game has that you know from 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:40.159
 the asiatic good example there is the 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.530
 does not play a ball on the backhand side 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.189
 I believe he has only the cover there 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.140
 glued on it that is only painted he 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.450
 then stands at the order acceptance even 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.689
 in the backhand side 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.939
 if he would like any ball because of com or 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.229
 on the far forehand with his 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.350
 play forehand 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.880
 But you also have to say that works 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.729
 only if you have a very good leg work 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.399
 if you have everything with one 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.869
 you wanted to cover the existing side 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.579
 you much more distance too 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.910
 overcome as if you also have one 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.860
 backhand I personally am 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.709
 also an offensive player who plays top 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.780
 and I am also slightly offset by 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.209
 in the backhand 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.650
 because I have a lot more to do with the forehand 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.810
 with the backhand at the order acceptance 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.150
 and so I find the change easier 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.400
 if your players since then you have 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.620
 anyway the position a little further back 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.050
 when recording or even if the in 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.420
 in the case of a website, that too 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.170
 a little bit decide what you defend 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.380
 type side 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.720
 there are those who fend off both sides 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.670
 or even pull on the forehand 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.860
 it shifts then again 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.560
 the focus continues to be on the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.880
 return or really into the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.170
 center 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.420
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.300
 I like to write me the comments 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.520
 where you stand at the serve or too 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.930
 Generally in the game I would be very 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.190
 interest and also writes this 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.190
 which player type you are
