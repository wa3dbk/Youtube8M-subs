00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:14.250
 we add me away from our center 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.820
 equestrian with my sister and me here 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.689
 we introduced ourselves we changed everything we 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.350
 admire man and we moved a malaise 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.840
 latent 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 we all moved then will you 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.850
 present very quickly because 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.140
 frankly are we going to eat so then 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.180
 here then go on then you see here on 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.710

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.390
 opportunity to eat here there is gold 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.579
 left 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.559
 so here we go you were not there 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.860
 before that was a lot more contributing 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.960
 to unravel with what now 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.730
 Photo cheek with care to see it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.989
 not the same 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.940
 it is different now actually was 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.189
 everything changes 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:11.220
 the street flourish with the beach car 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:17.040
 after that so we do not have if you see very 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:21.659
 well we have limits here because we 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 explain we have limits here for etc 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:37.740
 we have after george pasqui you 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:42.420
 see very well no harm then 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 that's the career I'm putting here that we 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:52.399
 have gone past that now go him 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:56.420
 ride the carousel here which has changed 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.719
 that there was no discomfort before 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.060
 mill little bit but that's enough 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:08.489
 so that after that it will not become after 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.129
 ac goes back mallet gsm and that's so 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.209
 a stall 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.830
 that's where there are letters to 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.569
 inside as you can see there 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.910
 have sareraka letters their flaws 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.830
 enemies with fine sand 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.390
 beloved of money they will inevitably and 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.150
 backlash of March 5th 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.200
 obstacles to look pretty for 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.780
 recommend then the band to present 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.780

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:56.340

 role runs along the state of the probe and the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.180
 new boxes and dessert but if you 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:15.200
