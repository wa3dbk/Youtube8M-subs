00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello how about youtube friends today 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.819
 I will teach to play the song of a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.650
 new love of tranzas this song is 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.590
 something old but I think it's one of the 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.630
 classic pop songs and more when 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.309
 one suffers like the lack of love of songs 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.349
 She was very good at dedicating it to 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.569
 someone special and we're going to start 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.880
 with the tutorial first of all we should 

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:23.249
 to lower our guitar half tone 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.949
 below and here is a link for you 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:28.380
 go to the tuner half tone down from 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.539
 reference this would be the first string 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.180
 How does the tone have to be? 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.920
 let's start with the chords the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.760
 song itself starts 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.610
 with 7 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.970
 then let's move on 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.270
 re 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.270
 F sharp without minor 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.060
 to the pear if with this variant without 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.920
 press what would be the third string 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.760
 here we are going to make a slide that 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.460
 then teach later 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.420
 then let's move to sun 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.420
 yes 7 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.970
 my minor 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.350
 Hello 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.050
 re 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.690
 and my 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.150
 let's start with the strumming since 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.130
 is the most peculiar thing about the song and it's the 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.590
 Create your own style let's 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.610
 position our fingers in a network and to 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.920
 this technique 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.620
 let's use the vermouth the prize 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.080
 means that we are going to position a little 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.670
 reload this part of the hand at the beginning 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.880
 what is the guitar as well as 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.880
 here 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.560
 and we start down 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.130
 and the third scratch we give you more 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130
 emphasis 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 Y 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.690
 i 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.690
 all right 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.640
 and we change in agreement 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.550
 ok here we are going to do a glide 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:29.690
 let's start by touching what would be 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.690
 the fourth string 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.750
 and we slide both fingers together 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.830
 Y 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.830
 ok then we start 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.690
 and 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 ah 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.290
 ok and we repeat this part again 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.060
 after entering what is the pre 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.670
 choir and for the preco we will use 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.790
 an arpeggio we are going to position our 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.840
 two in B minor and we start from the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.840
 fifth down 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.510
 then we release the fifth string the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.510
 we leave the air 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.700
 and then let's touch what would be 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.700
 on the sixth string the third fret 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.470
 then we will move here to a 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.470
 variant of me that is this 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.019
 we played sixth and then we passed the 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.019
 fourth down 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.900
 and then we go to the 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.190
 ok the preco will not be 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.620
 the choir carries the same as the verse 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.630
 nothing else will give you a little more 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.630
 emphasis but it's exactly the same 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:40.309
 and 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.309
 and 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.910
 here 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.570
 and good again we repeat this part 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.060
 what is this the chorus and the verse returns 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.920
 which is the same circle this the only 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.290
 difference of the changes is in the pre 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.930
 choir well you know that if you have doubts 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.550
