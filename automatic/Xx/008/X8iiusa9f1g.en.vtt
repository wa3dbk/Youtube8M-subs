looked at launching it here I think the
arrangement<00:01:48.440> here<00:01:48.620> with<00:01:48.770> sports<00:01:49.010> extra<00:01:49.340> works

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
arrangement here with sports extra works

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.070 
arrangement here with sports extra works
particularly<00:01:50.060> well<00:01:50.210> because<00:01:50.630> we<00:01:50.750> were<00:01:50.900> very

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
particularly well because we were very

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.020 
particularly well because we were very
clear<00:01:51.380> about<00:01:51.410> our<00:01:51.590> aspirations<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.520> our

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
clear about our aspirations and our

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.150 
clear about our aspirations and our
expectations<00:01:53.780> coach<00:01:54.230> is<00:01:54.410> working<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.830> schools

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
expectations coach is working in schools

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.450 
expectations coach is working in schools
can<00:01:55.820> contribute<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.660> massive<00:01:57.140> amount<00:01:57.500> both<00:01:58.310> in

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
can contribute a massive amount both in

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.180 
can contribute a massive amount both in
terms<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:59.000> social<00:01:59.450> health<00:01:59.780> fitness<00:02:00.230> it's<00:02:00.980> been

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
terms of social health fitness it's been

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.070 
terms of social health fitness it's been
shown<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:01.520> they<00:02:01.790> actually<00:02:02.210> contribute<00:02:02.900> as

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
shown that they actually contribute as

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.410 
shown that they actually contribute as
well<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.800> academic<00:02:04.250> development<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:05.300> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
well to the academic development of the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.460 
well to the academic development of the
children<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:05.870> I<00:02:05.900> think<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.140> there's<00:02:06.410> a

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
children so I think that there's a

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.499 
children so I think that there's a
massive<00:02:06.860> opportunity<00:02:07.250> for<00:02:07.880> getting<00:02:08.149> coaches

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
massive opportunity for getting coaches

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.969 
massive opportunity for getting coaches
in<00:02:08.660> boarding<00:02:08.990> school<00:02:09.229> we've<00:02:09.590> got<00:02:09.740> some<00:02:09.950> really

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
in boarding school we've got some really

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.340 
in boarding school we've got some really
good<00:02:10.580> important<00:02:11.060> role<00:02:11.209> models<00:02:11.570> in<00:02:11.870> the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
good important role models in the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.070 
good important role models in the
coaches<00:02:13.070> with<00:02:13.340> sports<00:02:13.610> sports<00:02:13.880> extra<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.600> I

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
coaches with sports sports extra and I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.690 
coaches with sports sports extra and I
think<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.500> children<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:16.040> found<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.400> easy<00:02:16.550> to

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
think the children have found it easy to

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.150 
think the children have found it easy to
identify<00:02:16.910> those<00:02:17.780> what<00:02:18.410> we<00:02:18.530> were<00:02:18.590> able<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.890> do

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
identify those what we were able to do

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.180 
identify those what we were able to do
is<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.820> help<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.150> school<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.660> their<00:02:20.870> staff

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
is to help the school and their staff

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.350 
is to help the school and their staff
support<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.280> targets<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.820> they<00:02:23.000> have<00:02:23.180> to

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
support the targets that they have to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.120 
support the targets that they have to
deliver<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.900> genuinely<00:02:24.650> make<00:02:24.980> the

deliver and genuinely make the
children's<00:02:25.840> experience<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.959> physical

children's experience of physical
