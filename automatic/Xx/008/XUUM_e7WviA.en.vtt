00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay so this is a perspective for

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.749

digital<00:00:03.629> camera<00:00:03.959> users<00:00:04.430> I'm<00:00:05.430> doing<00:00:05.670> this

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
digital camera users I'm doing this

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.059 
digital camera users I'm doing this
partly<00:00:06.330> because<00:00:06.480> I'm<00:00:06.720> an<00:00:06.870> elitist<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.680> you

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
partly because I'm an elitist and you

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.200 
partly because I'm an elitist and you
know<00:00:08.189> who<00:00:08.309> isn't<00:00:08.550> these<00:00:08.639> days<00:00:08.700> but<00:00:09.059> also

times from a two hundredth down to one

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.830 
times from a two hundredth down to one
second<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> interesting<00:01:51.360> thing<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.720> when

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
second now the interesting thing is when

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.139 
second now the interesting thing is when
you<00:01:51.899> set<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> second<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:53.790> sounds<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you set it to a second it sounds like a

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.840 
you set it to a second it sounds like a
clock<00:01:54.540> listen<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:57.530> neat<00:01:58.530> huh<00:01:58.710> all<00:01:59.670> right

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
clock listen this neat huh all right

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.280 
clock listen this neat huh all right
so<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.570> doesn't<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.229> know

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so if that doesn't get you you know

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
so if that doesn't get you you know
interested<00:02:01.799> nothing<00:02:02.250> well<00:02:02.810> now<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.869> focus<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
interested nothing well now to focus you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.630 
interested nothing well now to focus you
actually<00:02:04.649> turn<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.920> little<00:02:05.040> knob<00:02:05.159> here<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
actually turn this little knob here and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.359 
actually turn this little knob here and
it<00:02:05.729> moves<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.090> lens<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:07.190> now<00:02:08.190> you're

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it moves the lens in and out now you're

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.290 
it moves the lens in and out now you're
not<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> good<00:02:08.910> view<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.239> here

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
not going to get a good view of it here

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
quite tricky even on a tripod because

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.510 
quite tricky even on a tripod because
you<00:02:49.090> tend<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.450> move<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.500> around<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.770> lot<00:02:50.950> there's

you tend to move it around a lot there's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.670 
you tend to move it around a lot there's
a<00:02:51.550> little<00:02:51.700> catch<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.090> holds<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.450> place

know get the equipment to do it you can
even<00:03:52.780> do<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:52.989> in<00:03:53.140> trays<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.560> can<00:03:53.680> get<00:03:53.799> three

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
even do it in trays you can get three

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.259 
even do it in trays you can get three
little<00:03:54.250> trays<00:03:54.459> in<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.670> row<00:03:54.790> with<00:03:54.970> your<00:03:55.090> three

amount of time you need otherwise you

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.030 
amount of time you need otherwise you
can<00:04:01.750> buy<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:01.959> know<00:04:02.170> drums<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.799> things<00:04:02.860> like

can buy you know drums and things like
that<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:04.030> make<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.299> little<00:04:04.420> easier

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
that to make it a little easier

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.360 
that to make it a little easier

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
and once you're done you've got a piece

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.040 
and once you're done you've got a piece
of<00:04:08.490> film<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.910> can<00:04:09.720> either<00:04:09.840> print

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
of film you can either print

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.420 
of film you can either print
traditionally<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.680> darkroom<00:04:11.010> but<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.280> lot
