we've known the osmotics brand for a few

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.660 
we've known the osmotics brand for a few
years<00:00:11.790> now<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.240> really<00:00:12.809> like<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.259> they<00:00:13.410> do

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
years now and really like what they do

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.760 
years now and really like what they do
but<00:00:14.670> what<00:00:14.849> they've<00:00:15.059> come<00:00:15.780> up<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:15.929> recently

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
but what they've come up with recently

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.730 
but what they've come up with recently
is<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.190> new<00:00:17.580> line<00:00:17.910> called<00:00:18.359> prime<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.410> I'm<00:00:19.560> very

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
is a new line called prime and I'm very

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.279 
is a new line called prime and I'm very
excited<00:00:20.310> about<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.699> because<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:22.020> this

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
excited about this because I think this

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.439 
excited about this because I think this
is<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> first<00:00:22.830> line<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:24.180> address

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
is the first line to really address

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.540 
is the first line to really address
women's<00:00:25.140> skin<00:00:25.470> concerns<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.160> they<00:00:26.310> reach

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
women's skin concerns when they reach

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.330 
women's skin concerns when they reach
menopause<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.810> skin<00:00:28.140> really<00:00:28.650> changes<00:00:29.160> when

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
menopause the skin really changes when

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.330 
menopause the skin really changes when
it<00:00:29.369> goes<00:00:29.609> under<00:00:29.970> all<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.590> extreme<00:00:31.590> hormonal

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
it goes under all that extreme hormonal

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.209 
it goes under all that extreme hormonal
change<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> result<00:00:34.260> you'll<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.980> loss

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
change and as a result you'll get a loss

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.690 
change and as a result you'll get a loss
of<00:00:35.489> elasticity<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.809> particular<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:38.370> an

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
of elasticity in particular and an

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.389 
of elasticity in particular and an
impact<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.270> skin<00:00:39.719> tone<00:00:40.020> which<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:41.040> make<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
impact on skin tone which will make the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.130 
impact on skin tone which will make the
skin<00:00:41.520> look<00:00:41.820> dull<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.840> has<00:00:42.989> got

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
skin look dull and this has got

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.990 
skin look dull and this has got
ingredients<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.370> help<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.820> address

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
ingredients which really help to address

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.520 
ingredients which really help to address
that<00:00:45.210> there<00:00:45.390> are<00:00:45.450> several<00:00:45.719> different<00:00:46.260> types
