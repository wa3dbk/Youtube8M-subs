00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
right it's not incredibly fast over

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.089 
right it's not incredibly fast over
these<00:02:27.989> there's<00:02:28.410> people<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.800> faster

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
these there's people with faster

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.040 
these there's people with faster

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
speed right so 15 megabits up as opposed

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.610 
speed right so 15 megabits up as opposed
to<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:42.030> upload<00:02:42.330> your<00:02:42.420> video<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.959> you
