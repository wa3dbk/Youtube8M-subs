first thing I did was ripped out some
pages<00:00:09.179> out<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.530> book<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:10.980> wrote<00:00:11.099> which

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
pages out of the book that I wrote which

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.629 
pages out of the book that I wrote which
was<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> copy<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.530> was<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> misprint<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.490> it's

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
was a copy that was a misprint so it's

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.970 
was a copy that was a misprint so it's
not<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.820> big<00:00:15.000> deal<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.139> ripped<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.560> out

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
not a big deal that I ripped it out

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.910 
not a big deal that I ripped it out
I<00:00:17.010> didn't<00:00:17.400> deface<00:00:17.789> any<00:00:18.410> library<00:00:19.410> books<00:00:19.740> or

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
and then then I just glued it onto a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.279 
and then then I just glued it onto a
canvas<00:00:25.410> using<00:00:26.220> regular<00:00:26.640> I'm<00:00:27.029> Elmer's<00:00:27.930> glue

done<00:00:34.890> anything<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.610> before<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.239> I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
done anything like this before so I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.910 
done anything like this before so I
didn't<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.350> gonna<00:00:37.500> turn<00:00:37.620> out

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
didn't know how it was gonna turn out

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.540 
didn't know how it was gonna turn out
when<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.160> started<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:40.129> then<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.430> took

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
when I started it so then I just took

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.700 
when I started it so then I just took
some<00:00:41.610> yellow<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.450> orange<00:00:42.809> paint<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.680> just

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
some yellow and orange paint and just

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.190 
some yellow and orange paint and just
started<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.399> layering<00:00:44.820> some<00:00:45.059> paint<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.690> top

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
started with layering some paint on top

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.319 
started with layering some paint on top
of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.829> pages<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> glued<00:00:47.879> down<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of the pages that I glued down and I I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.170 
of the pages that I glued down and I I
spent<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.960> 45<00:00:52.350> minutes<00:00:52.789> total<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.969> this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
spent about 45 minutes total on this

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.500 
spent about 45 minutes total on this
canvas<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:57.170> I'm<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.379> completely<00:00:59.510> satisfied

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
canvas so I'm not completely satisfied

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
canvas so I'm not completely satisfied
with<00:01:00.690> how<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> turned<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.859> okay<00:01:02.129> for

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
with how it turned out but it's okay for

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.240 
with how it turned out but it's okay for
a<00:01:02.399> first<00:01:02.640> try<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> guess<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.920> I'm<00:01:05.010> just

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
a first try I guess and I'm just

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.660 
a first try I guess and I'm just
continuing<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.570> layer<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.990> paint<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.610> I

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
continuing to layer on paint and then I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.929 
continuing to layer on paint and then I
added<00:01:11.670> some<00:01:11.990> light<00:01:12.990> turquoise<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.340> some

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
added some light turquoise and some

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.719 
added some light turquoise and some
purple<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:18.890> just<00:01:19.890> spread<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> around<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.700> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
purple and just spread it around with a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.910 
purple and just spread it around with a
regular<00:01:21.090> paintbrush<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.619> anything

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
regular paintbrush I don't know anything

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
regular paintbrush I don't know anything
about<00:01:23.130> paint<00:01:23.490> brushes<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:24.030> anything<00:01:24.210> like

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
about paint brushes or anything like

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.859 
about paint brushes or anything like
that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
that
I<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.409> know<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.369> whatever

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
I just know what I like and whatever

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.679 
I just know what I like and whatever
works<00:01:26.880> I'll<00:01:27.810> use<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.450> my

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
works I'll use and then this was my

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.590 
works I'll use and then this was my
biggest<00:01:31.049> regret<00:01:31.619> coming<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.390> I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
biggest regret coming up right here I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.770 
biggest regret coming up right here I
took<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.810> wet<00:01:34.290> sponge<00:01:34.710> brush<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.490> went<00:01:36.479> over

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
took a wet sponge brush and went over

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.499 
took a wet sponge brush and went over
the<00:01:37.290> entire<00:01:37.470> thing<00:01:38.009> way<00:01:38.250> too<00:01:38.280> many<00:01:38.820> times<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the entire thing way too many times and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.990 
the entire thing way too many times and
it<00:01:40.439> turned<00:01:40.860> muddy

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it turned muddy

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.539 
it turned muddy
so<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> took<00:01:42.689> my<00:01:42.840> fingernail<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.920> dug<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
so I took my fingernail and just dug it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.710 
so I took my fingernail and just dug it
across<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> could<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.390> some<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
across so I could get some of that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.830 
across so I could get some of that
yellow<00:01:46.079> back<00:01:46.380> into<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.390> painting<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.420> then

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
yellow back into the painting and then

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.760 
yellow back into the painting and then
dip<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> end<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.310> my<00:01:50.610> paintbrush<00:01:51.320> into<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
dip to the end of my paintbrush into the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190 
dip to the end of my paintbrush into the
turquoise<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.909> pink<00:01:54.360> or<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.840> purple

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
turquoise and the pink or the purple

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.069 
turquoise and the pink or the purple
again<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.360> dragged<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.600> along<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
again and just dragged it along the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.399 
again and just dragged it along the
canvas<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> get<00:01:59.159> some<00:01:59.340> color<00:01:59.549> back<00:02:00.409> then

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
canvas just to get some color back then

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.190 
canvas just to get some color back then
I'm<00:02:01.560> starting<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.340> use<00:02:02.759> some<00:02:03.030> stencils<00:02:03.600> using

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
that I had gotten from that set of

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
ridge so I can get some nice perfect

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.580 
ridge so I can get some nice perfect
circles<00:02:58.860> around<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.010> painting<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:04.870> bigger

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
circles around the painting and a bigger

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.229 
circles around the painting and a bigger
circle<00:03:06.570> bigger<00:03:07.570> Cup<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.459> actually<00:03:09.670> a

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
circle bigger Cup and that is actually a

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:17.130 
circle bigger Cup and that is actually a
glittery<00:03:10.989> green<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.880> then<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.480> just<00:03:16.720> wanted<00:03:16.959> it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
glittery green and then I just wanted it

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.009 
glittery green and then I just wanted it
a<00:03:17.230> little<00:03:17.260> bit<00:03:17.590> more<00:03:17.769> opaque<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.549> mixed<00:03:18.910> some

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
a little bit more opaque so I mixed some

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.930 
a little bit more opaque so I mixed some
spring<00:03:20.019> green<00:03:20.320> color<00:03:20.709> into<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.190> glitter<00:03:21.640> and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
spring green color into that glitter and

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.949 
spring green color into that glitter and
put<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.540> in<00:03:22.660> there<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:24.120> added<00:03:25.120> some<00:03:25.420> white

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
put it in there and added some white

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.039 
put it in there and added some white
circles<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:28.090> if<00:03:28.209> you<00:03:28.299> notice<00:03:28.570> I<00:03:28.690> did<00:03:28.870> not

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
circles and if you notice I did not

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.050 
circles and if you notice I did not
clean<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.799> off<00:03:29.950> or<00:03:30.220> anything<00:03:30.549> before<00:03:30.910> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
clean it off or anything before the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.910 
clean it off or anything before the
color<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.630> they're<00:03:31.840> kind<00:03:32.080> of<00:03:32.140> swirling<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
color so they're kind of swirling and

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.900

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
trees and my leaves and I am just kind

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.069 
trees and my leaves and I am just kind
of<00:03:47.890> using<00:03:48.310> paint<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.150> sort<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.510> glue<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:49.930> on

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
of using paint to sort of glue it on

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.050 
of using paint to sort of glue it on
there<00:03:52.470> I'm<00:03:53.470> just<00:03:53.799> different<00:03:54.010> areas<00:03:54.579> where<00:03:55.030> I

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
there I'm just different areas where I

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.740 
there I'm just different areas where I
think<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.450> would<00:03:55.570> look<00:03:55.600> neat

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
think it would look neat

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.330
