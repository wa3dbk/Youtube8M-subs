00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
marbles inside a ziplock baggie here

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
marbles inside a ziplock baggie here
this<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.509> bag<00:01:30.660> I<00:01:30.690> had<00:01:30.990> laying

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this is just a little bag I had laying

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.719 
this is just a little bag I had laying
around<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.150> I<00:01:33.150> am<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.080> use<00:01:34.410> alcohol<00:01:35.400> ink

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
around and I am going to use alcohol ink

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.359 
around and I am going to use alcohol ink
and<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.330> one<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.780> called<00:01:36.990> stream<00:01:37.590> which

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and this one is called stream which

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.990 
and this one is called stream which
we'll<00:01:38.580> be<00:01:38.729> doing<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.119> blue<00:01:39.450> color<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:41.000> all

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
we'll be doing this blue color and all

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.889 
we'll be doing this blue color and all
you<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:44.149> I'm<00:01:45.149> putting<00:01:45.539> in<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.050> can<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.530> one

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
you do is I'm putting in you can see one

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.340 
you do is I'm putting in you can see one
two<00:01:48.899> maybe<00:01:49.830> three<00:01:50.369> drops<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.929> a<00:01:52.080> little

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
two maybe three drops so just a little

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.980 
two maybe three drops so just a little
bit<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.300> is<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.660> alcohol

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
bit and then this is the alcohol

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.440 
bit and then this is the alcohol
blending<00:01:55.319> solution<00:01:56.149> take<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.979> give<00:01:58.979> it

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
blending solution take this and give it

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.760 
blending solution take this and give it
maybe<00:02:00.450> three<00:02:00.899> drops<00:02:01.429> our<00:02:02.429> little<00:02:02.700> squirt

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.420 

bring<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:08.950> around<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.440> think<00:02:11.500> this<00:02:11.890> color<00:02:12.250> is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
bring it around if I think this color is

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.600 
bring it around if I think this color is
too<00:02:13.210> dark<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:14.590> I'll<00:02:14.740> just<00:02:14.980> pour<00:02:15.310> more

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
too dark then I'll just pour more

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.900 
too dark then I'll just pour more
alcohol<00:02:16.450> solution<00:02:17.050> inside<00:02:17.440> if<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.520> think<00:02:18.580> it's

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
alcohol solution inside if I think it's

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.000 
alcohol solution inside if I think it's
too<00:02:19.270> light<00:02:21.180> then<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.270> can<00:02:22.450> work<00:02:22.720> some<00:02:22.960> more<00:02:23.200> of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
too light then I can work some more of

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.910 
too light then I can work some more of
the<00:02:24.160> alcohol<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.110> great<00:02:26.410> color<00:02:26.620> rate

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
the alcohol this is a great color rate

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.710 
the alcohol this is a great color rate
so<00:02:27.820> in<00:02:28.420> order<00:02:28.630> for<00:02:28.780> these<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.320> dry<00:02:29.470> I've<00:02:30.070> got<00:02:30.340> to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
so in order for these to dry I've got to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.220 
so in order for these to dry I've got to
set<00:02:31.720> them<00:02:31.840> out<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:33.510> might<00:02:34.510> take<00:02:34.720> half<00:02:34.900> an<00:02:35.110> hour

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
set them out and might take half an hour

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.010 
set them out and might take half an hour
for<00:02:36.160> these<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.430> dry<00:02:36.610> if<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.240> they<00:02:37.570> dry<00:02:37.810> really

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
for these to dry if that they dry really

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.240 
for these to dry if that they dry really
actually<00:02:38.770> quickly<00:02:40.440> what<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:42.070> can

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
actually quickly what you can you can

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.160 
actually quickly what you can you can
reactivate<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:43.150> bag<00:02:43.420> after<00:02:43.690> it's<00:02:43.989> been

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
reactivate this bag after it's been

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.880 
reactivate this bag after it's been
dried<00:02:44.950> up<00:02:45.280> inside<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.750> could<00:02:47.230> add<00:02:47.470> more

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
dried up inside and you could add more

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.420 
dried up inside and you could add more
blocks<00:02:48.130> later<00:02:49.120> or<00:02:49.540> marbles<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.890> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
blocks later or marbles and to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:10.020 
blocks later or marbles and to
reactivate<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:08.230> great<00:03:08.650> thing<00:03:08.950> about<00:03:09.340> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
reactivate the great thing about the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.150 
reactivate the great thing about the
alcohol<00:03:10.270> inks<00:03:11.140> as<00:03:11.620> well<00:03:12.010> are<00:03:13.140> once<00:03:14.140> they<00:03:14.290> dry

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
alcohol inks as well are once they dry

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.490 
alcohol inks as well are once they dry
what<00:03:15.940> if<00:03:16.120> water<00:03:16.450> touches<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.110> they're<00:03:17.350> not

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
what if water touches it they're not

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.289 
what if water touches it they're not
going<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.830> bleed<00:03:18.100> at<00:03:18.250> all<00:03:18.370> if<00:03:18.700> they<00:03:18.850> don't<00:03:19.090> run

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
going to bleed at all if they don't run

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.420 
going to bleed at all if they don't run
at<00:03:19.510> all<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.870> only<00:03:20.170> thing<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.590> can<00:03:20.799> make<00:03:21.070> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
at all the only thing that can make the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.720 
at all the only thing that can make the
color<00:03:21.760> come<00:03:22.150> off<00:03:22.390> is<00:03:23.459> blending<00:03:24.459> solution
