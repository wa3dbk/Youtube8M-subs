 with a national gateway is a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.270
 which was carefully prepared 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.280
 scheduled 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.220
 taking into account your part 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.070
 the concept for the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.530
 restaurant is innovative the project begins 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.049
 by the use of concrete environment 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.770
 providing less impact to the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.720
 pure gabion led lamps and still 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.590
 provides for the implementation of a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.810
 wind and photovoltaics and stove 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.320
 wood for heating system 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.530
 water and cooking tesar nal cuts organic 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.470
 which promises a menu differentiated to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.799
 people will work with the card that is 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.430
 the organic part is and when I say the part 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.869
 organic foods are made in the house 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.600
 like your bread that is developed in the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.970
 house with a garden that the house owns is 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.850
 like the suppliers who share this 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.049
 same view they are being careful to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.820
 with plants other than the medium 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.429
 environment with the world and is a bit of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.140
 surprise I can not now tell what it is 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.319
 the menu but I can say that the people 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.989
 will have both in the part is 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.719
 This is very well defined and 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.519
 I have I had the opportunity to open 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.219
 the door and a great professional in the 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.340
 past that was the one toninho a 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:29.129

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.510
 the concept of Japanese cuisine then 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.510

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.290
 cooking is like giving the name of a 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.450
 Eastern cuisine is where we are going 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.060
 work close to the most elaborate 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.299

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.560
 is the very well defined part of the petiscaria 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.900
 remembering that using always is elements 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.299
 that are close to the people elements that 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.030
 are in the region the face that spends the cloth 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.889
 and will run from Wednesday to Saturday and 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.900

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.760
 the opening is scheduled for 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.069
 first week of June 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.780
 but this inauguration was also 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.370
 view with a little of the concept of the house and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.659
 today it is scheduled for the first 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.859
 week of June, and there is precisely one 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.599
 week that is the world day on day 5 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.669
 World Environment Week 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.040

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.930
 very strong and that we are inaugurating 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.590
 that date this structure is there 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.109
 practically prepared people who have already 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.599
 have the opportunity to visit the colors - 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.310
 passing by the door is a 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.220
 venture that is pioneering 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.180
 but it is an enterprise he believes 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.500
 a lot is in what is to come in these 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.500
 experiences to come
