00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.250
 and convinced that you can win because 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.970
 I have studied up no rival 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.280
 takes place earned but not scary 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.189
 because we have a good team too 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 I trust my team and we're going to 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.929
 work let's study well let's go 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.669
 to prepare to win is always good 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.460
 against teams like that because they come well 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.869
 because it has been enlarged by a lot of people 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.869
 that has been greatly enlarged 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.039
 and if you do not do not talk about great rival 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.379
 I have not listened to any journalist who 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.739
 I have criticized that I have seen something wrong 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.739
 above 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.000
 my team and a good team but good 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.480
 we also have what is ours and 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.339
 let's try to do that what 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.989
 we know how to do what effect you see 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.469
 then up we will not try to do 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.469
 on Sunday 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.750
 the rolfi was not that far away 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.750
 montenegro 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.810
 something other than doing them 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.660
 really independent went out to play at 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 arrive on the river court with that 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.370
 premise was surprised at 3 minutes 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.790
 with this free shot we have seen him di 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.620
 Mary 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.450
 recently the Manchester to which he is 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.580
 making a similar goal those centers 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.550
 very well thrown to that anyone the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.560
 touch with the head and the archer many 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.210
 Sometimes they become goals directly 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.400
 a play that originally its center 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.570
 it is very difficult it is very difficult too 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.450
 start a game in this category 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.550
 losing after three minutes changes everything 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.300
 the change to the whole fight 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.780
 we started against some of the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.250
 river answers his archer to the river 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.810
 it does not reach him much but when it arrives 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.710
 so far at least but that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.020
 goes to the championship 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.750
 barovero responds very well especially the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.210
 first giving a bounce to the side 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.280
 well open alone on this play I told him 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.020
 It's good to forgive me I took her river 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.060
 plays gives the feeling of playing as if 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.100
 I was in a training 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.290
 enjoying it there is an enjoyment 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.200
 based on trust or riding the 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.910
 trust that why when I 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.820
 you asked a word I said two in 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.700
 the entrance to the person because I say 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.420
 when a team plays well but also 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.250
 win and golea I think that beyond the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.470
 issues without joke so everyone 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.360
 can hold the etcetera etcetera south 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.270
 that is one one has to find 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.890
 certain enjoyment still flying low and 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.430
 they also all come out because rocks do not 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.350
 had a goal since December 2011 in 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.330
 the first river goal that makes red 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.640
 professionals officially the fact a 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.910
 goal to racing for a summer tournament 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.070
 allows that goal that makes the 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.880
 extension because it's awesome the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.410
 central room plus the ball wears 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.810
 that does not move does not turn on the ball 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.090
 on its own axis enters fully the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.100
 whiplash is the technical preparation of the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.330
 aunts let me say something that said 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.920
 after all they are saying 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.670
 you just need to go down 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.550
 but it has also good 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.430
 benefits of its main 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.290
 players there is almost no game under 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.300
 on riba exactly that is edge 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.700
 high championship that is mancuello 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.010
 for independent decisive software 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.140
 for the red arrived in 12 minutes it comes out 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.610
 curiously independent mariano 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.590
 I get to tell you the best moment of 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.620
 river was closer to the third and 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.540
 lasted eight minutes is emotional with the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.370
 tula rodrÃ­guez error that tula because 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.540
 Rodrigo is watching the play and knows 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.050
 that they will give him the ball was going to be 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.050
 back off 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:58.600
 for me not only the play ends here 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.170
 another new play is called many times 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.180
 misunderstanding between which today 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.390
 defender after guys let's go back to 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.310
 touching the east are Malaga it takes 4 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.989
 100 archer jumps to try to 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.640
 reject the ball and the ball passes more 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.220
 50 centimeters of some of his 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.079
 hands that's what happens in this 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.079
 play and the drive to the side more more 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:21.019
 far 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:24.560
 an exquisite left-handed awesome now 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.660
 there were 18 minutes in the 90 long that 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.460
 lasted the match they were was a 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.930
 torture because let's say here what 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.510
 we are seeing is the round trip that 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.470
 it seems a product of rescuing 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.470
 main plays
