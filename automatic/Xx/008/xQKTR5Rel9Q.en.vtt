00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 but not being me I do not do in the kitchen 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.690
 many cooks have him or cooks 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.580
 of they have panic to the smell that the garlic gives 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.710
 hands grab it and this is not going 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:18.750
 it's easy to solve, I'll explain 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:20.970
 today we have four tricks or ways of 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.789
 peel a garlic the first would be to put 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.590
 gloves the smell of garlic are transferred 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.109
 gloves not the hands the second would be 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.960
 manipulate it through this little 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.329
 plastic container the third would be to 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.149
 through a metal that rubbing the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.910
 hands are transferred the metal and the last 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.760
 it would be under the tap water without 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.489
 never get to rub we take a base 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.129
 so that we do not leave we put a rag 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.710
 of kitchen so we remain fixed we take the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.079
 Garlic 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.829
 and the first method we're going to do is 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.440
 to be with this we have 2 3 4 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.300
 Now he took it out and we have the garlic 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.149
 without touching them, they are a little 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.850
 regulín but but good he is worth truck and two 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.850
 gloves that more than chic trucchi 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.039
 and the third one we are going to do with our 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.840
 own hands like almost all the 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.079
 world at home or in a restaurant or 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.020
 wherever it is to fill our hands 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:27.170
 smell we have our garlics peeled and 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.340
 the sticky hands that are full of 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.570
 garlic let's open the tap 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.689
 let's let the water run and let's 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.780
 put your hands here and we're going to 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.670
 help from a piece of metal to finish 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.619
 to wash us like soap and a 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.619
 Once we have washed our hands 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.689
 we drain and let them air dry and 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.090
 finally how to keep these garlics already 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.619
 the time to flavor an oil we need 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.329
 these garlics that we just peeled and a 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.479
 glass jar with a laurel leaf 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.310
 basil or what more you like it 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.750
 I like that it gives a spicy touch with 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.840
 which I will also take a 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.070
 chilli pepper we open the pot 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.070
 we add the garlic 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.170
 bay leaf we break 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.370
 and the chilli 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.560
 with its nuggets and everything and we add oil 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.980
 good quality extra virgin olive 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.640
 we close we promote a little and the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.370
 fridge 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.459
 here we have our flavored oil 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 in 23 days you will already notice the taste of 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.530
 oil with a little picantón and flavor garlic 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.470
 and the garlic can be used 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.250
 perfectly for a week 15 days 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.250
 one month
