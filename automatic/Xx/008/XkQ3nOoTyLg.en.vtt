 there thure of violence 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.260
 pure wonder but remains well positioned at the start everything is true 

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:57.059
 that I say to myself oh here I am a little bit not 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.789
 this is too much 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.150
 this case also benefited the trial 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.670
 together at the end of the alert by sms with a little more than you launch the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.950
 talks 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.939
 there is not at all the impression of confinement really 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:09.920
 not 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.890
 a little more 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.220

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.640
 do I really have to use the three 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.480

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.060
 another black point 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.130
 machines 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.930
