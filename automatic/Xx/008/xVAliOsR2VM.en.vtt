00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.700
 basic structure of the retina 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.709
 first part neurons of the visual path 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.340
 the photoreceptors the cells 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:21.310
 bipolar and ganglion cells the 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.740
 Retina is a transparent tissue and 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.830
 sensitive to the light that covers the 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.330
 inner surface of the eyeball 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.700
 histologically the retina is a 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.040
 very complex structure formed by 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.760
 millions of cells with multiple 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.100
 complex interactions and synapses like 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.309
 we already studied the photoreceptors in 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.860
 previous videos in the current one we are going to 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.550
 refer to bipolar cells and 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.489
 ganglionic bipolar cells are 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.040
 very modified neurons located 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.080
 towards the middle of the retina who in the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.680
 cellular body in the nuclear layer 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.960
 internal their dendrites make synapses with 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.840
 the photoreceptors and the cells 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.890
 horizontal at aplec level if form 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.840
 external and its axon that is longer makes 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.470
 direct synapse with cells 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.899
 ganglion in the cones and indirect 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.570
 through cells to machines in the 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.770
 sticks at aplec level if shape 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.770
 internal 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.100
 Bipolar cells make synapses 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.490
 only with cones or only with canes but 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.979
 not with both 8 to 9 types have been described 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.469
 different bipolar cells for 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.220
 cones but only one type of cell 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:42.870
 bipolar for canes 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.880
 Cones path has fewer elements 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.020
 the direct path of the blue cones 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.230
 consists of three neurons the blue cone 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.630
 stimulates a single bipolar cell type on 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.110
 first synapse that in turn without up 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.450
 is with a ganglion cell tipÃ³n 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.330
 second synapse the first synapse 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.000
 is modulated by horizontal cells and 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.850
 the second by cells to machines the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.920
 green and red cones make synapses with 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.709
 two functional types of cells 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.860
 bipolar that start two separate ways 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.590
 driving visual stimulation 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.070
 bipolar cells center on imaginantes 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.040
 and bipolar cells centers to flat 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.330
 which in turn synapse with two 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.870
 ganglion cells on and off 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.049
 respectively 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.049
 day of the canes have at least 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.120
 four neurons the canes make 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.480
 direct synapses with cells 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.459
 bipolar cane type brush that 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.819
 they do not contact directly with 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.190
 ganglion but indirectly 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.010
 through cells to type 2 machines can fit 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.530
 several possibilities if the cells to 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.590
 machines make synapses with the cells 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.400
 ganglionaries the path of the canes is 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.849
 of 4 bipolar photoreceptor neurons 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.849
 from stick to machines to 2 and ganglion 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.239
 but many times the machines to 2 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.239
 excited by tight junctions to the 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.260
 bipolar cells of the colon and inhibit 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.629
 known bipolar cells 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.790
 glycine inhibitory synapses for 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.640
 then follow the path of the cones 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.569
 making synapses with the ganglion 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.889
 in this case the cane path has the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.650
 minus five photoreceptor neurons 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:43.099
 bipolar cane to macri nasa 2 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.340
 Bipolar cone and ganglion cells 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.370
 lymph nodes are located near the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.340
 internal surface of the retina there is 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.299
 12 to 15 million ganglion cells 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.090
 in the retina for about 125 million 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:02.269
 receiving photos so on average 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.450
 each ganglion cell receives impulses 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.390
 of about 100 photoreceptors the numbers 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.359
 vary widely between individuals and according to 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.480
 location in the fovea there is a cell 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.789
 ganglion for 1 to 6 cones while in 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.699
 the peripheral retina a cell 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:22.550
 ganglion receives impulses from hundreds of 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.699
 canes the axon of the cells 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.550
 ganglion is very long happens to the layer 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:31.070
 of optic nerve fibers and is directed 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.250
 towards the optical disk or for battery 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.039
 form the optic nerve where honey and 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.590
 Nice to leave the eyeball and 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.810
 it directs towards the middle brain the 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.090
 ganglion cells of the visual pathway 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.880
 they form three ways that are very well 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.780
 differentiated in him 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.380

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.290

 10% of the win is with a tree 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.110
 very developed dendritic receive 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.470
 impulses of canes and cones via parvo

 the won are the last discovered 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.180
 they are smaller and receive impulses from 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.490
 the blue cones will explain more 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.770
