00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
because i like dead silence then it

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.400 
because i like dead silence then it

lab<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.000> background<00:04:27.360> here<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:28.020> sometimes<00:04:28.800> run

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
lab this background here I sometimes run

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.130 
lab this background here I sometimes run
over<00:04:29.190> here<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.760> see<00:04:30.150> if<00:04:30.270> I<00:04:30.360> can<00:04:30.510> pick<00:04:30.600> up<00:04:30.810> some

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
over here to see if I can pick up some

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.290 
over here to see if I can pick up some
stragglers<00:04:31.650> over<00:04:31.860> here<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.160> what<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.880> do<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.120> I

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
stragglers over here and what I do is I

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.660 
stragglers over here and what I do is I
remember<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:35.690> pretty<00:04:36.690> much<00:04:36.780> know<00:04:37.110> or<00:04:37.560> can<00:04:38.340> guess

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
remember I pretty much know or can guess

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.090 
remember I pretty much know or can guess
where<00:04:39.120> people<00:04:39.510> are<00:04:39.570> going<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.750> spawn<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.350> when

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
where people are going to spawn and when

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.950 
where people are going to spawn and when
like<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.700> just<00:04:41.760> predicted<00:04:42.420> that<00:04:42.600> someone's

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
like I just predicted that someone's

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.950 
like I just predicted that someone's
gonna<00:04:43.050> spawn<00:04:43.290> back<00:04:43.470> here<00:04:47.450> seems<00:04:48.450> like<00:04:48.660> walking

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
gonna spawn back here seems like walking

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.440 
gonna spawn back here seems like walking
so<00:04:51.960> predicting<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.950> spawn<00:04:53.130> is<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.370> major<00:04:54.030> part

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
so predicting the spawn is a major part

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.130 
so predicting the spawn is a major part
of<00:04:54.600> getting<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:55.050> MOAB<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:56.790> I

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
of getting a MOAB and I

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.840 
of getting a MOAB and I
it's<00:05:00.140> not<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.290> portable<00:05:00.710> radar<00:05:00.890> yeah<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.760> was

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
it's not a portable radar yeah that was

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.280 
it's not a portable radar yeah that was
probably<00:05:02.030> one<00:05:02.480> of<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.630> first<00:05:02.840> times<00:05:02.960> using

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
probably one of the first times using

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.860 
probably one of the first times using
portable<00:05:03.710> radar<00:05:03.950> I<00:05:07.030> had<00:05:08.030> just<00:05:08.240> unlocked<00:05:08.720> it

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
portable radar I had just unlocked it

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.540 
portable radar I had just unlocked it
along<00:05:09.140> with<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.620> p7<00:05:11.560> enemy<00:05:12.560> UAV<00:05:12.710> spotted<00:05:12.980> a

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
along with it and p7 enemy UAV spotted a

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:21.730 
along with it and p7 enemy UAV spotted a
pretty<00:05:14.480> sure<00:05:19.210> think<00:05:20.210> so<00:05:20.360> sorry<00:05:21.050> for<00:05:21.440> my<00:05:21.560> life

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
pretty sure think so sorry for my life

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.760 
pretty sure think so sorry for my life
but<00:05:22.550> I've<00:05:22.700> done<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.000> hold<00:05:23.900> on<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.200> commentaries
