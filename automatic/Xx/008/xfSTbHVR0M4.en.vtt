00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello to all of you it's mr and 56 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.160
 we find ourselves today a new 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.300
 video so not a video a little bit 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.730
 particular as the last time 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.990
 registered longer hours so I 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.179
 you had made a league team 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.730
 So here I 'm going to introduce you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.650
 new league 1 team but even these 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.939
 much more successful recreation the other 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.430
 cost around 3000 catherine 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.800
 credit and then we went on 11 11 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.949
 even 12 credits between ten and twelve 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.300
 a thousand credit here so we'll do in 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.110
 same time the team 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.200
 so I chose for a snow 4-2-3-1 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.600
 came the other way 4 2 3 1 the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.280
 second because there the case of three 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.120
 years c2 is dead so it's so I 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.620
 preferred mgmt because here is no 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.230
 not what I say - 4 2 3 1 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.820
 it was a pass to 82 the cell here 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.960
 so long runner I'm going to put it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.719
 good it's always against the last 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 time I leave in addition I was not 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.149
 I have not made this type of credit no 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.010
 a league coach 1 so we go 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.369
 start to happen 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.140
 here we are already going off league 1 up 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.900
 and so it's ruffier 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.590
 the stehanese so here is stéphane 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.390
 ruffier very good we can see these stages 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.909
 that's 83 dive work of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.050
 rehabilitation 82 position 81 2 the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.110
 escape route 78 it has a 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.790
 average speed and long is not bad 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.180
 frankly and I recommend you duration 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:41.870
 normal then here in central defender 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.540
 this is the phenomenon of the other 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.890
 side we go there alex the Parisian so at 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.520
 a very big speed but still 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.550
 Defense and a big head 86 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.760
 I knew before me cannabis all 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.080
 that but hey I preferred I'm favorite 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.020
 put at ease anyway that's it's 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.490
 a big support behind so already for 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.220
 prices so in russia i managed to 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.190
 having got it 150 the price the average price is 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.110
 Alex I amused him to a thousand pardons me 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.510
 So here is fast game of the game bought 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.030
 precisely this video the second 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.390
 central defender his tonsils so 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.540
 so here is so very very big abidal 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.220
 frankly it's great it's it's a 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.090
 little old certainly but still if 19 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.850
 defense 70 he has a speed that is 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.070
 blond enough for a central defender 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.260
 but he is really he is rather 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.480
 complete and leave there a true monkey a 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.160
 true success a real foot and it is 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.790
 really good he organizes it's a 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.890
 good captain the right defender it's 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.709
 always fanni rod here so I have 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.140
 not changed him he's very good I 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.840
 always left 800 85 speed Credit 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.340
 76,262 head is the most complete of the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.430
 right advocates and so I had not said 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.720
 abidal 650 credit so so here's so 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.120
 pronounce players not too expensive 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.070
 around line credit the defender 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.930
 left he's Parisian he's also 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.340
 for that I held alex the other 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.489
 side is maxwell 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.610
 here we change the saf and generate the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:14.120
 So that's maxwell for 700 credit 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.400
 so mac what is very good very good 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.330
 I was young he reaches 82 goes into 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.050
 pulls that goes well rather full paris he 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.140
 has pretty much everything 70 by all and 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.410
 it is a very good element after middle 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.450
 Defensive I put a new Parisian 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.700
 because I had cheyrou before but 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.040
 i saw that motta really cost not 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.960
 dear I hesitated with vera team and go 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.550
 motta is still better even if 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.920
 because he still has a bigger 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.360
 kherrati head and in dribbles he is a 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.060
 little better good by cons the speed 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.160
 6 drags a little but it's not it's not 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.820
 too serious that so no here so I 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.820
 favorite motta cheyrou so so here it is 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.200
 after the middle right did that the 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.210
 criticism and all that but in the game I 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.770
 find it really good pastore 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.670
 javier pastore so I will not say 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.680
 motta 450 credit so do not fool yourself 750 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.070
 premium it's been four hours four 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.010
 from Paris 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.590
 good it's okay but really 80's 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.570
 92 flange speed it's really not bad 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.049
 good after 76 to say that's not bad 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.209
 also but I really find that 66 of 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.609
 speed and it's exaggerated we used to say before 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.920
 that his strength his strength was to be 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.750
 to be fast all that and frankly 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.000
 Pastore is not the most 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.490
 fast of its category but I find 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.230
 than 66 speed and it's a bit 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.820
 exaggerated for a player like him after 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:39.160
 in the middle left so there heavy 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.610
 alessandrini according to 76.2 general but who 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.890
 going a lot of the 1900 credit 80 have two 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.360
 speeds it's mostly it's mostly the 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:52.660
 purpose of speed stuff 80 for the 1900 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.880
 credit 78 ° 74 shooting 60 42 shots 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.340
 pass forgiveness so that's extremely 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.480
 complete if we force the general we can 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.550
 in four years or speed to go 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.530
 for that makes a good winger who can 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.300
 come in support 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.300
 the attacking midfielder his attics I the 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.310
 found very good frankly for not 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.740
 too much for frankly 800 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:17.140
 credit he 79th 82 71 speed pass 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.169
 74 shots plus there are some great 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.700
 kicks c 4 star wrong foot 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.730
 we see there so it is really not bad 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.970
 French Antilles then after I 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.160
 chose an extremely fast attack 86 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.680
 speed for the attack so Lacazette 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.660
 on the left side 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.450
 this is lacazette 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.390
 86 of speed only 69 years old pulls but 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.520
 it's really good 77 of driss 72's 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.160
 head so it's complete if the mans 650 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.930
 credit and and frankly it's really 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.330
 very good after on the left side 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.690
 so I chose jérémy ménez so he 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.840
 cost him more than 1700 credit 86 of 8 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.150
 aces 87 of dribbles 78 of flat is 190 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.370
 this four stars of the east and 4 stars 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.280
 bad foot which 86 87 it's just 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.360
 a request for one for a scorer so 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.160
 that's why I chose it 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.880
 an attack to a 86 speed is 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.890
 really huge 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.740
 so no here so you can 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.950
 easily won with this attack from 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.810
 good fire so that's all for this 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.690
 small team so it's a team 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.370
 binding for between ten and twelve thousand 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.680
 credit I tell you but after if you 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.180
 do not want to put 2700 credit in the 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.420
 jérémy ménez if you do not have the 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.860
 credit you choose you end up by 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.400
 another salomon kalou we would have taken 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.720
 a gignac 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.790
 they hang around they hold very well the 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.080
 route they are quite complete stages 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.460
 like that but I had money to 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.280
 to spend because I won the divine 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.170
 10 off line and so I went 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.460
 says why not Jeremie ménez is without 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.110
 doubt already seen armero in a pact of 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.180
 fidelity so I was able to sell it and 1200 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.850
 So it made me three credits and 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.610
 frankly jérémy ménez is frankly 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.550
 he is really good 86 of 8 aces 87 of 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.080
 dribbling which is so here after 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.910
 if there are players for example here I am 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.180
 mean replaced by kalou so it has 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.770
 between ten and twelve thousand credit a 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.880
 team but really very strong 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.080
 it's one of the best teams of 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.900
 league 1 we can do and we replace 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.790
 lacazette by zlatan is on the side 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.070
 right in may we break on the side 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.900
 left lavezzi and whose goals sirigu 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:20.010
 good after that will make too many Parisians 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:22.350
 but here it is so here it is 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.520
 very well seen that I advise myself after 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.470
 do as you feel 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.050
 but really this one is 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.460
 extremely powerful good go this is 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.070
 everything for me guys we end up 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.350
 soon by the way for the second challenge 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.060
 so the third challenge will soon come out 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.490
 the charles game second of the movies and no 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.690
 because 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.270
 I do not want to lose too much 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:43.680
 time so here it is 5 hours 10 so 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.680
 go hi to all
