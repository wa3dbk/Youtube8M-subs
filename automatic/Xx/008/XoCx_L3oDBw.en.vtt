00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:04.170
 if the ford request and search 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.960
 Ricardo believes that the spin 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.189
 loop a small modification that we will do in the stanza pms 70 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:13.619
 Thanks 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.699
 of course that is no longer what the surface 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.609
 but this xerox modification will accompany 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.829
 brings a little but the result on certain days 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.539
 and has its validity 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.579
 with the aid of the Serra 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.820
 we make a small cut and 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.699
 on the head of the bait 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.370
 here in this final agreement 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.370
 We're going to put a little 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.900
 is what can be of various materials is that I will use a zen material 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.190
 plastic we are going to change it and we will try at home soon to do 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.220
 lupo peru little cap that some call the horn on the list 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.430
 I'm leaving the pliers 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.820
 and a file 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.170
 I'm going to change that little piece of plastic 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.420
 which is actually a bit of rule 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.660
 for us to make pop 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.650
 until you reach the desired point 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.250
 here we change cast 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.759
 and let's try now 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.800
 paste on the line 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.870
 to stand in this position here so far granted araldite we will do 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.840
 this job 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.990
 Let's put that 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.660
 but my physical shape 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.660
 Have already done 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.280
 now we wait a few minutes after drying 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.359
 its placement of the a-3 and I went out to fish it looks there personal 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.740
 we have here 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.759
 regional scale of the account in those 70 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.130
 and you risk that we change 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.460
 but if he desisted in or near as disarming 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.440
 but we put in the bait 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.370
 foot when we give 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.520
 as stated 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.440
 but a disturbance in water 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.300
 noise and really are very attractive to several predatory fish and 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.520
 mainly the global 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.410
 who interests brilliant idea of ​​lisbon - south 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.960
 became trevisan 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.860
 started with the black pope and with other baits 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.429
 this is what we can do several baits of water-based lye mainly 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.749
 testimony and issued noise 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.020
 this group and the characteristic of the poor of citi 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.889
 or this surface 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.880
 with this photo pib of each researcher is sure to expect many fish 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.069
 but remember and 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.699
 do not kill test below average
