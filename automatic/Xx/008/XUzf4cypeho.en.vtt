first go to my channel my second third

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.120 
first go to my channel my second third
two<00:00:08.030> already<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:10.080> connected<00:00:10.740> these<00:00:10.889> all

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
two already so I connected these all

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.430 
two already so I connected these all
together<00:00:11.280> because<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.599> would<00:00:12.750> take<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.259> long

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
together because it would take so long

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.780 
together because it would take so long
showing<00:00:13.889> how<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:14.639> I've

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
showing how to do it because I've

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.450 
showing how to do it because I've
already<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.299> third<00:00:15.540> video<00:00:16.070> my<00:00:17.070> camera's

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
already in my third video my camera's

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.689 
already in my third video my camera's
giving<00:00:17.699> me<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> tough<00:00:18.119> time<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:20.310> most

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
giving me a tough time and the most

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.519 
giving me a tough time and the most
important<00:00:21.240> thing<00:00:21.420> about<00:00:21.510> connecting<00:00:22.109> them<00:00:22.289> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
important thing about connecting them is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.160 
important thing about connecting them is
to<00:00:22.830> make<00:00:23.010> sure<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.550> when<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.449> connect<00:00:24.930> them

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
to make sure that when you connect them

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.740 
to make sure that when you connect them
that<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.279> petals<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.820> laying<00:00:26.970> side<00:00:27.300> by<00:00:27.330> side

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
that the petals are laying side by side

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.919 
that the petals are laying side by side
so<00:00:28.080> none<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.500> beads<00:00:28.710> break<00:00:29.330> now<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.750> going

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
so none of the beads break now I'm going

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.510 
so none of the beads break now I'm going
to<00:00:30.990> show<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:32.630> how<00:00:33.860> they<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.010> supposed<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> be

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
to show you how they are supposed to be

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
to show you how they are supposed to be
laid<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:35.880> when<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> connect<00:00:36.899> them<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.590> so

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
laid out when you connect them just so

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.959 
laid out when you connect them just so
when<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.950> wear<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> necklace<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.790> lays

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

correctly all right

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.279 
correctly all right
zoom<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:43.100> okay<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> top<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
zoom in okay so this is the top of the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.740 
zoom in okay so this is the top of the
necklace<00:00:46.710> where<00:00:47.340> you're<00:00:47.789> next<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.570> be

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
necklace where you're next going to be

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.910 
necklace where you're next going to be
and<00:00:50.180> all<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.420> flowers<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.530> lay<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and all the flowers have to lay a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.990 
and all the flowers have to lay a
certain<00:00:53.309> direction<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:55.280> for<00:00:56.280> instance<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
certain direction and for instance this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.560 
certain direction and for instance this
one<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> laying<00:00:58.379> right<00:00:58.620> side<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.609> this<00:01:00.390> is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
one is laying right side up so this is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.939 
one is laying right side up so this is
the<00:01:00.719> top<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.109> flower<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the top of flower and this will be the

the top of flower and this will be the
bottom<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> star<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> top<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
bottom like a star so at the top of the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.200 
bottom like a star so at the top of the
necklace<00:01:06.409> up<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.369> flower<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.030> actually

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
necklace up here this flower is actually

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.050 
necklace up here this flower is actually
upside<00:01:10.080> down<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:11.189> how<00:01:11.310> there's<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.580> petals

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
upside down see how there's two petals

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.870 
upside down see how there's two petals
are<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:14.280> would<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> top<00:01:14.850> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
are here and this would be the top of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.140 
are here and this would be the top of
flower<00:01:16.159> because<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:17.460> they're<00:01:17.640> laying<00:01:17.850> in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
flower because of how they're laying in

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.899 
flower because of how they're laying in
the<00:01:18.509> direction<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.830> one's<00:01:20.040> upside<00:01:20.460> down

these ones are out and I have my little
flowers<00:01:29.970> connected<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.640> chain

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
flowers connected with two of the chain

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.149 
flowers connected with two of the chain
links<00:01:33.270> there's<00:01:33.869> two<00:01:34.079> more<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:35.070> have

links there's two more and I have
another<00:01:35.460> chain<00:01:35.820> link<00:01:36.000> here<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.479> connects

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
another chain link here that connects

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
another chain link here that connects
the<00:01:37.439> rest<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:37.860> roller<00:01:38.070> chain<00:01:38.400> same<00:01:39.030> thing

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the rest of my roller chain same thing

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.929 
the rest of my roller chain same thing
on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> other<00:01:39.540> side<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> go<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
on the other side so when I go to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.480 
on the other side so when I go to
connect<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.540> flowers<00:01:42.810> together<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.439> start<00:01:44.280> with

connect my flowers together I start with

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.770 
connect my flowers together I start with
these<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.409> lay<00:01:46.409> them<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.939> just<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.060> this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
these I lay them out just like this

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.260 
these I lay them out just like this
and<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.500> connect<00:01:50.100> take<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:50.759> link<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and I connect take one link and I

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.020 
and I connect take one link and I
connect<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.220> flower<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:53.610> sitting<00:01:53.970> in

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
connect on a flower that's sitting in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.179 
connect on a flower that's sitting in
this<00:01:54.180> direction<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.040> have

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
then I connect it to another one so I

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.340 
then I connect it to another one so I
start<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.149> these<00:02:00.689> two<00:02:00.750> links<00:02:01.290> here

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
start with these two links here

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.969 
start with these two links here
connecting<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:02.610> three<00:02:02.670> flowers<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.680> then

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
connecting these three flowers and then

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.010 
connecting these three flowers and then
I<00:02:05.250> go<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.460> down<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:07.229> rest<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:08.330> my<00:02:09.330> flowers

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
I go on down to the rest of my flowers

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.170 
I go on down to the rest of my flowers
and<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.379> connect<00:02:10.800> two<00:02:11.069> flowers<00:02:11.610> together<00:02:11.760> with

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and I connect two flowers together with

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.970 
and I connect two flowers together with
one<00:02:12.450> link

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
one link

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.140 
one link
this<00:02:13.970> link<00:02:14.239> here<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.690> then<00:02:15.129> I<00:02:16.129> bring<00:02:16.670> these

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
this link here and then I bring these

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.320 
this link here and then I bring these
two<00:02:17.390> flowers<00:02:17.769> together<00:02:18.769> with<00:02:18.980> these<00:02:19.190> by<00:02:20.060> cut

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
two flowers together with these by cut

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.930 
two flowers together with these by cut
by<00:02:21.019> connecting<00:02:21.650> them<00:02:21.799> with<00:02:21.860> two<00:02:22.549> Mullings

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
by connecting them with two Mullings

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.210 
by connecting them with two Mullings
here<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.920> here

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
here here and here

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.430 
here here and here
so<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.000> should<00:02:26.330> have<00:02:27.220> two<00:02:28.220> things<00:02:28.430> here

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
so you should have two things here

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.339 
so you should have two things here
connecting<00:02:31.299> two<00:02:32.299> links<00:02:32.660> there<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.200> there

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
connecting two links there so there

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.380 
connecting two links there so there
should<00:02:33.500> be<00:02:33.620> cluster<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.430> three<00:02:34.790> here<00:02:35.209> and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
should be cluster of three here and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.520 
should be cluster of three here and
three<00:02:35.450> here<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:37.420> if<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.599> study<00:02:38.989> really<00:02:39.049> good

three here and if you study really good

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.589 
three here and if you study really good
in<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.739> camera<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.280> hit<00:02:40.430> pause<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.209> see

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
in the camera and hit pause you can see

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
freely in here so two petals are going

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.890 
freely in here so two petals are going
to<00:03:04.760> be<00:03:04.819> going<00:03:05.000> through<00:03:05.120> one<00:03:05.299> link<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.690> into

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
to be going through one link and into

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.759

music so I'm going to show you how I

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.000 
music so I'm going to show you how I
connect<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.690> now<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:11.959> not<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:12.440> as<00:03:12.560> easy<00:03:12.799> as

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
connect it now it's not just as easy as

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.520 
connect it now it's not just as easy as
connecting<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.730> because<00:03:14.150> if<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.540> don't<00:03:14.660> do<00:03:15.410> it

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
connecting it because if you don't do it

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.349 
connecting it because if you don't do it
right<00:03:15.560> you'll<00:03:16.040> break<00:03:16.280> your<00:03:16.340> bead<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.090> then<00:03:17.269> you

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
right you'll break your bead so then you

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.640 
right you'll break your bead so then you
have<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.599> remake<00:03:17.900> your<00:03:18.049> flower<00:03:18.349> and<00:03:18.500> I've
