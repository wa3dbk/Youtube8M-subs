five minutes it was sort of like as we

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.250 
five minutes it was sort of like as we
say<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.020> France<00:00:43.309> putting<00:00:44.309> Paris<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> bottle

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260

management for people who are interested

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.240 
management for people who are interested
in<00:00:57.360> sort<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> out-of-the-box<00:00:58.859> thinking<00:00:59.579> about

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
in sort of out-of-the-box thinking about

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
in sort of out-of-the-box thinking about
subjects<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.460> general<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.719> happens<00:01:04.110> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
subjects in general and this happens to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
subjects in general and this happens to
be<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.650> that's<00:01:04.890> particularly<00:01:05.339> relevant<00:01:05.729> from

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
be one that's particularly relevant from

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.969 
be one that's particularly relevant from
that<00:01:06.450> point<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> view<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.470> has<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.799> do

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that point of view because it has to do

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.670 
that point of view because it has to do
with<00:01:08.280> human<00:01:09.210> nature<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.229> way<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> mind

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
with human nature and the way the mind

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130 
with human nature and the way the mind
works<00:01:11.030> it's<00:01:12.030> an<00:01:12.119> absolute<00:01:12.450> revolution<00:01:12.750> taking

place right now in the area of cognitive
neurosciences<00:01:16.100> because<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> first<00:01:17.490> time

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
neurosciences because for the first time

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.280 
neurosciences because for the first time
we're<00:01:19.200> actually<00:01:19.500> able<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.189> look<00:01:21.080> inside<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
we're actually able to look inside the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.780 
we're actually able to look inside the
brain<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:22.890> how<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> brain<00:01:23.580> is

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
brain and see how the brain is

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.480 
brain and see how the brain is
functioning<00:01:24.170> pretty<00:01:25.170> much<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.530> real<00:01:25.710> time

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490

more and more efficient and with a lot

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.749 
more and more efficient and with a lot

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
of soft words that are around it that
allows<00:01:39.420> us<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.960> analyze<00:01:40.500> what's<00:01:40.799> going

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
allows us really to analyze what's going

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
allows us really to analyze what's going
on<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.240> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.630> an<00:01:42.720> impact

actually<00:02:34.780> now<00:02:35.080> we<00:02:35.140> know<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.650> brain<00:02:35.830> can

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
actually now we know that the brain can

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
are all very very good things you can

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.520 
are all very very good things you can
hardly<00:04:55.670> argue<00:04:56.060> against<00:04:56.480> them<00:04:56.600> on<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.410> other

hardly argue against them on the other

hardly argue against them on the other
hand<00:04:57.830> for<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.490> follower<00:04:58.910> there<00:04:59.300> what<00:04:59.750> we

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
hand for the follower there what we

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.390 
hand for the follower there what we
found<00:05:00.050> is<00:05:00.260> that<00:05:00.290> they're<00:05:00.560> not<00:05:00.680> necessarily

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
found is that they're not necessarily

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.280 
found is that they're not necessarily
very<00:05:01.700> engaging<00:05:02.980> and<00:05:03.980> so<00:05:04.430> we're<00:05:05.420> neuroscience

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
very engaging and so we're neuroscience

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.710 
very engaging and so we're neuroscience

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
can be instrumental is is looking at it

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.390 
can be instrumental is is looking at it
in<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.930> somewhat<00:05:09.440> different<00:05:09.470> way<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.220> a<00:05:10.280> much

leaders have a tendency to use very

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
how do we deal with that how do we use

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.930 
how do we deal with that how do we use
visualization<00:05:56.560> to<00:05:57.560> try<00:05:58.130> to<00:05:58.190> promote<00:05:58.430> change

for instance the people leadership has

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.490 
for instance the people leadership has
to<00:06:00.890> do<00:06:01.010> with<00:06:01.160> change<00:06:01.490> of<00:06:01.669> course<00:06:02.290> how<00:06:03.290> do<00:06:03.350> you

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
to do with change of course how do you

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.409 
to do with change of course how do you
for<00:06:03.680> instance<00:06:03.980> create<00:06:04.419> insightful

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
for instance create insightful

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.530 
for instance create insightful
experiences<00:06:06.169> for<00:06:06.350> people<00:06:06.790> that's<00:06:07.790> been<00:06:08.150> shown

to to have an impact on the way in which

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.409 
to to have an impact on the way in which

people act and the way in which actually

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.140 
people act and the way in which actually
the<00:06:14.480> brain<00:06:14.720> rewires<00:06:15.140> itself<00:06:15.850> how<00:06:16.850> do<00:06:16.910> you

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
the brain rewires itself how do you

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.930 
the brain rewires itself how do you
reduce<00:06:17.480> discounting<00:06:18.440> in<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:18.620> future<00:06:18.979> leaders

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
reduce discounting in the future leaders

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.719 
reduce discounting in the future leaders
have<00:06:20.060> a<00:06:20.090> tendency<00:06:20.450> to<00:06:20.479> discount<00:06:20.690> future

have a tendency to discount future

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.439 
have a tendency to discount future
is<00:06:21.849> less<00:06:22.330> than<00:06:23.669> involved<00:06:24.669> and<00:06:24.849> other<00:06:25.089> people

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
is less than involved and other people

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.959 
is less than involved and other people
in<00:06:25.689> general<00:06:25.960> so<00:06:26.499> how<00:06:26.979> does<00:06:27.039> that<00:06:27.279> impact<00:06:27.789> our

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
in general so how does that impact our

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:32.129 
in general so how does that impact our
way<00:06:28.120> of<00:06:28.300> thinking<00:06:28.809> about<00:06:30.539> about<00:06:31.539> leadership

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
way of thinking about about leadership

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.670 
way of thinking about about leadership
and<00:06:32.379> and<00:06:32.830> and<00:06:33.339> getting<00:06:33.669> followers<00:06:34.180> to<00:06:34.499> do<00:06:35.499> what

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
and and and getting followers to do what

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.329 
and and and getting followers to do what
we<00:06:35.800> hope<00:06:35.949> they're<00:06:36.129> gonna<00:06:36.249> do<00:06:38.039> how<00:06:39.039> do<00:06:39.099> you<00:06:39.219> deal

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:39.339 
we hope they're gonna do how do you deal

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:41.129 
we hope they're gonna do how do you deal
with<00:06:39.400> things<00:06:39.699> like<00:06:39.999> dis<00:06:40.300> rationale<00:06:40.900> yeah

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
with things like dis rationale yeah

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.730 
with things like dis rationale yeah
where<00:06:41.710> even<00:06:42.279> people<00:06:42.309> have<00:06:42.580> very<00:06:42.849> high<00:06:43.089> IQ

actually<00:06:44.740> don't<00:06:45.009> either<00:06:45.789> because<00:06:46.089> their

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
actually don't either because their

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.110 
actually don't either because their
cognitive<00:06:46.689> misers<00:06:46.870> or<00:06:47.409> because<00:06:48.159> they<00:06:48.939> don't

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
cognitive misers or because they don't

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.100

in<00:06:57.099> a<00:06:57.249> rational<00:06:57.669> way<00:06:58.439> how<00:06:59.439> you<00:06:59.499> create<00:06:59.949> for

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:00.129 
in a rational way how you create for

in a rational way how you create for
instance<00:07:01.020> chunks<00:07:02.020> of<00:07:02.229> anticipation

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:03.059 
instance chunks of anticipation

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:05.639 
instance chunks of anticipation

anticipation has been shown to have a be

anticipation has been shown to have a be
a<00:07:05.680> great<00:07:05.919> predictor<00:07:06.219> in<00:07:06.580> terms<00:07:06.819> of<00:07:07.029> the<00:07:07.120> way<00:07:07.300> in

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:07.509 
a great predictor in terms of the way in

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:09.839 
a great predictor in terms of the way in
which<00:07:07.539> people<00:07:08.129> what<00:07:09.129> people<00:07:09.370> are<00:07:09.430> gonna<00:07:09.490> do<00:07:09.729> in

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849 
which people what people are gonna do in

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.290 
which people what people are gonna do in
the<00:07:09.909> future<00:07:10.270> and<00:07:11.580> you<00:07:12.580> can't<00:07:12.909> give<00:07:13.120> them

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
the future and you can't give them

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.269 
the future and you can't give them
anticipation<00:07:13.870> all<00:07:14.139> the<00:07:14.259> time<00:07:14.499> sort<00:07:15.039> of<00:07:15.129> like

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:15.279 
anticipation all the time sort of like

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:15.869 
anticipation all the time sort of like
in<00:07:15.370> a<00:07:15.460> movie

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 
in a movie

in a movie
everybody<00:07:16.469> laughing<00:07:17.469> all<00:07:17.620> the<00:07:17.649> time<00:07:17.919> in<00:07:18.069> a

everybody laughing all the time in a

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.100 
everybody laughing all the time in a
comedy<00:07:18.580> well<00:07:18.819> no<00:07:18.939> you<00:07:18.999> have<00:07:19.089> to<00:07:19.270> give<00:07:19.749> people<00:07:19.930> a

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
comedy well no you have to give people a

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.409 
comedy well no you have to give people a
chance<00:07:20.139> to<00:07:20.499> sort<00:07:20.919> of<00:07:21.009> slow<00:07:21.699> down<00:07:21.729> a<00:07:21.939> little<00:07:22.210> bit

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
chance to sort of slow down a little bit

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.439 
chance to sort of slow down a little bit
before<00:07:22.899> the<00:07:23.169> next<00:07:23.289> punchline<00:07:24.149> so<00:07:25.149> how<00:07:25.270> do<00:07:25.330> you

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:25.449 
before the next punchline so how do you

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.629 
before the next punchline so how do you
actually<00:07:25.599> do<00:07:25.930> that<00:07:26.080> and<00:07:26.319> how<00:07:26.949> is<00:07:27.399> that<00:07:27.430> gonna

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 
actually do that and how is that gonna

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.389 
actually do that and how is that gonna
impact<00:07:27.999> on<00:07:28.270> your<00:07:28.389> leadership<00:07:28.629> on<00:07:29.560> your

impact on your leadership on your

impact on your leadership on your
leadership<00:07:30.669> skills<00:07:31.499> the<00:07:32.499> importance<00:07:32.830> of

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:32.889 
leadership skills the importance of

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:36.179 
leadership skills the importance of
branding<00:07:33.749> branding<00:07:34.749> has<00:07:34.870> been<00:07:35.080> shown<00:07:35.319> to<00:07:35.499> have

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:36.189 
branding branding has been shown to have

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:37.170 
branding branding has been shown to have
an<00:07:36.339> actual<00:07:36.610> there's<00:07:36.879> an<00:07:36.969> actual

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
an actual there's an actual

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.649 
an actual there's an actual
physiological<00:07:37.499> component<00:07:38.499> to<00:07:38.589> it<00:07:38.709> so<00:07:39.449> kind<00:07:40.449> of

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659 
physiological component to it so kind of

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.779 
physiological component to it so kind of
Neurosciences<00:07:41.259> is<00:07:41.550> coming<00:07:42.550> down<00:07:42.610> the<00:07:42.729> road

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:42.789 
Neurosciences is coming down the road

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.449 
Neurosciences is coming down the road
like<00:07:43.060> a<00:07:43.089> big<00:07:43.330> Mack<00:07:43.569> truck<00:07:44.099> and<00:07:45.099> there<00:07:45.370> are

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:45.459 
like a big Mack truck and there are

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:48.420 
like a big Mack truck and there are
basically<00:07:45.729> two<00:07:46.089> ways<00:07:46.360> to<00:07:46.779> deal<00:07:47.680> with<00:07:47.709> it<00:07:47.919> it's

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430 
basically two ways to deal with it it's

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.689 
basically two ways to deal with it it's
gonna<00:07:48.550> happen<00:07:48.969> whatever<00:07:49.330> the<00:07:49.509> case<00:07:50.490> on<00:07:51.490> the

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:51.699 
gonna happen whatever the case on the

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:53.489 
gonna happen whatever the case on the
one<00:07:51.849> and<00:07:52.089> and<00:07:52.330> it's<00:07:52.449> very<00:07:52.629> controversial<00:07:53.139> a

00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:53.499 
one and and it's very controversial a

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:55.170 
one and and it's very controversial a
lot<00:07:53.860> of<00:07:53.979> a<00:07:54.009> lot<00:07:54.279> of<00:07:54.309> the<00:07:54.399> results<00:07:54.879> that<00:07:54.939> are

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:55.180 
lot of a lot of the results that are

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.829 
lot of a lot of the results that are
coming<00:07:55.479> out<00:07:55.629> or<00:07:57.509> some<00:07:58.509> people<00:07:58.629> are<00:07:58.719> gonna

00:07:58.829 --> 00:07:58.839 
coming out or some people are gonna

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.059 
coming out or some people are gonna
maybe<00:07:59.050> have<00:07:59.199> a<00:07:59.229> little<00:07:59.469> difficulty<00:07:59.770> dealing

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:00.069 
maybe have a little difficulty dealing

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:03.089 
maybe have a little difficulty dealing
with<00:08:00.719> and<00:08:01.719> so<00:08:02.199> there<00:08:02.409> are<00:08:02.439> basically<00:08:02.740> two<00:08:02.949> ways

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:03.099 
with and so there are basically two ways

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.989 
with and so there are basically two ways
to<00:08:03.249> deal<00:08:03.399> with<00:08:03.459> it<00:08:03.610> we<00:08:04.240> can<00:08:04.419> either<00:08:04.569> ignore<00:08:05.439> it

00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:05.999 
to deal with it we can either ignore it

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:09.420 
to deal with it we can either ignore it
do<00:08:06.999> as<00:08:07.149> we've<00:08:07.300> been<00:08:07.419> doing<00:08:07.539> all<00:08:07.809> along<00:08:08.110> and<00:08:08.430> try

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:09.430 
do as we've been doing all along and try

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.989 
do as we've been doing all along and try
to<00:08:09.490> hopefully<00:08:10.059> goes<00:08:10.330> away<00:08:10.629> or<00:08:11.399> we<00:08:12.399> look<00:08:12.669> at<00:08:12.849> it

00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:12.999 
to hopefully goes away or we look at it

00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:16.619 
to hopefully goes away or we look at it
pay<00:08:13.569> attention<00:08:13.990> to<00:08:14.139> it<00:08:14.259> and<00:08:15.059> find<00:08:16.059> an<00:08:16.209> ethical

00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:16.629 
pay attention to it and find an ethical

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:19.860 
pay attention to it and find an ethical
moral<00:08:16.990> way<00:08:17.259> to<00:08:17.319> deal<00:08:17.559> with<00:08:17.740> it
