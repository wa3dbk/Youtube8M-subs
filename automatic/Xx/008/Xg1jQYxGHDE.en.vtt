history and so there's a little
navigation<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.369> could<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.990> let's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
navigation that you could do here let's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.020 
navigation that you could do here let's
take<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.170> look<00:01:13.380> at<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> actual<00:01:13.710> driver<00:01:14.280> that's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
take a look at the actual driver that's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.990 
take a look at the actual driver that's
on<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> Windows<00:01:15.720> machine<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:17.670> what's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
on the Windows machine and see what's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.590 
on the Windows machine and see what's
configurable<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.850> we<00:01:20.850> hop<00:01:21.060> over<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
configurable so we hop over to the
