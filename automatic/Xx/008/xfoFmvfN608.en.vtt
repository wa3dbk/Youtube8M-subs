00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.650
 pour half of a bottle of wine 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.300
 red in that case in Rioja in a saucepan and 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.630
 let's reduce it halfway to fire 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.630
 medium 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.839
 peel the carrot and cut it into 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.520
 thin slices we wash and chop in 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:29.230
 julienne the pepper 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.230
 we touch julienne onion 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.400
 cut the leeks into slices 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.140
 ah 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.940
 I like beef in pieces 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 small so the pieces that I 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.200
 They got in the carnage I've cut 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.740
 in half and taken advantage of to take 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740
 the fat 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.610
 we peel the potatoes 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.170
 in an express pot we add 2 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.030
 tablespoons olive oil 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.400
 extra virgin 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.950
 we pepper the meat and we mark it 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.369
 three times I had all the meat 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.369
 list 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.630
 when it's marked on all sides 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.680
 we remove them on a plate and mark the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.680
 next round of tacos 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.400
 you see that the bottom of the pot is 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.400
 taking toasted color do not worry 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.760
 now we throw 3 tablespoons more oil 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.990
 and we suffer the vegetables at medium heat 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.990
 for about 10 minutes 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.629
 we apply the garlic although I have done it 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.629
 medium 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.450
 once the vegetables are fried 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.190
 we incorporated the veal and all the juice 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.650
 who has released 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.630
 a tablespoon soup of flour and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.190
 we remove 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.830
 we let cook for 5 more minutes 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.810
 we look for the potatoes that is to say we cut 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.000
 with a knife without reaching the end and 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.980
 we break with this we will get the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.400
 potato release the starch and thicken the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.400
 sauce 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.430
 after five minutes we pour the 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.430
 hot water 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.300
 we crumble the broth pill 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.640
 when it breaks to boil, we incorporate the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.640
 wine and potatoes 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.880
 now it's time to close the pot 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
 express in this case we put the pressure 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.350
 to 2 and let cook for 20 minutes 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.620
 after the pot starts to whistle 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.270
 or the two lines have left if not 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.610
 you have today under pressure let it cook 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.910
 for a minimum hour once ready 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.380
 rectify salt if necessary
