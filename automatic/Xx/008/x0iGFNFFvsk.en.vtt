 Tale of Anton Pavlovich but could not 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.800
 see the very piercing 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.720
 Chekhov's intonation and only in work with 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.240
 the director on the stage, everything was on its 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.980
 places I somehow for some reason 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 psychologically closed on this topic 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.110
 because I probably subconsciously 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.080
 understood that it would be very difficult it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.170
 it will be some kind of 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.670
 infinite bridging in this this

 you need a lot of things 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.350
 pick open to carry out this work 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.670
 drama on the hunt of one of the earliest 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.500
 works of Chekhov 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.060
 this story is almost impossible 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.369
 see on theatrical scenes 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.470

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.390
 filled in person at rehearsals before 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.970
