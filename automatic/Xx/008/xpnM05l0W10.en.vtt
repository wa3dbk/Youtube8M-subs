00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.900 
exercise here the rain stopped now not
too<00:04:37.550> bad<00:04:37.850> so<00:04:38.270> she<00:04:38.860> did<00:04:39.860> make<00:04:40.100> a<00:04:40.130> pass<00:04:40.490> at<00:04:40.790> the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
too bad so she did make a pass at the

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.560 
too bad so she did make a pass at the
duck<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:42.490> she<00:04:43.490> would<00:04:43.610> make<00:04:43.760> another<00:04:43.910> one<00:04:44.330> here

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
a little bit well I think we can

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.710 
a little bit well I think we can
probably<00:04:48.200> call<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:49.010> good<00:04:49.370> then<00:04:49.670> I'll<00:04:49.940> turn

probably call that good then I'll turn

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.400 
probably call that good then I'll turn
it<00:04:50.840> off<00:04:50.930> we'll<00:04:51.170> go<00:04:51.290> sit<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:51.650> locate<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.220> mail

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410
