good morning quite copter 101 here a
couple<00:00:03.840> days<00:00:03.990> ago<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.290> get<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> review<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
couple days ago I get a review of the

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.400 
couple days ago I get a review of the
syma<00:00:05.879> XA<00:00:06.330> G<00:00:06.540> which<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.899> have<00:00:07.109> here<00:00:07.849> where<00:00:08.849> I

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
syma XA G which I have here where I

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.749 
syma XA G which I have here where I
noticed<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:11.040> was<00:00:11.099> getting<00:00:11.490> reduced

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
noticed that it was getting reduced

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.570 
noticed that it was getting reduced

I've<00:00:23.430> never<00:00:23.730> flown<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.180> out<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.420> range<00:00:24.600> yet<00:00:24.869> but

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
I've never flown it out of range yet but

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.910 
I've never flown it out of range yet but
this<00:00:25.980> quadcopter<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.849> XA<00:00:27.090> g<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:28.289> barely

about<00:00:30.630> 50<00:00:30.990> 60<00:00:31.140> meters<00:00:31.710> before<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.430> would<00:00:32.669> lose

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
about 50 60 meters before I would lose

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.900 
about 50 60 meters before I would lose
range<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.200> quadcopter<00:00:34.469> would<00:00:34.950> drop<00:00:35.160> now

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
range and the quadcopter would drop now

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.330 
range and the quadcopter would drop now
I<00:00:36.530> had<00:00:38.059> assumed<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.390> had<00:00:39.690> theorized<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
I had assumed I had theorized that that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.970 
I had assumed I had theorized that that
was<00:00:41.520> being<00:00:41.760> caused<00:00:42.030> by<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.629> noisy<00:00:43.170> camera<00:00:43.829> a

noisy camera can do such a thing you
know<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> mean<00:00:46.890> by<00:00:47.039> noises<00:00:47.309> noise<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
know what I mean by noises noise and the

our<00:00:58.859> runcam<00:00:59.340> HD<00:01:00.230> camera<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.410> throw<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.280> on

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
our runcam HD camera I throw this on

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
our runcam HD camera I throw this on
just<00:01:02.609> about<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:02.910> my<00:01:03.059> quad<00:01:03.539> copters<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.500> can

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
just about all my quad copters that can

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.060 
just about all my quad copters that can
carry<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> shielded<00:01:07.070> camera

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
carry it but it is a shielded camera

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.510 
carry it but it is a shielded camera
what<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> mean<00:01:08.790> by<00:01:08.939> shielded<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> has<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
what I mean by shielded it has like a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.270 
what I mean by shielded it has like a
foil<00:01:11.520> inside<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.450> case<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.320> prevents<00:01:14.040> the

foil inside the case that prevents the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.289 
foil inside the case that prevents the
RF<00:01:14.790> energy<00:01:15.119> from<00:01:15.530> exiting<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.740> case<00:01:16.979> and

RF energy from exiting the case and
interfering<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.770> quadcopter

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280

is a different weight camera on there
okay<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.289> should<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.530> good<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:10.830> let's<00:02:11.550> go

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
okay we should be good to go let's go

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.760 
okay we should be good to go let's go
for<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> flight<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.959> if<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.379> have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
for a flight and see if we have

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.360 
for a flight and see if we have
any<00:02:14.280> improved<00:02:14.700> range<00:02:15.710> with<00:02:16.710> this<00:02:16.860> particular

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
any improved range with this particular

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.000 
any improved range with this particular
camera<00:02:17.610> I'm<00:02:18.570> going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> set<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.020> up<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.170> bit<00:02:19.860> high

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
camera I'm going to set it up a bit high

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.610 
camera I'm going to set it up a bit high
here<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.790> some<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:21.240> chance<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.230> recover

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
here so I have some a chance to recover

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.590 
here so I have some a chance to recover
if<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:23.070> case<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.400> does<00:02:23.550> fly<00:02:23.760> out<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.940> range<00:02:26.600> okay

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
if in case it does fly out of range okay

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.420 
if in case it does fly out of range okay
right<00:02:27.780> about<00:02:27.900> there<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.290> would<00:02:28.590> be<00:02:28.740> losing

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
right about there I would be losing

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.240 
right about there I would be losing
control<00:02:30.210> over<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.540> quadcopter<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.890> had<00:02:32.130> to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
control over the quadcopter if I had to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.120 
control over the quadcopter if I had to
keep<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.700> original<00:02:33.030> camera<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.510> yes<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.170> got

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
keep the original camera and yes I got

00:02:35.130 --> 00:03:03.440 
keep the original camera and yes I got
good<00:02:35.670> range<00:02:35.910> well<00:02:36.180> there<00:02:36.450> we<00:02:36.540> go<00:02:57.020> no<00:03:02.300> I'm<00:03:03.300> gonna

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
good range well there we go no I'm gonna

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.790 
good range well there we go no I'm gonna
keep<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:03.990> there<00:03:04.140> folks<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.650> was

this way turns off okay well that's a

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.060 
this way turns off okay well that's a
tough<00:03:50.940> bird<00:03:51.180> isn't<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:54.590> we<00:03:55.590> turn<00:03:55.800> off<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
yes it takes a beating let's take a look

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.030 
yes it takes a beating let's take a look
folks<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:15.330> was<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.480> drop<00:04:15.810> from<00:04:15.990> about<00:04:16.380> 80

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
folks that was a drop from about 80

folks that was a drop from about 80
meters<00:04:17.280> up<00:04:17.640> or<00:04:18.359> not<00:04:18.510> 80<00:04:18.720> meters<00:04:19.109> about<00:04:19.680> 50

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
meters up or not 80 meters about 50

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.720 
meters up or not 80 meters about 50
meters<00:04:20.310> up<00:04:20.460> I'd<00:04:20.640> say<00:04:20.780> but<00:04:21.780> let's<00:04:22.049> take<00:04:22.230> a<00:04:22.260> look

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
meters up I'd say but let's take a look

meters up I'd say but let's take a look
everything<00:04:23.730> looks<00:04:23.910> fine<00:04:25.190> with<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.310> exception

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
everything looks fine with the exception

everything looks fine with the exception
of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100

that<00:04:27.760> propeller<00:04:28.500> about<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.620> other<00:04:29.740> propeller

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
that propeller about the other propeller

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.910 
that propeller about the other propeller
sir<00:04:30.250> all<00:04:30.400> fine<00:04:30.640> too<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.440> we<00:04:32.440> know<00:04:32.590> this<00:04:32.740> can

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
sir all fine too so we know this can

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.760 
sir all fine too so we know this can
take<00:04:33.040> a<00:04:33.100> beating<00:04:33.370> that's<00:04:33.850> good<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.620> was<00:04:35.620> always

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
take a beating that's good I was always

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.620 
take a beating that's good I was always
wondering<00:04:36.100> what<00:04:36.310> what<00:04:36.790> if<00:04:37.090> this<00:04:37.300> could<00:04:37.450> take<00:04:37.570> a

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
wondering what what if this could take a

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.870 
wondering what what if this could take a
beating<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:38.320> could<00:04:38.560> take<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.710> beating<00:04:38.920> I<00:04:39.250> had<00:04:39.850> a

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
beating it could take a beating I had a

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.240 
beating it could take a beating I had a
little<00:04:40.210> bit<00:04:40.390> better<00:04:40.420> range<00:04:40.900> but<00:04:41.890> it<00:04:41.980> wasn't

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
little bit better range but it wasn't

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.820 
little bit better range but it wasn't
very<00:04:42.460> much<00:04:42.610> improved<00:04:43.450> range<00:04:43.750> okay<00:04:44.440> maybe<00:04:44.650> it's

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
very much improved range okay maybe it's

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.460 
very much improved range okay maybe it's
not<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:45.220> camera<00:04:45.640> on<00:04:45.820> this<00:04:46.600> quadcopter<00:04:46.900> maybe

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
not the camera on this quadcopter maybe

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.760 
not the camera on this quadcopter maybe
there<00:04:47.890> is<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.010> difference<00:04:48.430> in<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.670> transmitter

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
there is a difference in the transmitter

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.980 
there is a difference in the transmitter
since<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:51.490> original<00:04:51.640> release<00:04:52.090> of<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.390> XH<00:04:52.750> C

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
since the original release of the XH C

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.580 
since the original release of the XH C
