00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.649
 good hello to all friends of the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.230
 violet from the purple color you see me of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.340
 overprint given sea to francs 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.960
 we lost 2 to 1 against inter 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.670
 Mazzarri 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.770
 Montella had already got his hands a little 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.600
 forward saying after the game with 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.490
 the Udinese 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.260
 they were tired we had played many 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.119
 you meet that objectively though 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.609
 there are some things I did not go 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.949
 so much down 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.449
 the first is precisely the depriving of 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.440
 training he has put in place 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.780
 montella we're going to see it now 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 with a screen 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.679
 an action that was a 3 5 1 1 with 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.690
 practically the three in black defense 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.359
 it matters foot to the right of it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.280
 200 purchases on the left then we had the 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.620
 five in midfield with vargas a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.539
 left then mati fernandez pesaro 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.059
 milani and square to the right while 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.510
 in front of me was a king who stood 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.190
 the internet was behind it 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.320
 prompter for PCs 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.470
 and this training is practically not 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.690
 the first half convinced me a lot 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.700
 we have had it very much aside 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.990
 inter 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.060
 inter that has had three clear occasions 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.880
 the palacio post then two more 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.450
 occasions has not already thought about 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.710
 make a nice parade and in another mi 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.830
 apparently the militia prince threw 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.630
 out on the left of neto short 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.710
 the time intervention has kept beating is 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.190
 also deserved advantage advantage 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.570
 who arrived I show how it is 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.570
 arrived arrived exactly 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.810
 on this action 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.549
 as you can see I wrote palacio 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.810
 author of Inter's advantage over the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.670
 Flight Passing Is Not Offside 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.920
 here the marker you see at the bottom is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.440
 was really very good because you see 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.649
 if i go with the mouse these guain that is 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.640
 to pass the ball that then palazzi a 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.890
 transformers angle 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.959
 of course it is very difficult on account 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.030
 mine for a token can figure out a 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.550
 who can be directed the ball 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.800
 physique that coexists by calculating why 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.410
 we have definitely played in offside 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.489
 and also nagatomo perhaps on the same 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.950
 line of pumps 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.540
 however we are there could be in 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.209
 offside too, however, the ball 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.769
 extraordinarily he goes to that palace 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.319
 indeed it is not offside then 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:42.120
 for the purposes of the very regular regulation 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.810
 but what certainly is not 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.630
 regular and then work victory 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.670
 to the inside that we see here 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.989
 the very hot and classic offside 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.550
 always in front 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.190
 when it starts from nagatomo action 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.380
 always always in front of the defender always 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.100
 provided that the signals failed to 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.620
 see an offside so here's to me 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.079
 this really seems like something to me 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.030
 it is unbelievable because it is always 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.739
 been icardi in front of the defender of 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.570
 Florentine 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.130
 clearly to anticipate it to search 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.670
 to score is always in front in 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.400
 production 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.959
 enormously offside we work 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.500
 so practically dialysis in doubt 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.250
 certain teams offside not there 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.130
 whistle and other teams instead yes 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.090
 unfortunately we know this from 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.370
 a long time with a purple heart that works 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.980
 in this way in fact if the inter 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.540
 he had won as he could 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.860
 scoring his own in the first half 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.569
 there would have been no occasions 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.459
 determined nothing but then we see that 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.150
 in certain situations 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:59.380
 eventually the signals are paying referees 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.840
 always in favor of the usual suspects 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.100
 let's get back out of the membership 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.960
 stationary 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.280
 as you have seen, in short, the goal he can 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.450
 decisive account was in clear offside 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.580
 and this already decidedly penalized 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.110
 had already happened with napoli is always the 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.370
 same game with a team e 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.720
 we have to get into champions 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.970
 probably naples always has too 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.180
 something more organic 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.750
 of the Florentine and therefore it will be 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.130
 very difficult for the way to succeed in 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.130
 enter third place 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.880
 however then in doubt and the referees 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.150
 when we have problems 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.370
 refereeing us our offside from 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.510
 doubts become certain while 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.470
 others 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.900
 who knows why I'm never for us 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.820
 they are always negative I don't remember a 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.270
 my memory of ever winning one 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.840
 match as inter milan errors 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.350
 arbitration 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.360
 this genre while there are many 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.880
 occasions when it happened 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.190
 from our opponents 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.860
 here nothing one beats us 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.340
 arrest the multiple Florentine 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.460
 commitments that are therefore suffered a 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.460
 little 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.120
 also not having borja valero in the field 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.770
 because for us that clergy 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.990
 a bit like when he played antonioni on 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.210
 our 10 reference is the one in 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.270
 which turns the team a bit and yesterday 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.010
 we have missed him a lot 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.380
 having said that we have rediscovered how it is 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.740
 then entered the field did not arrive 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.480
 on the last ball remains turned that not 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.980
 you get there I ca n't put it in must 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.890
 be a draw then maybe a 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.990
 end we would not have deserved repeat for the 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.320
 count of occasions inter could 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.470
 however, having deserved success is 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.240
 the success of the giving token occurred 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.960
 eagle eye candy that I would have said outside 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.060
 oh well game went like this and now a hundred 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.510
 we will focus on the europa league 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.230
 hoping that Thursday things are denmark 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.730
 go well 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.910
 Hello everyone and they always had strength e 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.910
 anyway
