clamp and this allows the drummer to put
the<00:00:50.580> the<00:00:50.940> pedal<00:00:51.810> off-center<00:00:52.650> so<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.310> doesn't

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the the pedal off-center so it doesn't

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.010 
the the pedal off-center so it doesn't
have<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:53.790> be<00:00:53.910> directly<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.360> sander<00:00:54.810> to<00:00:54.930> be

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
have to be directly on sander to be

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
have to be directly on sander to be
moved<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.470> right<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:56.460> off<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.060> left

moved to the right or off to the left
and<00:00:57.540> when<00:00:57.630> you<00:00:57.720> clamp<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.230> it'll<00:00:58.860> still<00:00:59.100> lay

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and when you clamp it it'll still lay

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430

see<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.760> catch<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:56.970> on

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
see if you can you can catch that on

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.990 
see if you can you can catch that on
there

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
there

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.270 
there
so<00:01:59.540> right<00:01:59.750> in<00:01:59.900> here

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.790 

so<00:02:05.820> again<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.180> set<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.480> beater<00:02:06.690> angle<00:02:07.170> you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
so again you set the beater angle you

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.980 
so again you set the beater angle you
have<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.980> gauge<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.460> there<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.479> set<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
have a gauge on there you can set it and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.740 
have a gauge on there you can set it and
forget<00:02:10.080> it

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
forget it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.240 
forget it
take<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.900> back<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.470> front<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.890> pedal

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
take it back to the front of the pedal

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.190 
take it back to the front of the pedal
this<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.360> what<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> call<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.840> fulcrum

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
this is what I call the fulcrum

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.070 
this is what I call the fulcrum
adjustment<00:02:16.860> or<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.310> pivot<00:02:17.640> point<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.240> this

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
adjustment or the pivot point and this

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.650 
adjustment or the pivot point and this
is<00:02:19.230> adjustable<00:02:19.530> from<00:02:20.190> basically<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.940> chain

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
is adjustable from basically a chain

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.320 
is adjustable from basically a chain
drive<00:02:21.960> feel<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> more<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.910> direct<00:02:24.060> drive
