00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:11.400
 good rock people to show you 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:14.340
 in my wave is cg 150 fan esi from itá do 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 Which one did I use the originals there? 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.039
 I set the scene for the front scouting and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.920
 rear of the rear he has with brake the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.720
 said disc talked about brake 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.730
 back disk in other other videos 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.970
 Look there, you'll find it, then. 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.890
 so I did I stuck here the hoop of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 light alloy other than air exchange 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.350
 the reign to compel the fugitive to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.020
 do it if you go here and drop it on 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 11.5 millimeters is that this beak 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.360
 could enter came in half crooked because 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.030
 the guy did a not so good job 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.760
 quality but is coming is 100% in 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.920
 truth did us nothing and I ended up 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.289
 putting these michelin tires is what is the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.780
 sport driver in front of back néné 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.219
 tires on camera and recommend to you 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 You're putting that air on it. 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.620
 really good right 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.210
 besides the tire also the tire also 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.090
 excellent quality especially if 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.220
 treating the city right 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:16.130
 So that's how the tire without camera is is 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.790
 recommended to you there, because of 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.670
 bore 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.619
 they are more resistant to drilling is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.390
 since they were both front 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:31.710
 or back is they have the ability to 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.600
 The permanence of the piercing object is 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.579
 that it is bare inside the tire without 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.530
 change the internal tire pressure or 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.079
 sometimes it stays inside and does not 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.439
 empty opinions and empties empties 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.750
 It is slow to let the pilot 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.079
 to go through a specific 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.090
 until you find a way to go. 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.790
 to make the exchange is a repair teach 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.549
 independent of the facts then 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.979
 I recommend it because it is very good 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.409
 well this is the tire ball show in 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.939
 Camera is just joy 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.939
 It's what I have to tell you.
