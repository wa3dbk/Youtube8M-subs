00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 in what is another new room 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.639
 and it totally works all also the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.600
 software that is a generic network 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.250
 it must practically remain 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.570
 to everything 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:26.670
 he uses the touch and we are going to look for a 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.670
 what is called rocker 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.640
 let's see yes 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.180
 if you come raked 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.680
 that's a software normally the 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.180
 normal software do not come with do not come 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.280
 surrounded then 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.890
 while we wait for downloads 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 works very well 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.250
 I had downloaded others that we had 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.640
 works well but in the long run it was 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.780
 very very very slow and did not allow me 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.780
 to do a lot 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.790
 so 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.250
 we see here 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.250
 and we will not accept it 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.910
 you do not know in verifying 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.940
 we just need to root well 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.920
 especially 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.360
 of this this function to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.360
 they serve the two cameras 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.410
 they have the cameras 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.700
 it comes more a bit more stable 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.979
 that the other one that I showed you 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.530
 and it's generic so it's not 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:57.789
 supposedly gives all the salt winner to 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.789
 10 of 7 inches should be left 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.440
 exist 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.840
 the configuration 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.580
 we were on android a new model 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.340
 software 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.900
 Skates is this model that I'm going to 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.579
 put 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.930
 so that the two will try not to 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:33.689
 it is three recovery also try and living 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.590
 of the operating system and the living and in 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:40.390
 it really works very well 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.860
 it works absolutely fine it surprises me 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:51.030
 the work of what they were 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:53.610
 100 20 30 rooms of all these 30 sep 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.220
 efe the only one that has worked for me 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.599
 load 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.420
 so that this is for double camera 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:04.260
 double camera that brings a sample of 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.470
 the other one and we wrote the ones that try it 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.480
 and there I leave the link 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.480
 everything serves the sensor 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.730
 it also serves them 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.170
 higher than free but do not vibrate 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:25.459
 is then yes they try what 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.459
 these are some updates 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.380
 then suddenly you get to work 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.230
 but no turn I have thing of 7 minutes 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.900
 I put it 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.800
 and I hope you like it and I can 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.800
 serve more than anything
