00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
like a Minecraft got more than like ten

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.089 
like a Minecraft got more than like ten
thousand<00:00:30.330> voters<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.929> once<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.830> gets<00:00:31.980> more

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
thousand voters and once it gets more

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.530

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
picture picture of the stone pickaxe on

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
picture picture of the stone pickaxe on
my<00:01:06.030> computer<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.020> let<00:01:07.229> me<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.430> i

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
my computer here so let me just and i

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.539 
my computer here so let me just and i
actually<00:01:08.930> use<00:01:09.930> each<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.380> pixel<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.310> two

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
actually use each like pixel as like two

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.399 
actually use each like pixel as like two
by<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:15.590> I'd<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.400> Lego

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
by two so I'd see that there's a Lego

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
by two so I'd see that there's a Lego
that's<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.650> pickaxe<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.490> that's<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.820> let<00:01:21.030> go

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that's the pickaxe but that's not let go

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.460 
that's the pickaxe but that's not let go
and<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:22.290> here's<00:01:22.530> mine<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> pretty<00:01:24.869> much<00:01:24.990> what

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and then here's mine so pretty much what

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.700 
and then here's mine so pretty much what
i<00:01:25.530> did<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:26.220> i<00:01:26.900> counted<00:01:27.900> how<00:01:28.080> many<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
i did was i counted how many of the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.219 
i did was i counted how many of the
brown<00:01:29.009> pieces<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:30.299> pixels<00:01:30.689> there<00:01:30.810> were<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
brown pieces or pixels there were and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.499 
brown pieces or pixels there were and
there<00:01:31.259> were<00:01:31.380> nine<00:01:31.619> down<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.850> two<00:01:33.329> at<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
there were nine down here and two at the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.140 
there were nine down here and two at the
top<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.290> i<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.500> nine<00:01:34.740> two<00:01:35.400> by<00:01:35.520> twos<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:35.970> as

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
top so i have nine two by twos here as

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.510 
top so i have nine two by twos here as
you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.869> two<00:01:37.650> three<00:01:37.950> four<00:01:38.189> five<00:01:38.250> six

you can see one two three four five six

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.450 
you can see one two three four five six
seven<00:01:38.970> eight<00:01:39.329> nine<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.799> two<00:01:41.009> more<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460

seven eight nine and then two more and
then<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> side<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> each<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> those

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
then on the on the side of each of those

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.819 
then on the on the side of each of those
are<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> black<00:01:44.820> pixels<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
are the black pixels and then to the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.679 
are the black pixels and then to the
like<00:01:47.280> pickaxe<00:01:47.729> part<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> head<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
like pickaxe part like the head of the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.590 
like pickaxe part like the head of the
pickaxe<00:01:49.020> i<00:01:49.700> counted<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> pixels<00:01:51.149> too<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.540> i

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
pickaxe i counted the pixels too and i

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
pickaxe i counted the pixels too and i
did<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.170> what<00:01:52.860> i<00:01:52.890> did<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.549> the
