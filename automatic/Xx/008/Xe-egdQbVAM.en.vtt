00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.220
 we did not start the war and 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.319
 We have this kind of war 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.960
 not chosen because we are in the war 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.610
 also did not choose to us 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.120
 come terrorists with all sorts of 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.039
 sophisticated weapons 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.840
 they started killing people 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.830
 to break the infrastructure 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.060
 destroying public facilities 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.070
 we defend ourselves just like that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.960
 circumstances require what tactics is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.650
 the opponent requires they used 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.539
 heavy weapons 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.780
 that's why the same will beat 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.579
 Wise way back we had the same 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.770
 started the conflict in syria too 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.250
 discuss and I have priority 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.230
 focused on the issue of violence 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.680
 If you want to succeed , I said 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.360
 on 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.010
 then they have to deal with theirs 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.899
 initiative on the question of violence 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.670
 if they do not concentrate 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.350
 terrorists stop those in syria 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.360
 come mainly from turkey and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.309
 Qatar they will fail 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.079
 and if you do not have the cash flow of 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.270
 outside of here the fire stop 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.790
 then will be the whole experiment 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.110
 fail 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.049
 That was the central point of our 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.549
 First meet me as president 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.570
 The decision should be taken when 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.369
 Syrian people is lying 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.960
 and if the Syrian people do not know me 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.610
 as president , how could I then 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.619
 still must exist by one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.720
 national dialogue happens and whatever 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.369
 this national dialogue concludes this 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 we will decide as a government 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.810
 also as far as I'm concerned this is part of the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.689
 nato missile defense shield already before 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.100
 a year in turkey 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:43.170
 The Turks did not want to say because 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.119
 many turks are against it and the second 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.189
 aspect is that the turkish 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.229
 Prime Minister Erdogan tries everyone 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.240
 turks for his policy against syria too 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.979
 win what failed, however 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.450
 is 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.009
 that's why he starts the page at rockets 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.180
 set up our border around the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.579
 convey impression 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.680
 Turkey would be in danger Syria 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.369
 The turkey attack something unrealistic 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.560
 is 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.430
 that's what the pages are about 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.430
 the Turkish domestic policy
