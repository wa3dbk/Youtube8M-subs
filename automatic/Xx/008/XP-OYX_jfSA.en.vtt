do in my life which is very hectic um so

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.090 
do in my life which is very hectic um so
that<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:40.060> about<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:41.650> washed<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.519> in<00:02:43.359> sections

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
that is about it I washed it in sections

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.670 
that is about it I washed it in sections
my<00:02:45.100> condition<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:46.090> put<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.660> slight<00:02:47.200> leaving

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
my condition I put a slight leaving

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.710 
my condition I put a slight leaving
conditioner<00:02:47.890> on<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.850> then<00:02:49.269> followed<00:02:49.660> up

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
conditioner on it and then followed up

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.080 
conditioner on it and then followed up
with<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.049> aussie<00:02:50.560> before<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.370> blow<00:02:51.579> dried<00:02:51.880> it
