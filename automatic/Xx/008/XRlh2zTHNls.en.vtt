00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.369 
it and then instead of two photos I did
one<00:00:31.830> stamped<00:00:32.780> embellishment<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:33.930> that's<00:00:34.110> one

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
one stamped embellishment so that's one

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.830 
one stamped embellishment so that's one
way<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.739> stretch<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> sketch<00:00:35.720> all<00:00:36.720> right

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840

put a photo so you can see and then I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.670 
put a photo so you can see and then I
pre<00:01:04.920> stitched<00:01:05.309> around<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:07.110> match<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
pre stitched around this to match the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.070 
pre stitched around this to match the
stamped<00:01:08.220> cardstock<00:01:08.820> blog<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> first<00:01:09.780> page

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080

stamped cardstock blog on the first page
I'm<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.369> size<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.180> also

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
I'm going to think the size you can also

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.530 
I'm going to think the size you can also
use<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:13.200> foam<00:01:13.500> applicator<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.369> some<00:01:15.060> distress

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
use a foam applicator and some distress

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.260 
use a foam applicator and some distress
ink<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.070> doing<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> way

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.770 

alright<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.570> I'm<00:01:21.660> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.870> off-center<00:01:22.650> this

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
alright so I'm going to off-center this

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.020 
alright so I'm going to off-center this
and<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.230> large<00:01:25.770> photo<00:01:26.670> corner

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030

up<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.750> perpendicular<00:02:23.750> lines<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:25.390> then<00:02:26.390> cut

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
up the perpendicular lines and then cut

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.920 
up the perpendicular lines and then cut
and<00:02:28.940> then<00:02:29.060> I'm<00:02:29.150> going<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.330> trim<00:02:29.600> off<00:02:29.630> the
