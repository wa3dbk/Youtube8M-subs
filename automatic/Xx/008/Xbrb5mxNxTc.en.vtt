00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.690
 hello to all and all the followers of 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.019
 study coast and welcome to this 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.550
 video in which I'm going to show you a little bit 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.660
 in this video I'm probably already 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.640
 asking through the forum 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.180
 your studies how am I doing the 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.680
 beach scene good I'm going to 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.820
 show I'm working at this moment 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.170
 in union with this software this 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.710
 mario software interface I'm 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.449
 working and it was the option that I chose 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.559
 to make this cabin project 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.270
 tourist obviously here is missing a 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.560
 building missing many details here 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.930
 comes a building also that has not 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.329
 brought there are details over here of 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.880
 vegetation missing things to do but 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.620
 for example the main shots already 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.020
 they are almost defined which are these shots 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.380
 in which I show the cabins already and 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.950
 vegetation placed 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.390
 the cabins have their railings all 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.130
 has material here are the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.530
 rails with the ropes 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.090
 I have even added some bicycles to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.360
 make it look more interesting here 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.710
 that can be used I have added vegetation 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.050
 and I will explain more or less what 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.640
 it is the same but to explain it 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.920
 over here this space that we have here 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.350
 with this user interface obviously 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.670
 later in the channel 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.680
 main cons of studies them 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.300
 I will show a little more about the union and 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.770
 I will teach you a little more here 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.260
 I have a gap and I have been asked 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.479
 how do I effect the good pond 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.729
 it's just working in the union and 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.340
 create a template file of a 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.200
 ocean as you can see I created the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.300
 template file of an ocean and everything 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.270
 what I have around is a vast 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.179
 ocean and I have simply dedicated myself to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.310
 remove this island from the ocean and that is 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:51.149
 say good basically came through here 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.189
 landscape I open the paddle to go up 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.680
 to increase the brush to make it more 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.800
 great to show it here 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.960
 the smallest thing and I'm going to upload it and 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.640
 basically this what I do in I'm going 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.440
 dimensions up some level for 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.260
 create new land surfaces by 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.670
 defect the union will create this effect 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.709
 where the earth is very high will be 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.120
 dry and when it is near the water it will 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.959
 be more humid that's why when I go 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.980
 going up the earth notice that I'm going 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.100
 neutralizing the rest I can also 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.200
 come down here with the pressure of the brush 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.510
 I can decrease the pressure of the brush 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.070
 and increase it a little bit more to make 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.250
 that all this again come back to be 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.330
 down and I can create as a kind of 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.790
 archipelago or something like that ok weird by 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.110
 back here this is basically to create 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.900
 these gaps just what I 'm going is 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.690
 going down a bit and I think the lagoon ok and 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.730
 well I created all the others all this 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.400
 little where plants that we have here 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.890
 they have not modeled them in 3d they are part of 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.780
 the library and they are very easy to 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.190
 show that I only know 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.800
 I just have to press here 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.390
 the button to take a picture and it goes to 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.480
 take a picture like this that I have taken 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.370
 a second ago and it is already the render there is no 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.870
 that doing it is simply to take it 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.450
 a photo because we are already seeing it in 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.030
 render live and it can be the advantage of 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.739
 lumen but I repeat and I remind you that 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.150
 the union is a program that consume 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.010
 many resources need a good 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.800
 video card to know a little bit 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.380
 more about mine 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.330
 so he continued because these are 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.250
 images that are here are what 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.510
 has been posting in the forum the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.340
 work that I'm doing in this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.100
 moment just like you I too 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.920
 work these were the first facts 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.030
 / mcs this is also done / mcs this 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.950
 is also done between max and 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.210
 obviously I did not like the water 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.670
 It was very complicated and I opted for 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.550
 bring me here and you can notice that 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.620
 the change is much better and that was a 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.000
 pretty good choice to make 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.980
 vegetation is very simple simply 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.830
 you have to enter here in the object area 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.870
 select the area of ​​vegetation what 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.350
 vegetation I want to place for example 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.750
 let's go we're going to equip a part of the 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.700
 vegetation that has not done so I'm going to 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.210
 select some open palms like 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.980
 these 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.230
 and we're going to go to a point that we have 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.030
 around here that is not yet tree-grown 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.190
 but a midpoint that was 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.380
 organizing here in this of this that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.300
 it's here but we're just going 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.730
 clicking and see how he does 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.100
 clicks on the plant and so on 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:26.230
 simple there is 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.780
 it's the simplest thing ok then very 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.580
 and I'm creating plants if I want to create 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.200
 these short plants that are like a 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.480
 sort of grass that I like to place 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.950
 under the plants just inside 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.050
 over here in the grass category 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.090
 I select the grass that I like in this 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.699
 case is this that is down here 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.889
 ok and see that he placed a few 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.350
 shrubs that's basically what 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.020
 you have to go to the displacement 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.850
 within the union is different takes time 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.889
 get used because it's not the same as 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.410
 mesh is not the same as another imax's 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.830
 equalities that chopin much less to that of 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.699
 yes bruce ok then basically 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.150
 it works like a video game keyboard 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:14.479
 wv I approach that I move away to is for the 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.630
 left of to the right and with click 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.430
 left of the mouse I can go to 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.260
 change the direction of the view 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.639
 so I just have to go 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.930
 moving as if you were playing a 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.720
 video game notice that here I am 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.580
 pretending that I'm walking ok is 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.080
 basically the same if you press shift 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.810
 I can make the displacement be 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.970
 faster ok this will allow me 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.400
 cover spaces for example, notice that 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.470
 all this space here in the middle what 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.850
 I have to fill with plants now but 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.320
 it's quite simple what you have to 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.720
 have a little bit of creativity to 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.510
 create oases like these that look a 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.160
 unnatural and all this is based 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.889
 in the plane of this project that has 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.990
 come that the distribution of all the 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.250
 project over here has a gap that I've 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.919
 made smaller because it was very 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.590
 large and because there is too much vegetation 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.120
 that I will not be complete because 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.830
 is going to be a quilombo as they say 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.840
 Argentine is going to be a problem so 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.870
 I just drew it a little more 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.910
 easy in the area of ​​the dock I will use 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.680
 the main dock is not that very 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.860
 this one that is here on the pier 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.170
 service this main dock in the 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.190
 main mobile I will reach this point 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.590
 but when the point arrives it is 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.050
 simply enter here and select 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.790
 the transport area change and 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.860
 select a ship and I could 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.350
 select a ship a sailboat by 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.630
 example and put it here and notice that 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.910
 there I already have a sailboat ready so 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.240
 simple is difference that the effect on 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.190
 the water is great the luminol is a 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.740
 excellent tool but I remind you 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.540
 you need a good team to work 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.100
 with me going to go to rotate and 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.810
 just change the orientation of the 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.460
 sailboat 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.130
 and then you can move it a little to 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.810
 put it closer and ready 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.200
 think I already have a sailboat there ready 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.370
 to approach it from the dock one thing 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.840
 very interesting of the lumen are the 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.360
 real effects for example these 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.190
 caustic and these flashes even those 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.949
 caustic under water see how 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.419
 it looks under the water 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.840
 impressive is an excellent 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.030
 work tool 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.880
 another very interesting thing is that look 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.560
 that when I'm under the pier that 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.410
 I'm looking out there's a balloon 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.350
 giant of light and is what we would see real 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.639
 or what we would see in a real way with the 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.150
 human eye because the shadow that is 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:29.650
 down here is going to make us see more 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.560
 light from outside and notice that when 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.960
 leave because the retina takes a little while 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.550
 to get used to it until it appears 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.460
 obviously this square that you are seeing 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.050
 here is not like here a building goes too 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.510
 that I have not done it yet I have not 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.070
 brought and also goes to a building 

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.110
 not me I brought him call I will bring 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.930
 later on but I want this 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.010
 it was just an advance so that 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.650
 let's see more or less what I'm 

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.510
 working and clarifying those doubts of by
