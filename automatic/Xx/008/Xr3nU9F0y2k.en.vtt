00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:08.220
 This time, I think I want to a description of how to use of sound 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.230
 Hmm 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:21.930
 t 4th place 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:27.010
 Because use of Oite music to Latin dance is becoming very important point 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.250
 Simply put, music needs to be saved 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.489
 By making Tame 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:41.070
 The next step will be to make it quicker There will be a squeeze out there 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.789
 I think that I would like to focus on explaining the area 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.200
 if 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:50.280
 Because 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.480
 It will go visible to feel the foot is lazy and does not 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.200
 So my feet 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:02.160
 I will leave it firmly 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:09.520
 You will hear a loose sound if the foot you're leaving makes a step when you move it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:13.200
 So keep the foot firmly and leave the tip quickly from there 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.200
 I will try to put out one side 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.180
 2 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 Hmm 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.170
 Aye N 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:38.650
 Then I want to explain in Roomba 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.650
 The count is 2 34 days off so we are moving 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.340
 34 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.120
 Note 34 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.490
 Sincerity 34 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.340
 this is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.200
 Not a good example 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.799
 And say why 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.799
 It is because there is no need to save this and go 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.110
 Quickly step by step 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.600
 So I will put up with it quickly 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.440
 This is how to use basic sounds 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.440
 that's all 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.340
 Four 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:47.579
 Cw- do
