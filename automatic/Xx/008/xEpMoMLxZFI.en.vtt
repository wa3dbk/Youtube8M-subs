00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.460 
chat two slashes and then want now by
default<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.920> will<00:00:23.010> give<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> wooden<00:00:24.090> axe

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
configuration file then it will be

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900 
configuration file then it will be
different<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.250> you're<00:00:29.369> gonna<00:00:29.490> find<00:00:29.789> a

different so you're gonna find a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.999 
different so you're gonna find a
position<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.570> where<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.929> want<00:00:31.199> your<00:00:31.590> building

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
position of where you want your building

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.470 
position of where you want your building
to<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:34.250> wherever<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.460> click<00:00:35.730> first<00:00:36.149> is

to be and wherever you click first is
where<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.260> corner<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.600> so

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
where that one corner is going to be so

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.170 
where that one corner is going to be so
since<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.989> want<00:00:40.230> my<00:00:40.320> corner<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.920> here

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.730 

right<00:00:44.780> here

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
right here

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
other corner of where my imaginary

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.170 
other corner of where my imaginary
building<00:00:57.240> so<00:00:57.390> far<00:00:57.630> is<00:00:57.780> gonna<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.880> and<00:00:59.880> I<00:01:00.000> want

building so far is gonna be and I want

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.500 
building so far is gonna be and I want
to<00:01:00.270> click<00:01:00.770> there<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:01.920> selected<00:01:02.550> us<00:01:02.670> exact

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to click there I just selected us exact

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.010 
to click there I just selected us exact
square<00:01:05.090> then<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.210> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.480> type<00:01:06.660> in<00:01:06.840> two

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
square then I want to type in two

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780 
square then I want to type in two
slashes<00:01:07.320> again<00:01:07.740> make<00:01:07.950> sure<00:01:07.980> you<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.640> two

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
slashes again make sure you have the two

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.380 
slashes again make sure you have the two
slashes<00:01:09.120> because<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.740> won't<00:01:10.920> work<00:01:11.100> otherwise

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
slashes because it won't work otherwise

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.690 
slashes because it won't work otherwise
so<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:12.600> undo<00:01:12.870> slash<00:01:13.110> slash<00:01:13.470> slash<00:01:14.370> slash

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
so you know undo slash slash slash slash

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.590 
so you know undo slash slash slash slash
replace<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:16.310> then<00:01:17.310> since<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.820> air<00:01:18.090> or<00:01:18.450> in
