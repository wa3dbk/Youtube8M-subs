00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.109
 hi girls today i want to explain you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.860
 how to make this white france 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.650
 with purple glitter then like 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.450
 you can see a france or big one though 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.860
 I don't get lost in talking and I'll explain 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.700
 immediately what we need to 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.980
 make it happen 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:30.090
 do a white nail polish but you know it 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.540
 the one to give us a manicure more polish 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.880
 bright born 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.329
 a top coat for the figure 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.159
 it is a berlin 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:49.469
 a subtle note not even zaro then 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:49.469
 let's start with these speeches 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.570
 is hurt lira are our nails 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.370
 attention advises not to do one 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.140
 france too high 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.080
 because he doesn't have much fingers anyway 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 tapered that seemed even shorter 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.220
 and I will adhere so I do n't stay not 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.220
 want Italy 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.570
 come on 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.570
 in my enamel 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.570
 little product because it is a 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.750
 France 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:29.030
 and step with a rotary motion from 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 right to left a france of mine 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.320
 against white street sweepers 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 what to pay attention because the white enamel 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.820
 it is very difficult to apply 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.270
 okay now theory should we wait 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.410
 let it dry more than anything else because of it 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.440
 may be the risk that maybe 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.600
 by lifting our scotch we can 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.940
 take away a bit of nail polish and then the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.930
 ruin our work 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:04.229
 I'll try and see if he can then 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.229
 be very careful when lifting 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.770
 here it is 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.500
 very simple then in this case goes by 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.890
 I made a mistake but it does nothing 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:30.680
 just take a little bit of cotton with 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.720
 a Macedonian bow you can also use the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.950
 pen correct nail polish but I don't have it 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.640
 over then I use this and let's go to 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.640
 remove 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.860
 that's done here a little bit 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:57.220
 perfect then left of course 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.580
 dry your nail polish a little 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:06.730
 after that we take our nail polish 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:13.700
 our small panel glittered 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:16.160
 let's go to make this little line 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.320
 usual product if yes 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.500
 they make more wet passes at the tip 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.770
 however made it fly better so better 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.850
 take it with the rotary motion as well 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:35.950
 managed to fill the panel with mesh 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:42.380
 ok you see that he too eliminated 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:44.720
 I do n't know our France we apply not 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.480
 they pass so let's say do a 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.190
 tapping because there is a risk that 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.860
 opened too much i think 8 then all in one 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.670
 point because who always does in time a 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.300
 go over you notice very little improvement doing 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.300
 another pasadena 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.770
 I'll take this beautiful drop 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.140
 and I recommend old lady ndaw e 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.140
 raising the brush slightly 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.120
 let's go like this 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.910
 sure if it's not a bright polish 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:30.550
 born is even simpler though also 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.860
 so it goes well not the way after doing it 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:38.380
 with any color you know or yes 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:42.220
 prefers ok filled and all 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.930
 corners too especially the edges 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.630
 because they are the ones that maybe go at least 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:58.330
 color because they usually concentrate 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:05:01.000
 more in the middle, a firm hand here piece yes 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.229
 vedana habana I only realized it 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.729
 suzuki to show how much is coming 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:12.970
 cute okay it was a very good video 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:15.729
 I hope you enjoyed it and if you have any 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.789
 doubt usual I will see again the vat I know 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:21.430

 also write subscribe to my channel 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.840

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.050
 I leave you some information I send you 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.349
