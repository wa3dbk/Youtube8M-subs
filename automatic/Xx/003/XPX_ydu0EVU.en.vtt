00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.500
 after preparing long natural 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.599
 opacizzando the fine-grained with a soul 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.980
 applied the primer and let it dry 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.020
 a few seconds in the air you take one 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.460
 stretch map and insert it 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.920
 under the free edge of the nail 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.710
 natural after placing it I take 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.570
 my basic gel or already at the monophasic e 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.519
 I apply it on the natural nail and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.550
 I proceed directly to the lengthening 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.250
 so we can do this in a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.630
 single pass or do the first 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.090
 passage on the natural nail 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.190
 catalyze in the lamp and then proceed 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.680
 with elongation you were catalyzed in 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.250
 lamp as you are better I am 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.739
 using a very dense gel then mi 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.050
 you can do it all at once 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.899
 all in one in one step 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.789
 if instead you use a gel that tends to 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.030
 perhaps it is better to do it in two 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.030
 steps 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.289
 I go to the lamp and catalyze for 180 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.289
 seconds 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 finished the process in lamp clean 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.590
 with the clean air and with a grain file 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.219
 I go to fix the sides and the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.049
 tip while with a 180-grained file 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.039
 based on how much there is to fix the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.890
 structure 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.140
 so if there is much to fix we go 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.869
 to arrange with a hundred grit soul 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.030
 then gangway lean na 180 finer 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.369
 while if there is little to fix e 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:06.000
 just use the grain file 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:07.829
 180 once the structure has been arranged 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.920
 opening a rhyme buffer that usually 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.079
 240 grit then very very fine and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.209
 moves the scratches of the soul then 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.660
 I clean with a brush the residues of 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:24.720
 filing powder is long and ready for 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:27.030
 the writing of france as I already said 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.790
 the french in this case i'm 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.609
 spending over the camber so me 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.310
 I apply it with a spot or if there is 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.319
 you find better with a thin brush 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.500
 but the important thing is to spread it out 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.900
 precise and very subtle in such a way 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.430
 which afterwards I will go to apply only the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.430
 final glossy sealant 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.650
 once he spread the white gel I take 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.800
 a neat flat brush and I go 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.540
 to fix the french line then 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:32.570
 I just need to put it down 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:34.400
 on the nail and define the margin a 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.490
 this point can catalyze 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.260
 in lamp for 180 seconds then without 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.390
 degrease with the clean air I go to 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.880
 directly apply sealant polish 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.970
 final I apply it over the entire nail 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.890
 laid out well and also on the finish then 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.710
 in tip so that I go to seal 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.810
 for good all the reconstruction and I go to 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.810
 catalyze in the lamp for at least 180 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.610
 seconds if not for 240 that I have 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.920
 found more shine 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.230
 I just have to apply the oil for 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.980
 nourish the cuticles and reconstruction is 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.980
 finished
