00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.230 
series correctly and I'm an idiot
because<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:18.329> didn't<00:04:18.690> see<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:18.870> guy<00:04:22.040> so<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.820> don't

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
because I didn't see that guy so I don't

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.330 
because I didn't see that guy so I don't
know<00:04:24.330> what<00:04:24.510> my<00:04:24.660> score<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.020> right<00:04:25.410> now<00:04:25.620> but<00:04:26.070> I'm

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
know what my score is right now but I'm

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.420 
know what my score is right now but I'm
taking<00:04:26.580> some<00:04:26.940> stupid<00:04:27.390> deaths<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:28.410> think<00:04:29.310> the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
taking some stupid deaths I think the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.760 
taking some stupid deaths I think the
ending<00:04:29.700> score<00:04:30.030> is<00:04:30.150> 27<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:30.870> four<00:04:31.200> is<00:04:31.350> not<00:04:31.560> that

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
ending score is 27 and four is not that

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.520 
ending score is 27 and four is not that
great<00:04:32.040> it's<00:04:32.790> an<00:04:32.940> old<00:04:33.090> case<00:04:33.600> for<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.170> mean

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
great it's an old case for I mean

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.710 
great it's an old case for I mean
instant<00:04:35.340> death<00:04:35.520> match<00:04:35.880> but<00:04:36.150> it's<00:04:36.330> not<00:04:36.540> like

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720
