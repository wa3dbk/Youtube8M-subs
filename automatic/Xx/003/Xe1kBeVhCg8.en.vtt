00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 for all welcome one more Sunday 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.380
 here to book I bring you the little prince 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.549
 a classic the truth is that it is one of 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.259
 my favorite videos and I hope that 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.259
 also be from you we started 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.219
 when I was six years old and once a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.959
 magnificent blade in a book about the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.060
 virgin forest that was called stories 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.980
 lived represented a booby snake 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.610
 that swallowed a beast here is the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.610
 copy of the drawing 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.570
 the book said snakes boas 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 swallow their whole prey without chewing 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.230
 then they can not move and sleep 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.190
 during the six months of digestion 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.530
 I reflected a lot then on the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.210
 adventures of the jungle and I managed to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.850
 trace with a color pencil my first 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.850
 drawing my drawing number one was like that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.589
 I showed my masterpiece to people 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.640
 big adults and I asked them if 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.640
 my drawing scared them 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.870
 they answered me because there will be 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.899
 scare us a hat 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.280
 the microphone represented a hat 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.619
 represented a vogue that digested a 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 elephant draw then the inside of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.860
 the boa snake so that the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.869
 large older people could 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.509
 understand always need 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.509
 explanations very drawing number two eras 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.600
 the big people advised me that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.670
 leave aside the drawings of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.920
 boas snakes open or closed and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.810
 that I would be interested a little more in the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 geography the history the calculation and the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.000
 grammar and that's how at the age of 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.490
 six years I left my career unsuccessful 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.560
 of a painter was discouraged by the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.030
 failure of my drawing one people 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.430
 great never understand anything by itself 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.660
 alone and it is tiring for children to have 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.540
 than always and always 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.180
 explanations must therefore choose another 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.830
 trainee apprentice to batch aircraft flew 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.540
 a little around the world and it's true 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.740
 geography served me well the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.480
 first glance was in 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 conditions to distinguish between China's 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.890
 arizona this is very useful especially if 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.440
 you're missing point during the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.390
 I had that night in the course of my life 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.520
 many links with a lot 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.490
 serious people I lived a lot with people 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.890
 I've seen them very closely I have not 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.690
 overdone my opinion all 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.760
 it was said when I found a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.350
 person who seemed a bit lucid and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.080
 of the experience of my drawing number 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.060
 that I have always kept I wanted to know 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.890
 if she was truly understanding but 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.630
 it always surprised me is a hat 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.940
 so I did not speak to him 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.400
 and boas snakes or forests or 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.710
 stars placed me at your fingertips and you 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.870
 he talked about politics golf bridge and 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.010
 of ties and the big person is 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.620
 I was very pleased to have 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.780
 recognized and was thinking that it was a 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.030
 very reasonable man 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.560
 chapter 2 or a little more than 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.580
 chapter 2 to leave it at a point 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.580
 where you can continue the story 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.230
 I lived like this alone without anyone to talk to 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.390
 truly until I had a bread in 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.159
 the sahara desert something had 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.200
 broken in my engine and how he did not have me 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.780
 neither mechanic nor passengers I set out to 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.730
 perform only one difficult repair was 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.640
 for me question of life or death had 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.379
 drinking water for just eight days the 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.170
 first night sleeping on the sand 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.879
 thousand Maya of every inhabited land was 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.310
 more isolated than a castaway on a 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.409
 raft in the middle of the ocean imagine 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.359
 my surprise when breaking the day I 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.980
 he woke up a strange little voice that said 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:24.400
 please draw me a lamb 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.629
 draws of a lamb I stood up from 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.019
 a jump and rub my eyes I looked good and 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.390
 I saw a little man entirely 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.920
 extraordinary who was examining me 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.900
 badly clippers I have left you the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.000
 story at a very interesting point like that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.560
 to give the coconut that was being 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.480
 very in the previous weeks and I think that 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.160
 this week you are going to be very good and 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.590
 tell him how it would end and you are 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.700
 story still and just like it's a very book 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.200
 classic and it's likely that many of 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.540
 you have read it seems to me 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.840
 still an exercise of creativity 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.819
 much more enriching so although not 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.200
 You have continued to try to find another 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.760
 different story another different ending 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.379
 you know that those who have not read it 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.299
 and you want to know the original story 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.349
 you only have to look for it in your 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.840
 library that is sure that what 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.349
 contradict the library or if not and in 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.000
 any bookstore the door primers us 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.950
 we see next sunday here do not you 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.419
 forget now I like directives the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.419
 detectives thinking exams 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.870
 you need to transmit to 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.889

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.889
