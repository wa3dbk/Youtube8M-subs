but<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:37.740> know<00:02:37.950> what<00:02:38.070> he<00:02:38.130> means<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.640> mean

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
but I do know what he means I mean

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.700 
but I do know what he means I mean
eventually<00:02:42.020> like<00:02:43.020> there<00:02:43.200> there's<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.560> little

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
eventually like there there's a little

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.400 
eventually like there there's a little
wave<00:02:43.980> here<00:02:44.400> but<00:02:44.760> that'll<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.150> fixed<00:02:45.420> when<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
wave here but that'll be fixed when the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.820 
wave here but that'll be fixed when the
crossmember<00:02:47.310> bar<00:02:47.610> goes<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.200> for<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.230> engine

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
crossmember bar goes in for the engine

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.110 
crossmember bar goes in for the engine
and<00:02:50.100> that'll<00:02:50.400> hold<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.790> two<00:02:51.060> together<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:53.120> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
and that'll hold the two together so the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.760 
and that'll hold the two together so the
