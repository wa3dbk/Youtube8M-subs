their own mission but in many ways it

their own mission but in many ways it
also<00:04:42.530> feels<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.100> game<00:04:43.310> is<00:04:43.490> too<00:04:43.730> small<00:04:44.090> to

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
also feels that the game is too small to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.090 
also feels that the game is too small to
accommodate<00:04:44.390> them<00:04:44.990> all<00:04:45.080> properly<00:04:45.500> so<00:04:45.980> it

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
accommodate them all properly so it

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.430 
accommodate them all properly so it
seems<00:04:46.370> rushed<00:04:46.730> asylum<00:04:47.660> at<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.780> great<00:04:48.110> story

seems rushed asylum at a great story
which<00:04:48.740> was<00:04:48.770> properly<00:04:49.310> pace<00:04:49.640> and<00:04:49.910> each

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
which was properly pace and each

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.580 
which was properly pace and each
