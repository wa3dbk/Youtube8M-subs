high tide here it could be higher than

though<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.260> drops<00:03:43.680> off<00:03:43.950> slightly<00:03:44.989> what<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.020> mean

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
though it drops off slightly what I mean

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.290 
though it drops off slightly what I mean
by<00:03:46.230> slightly<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.040> goes<00:03:47.130> down<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.430> 135<00:03:48.030> not

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
by slightly is it goes down to 135 not

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.040 
by slightly is it goes down to 135 not
so<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.320> really<00:03:49.739> goes<00:03:50.160> from<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.790> massive<00:03:51.480> typhoon

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
so it really goes from a massive typhoon

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.940 
so it really goes from a massive typhoon
and<00:03:52.739> very<00:03:52.920> deadly<00:03:53.220> down<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.120> not<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.380> massive

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
and very deadly down to not so massive

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.910

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
Typhoon Warning Center so it's still

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.280 
Typhoon Warning Center so it's still
looking<00:04:01.739> like<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.250> very<00:04:03.090> violent<00:04:03.570> typhoon<00:04:03.810> I

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
looking like a very violent typhoon I

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.949 
looking like a very violent typhoon I
know<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.790> PAGASA<00:04:05.790> or<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.420> Philippines<00:04:06.780> does

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
know that PAGASA or the Philippines does

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.600 
know that PAGASA or the Philippines does
not<00:04:07.110> use<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.440> term<00:04:07.470> super<00:04:07.950> typhoon<00:04:08.340> neither

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
not use the term super typhoon neither

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.030 
not use the term super typhoon neither
do<00:04:08.850> i<00:04:08.880> usually<00:04:09.540> use<00:04:09.600> gma's<00:04:10.200> intensities<00:04:10.830> which

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
do i usually use gma's intensities which

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.190 
do i usually use gma's intensities which
at<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.730> time<00:04:11.970> would<00:04:12.150> be<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.540> violent<00:04:12.989> typhoon

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
at this time would be a violent typhoon

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.280 
at this time would be a violent typhoon
with<00:04:13.680> 105<00:04:14.280> gusting<00:04:14.700> up<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.870> 150<00:04:15.870> knots<00:04:16.109> a

GMA to put violent intensity it truly

typhoon<00:06:42.500> strength<00:06:42.860> winds<00:06:43.160> but<00:06:43.520> it's<00:06:44.090> these

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
typhoon strength winds but it's these

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.730 
typhoon strength winds but it's these
areas<00:06:44.810> here<00:06:44.840> where<00:06:45.140> you're<00:06:45.470> going<00:06:45.590> to<00:06:45.650> be

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
areas here where you're going to be

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.820 
areas here where you're going to be
feeling<00:06:46.450> not<00:06:47.450> only<00:06:47.870> typhoon<00:06:48.320> strength<00:06:48.620> winds

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
feeling not only typhoon strength winds

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.450 
feeling not only typhoon strength winds
but<00:06:49.010> potentially<00:06:49.730> just<00:06:50.030> a<00:06:50.270> catastrophic

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
but potentially just a catastrophic

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.980 
but potentially just a catastrophic
winds<00:06:52.460> Nevis<00:06:52.910> farther<00:06:53.330> up<00:06:53.480> there<00:06:53.660> towards<00:06:53.840> an

winds Nevis farther up there towards an
orb<00:06:54.110> actually<00:06:54.440> should<00:06:54.590> extend<00:06:54.920> that<00:06:55.100> a<00:06:55.160> little

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
orb actually should extend that a little

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.730 
orb actually should extend that a little
bit<00:06:55.520> farther<00:06:55.760> off<00:06:55.970> here<00:06:56.150> because<00:06:56.420> much<00:06:57.020> of<00:06:57.050> the

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
bit farther off here because much of the

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.560 
bit farther off here because much of the
eastern<00:06:57.770> seaboard<00:06:58.490> of<00:06:58.760> Luzon<00:06:59.150> is<00:06:59.330> going<00:06:59.450> to<00:06:59.510> be

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
eastern seaboard of Luzon is going to be

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.240 
eastern seaboard of Luzon is going to be
feeling<00:06:59.780> some<00:07:00.050> pretty<00:07:00.260> gusty<00:07:00.500> winds<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.010> also

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
feeling some pretty gusty winds and also

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.670 
feeling some pretty gusty winds and also
the<00:07:01.370> risk<00:07:01.520> of<00:07:01.670> storm<00:07:01.940> surge<00:07:02.150> off<00:07:02.420> to<00:07:03.140> here<00:07:03.530> as

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
the risk of storm surge off to here as

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.160 
the risk of storm surge off to here as
well<00:07:03.920> so<00:07:04.210> yeah<00:07:05.210> let's<00:07:05.480> continue<00:07:05.780> to<00:07:05.990> watch

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
this a very dangerous storm system

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.070 
this a very dangerous storm system
through<00:07:07.910> the<00:07:08.000> coming<00:07:08.270> but<00:07:08.360> I<00:07:08.390> hope<00:07:08.600> set<00:07:08.870> is

agency is warning on this storm system
at<00:07:23.240> this<00:07:23.870> time<00:07:24.140> outside<00:07:24.920> of<00:07:25.130> the<00:07:25.190> Philippines

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:25.640 
at this time outside of the Philippines

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.090 
at this time outside of the Philippines
so<00:07:25.970> it's<00:07:26.390> very<00:07:26.810> very<00:07:26.960> disappointing<00:07:27.800> and<00:07:27.950> I

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.100 
so it's very very disappointing and I

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.370 
so it's very very disappointing and I
just<00:07:28.790> did<00:07:29.000> say<00:07:29.330> one<00:07:29.600> more<00:07:29.780> thing<00:07:29.840> about<00:07:30.200> this

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:30.380 
just did say one more thing about this

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.020 
just did say one more thing about this
this<00:07:30.590> would<00:07:30.740> be<00:07:30.890> the<00:07:31.040> equivalent<00:07:31.340> if<00:07:31.700> you<00:07:31.850> are

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.030 
this would be the equivalent if you are

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.040 
this would be the equivalent if you are
in<00:07:32.120> the<00:07:32.180> United<00:07:32.480> States<00:07:32.540> and<00:07:32.810> you're<00:07:32.900> watching

in the United States and you're watching
its<00:07:33.470> and<00:07:33.680> you're<00:07:33.830> curious<00:07:34.250> would<00:07:34.850> be<00:07:34.940> like

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
its and you're curious would be like

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.330 
its and you're curious would be like
having<00:07:35.390> a<00:07:35.690> major<00:07:35.990> hurricane<00:07:36.380> forming<00:07:37.160> out

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:37.340

going<00:07:40.070> to<00:07:40.130> turn<00:07:40.340> and<00:07:40.670> it's<00:07:41.060> going<00:07:41.240> to<00:07:41.300> go

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
going to turn and it's going to go

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.200

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.130 
doesn't issue an official track until it

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.820

exact same idea in equivalent as that so
yeah<00:07:59.540> really<00:08:00.440> it<00:08:00.860> kind<00:08:01.220> of<00:08:01.250> babbles<00:08:01.640> me<00:08:01.790> so
