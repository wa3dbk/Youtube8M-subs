00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.250 
on board and twin tips course we set up
pretty<00:02:11.950> fast<00:02:12.160> we<00:02:12.489> had<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.610> first<00:02:13.540> long<00:02:13.780> reach<00:02:14.019> to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
pretty fast we had a first long reach to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.280 
pretty fast we had a first long reach to
get<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> lot<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.650> speed<00:02:15.269> then<00:02:16.269> for<00:02:16.630> tight<00:02:16.870> marks

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
get a lot of speed then for tight marks

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.650 
get a lot of speed then for tight marks
and<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:18.069> final<00:02:18.370> written<00:02:18.819> last<00:02:19.060> reach<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.510> was

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
and a final written last reach that was

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.890 
and a final written last reach that was
