think<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.340> something<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.000> have

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
think that is something that we have

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.899 
think that is something that we have
relatively<00:01:04.589> common<00:01:05.010> agreement<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.880> a

relatively common agreement on as a

relatively common agreement on as a

positive aspect for society the question

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.730 
positive aspect for society the question
of<00:01:10.640> changing<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.210> genetic<00:01:12.479> makeup<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.350> humans

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
of changing the genetic makeup of humans
for<00:01:14.010> generations<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> come<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> much<00:01:15.540> more

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
for generations to come is a much more

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.289 
for generations to come is a much more
complicated<00:01:16.170> issue<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.979> also<00:01:17.759> gets<00:01:17.970> into<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
complicated issue and also gets into the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.330 
complicated issue and also gets into the
question<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.810> whether<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
consequences of our actions but I think

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
there and I don't so I don't know the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.600 
there and I don't so I don't know the
details<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:47.009> question

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
details of that it's a it's a question

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.609 
details of that it's a it's a question
that<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.390> look<00:01:49.020> at<00:01:49.200> very<00:01:49.439> carefully

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that you have to look at very carefully

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.520 
that you have to look at very carefully
I<00:01:50.360> think<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> good<00:01:52.020> question<00:01:52.200> for

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
I think this is a good question for

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.810 
I think this is a good question for
discussion<00:01:52.619> what<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> regulatory

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
discussion what kind of regulatory

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.870 
discussion what kind of regulatory
oversight<00:01:54.450> government<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.320> otherwise<00:01:55.880> might

oversight government or otherwise might

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.639

the therapeutic you have to meet all
these<00:03:06.019> hurdles<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.250> has<00:03:07.489> been<00:03:07.970> a

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
these hurdles and so that has been a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.270 
these hurdles and so that has been a
phenomenal<00:03:08.720> system<00:03:09.080> over<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.380> years<00:03:09.410> with<00:03:10.010> of

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
phenomenal system over the years with of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.740 
phenomenal system over the years with of
course<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.640> few<00:03:10.790> bumps<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.209> road<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.450> are

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
course a few bumps in the road that are

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.930 
course a few bumps in the road that are
that<00:03:11.900> are<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.290> are<00:03:12.530> renowned<00:03:12.890> but<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.489> think

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
that are that are renowned but I think

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.070 
that are that are renowned but I think
it's<00:03:14.060> worth<00:03:14.269> looking<00:03:14.299> at<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.720> bigger<00:03:14.989> picture

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
it's worth looking at the bigger picture

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.979 
it's worth looking at the bigger picture
of<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.650> let<00:03:16.400> me<00:03:16.489> ask<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.090> as<00:03:17.690> we<00:03:17.840> move

want to put that put out there for all
politicians<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.120> consider<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.690> terms<00:03:29.870> of

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
politicians to consider in terms of

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.130 
politicians to consider in terms of
scientific<00:03:30.890> funding<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:31.640> forth<00:03:32.019> well<00:03:33.019> I

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
scientific funding and so forth well I

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.750 
scientific funding and so forth well I
think<00:03:33.260> there's<00:03:33.680> two<00:03:33.739> messages<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.640> have

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
think there's two messages that have

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.520 
think there's two messages that have
been<00:03:34.790> coming<00:03:35.060> out<00:03:35.299> one<00:03:35.569> message<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.319> I<00:03:36.500> think

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
been coming out one message and I think

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.740 
been coming out one message and I think
are<00:03:36.980> very<00:03:37.010> important<00:03:37.640> to<00:03:37.760> bring<00:03:37.940> out<00:03:38.120> one

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
are very important to bring out one

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.920 
are very important to bring out one
message<00:03:39.230> is<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:40.549> there<00:03:41.239> is<00:03:41.329> a<00:03:41.359> tremendous

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
message is that there is a tremendous

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.020 
message is that there is a tremendous
opportunity<00:03:42.079> right<00:03:42.739> now<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.519> scientific

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
opportunity right now in the scientific

with it we should we shouldn't be in our
own<00:04:40.690> little<00:04:40.840> ivory<00:04:41.170> towers<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:42.070> think<00:04:42.250> both

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
own little ivory towers and I think both

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.880 
own little ivory towers and I think both
of<00:04:42.490> those<00:04:43.110> messages<00:04:44.110> are<00:04:44.260> very<00:04:44.290> important<00:04:44.830> to

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
of those messages are very important to

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.500 
of those messages are very important to
be<00:04:45.010> that<00:04:45.160> we<00:04:45.280> need<00:04:45.460> a<00:04:45.490> two-way<00:04:46.000> street<00:04:46.060> of

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
be that we need a two-way street of

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.900 
be that we need a two-way street of
communication<00:04:47.230> and<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.740> think<00:04:48.040> based<00:04:48.520> on<00:04:48.700> that

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
communication and I think based on that

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.550 
communication and I think based on that
the<00:04:49.090> opportunities<00:04:49.780> for<00:04:49.990> really<00:04:50.230> being<00:04:50.380> able

want<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.500> do<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:29.950> our<00:05:30.280> ability<00:05:30.790> to<00:05:30.880> carry<00:05:31.090> out

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
want to do and our ability to carry out

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.240 
want to do and our ability to carry out
research<00:05:31.390> is<00:05:31.840> really<00:05:32.020> based<00:05:32.320> on<00:05:32.530> a<00:05:32.590> bill<00:05:32.830> on

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
research is really based on a bill on

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.040 
research is really based on a bill on
our<00:05:33.430> ability<00:05:33.880> to<00:05:34.030> convince<00:05:34.330> people<00:05:34.600> to<00:05:34.750> fund

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
our ability to convince people to fund

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.170 
our ability to convince people to fund
that<00:05:35.230> to<00:05:35.650> fund<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:35.980> research<00:05:36.370> it's<00:05:36.910> really

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
that to fund that research it's really

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.520 
that to fund that research it's really
challenging<00:05:37.360> right<00:05:37.780> now<00:05:37.840> because<00:05:38.320> there's

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
challenging right now because there's

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.350 
challenging right now because there's
partly<00:05:39.310> because<00:05:39.490> there's<00:05:39.820> so<00:05:39.970> much<00:05:40.120> great

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
partly because there's so much great

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.060 
partly because there's so much great
science<00:05:40.750> going<00:05:40.900> on<00:05:41.080> but<00:05:41.230> partly<00:05:41.500> because<00:05:41.740> the

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
science going on but partly because the

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.290 
science going on but partly because the
real<00:05:42.250> support<00:05:42.610> for<00:05:42.730> research<00:05:42.970> has

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
real support for research has

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.790 
real support for research has
dramatically<00:05:43.780> dropped<00:05:44.080> over<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.410> last<00:05:44.590> few

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
dramatically dropped over the last few

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.860 
dramatically dropped over the last few
years<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.280> I'm<00:05:45.790> not<00:05:45.970> confident<00:05:46.480> at<00:05:46.540> all<00:05:46.660> I

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
years and I'm not confident at all I

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.560 
years and I'm not confident at all I
worry<00:05:47.200> about<00:05:47.520> not<00:05:48.520> only<00:05:48.730> it's<00:05:49.060> sort<00:05:49.270> of<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.540> I

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
worry about not only it's sort of that I

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.000 
worry about not only it's sort of that I
think<00:05:49.750> it's<00:05:50.020> in<00:05:50.140> a<00:05:50.200> depression<00:05:50.770> now<00:05:50.950> the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
think it's in a depression now the

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.860 
think it's in a depression now the
recession<00:05:51.700> is<00:05:51.820> when<00:05:52.000> your<00:05:52.120> neighbor<00:05:52.419> loses

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
recession is when your neighbor loses

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.480 
recession is when your neighbor loses
their<00:05:53.020> grant<00:05:53.290> a<00:05:53.500> depression<00:05:54.100> is<00:05:54.220> when<00:05:54.340> you

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
their grant a depression is when you

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.310 
their grant a depression is when you
lose<00:05:54.669> your<00:05:54.880> Grantham<00:05:55.390> and<00:05:55.570> so<00:05:55.870> I<00:05:55.900> think<00:05:56.020> all<00:05:56.260> of

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
lose your Grantham and so I think all of

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.290 
lose your Grantham and so I think all of
us<00:05:56.500> are<00:05:56.710> really<00:05:56.919> worried<00:05:57.190> about<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:57.580> in<00:05:57.790> a<00:05:58.120> in

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
us are really worried about that in a in

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.570 
us are really worried about that in a in
a<00:05:58.419> rather<00:05:58.570> personal<00:05:59.140> way<00:05:59.290> for<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.220> research

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
a rather personal way for the research

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.550 
a rather personal way for the research
that<00:06:00.610> we<00:06:00.940> are<00:06:01.060> very<00:06:01.240> invested<00:06:01.540> in<00:06:01.840> and<00:06:02.080> how<00:06:02.530> to

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
that we are very invested in and how to

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.910 
that we are very invested in and how to
continue<00:06:02.919> that<00:06:03.190> over<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.490> next<00:06:03.520> few<00:06:03.880> years
