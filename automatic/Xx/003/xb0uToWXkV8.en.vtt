 well I'm getting today for a 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.840
 new makeup it's been a long time since 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.270
 I want to make a makeup that style 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.490
 a little summer festival so we start 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.140
 immediately with a base vouziers of 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.730
 the base you want me I'm 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.960
 a mache the story of my home complexion 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.239
 little candles but as usual 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.989
 all the products used will be in 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.969
 the info bar 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.770
 then I use my foundation of 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.329
 at nars that I love enormously and 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.590
 I use mainly for this 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.989
 makeup there because I know who 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.180
 holds very well and if we do a 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.309
 makeup for the summer festival on 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.949
 wants it to be necessary then 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.519
 I apply my anti dark circles I use the 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.249
 large 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.329
 krummi ryan as if their radio and a half 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.219
 I do not know in which order 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.780
 but here I am all the time I know 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.829
 maybe it'll make some people upset 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.510
 but it's really the one I'm using 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.489
 every day and that I like most 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.089
 so here I am it is quite 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.609
 normal 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.830
 then after I will come powder and the 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.080
 all so I use my hd powder from home 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.870
 make up for ever since she is very 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.850
 fine she is transparent and I find 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.320
 that she mattifies very well I have 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.320
 mainly uses on my 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.360
 corrector and on the t zone if needed 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.240
 then we'll go to the eyes and cowardice 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.670
 from my palette matthews myth from the the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.020
 ball meshes the color that is a small 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.060
 little orange 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.409
 it's a piece that I really like 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.079
 are lighthouses that are mainly 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.060
 mainly matt forgiveness and at the cottage 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.570
 to be color in the hollow of the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.130
 eyelid 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.390
 it's something that I do very often 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.040
 you must be used now 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.040
 then I use 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.200
 montbard cream that I like most is 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.400
 the one at make-up revolution you 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.650
 put the link in the tax bar 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.420
 it's the beautiful and copper and so 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.310
 I apply it on the entire eyelid 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 and I come to blur the edges for 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.520
 to avoid being ugly simply 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.660
 and then we'll add a little bit of 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.729
 colors so I will resume my 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.470
 Palette darling the electric pallet 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.150
 home art show I will reprove 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.530
 the orange color so I know more the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.030
 name right now when there is 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.920
 that an orange color is not very 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.720
 difficult I apply them with a 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.250
 brush is not one to have a species 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.230
 of color diffusion and of which she 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.780
 apply on the center of my eyelid in 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.310
 overflowing slightly to the sides and I 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.530
 I'm going to pay it will bring a 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.030
 touch of color rather pétantes 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.430
 I personally like it 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.220
 especially in the summer and then I'm going 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.110
 take my job high-alpine sales at 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.060
 nyx in color or white 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.350
 I think it's white that I had 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.930
 deposition very long ago then 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.120
 there if you have a white liner that's 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.560
 really perfect this is not my case 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.420
 you want to try to do with that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.160
 never you have to know that if you 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.420
 use a white pencil to make 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.240
 your liner 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.400
 it may be moving or is 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.690
 to move as and when 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.330
 evening is something that has 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.650
 a lot of trouble to hold but hey I 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.270
 done with what I could so 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.700
 remember that if you use a 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.360
 pencil or a jumbo as I use the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.670
 a cream 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.440
 it must be fixed and with a 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.850
 white blush there I'm not showing you in the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.360
 video because I had cut at that 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.459
 moment but you have to fix 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.560
 simply liner with a makeup 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.540
 white and then I have to take a lighthouse 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.040
 again in the myth matmut pallet 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.989
 that I come involved will he have 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.760
 lower and then I apply my 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.040
 mascara so I used a mascara 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.760
 waterproof which is the hip noz doll eyes 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.920
 from lancôme or waterproof art pardon 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.720
 because we have to keep everything 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.760
 just once again then I 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.769
 applied bronze hours that I'm in 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.170
 contouring 11 am both mixes and 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.580
 it was one of diagrams left in edition 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.410
 limited so it only serves a little nothing 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.239
 I tell you the name and Olympics 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.690
 also in blush to give a little 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.010
 broonzy side to the face and I apply 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.870
 then my highlighter who is a 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.940
 actor from make up to revolutions 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.769
 again the references will be 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.840
 in the info bar and then for 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.280
 all that is small point of co then 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.709
 there you do as you wish at 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.079
 level of design I am inspired on 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.160
 pictures on the site we are title you 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.320
 do what you want but again 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.940
 once used the same john boye 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.620
 Penneçot there again if you 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.720
 a liner is perfect it's a lot 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.400
 better but I do with what I have this 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.810
 that I just had and so 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.209
 the device you I do little 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.669
 points using the back of finally the last 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.350
 brush and it's pretty easy to 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.120
 do it like that to the size that 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.310
 you want to use a brush that 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.320
 less wide and that's what gives that and 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.570
 please do not forget again 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.510
 fix with a white makeup if you do not 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.800
 not used a white liner that's like 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.130
 for the liner it's exactly the same 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.990
 thing 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.110
 then I apply a lip pencil 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.449
 who is fishing and I am a balm to 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.100
 by terry's lips from above for 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.720
 have a little more glossy effect 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.970
 but that is not so much tights 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.560
 and that's the makeup is over 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.970
 I hope you enjoy it I am 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.260
 sorry for the big blah, but you have 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.479
 need to explain a little more in 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.699
