00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
pretty well with that too so this seems

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.510 
pretty well with that too so this seems
like<00:06:03.659> it's<00:06:03.870> real<00:06:04.050> hot<00:06:04.320> right<00:06:04.710> now<00:06:04.860> I<00:06:05.099> got<00:06:05.400> this

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
aren't too many of these kicking around

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.490 
aren't too many of these kicking around
I<00:06:14.969> think<00:06:15.240> a<00:06:15.330> lot<00:06:15.509> of<00:06:15.539> people<00:06:15.630> just<00:06:15.840> pour<00:06:16.349> them

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
I think a lot of people just pour them

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.800 
I think a lot of people just pour them
in<00:06:16.620> their<00:06:16.740> kitchens<00:06:17.210> there's<00:06:18.210> obviously<00:06:18.389> a

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
in their kitchens there's obviously a

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.830 
in their kitchens there's obviously a
lot<00:06:18.900> of<00:06:19.169> people<00:06:19.440> who<00:06:19.560> love<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.789> friends<00:06:21.270> show

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
lot of people who love the friends show

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.499 
lot of people who love the friends show
and<00:06:22.490> they'll<00:06:23.490> probably<00:06:23.699> pay<00:06:23.940> quite<00:06:24.180> a<00:06:24.240> bit<00:06:24.389> for

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
and they'll probably pay quite a bit for

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.629 
and they'll probably pay quite a bit for
this<00:06:24.659> I<00:06:24.810> have<00:06:25.050> one<00:06:25.349> but<00:06:26.039> I've<00:06:26.130> been<00:06:26.219> holding<00:06:26.400> on
