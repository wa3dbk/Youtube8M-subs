market parts you don't made by different
manufacturers<00:00:37.379> and<00:00:37.769> some<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> them<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.280> good

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
manufacturers and some of them have good

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.090 
manufacturers and some of them have good
primers<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.149> some<00:00:39.329> devil<00:00:39.749> and<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
primers and some devil and what this

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.669 
primers and some devil and what this
black<00:00:41.609> primer<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.510> an<00:00:42.629> OEM<00:00:43.050> part<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
black primer it is on an OEM part is the

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.849 
black primer it is on an OEM part is the
eco<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.429> that's<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.300> coating<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.109> really

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
eco and that's a coating this really

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.239 
eco and that's a coating this really
provides<00:00:47.219> aids<00:00:48.089> corrosion<00:00:48.899> protection

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
provides aids corrosion protection

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.009 
provides aids corrosion protection
however<00:00:50.249> just<00:00:50.819> a<00:00:50.909> black<00:00:51.120> primer<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.929> know

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
however just a black primer you know

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.119 
however just a black primer you know
it's<00:00:52.140> kind<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.289> hard<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.499> tell<00:00:52.679> the<00:00:52.769> difference

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it's kind of hard to tell the difference

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.660 
it's kind of hard to tell the difference
between<00:00:53.159> eco<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:54.210> black<00:00:54.719> primer<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.670> one

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
between eco and black primer and one

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.219 
between eco and black primer and one
thing<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.329> before<00:00:57.569> you<00:00:57.870> start

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
thing you can do before you start

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.459 
thing you can do before you start
sanding<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:59.219> determine<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.819> this<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.149> eco<00:01:00.600> or<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
sanding to determine if this is eco or a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.700 
sanding to determine if this is eco or a
cheaper<00:01:02.010> primer<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.350> test<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
cheaper primer is do they test on it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.870 
cheaper primer is do they test on it
we're<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> show<00:01:05.370> you<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we're going to show you that just a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.219 
we're going to show you that just a
minute<00:01:07.040> now<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.250> uh<00:01:08.540> if<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> test<00:01:09.899> comes<00:01:10.140> back

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
minute now you uh if the test comes back

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.469 
minute now you uh if the test comes back
you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.070> after<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.399> do<00:01:11.579> it<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.149> doesn't

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you know after we do it and it doesn't

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.270 
you know after we do it and it doesn't
show<00:01:12.509> that<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.049> cheaper<00:01:13.350> primer<00:01:13.649> when<00:01:14.159> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
show that it's a cheaper primer when you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
show that it's a cheaper primer when you
interview<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.969> an<00:01:15.090> OEM<00:01:15.540> parts<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
interview just like an OEM parts and and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.080 
interview just like an OEM parts and and
paint<00:01:16.649> but<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.219> we're<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
paint but if not we're going to have to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.880 
paint but if not we're going to have to
strip<00:01:18.329> it<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.570> metal<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.140> put<00:01:19.619> something<00:01:19.799> like

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
strip it to metal and put something like

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.910 
strip it to metal and put something like
epoxy<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.969> you<00:01:21.780> know<00:01:21.899> slippy<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.500> against<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
epoxy on you know slippy up against that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.880 
epoxy on you know slippy up against that
metal<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.490> provide<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.939> erosion<00:01:24.329> protection

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
metal to provide that erosion protection

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.020 
metal to provide that erosion protection
so<00:01:25.890> Jordan<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> show<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.729> how<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> do

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
done to this point first we wanted this

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.190 
done to this point first we wanted this
an<00:03:44.520> aftermarket<00:03:45.000> parts<00:03:45.510> we<00:03:45.660> wanted<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:45.990> see<00:03:46.110> if

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
an aftermarket parts we wanted to see if

an aftermarket parts we wanted to see if
this<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.320> eco<00:03:46.860> tour<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.160> cheaper<00:03:47.550> primer<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.510> we

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
this is eco tour a cheaper primer so we

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.420 
this is eco tour a cheaper primer so we
did<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.780> lacquer<00:03:49.050> test<00:03:49.440> we<00:03:49.740> rubbed<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.040> on<00:03:50.190> there

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
did a lacquer test we rubbed it on there

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.700 
did a lacquer test we rubbed it on there
and<00:03:50.670> if<00:03:51.480> if<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.170> would<00:03:52.320> have<00:03:52.410> came<00:03:52.650> off

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
and if if it would have came off

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.650 
and if if it would have came off
transferred<00:03:53.490> to<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.700> rag<00:03:53.910> we'd<00:03:54.390> need<00:03:54.510> to

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
transferred to the rag we'd need to

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.560 
transferred to the rag we'd need to
strip<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.350> put<00:03:55.470> some<00:03:55.620> epoxy<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:56.450> but<00:03:57.450> it

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.030 
strip this and put some epoxy on but it
didn't<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.110> we<00:03:58.230> can<00:03:58.350> go<00:03:58.470> ahead<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.770> treat<00:03:58.890> it

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
didn't so we can go ahead and treat it

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.610 
didn't so we can go ahead and treat it
like<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> heat<00:03:59.730> coat<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.210> just<00:04:00.240> final<00:04:01.140> sand<00:04:01.410> it

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
like a heat coat and just final sand it

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.690 
like a heat coat and just final sand it
and<00:04:01.740> get<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.070> great<00:04:02.310> prep<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.140> then<00:04:04.140> we<00:04:04.380> uh<00:04:04.700> Jacob

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
and get a great prep so then we uh Jacob

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.000
