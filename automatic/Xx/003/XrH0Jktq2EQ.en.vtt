00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.830
 Y 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.260
 hello everyone greets you home queen and 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.270
 family see you again I'm here with 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.119
 you bringing another video here from 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.910
 my kitchen this is to teach them or more 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.880
 well to show you how I prepare a 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.759
 pineapple atole is very easy and very 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.000
 simple to prepare it and here I already have 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.800
 a small pot I already put this 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.930
 a quarter of water and I will add 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.830
 another quarter of water has to be 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.460
 of two quarters of water because I'm going to 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:45.649
 add this can of 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.989
 Pineapple 20 oz to prepare 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.390
 the actor later we are going to add 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.280
 more water so this pot has to 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.399
 be at least two quarters of 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.760
 water because it will rise more or less to 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.879
 three quarters so that's all we're going 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.930
 to put him and I'm going to put a hairline 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.710
 cinnamon in what boils the water this 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.860
 let's cover it and then we will continue 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.070
 with what with what continues in 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.049
 is 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.020
 in this preparation I'm going to put you as 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:25.189
 I repeat this pineapple again 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.729
 in a 20 ounce can if you have the 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.060
 whole pineapple so the fruit can do it 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.979
 also with that and if in case you 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.530
 do not have like in my case right now 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.560
 I do not have pineapple without fruit, I'm going to 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.450
 do with this good then what you 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.600
 I will add for what kind of 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:50.119
 zone would be in addition dry here already 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:55.819
 I have two tacitas of this is a 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:02:00.140
 of a third I put two so this 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:06.429
 it will serve us to make the mixture and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.429
 to thicken the act we're going to do it 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.700
 this adds it to all the stress 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.810
 what about the pineapple 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.810
 and we add 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.280
 the maseca flour 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.360
 and this we are going to liquefy it in what 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.360
 boil the water 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.080
 well here we have the mixture 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.180
 already prepared all liquefied and then here 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.880
 the water is boiling so we're going to 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.260
 add 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.260
 of the mixture towards 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.319
 you have to add just everything and you're 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.980
 liquefy it so it does not look like this 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.129
 balls the driest 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.489
 we'll take a little water and it 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.489
 we add 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:12.760
 and this because we are going to move until 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:15.969
 cook and so this thickens in 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.060
 if it is not well the 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:21.700
 thickness consistency so you can 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.090
 others add another little flour 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.459
 dry and then this one here we're going to 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.459
 add the sugar I will add the 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.060
 sugar is tacita is half coop well 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.060
 what are we going to add 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.180
 one 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.180
 and another 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.730
 and more or less so not so full the 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.739
 third 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.739
 because here there is already this 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.380
 more or less three coupons of liquid or of 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.540
 water all over 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.330
 and it is what is added that is the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.820
 exact measure what I add him and then 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.910
 this one if you want to prepare this 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.240
 It is very easy to prepare it and it tastes very 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.820
 tasty very rich be amazed by pineapple and 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.550
 well this for these cold seasons 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.430
 Well, it's going to be soon, so you have to 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:22.670
 take advantage of making our atoles good 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.430
 here the atole has finished cooking 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.220
 of pineapple and you're ready as you can see 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.820
 the consistency is fine is not very 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.090
 thick and is not very comfortable and very 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.900
 Distilled or easy very light water 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.490
 but it is in its at its good point 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.070
 good here and I present the actor I 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.620
 prepared served in a cup is like that 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.660
 How is the atole de pineapple? 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.380
 serves them with about two loaves of bread 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.510
 toasted bread and that comes out very good so 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.630
 take advantage in these last days 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.420
