know I raced arenacross for a few years

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.270 
know I raced arenacross for a few years
and<00:01:03.450> growing<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.009> know<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> also<00:01:07.280> rebuilt

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and growing up and I know I also rebuilt

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.890 
and growing up and I know I also rebuilt
my<00:01:08.400> part<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.970> my<00:01:09.030> supercross<00:01:09.420> track<00:01:09.600> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
my part of my supercross track and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.060 
my part of my supercross track and
actually<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> made<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:10.890> bit

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
actually kind of made it a little bit

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.789 
actually kind of made it a little bit
tighter<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.900> think<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.020> was<00:01:13.530> over<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
tighter and I think it was over the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.230 
tighter and I think it was over the
years<00:01:14.009> I<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.579> of<00:01:14.609> struggled<00:01:14.789> coming

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
years I think I kind of struggled coming

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.609 
years I think I kind of struggled coming
over<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.840> never<00:01:16.020> really<00:01:16.590> had

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
over here because I never really had

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
over here because I never really had
anything<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.070> tight<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.579> practice<00:01:17.969> on<00:01:18.149> but

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
anything really tight to practice on but

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.660 
anything really tight to practice on but
i<00:01:18.689> changed<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.469> up<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.679> year<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.100> made<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
i changed it up this year and made it

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.029 
i changed it up this year and made it
made<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.939> tight<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.869> came<00:01:22.380> over<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.649> and<00:01:22.950> I

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
made it tight and I came over here and I

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.309 
made it tight and I came over here and I
I<00:01:23.310> actually<00:01:23.789> feel<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.359> I<00:01:24.509> felt<00:01:24.719> comfy<00:01:25.079> i<00:01:25.170> get

I've been to Europe a few times now I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.980 
I've been to Europe a few times now I
think<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.980> always<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.640> great<00:01:41.850> great<00:01:42.720> trip

think it's always the great great trip
and<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.980> like<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> dirt<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:45.300> like

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.240 
the people and I like the culture and so
I'm<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.300> happy<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:49.160> riding<00:01:50.160> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
I'm very happy to be here riding the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.570 
I'm very happy to be here riding the
track<00:01:50.460> today<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.090> thought<00:01:51.510> that<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.780> track<00:01:51.960> was

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
track today I thought that the track was

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.510 
track today I thought that the track was
soft<00:01:53.580> it<00:01:53.940> had<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.300> decent<00:01:55.050> flow<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.250> jumps

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
soft it had a decent flow and the jumps

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760 
soft it had a decent flow and the jumps
were<00:01:56.640> pretty<00:01:56.880> pretty<00:01:57.330> good<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.900> you<00:01:58.440> know<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> go

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
were pretty pretty good so you know I go

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.610 
were pretty pretty good so you know I go
out<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> go<00:02:00.210> practice<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.110> about<00:02:01.290> 20

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
out there and go practice in about 20

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.890 
out there and go practice in about 20
minutes<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.160> so<00:02:02.400> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.910> if<00:02:03.570> i<00:02:03.690> can<00:02:03.840> get

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
minutes and so I think that if i can get

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.590 
minutes and so I think that if i can get
the<00:02:04.020> track<00:02:04.230> figured<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.160> will<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:06.000> good

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the track figured out it will be good

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.690 
the track figured out it will be good
and<00:02:07.080> I'll<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.740> able<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.950> go<00:02:08.070> out<00:02:08.220> there<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.460> do

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and I'll be able to go out there and do

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.050 
and I'll be able to go out there and do
