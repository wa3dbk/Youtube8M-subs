00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.380 

Yoshimoto<00:00:04.290> created<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.189> very<00:00:05.399> complex<00:00:06.000> play

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
Yoshimoto created a very complex play

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.740 
Yoshimoto created a very complex play
object<00:00:06.840> consisting<00:00:07.380> of<00:00:07.470> three<00:00:07.769> cubes<00:00:08.750> there

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
object consisting of three cubes there

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.329 
object consisting of three cubes there
are<00:00:09.870> many<00:00:10.080> demonstrations<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.190> these

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:11.339 
are many demonstrations of these

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.060 
are many demonstrations of these
Yoshimoto<00:00:11.879> cubes<00:00:12.179> except<00:00:12.570> they<00:00:13.019> mainly<00:00:13.469> focus

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
Yoshimoto cubes except they mainly focus

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
Yoshimoto cubes except they mainly focus
on<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.669> one<00:00:15.200> part<00:00:16.200> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> object<00:00:16.530> and<00:00:17.090> only

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
on this one part of the object and only

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.820 
on this one part of the object and only
showing<00:00:18.330> one<00:00:18.480> cute<00:00:18.930> really<00:00:19.140> doesn't<00:00:19.530> do<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
showing one cute really doesn't do the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.400 
showing one cute really doesn't do the
whole<00:00:20.070> piece<00:00:20.370> justice<00:00:21.000> because<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:22.110> only<00:00:22.290> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
whole piece justice because it's only a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.290 
whole piece justice because it's only a
fraction<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.610> do<00:00:23.790> with<00:00:23.940> them

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
fraction of what you can do with them

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.260 
fraction of what you can do with them
so<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.080> could<00:00:25.290> hold<00:00:25.440> these<00:00:26.030> with<00:00:27.030> this

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
so if you could hold these with this

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.190 
so if you could hold these with this
cube<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.020> can<00:00:28.050> take<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.950> apart<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:30.810> turns

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
cube you can take it apart and it turns

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.119 
cube you can take it apart and it turns
into<00:00:31.470> eight<00:00:32.250> smaller<00:00:32.759> cubes<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.570> each<00:00:33.750> side

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
into eight smaller cubes on each side

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.009 
into eight smaller cubes on each side
you<00:00:35.129> can<00:00:35.280> turn<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.789> silver<00:00:36.059> cube<00:00:36.449> into<00:00:36.780> what's

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
you can turn the silver cube into what's

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.880 
you can turn the silver cube into what's
now<00:00:37.199> a<00:00:37.230> gold<00:00:37.559> keep<00:00:38.359> from<00:00:39.359> that<00:00:39.539> gold<00:00:39.870> cube<00:00:40.199> you

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
now a gold keep from that gold cube you

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.410 
now a gold keep from that gold cube you
can<00:00:41.070> take<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.879> halves<00:00:42.210> apart<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.879> make<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
can take two halves apart and make a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.880 
can take two halves apart and make a
gold<00:00:45.899> star<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.370> silver<00:00:47.760> star<00:00:48.769> once<00:00:49.769> you

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
gold star and the silver star once you

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.989 
gold star and the silver star once you
have<00:00:50.069> the<00:00:50.460> gold<00:00:50.699> star<00:00:50.999> in<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> silver<00:00:51.600> star

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
have the gold star in the silver star

00:00:52.999 --> 00:01:01.160 
have the gold star in the silver star
you<00:00:53.999> can<00:00:54.239> create<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:55.550> gold<00:00:56.550> cube<00:00:58.879> and<00:01:00.170> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you can create a gold cube and the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.709 
you can create a gold cube and the
silver<00:01:01.469> cube<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:02.159> those<00:01:02.309> two<00:01:02.519> pieces<00:01:02.719> they

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
silver cube with those two pieces they

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
silver cube with those two pieces they
all<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> end<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:04.979> go<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.820> together

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
all in the end they all go back together

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.990 
all in the end they all go back together
into<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:10.369> part<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> Yoshimoto

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
into this one part of the Yoshimoto

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.510 
into this one part of the Yoshimoto
object<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.829> what<00:01:13.829> can<00:01:14.009> you<00:01:14.100> create<00:01:14.369> with

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
object there what can you create with

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.090 
object there what can you create with
the<00:01:14.549> second<00:01:15.000> cube<00:01:15.590> second<00:01:16.590> cube<00:01:16.799> actually

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the second cube second cube actually

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.569 
the second cube second cube actually
breaks<00:01:17.670> apart<00:01:18.060> into<00:01:18.270> two<00:01:18.479> separate<00:01:19.469> rings<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
breaks apart into two separate rings you

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.359 
breaks apart into two separate rings you
can<00:01:20.759> play<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.039> you<00:01:23.039> can<00:01:23.189> make

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
can play with that one and you can make

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.880 
can play with that one and you can make
many<00:01:23.729> different<00:01:24.539> weird<00:01:25.049> shapes<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> these

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
many different weird shapes out of these

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.370 
many different weird shapes out of these
rings<00:01:28.520> something<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:30.110> they're<00:01:31.110> both

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
rings something like that they're both

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.529 
rings something like that they're both
identical<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.219> can<00:01:32.369> make<00:01:32.520> either<00:01:32.729> there's

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
identical so you can make either there's

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.709 
identical so you can make either there's
another<00:01:33.810> example<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.450> these

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
another example and then with these

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.279 
another example and then with these
rings<00:01:37.399> what<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.180> create<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.049> base

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
rings what you can do is create the base

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.990 
rings what you can do is create the base
of<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:42.320> star<00:01:43.490> they're<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.759> come

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
of a star they're all gonna come

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
of a star they're all gonna come
together<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.600> star<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> end<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.859> this<00:01:46.950> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
together in a star in the end so this is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.270 
together in a star in the end so this is
part<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:48.109> we'll<00:01:49.109> put<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.619> first<00:01:49.920> cube

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
part of it we'll put the first cube

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.029 
part of it we'll put the first cube
solving<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.719> cube<00:01:51.899> form<00:01:52.399> into<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
solving the cube form into here so you

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.330 
solving the cube form into here so you
make<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.399> same<00:01:59.810> shape<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> second<00:02:01.590> ring

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
make the same shape with the second ring

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.120 
make the same shape with the second ring
of<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.880> second<00:02:03.299> cube<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.289> put<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.890> top

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of the second cube you can put it on top

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.900 
of the second cube you can put it on top
of<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.079> now<00:02:07.079> you've<00:02:07.320> got<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.979> shape<00:02:08.220> made

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
of that now you've got this shape made

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.009 
of that now you've got this shape made
out<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.929> first<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.530> second<00:02:10.890> cube<00:02:11.930> now<00:02:12.930> if

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
out of the first and second cube now if

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.690 
out of the first and second cube now if
the<00:02:13.170> third<00:02:13.470> cube<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:15.540> actually<00:02:16.050> one<00:02:16.700> full

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the third cube is actually one full

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.930 
the third cube is actually one full
piece<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.659> comes<00:02:19.019> apart<00:02:19.409> into<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.650> ring<00:02:19.940> with

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
piece that comes apart into a ring with

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.000 
piece that comes apart into a ring with
this<00:02:21.120> piece<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:22.050> make<00:02:22.230> some<00:02:22.440> really<00:02:22.709> neat

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
this piece can make some really neat

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.920 
this piece can make some really neat
designs<00:02:23.840> where<00:02:24.840> my<00:02:25.019> favorites<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.739> this<00:02:26.930> right

here<00:02:29.629> from<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.750> third<00:02:30.989> cube<00:02:31.379> we<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.709> created

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
here from the third cube we have created

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:39.040 
here from the third cube we have created
somewhat<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.730> star<00:02:33.000> shape

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.020 

the<00:02:39.590> shape<00:02:39.800> from<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.070> first<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.640> second

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
the shape from the first and second

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.280 
the shape from the first and second
cubes<00:02:41.330> can<00:02:41.600> fit<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.140> middle<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:48.260> create
