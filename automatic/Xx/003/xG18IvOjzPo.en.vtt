00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.029
 in the last program we are with Andrei 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.899
 shishigi us fishing in Uglich 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.599
 reservoir 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.790
 more precisely combined business with pleasure 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.740
 in addition to catching zander proving 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.199
 dreamcast rod advantage 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.520
 namely their high sensitivity 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.740
 just how sensitive you will be 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.740
 just stunned but everyone thought that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.900
 you can see also the hand of God is not at all 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.220
 amazing of course and visual 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.920
 sensitivity and according to it 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 great brain this 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.780
 we decided to touch this topic again and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.969
 that is why in the last program on 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.820
 dreamcast rod caught not only Andre 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.649
 decide the program crew is not 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 owned by a cohort of professional 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.690
 anglers rather we can be attributed to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 sympathetic and affiliated with it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.079
 beautiful occupation 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.629
 so here we also tried to catch on 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.840
 dreamcast naturally offscreen but 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.699
 unsuccessfully the most interesting bite 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.340
 we were like Andrei Shishigin and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.780
 all is really felt here only 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.689
 catch nothing failed 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 why talk about it today 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.540
 spinning rods which 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.200
 designed for fishing on jig 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.570
 bait 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.549
 most often has a heightened visual 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.340
 sensitivity to them include the series 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.250
 dreamcast rods 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.830
 Well, about all the increased sensitivity 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.979
 already know how to unfortunately these rods 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.829
 possess such amazing property about 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.170
 which just not many do not know or not 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.700
 The fisherman takes into account the fact that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.979
 here it is who died so here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.720
 happens that is exactly due to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.930
 here is this increased sensitivity 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.049
 we can see even the slightest 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.509
 poklevku but if we ourselves bend like this 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.520
 rods that good vizazhu can be seen that 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.590
 hooking occurs not vertex 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.310
 directly that is all long 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.189
 this lever 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.020
 and somewhere here is the middle of about the top 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.630
 knees 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.570
 so with the usual habit 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.549
 that's what many reflex 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.490
 the habit of short poke short 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.590
 a sharp movement often does not pass 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.250
 especially when catching exactly zander 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.520
 why zander has a very 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.170
 let the bony mouth practically 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.060
 her upper part 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.450
 relatively lower motionless therefore 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.060
 it is necessary, and so much to slip through 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.490
 hook certainly hooked it 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.500
 bony this fall accordingly 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.270
 cutting often should not be 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.310
 just fast like lightning 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.390
 reflex but also sufficient 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.550
 degree sweeping it is about this people 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.520
 forget that they flow very shortly 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.860
 how would a large number of catching a perch or 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.720
 we will separately show the pike on 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.670
 rod which is equipped with a cord and 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.020
 coil how does cutting and how 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.870
 when this happens 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.180
 bend where you died rods what place 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.870
 specifically rod proceeds this very 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.540
 why it is important because more often we usually 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.880
 believe so if we catch from a boat then 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.950
 seems to be a long cast and not relevant 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.020
 although we have already proved to you that distant 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.870
 casts are important even when 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.940
 catching from the boat and the second as if there 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.440
 catch on a boat more convenient to take or 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.290
 will put especially short passage 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.360
 Nick directly at short 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.130
 rod but unfortunately short rod 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.830
 has a short lever 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.360
 that is, what is the length of the rod more by whom? 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.860
 cutting is obtained 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.540
 effective we now you this 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.280
 demonstrate directly 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:37.010
 equipped with angler we fixed the end 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.790
 despicable curtains on the floor and we 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.489
 rod 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.299
 a little bend you can see yes and here it is 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.790
 Here's how to touch I went away and went 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.739
 poklevka when we cut our sharply 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.860
 it is clear that 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.510
 bends the upper quarter of the top then 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.730
 there is exactly half the upper knee 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.950
 leaves almost straight with 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.450
 fishing line that is why many of them are not 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.390
 understand how is happening to this 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.360
 here's the length under the flowing part really 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.459
 this is a three-quarter high fishing rod 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.340
 visual sensitivity here 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.130
 just very well see that half 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.910
 almost the upper knee 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.310
 straight along with the cord again 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.010
 show wash your time it's pretty 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.370
 strong on the hooking period and clearly 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.370
 prominent 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.670
 if we do sharp cutting then 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.160
 the length of the leaking part is longer 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.740
 so she is more so long 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.700
 rod will rather win perch with hard 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.460
 bony grasped among photographers there 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.130
 such a proverb takes no camera 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.430
 takes a photographer we think it 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.650
 true for anglers technique 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.610
 there are tackles of course must be good 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.330
 but you need to be able to use them 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.380
 he catches well and who does not know how to catch 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.810
 removes fishing program 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.580
 This of course joke on fact 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.100
 learn to properly cut completely 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.230
 not difficult especially when in the hands of such 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.230
 wonderful tool like dreamcast
