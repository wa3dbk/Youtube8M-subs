we created supports this concept here
you<00:02:05.970> see<00:02:06.180> rock<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.750> matter<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.259> very<00:02:07.560> hard

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
you see rock it's matter is very hard

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.180 
you see rock it's matter is very hard
and<00:02:08.160> it'll<00:02:08.759> roads<00:02:09.000> extremely<00:02:09.750> slowly<00:02:10.190> above

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
the rocky soil which is solved see how

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.920 
the rocky soil which is solved see how
