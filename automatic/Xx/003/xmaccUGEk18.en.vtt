three<00:02:17.569> sometimes<00:02:18.569> gameplay<00:02:18.959> can<00:02:19.170> go<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.350> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
three sometimes gameplay can go to a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.610 
three sometimes gameplay can go to a
halt<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:21.120> sometimes<00:02:21.540> you'll<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.380> just

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
halt and sometimes you'll just it's just

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
maybe it's not that impressive it's just

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.350 
maybe it's not that impressive it's just
because<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.700> sponsor<00:02:32.700> horrible<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.150> mean

team<00:03:18.180> pack<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.570> fun<00:03:18.989> but<00:03:19.170> obviously<00:03:19.590> it's<00:03:19.799> only

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
team pack is fun but obviously it's only

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.699 
team pack is fun but obviously it's only
for<00:03:20.250> guys<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:23.340> know<00:03:23.370> honestly<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.820> think

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
for guys that you know honestly I think

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.140 
for guys that you know honestly I think
don't<00:03:25.709> get<00:03:25.920> me<00:03:26.010> wrong<00:03:26.040> i<00:03:26.400> know<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.820> this

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
don't get me wrong i know that this

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.090 
don't get me wrong i know that this
makes<00:03:27.390> perfect<00:03:27.570> sense<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.200> why<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.680> has

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
makes perfect sense to why it it has

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.580 
makes perfect sense to why it it has
less<00:03:29.370> lag<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:30.780> there's<00:03:31.019> less<00:03:31.170> people

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
less lag is because there's less people

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.460 
less lag is because there's less people
because<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.459> say<00:03:32.790> perhaps<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:34.200> way<00:03:34.320> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
because this say perhaps the way the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.170 
because this say perhaps the way the
service<00:03:34.799> works<00:03:35.040> this<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.430> kind<00:03:35.609> of<00:03:35.670> nerdy<00:03:35.910> shit

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
service works this is kind of nerdy shit

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.520 
service works this is kind of nerdy shit
but<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:37.170> say<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:38.340> have<00:03:39.290> like<00:03:40.290> one

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
but just say that to have like one

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.190 
but just say that to have like one
player<00:03:40.799> in<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.549> game<00:03:41.760> takes<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.480> hundred

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
player in a game takes a hundred

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.160 
player in a game takes a hundred
megabytes<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.130> then<00:03:44.700> there's<00:03:44.970> nine<00:03:45.420> nine

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
megabytes and then there's nine nine

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.050 
megabytes and then there's nine nine
players<00:03:46.470> well<00:03:47.250> then<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.489> nine<00:03:47.730> hundred

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
players well then you have nine hundred

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.699 
players well then you have nine hundred
megabytes<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.690> are<00:03:48.840> eating<00:03:49.109> up<00:03:49.230> worth<00:03:49.530> of

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
megabytes that are eating up worth of

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.039 
megabytes that are eating up worth of
upload<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:50.970> say<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.359> now<00:03:51.510> there's<00:03:51.780> only

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
upload so just say that now there's only

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.840 
upload so just say that now there's only
eight<00:03:52.440> guys<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:52.980> only<00:03:53.070> have<00:03:53.130> 800<00:03:53.400> and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
eight guys and you only have 800 and

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.610 
eight guys and you only have 800 and
then<00:03:53.940> like<00:03:54.120> when<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.870> thoroughly<00:03:55.049> ground<00:03:55.440> war

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
then like when you thoroughly ground war

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.229 
then like when you thoroughly ground war
into<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.920> equation<00:03:56.549> like<00:03:57.140> 18<00:03:58.140> people<00:03:59.239> that's

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
into the equation like 18 people that's

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.720 
into the equation like 18 people that's
1,800<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.079> there's<00:04:01.410> more<00:04:01.769> work<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.670> the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
1,800 so there's more work for the

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.940 
1,800 so there's more work for the
consoles<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.420> do<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.660> service<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.170> do<00:04:04.319> which<00:04:04.920> is

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
consoles to do in service to do which is

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.500 
consoles to do in service to do which is
why<00:04:05.100> sometimes<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.760> actually<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.269> playing

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
why sometimes I actually like playing

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.330 
why sometimes I actually like playing
team<00:04:06.720> tactical<00:04:07.230> hope<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.010> guys<00:04:08.160> actually

competitive<00:04:21.709> aspect<00:04:22.159> of<00:04:22.310> gaming<00:04:22.669> which<00:04:22.849> I

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
competitive aspect of gaming which I

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.719 
competitive aspect of gaming which I
think<00:04:23.870> some<00:04:24.319> channels<00:04:24.680> work<00:04:25.400> really<00:04:25.610> well

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
think some channels work really well
