00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.509 
then i'm going to try and do more
consistency<00:03:14.109> with<00:03:14.409> series<00:03:14.769> in<00:03:14.799> terms<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.370> like

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
consistency with series in terms of like

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.009 
consistency with series in terms of like
timing<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.209> like<00:03:16.329> times<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.629> day<00:03:16.750> when<00:03:16.900> they're

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
timing and like times a day when they're

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.809 
timing and like times a day when they're
released<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.469> so<00:03:17.590> forth<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.430> there's<00:03:18.639> a<00:03:18.700> lot

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
released and so forth so there's a lot

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:19.830 
released and so forth so there's a lot
of<00:03:18.879> stuff<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.299> i'm<00:03:19.450> going<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.599> try<00:03:19.750> and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
of stuff like that i'm going to try and

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.449 
of stuff like that i'm going to try and
do<00:03:20.079> let<00:03:20.889> me<00:03:20.919> know<00:03:21.010> what<00:03:21.159> you<00:03:21.250> think<00:03:21.370> about
