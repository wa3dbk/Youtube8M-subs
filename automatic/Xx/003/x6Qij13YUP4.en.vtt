00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
because all mine's I believe it just had

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.010 
because all mine's I believe it just had
something<00:01:23.700> else<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> top<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.810> stuck

something else at the top so I was stuck
on<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.189> does<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.759> allows

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
on that but what this does is it allows

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.120 
on that but what this does is it allows
you<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.540> toggle<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.590> forth<00:01:28.829> between

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you to toggle back and forth between

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.219 
about this particular tweak is that it
caused<00:05:49.520> my<00:05:49.760> device<00:05:50.090> to<00:05:50.270> respring<00:05:50.630> a<00:05:50.750> lot<00:05:50.930> and<00:05:51.139> I

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
caused my device to respring a lot and I

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.150 
caused my device to respring a lot and I
don't<00:05:51.290> know<00:05:51.440> if<00:05:51.530> it's<00:05:51.620> gonna<00:05:51.770> do<00:05:51.889> the<00:05:52.010> same

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
don't know if it's gonna do the same

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.100 
don't know if it's gonna do the same
thing<00:05:52.400> for<00:05:52.550> yours<00:05:52.820> but<00:05:53.419> in<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.690> event<00:05:53.810> you

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
thing for yours but in the event you

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.840 
thing for yours but in the event you
install<00:05:54.470> this<00:05:54.590> tweak<00:05:54.860> and<00:05:55.010> it<00:05:55.100> does<00:05:55.310> then<00:05:55.699> it's

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
install this tweak and it does then it's

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.159 
install this tweak and it does then it's
possibly<00:05:56.240> something<00:05:56.479> going<00:05:56.780> wrong<00:05:56.810> with<00:05:57.080> the

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
possibly something going wrong with the

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.480 
possibly something going wrong with the
tweak<00:05:57.380> that<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.680> developer<00:05:58.160> needs<00:05:58.370> to

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
tweak that the developer needs to

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.000 
tweak that the developer needs to
address<00:05:58.760> but<00:05:59.479> for<00:05:59.660> my<00:05:59.840> particular<00:06:00.229> device<00:06:00.740> I

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
address but for my particular device I

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.340 
address but for my particular device I
got<00:06:01.250> a<00:06:01.280> lot<00:06:01.460> of<00:06:01.490> respring<00:06:02.000> x'<00:06:02.060> at<00:06:02.300> random<00:06:03.169> and

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
got a lot of respring x' at random and

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.350 
got a lot of respring x' at random and
it<00:06:03.650> hasn't<00:06:03.860> done<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.250> as<00:06:04.370> of<00:06:04.550> late<00:06:04.760> but<00:06:05.090> one

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
it hasn't done it as of late but one

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.969 
it hasn't done it as of late but one
consistent<00:06:05.930> respring<00:06:06.320> that<00:06:06.470> i<00:06:06.500> will<00:06:06.710> get<00:06:06.889> is

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
consistent respring that i will get is

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.010 
consistent respring that i will get is
when<00:06:07.130> i<00:06:07.160> slide<00:06:07.490> in<00:06:07.669> from<00:06:07.820> the<00:06:07.940> left<00:06:08.180> and<00:06:08.449> i<00:06:08.870> go

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
when i slide in from the left and i go

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.529 
when i slide in from the left and i go
to<00:06:09.080> load<00:06:09.590> a<00:06:09.620> theme<00:06:10.039> and<00:06:10.340> it<00:06:10.880> takes<00:06:11.180> me<00:06:11.330> to<00:06:11.360> the

go ahead and load this theme when I go

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.659 
go ahead and load this theme when I go
to<00:06:26.210> my<00:06:26.449> lock<00:06:26.690> screen<00:06:26.720> it<00:06:27.470> just<00:06:28.280> stays<00:06:28.460> at<00:06:28.639> a

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
to my lock screen it just stays at a

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.090 
to my lock screen it just stays at a
black<00:06:28.880> screen<00:06:29.150> and<00:06:29.419> of<00:06:30.169> course<00:06:30.440> it<00:06:30.680> doesn't<00:06:31.010> do

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
black screen and of course it doesn't do

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.060 
black screen and of course it doesn't do
it<00:06:31.220> now<00:06:31.370> but<00:06:32.060> nonetheless<00:06:32.419> it<00:06:32.960> usually<00:06:33.680> does

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
it now but nonetheless it usually does

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.129 
it now but nonetheless it usually does
it<00:06:34.280> so<00:06:34.700> that<00:06:34.940> is<00:06:35.090> something<00:06:35.389> that<00:06:35.450> I<00:06:35.570> noticed

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
it so that is something that I noticed

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.960 
it so that is something that I noticed
that<00:06:36.289> happened<00:06:36.800> on<00:06:36.889> a<00:06:36.950> consistent<00:06:37.310> basis

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
that happened on a consistent basis

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.420 
that happened on a consistent basis
until<00:06:38.539> right<00:06:38.780> then<00:06:39.020> so<00:06:39.410> just<00:06:39.440> be<00:06:39.770> mindful<00:06:40.039> if

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
until right then so just be mindful if

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.890 
until right then so just be mindful if
your<00:06:40.580> phone<00:06:40.820> does<00:06:41.090> something<00:06:41.479> a<00:06:41.570> little<00:06:41.780> odd

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
your phone does something a little odd

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.870 
your phone does something a little odd
it<00:06:42.260> could<00:06:42.440> potentially<00:06:42.860> be<00:06:42.979> this<00:06:43.130> week<00:06:43.340> cuz

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
it could potentially be this week cuz

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.400 
it could potentially be this week cuz
I've<00:06:44.000> been<00:06:44.150> having<00:06:44.419> that<00:06:44.450> issue<00:06:44.690> but<00:06:45.080> overall

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
I've been having that issue but overall

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.350 
I've been having that issue but overall
this<00:06:45.680> week<00:06:45.860> is<00:06:46.039> a<00:06:46.070> good<00:06:46.280> week<00:06:46.520> with<00:06:46.789> that<00:06:47.090> small

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
this week is a good week with that small

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.420 
this week is a good week with that small
glitch<00:06:47.630> but<00:06:48.020> that<00:06:48.200> sums<00:06:48.470> everything<00:06:48.650> up<00:06:48.979> for

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
glitch but that sums everything up for

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.460 
glitch but that sums everything up for
