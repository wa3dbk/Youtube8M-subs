probably just a baby now it's probably a
year<00:01:22.350> old<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.890> would<00:01:23.130> say<00:01:23.659> but<00:01:24.659> they'll<00:01:24.960> grow<00:01:25.320> at

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
year old I would say but they'll grow at

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.740 
year old I would say but they'll grow at
least<00:01:26.030> eight<00:01:27.030> inches<00:01:27.600> long<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:29.540> they<00:01:30.540> would

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
least eight inches long and they would

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.310 
least eight inches long and they would
eventually<00:01:31.259> need<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> 20<00:01:32.579> gallon<00:01:32.759> tank<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
eventually need a 20 gallon tank which I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.310 
eventually need a 20 gallon tank which I
do<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.460> I'll<00:01:36.240> eventually<00:01:36.659> put<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.170> in

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
do have one so I'll eventually put it in

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.710 
do have one so I'll eventually put it in
there<00:01:37.560> when<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> gets<00:01:38.009> bigger<00:01:38.329> it<00:01:39.329> needs<00:01:39.509> to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
there when it gets bigger it needs to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.280 
there when it gets bigger it needs to
like<00:01:40.430> move<00:01:41.430> around<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.329> stuff<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.170> get

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
like move around and stuff it will get

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.940 
like move around and stuff it will get
really<00:01:43.500> fat<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.399> big<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.420> anyway<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.619> it's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.059 
and they're like one of the most studied
salamanders<00:02:41.400> ever<00:02:41.909> liked<00:02:42.659> by<00:02:43.079> scientists<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
salamanders ever liked by scientists and

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.210 
salamanders ever liked by scientists and
they've<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:45.200> came<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.319> with<00:02:46.500> ways<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.739> make

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
they've like came up with ways to make

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.880 
they've like came up with ways to make
it<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.900> be<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> full<00:02:49.459> salamander<00:02:50.870> by<00:02:51.890> injecting

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
it a be a full salamander by injecting

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.930 
it a be a full salamander by injecting
it<00:02:53.069> with<00:02:53.099> whatever<00:02:54.019> in<00:02:55.019> there<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
it with whatever in there and it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.569 
it with whatever in there and it
actually<00:02:57.269> being<00:02:57.900> able<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.290> walk<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:58.799> land<00:02:59.159> and

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
actually being able to walk on land and

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.500 
actually being able to walk on land and
stuff<00:03:00.269> but<00:03:01.140> they<00:03:01.950> live<00:03:02.190> up<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.370> 10<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:02.970> 12<00:03:03.030> years

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
stuff but they live up to 10 to 12 years

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.680 
stuff but they live up to 10 to 12 years
in<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.750> wild<00:03:04.019> but<00:03:04.579> they<00:03:05.579> can<00:03:05.790> live<00:03:06.000> up<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.150> 15

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
in the wild but they can live up to 15

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.130 
in the wild but they can live up to 15
years<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:07.079> captivity<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:08.840> they<00:03:09.840> breathe

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
years in captivity and they breathe

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.860 
years in captivity and they breathe
through<00:03:10.409> their<00:03:10.799> gills<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.879> they<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.659> breathe

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
through their gills and they can breathe

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.490 
through their gills and they can breathe
through<00:03:12.900> their<00:03:13.290> skin<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.810> think<00:03:16.290> that's

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
through their skin and I think that's

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.620 
through their skin and I think that's
really<00:03:16.709> cool<00:03:16.950> they<00:03:17.639> are<00:03:17.669> carnivores<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.450> they

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
really cool they are carnivores and they

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.319 
really cool they are carnivores and they
eat<00:03:18.840> blood<00:03:19.139> worms<00:03:19.380> small<00:03:20.040> fish<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.340> insect

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
eat blood worms small fish and insect

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.890 
eat blood worms small fish and insect
larvae<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:23.130> they<00:03:23.609> have<00:03:23.760> really<00:03:24.030> bad<00:03:24.150> eyesight

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
larvae and they have really bad eyesight

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.420 
larvae and they have really bad eyesight
so<00:03:25.410> that's<00:03:25.739> why<00:03:25.889> I<00:03:26.250> hand<00:03:27.030> feed<00:03:27.389> him<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.980> he<00:03:29.190> can

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
so that's why I hand feed him so he can

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.300 
so that's why I hand feed him so he can
see<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.329> food<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.690> front<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:30.989> its<00:03:31.109> face<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.859> it

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
see the food in front of its face and it

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.759 
see the food in front of its face and it
prefers<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.329> be<00:03:33.450> fed<00:03:33.629> that<00:03:33.870> way<00:03:34.049> if<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.560> just

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
prefers to be fed that way if you just

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.909 
prefers to be fed that way if you just
leave<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.099> up<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.819> tank<00:03:36.060> or<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:37.650> it'll

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
leave it up in the tank or and it'll

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.250 
leave it up in the tank or and it'll
just<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.579> be<00:03:39.239> kind<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.599> lost<00:03:39.780> it'll<00:03:40.109> take

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
just like be kind of lost it'll take

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.710 
just like be kind of lost it'll take
forever<00:03:40.440> for<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.190> really<00:03:41.760> find<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> food<00:03:42.329> I

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
forever for it to really find the food I

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.909 
forever for it to really find the food I
would<00:03:43.410> put<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> bowl<00:03:44.760> out<00:03:45.209> for<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.019> fish<00:03:46.290> earth

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
would put a bowl out for the fish earth

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.939 
would put a bowl out for the fish earth
the<00:03:47.280> water<00:03:47.459> dog<00:03:47.849> and<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:49.319> would<00:03:49.530> be<00:03:49.680> able<00:03:49.799> to

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949
