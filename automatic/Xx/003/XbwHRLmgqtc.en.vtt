which<00:00:07.440> was<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> PSG<00:00:08.130> badge<00:00:08.340> which<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.910> initially

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
which was a PSG badge which I initially

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.450 
which was a PSG badge which I initially
thought<00:00:09.300> was<00:00:09.540> gonna<00:00:09.630> be<00:00:09.750> very<00:00:09.929> easy<00:00:10.050> and

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
thought was gonna be very easy and

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.440 
thought was gonna be very easy and
didn't<00:00:11.460> realize<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.790> till<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.969> created<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.420> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
didn't realize it till I created it a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.089 
didn't realize it till I created it a
second<00:00:12.900> time<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.080> had<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> bit<00:00:13.769> more<00:00:13.889> time<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
second time and had a bit more time and

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.919 
second time and had a bit more time and
to<00:00:14.250> look<00:00:14.340> into<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.820> made<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.599> much<00:00:15.750> more

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
to look into it and made it much more

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.060 
to look into it and made it much more
better-looking<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.470> as<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.740> see<00:00:16.800> we

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
better-looking so as you can see we

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.830 
better-looking so as you can see we
start<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.430> something<00:00:17.910> called<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.180> circle<00:00:18.600> o<00:00:18.720> 2

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
start with something called a circle o 2

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.349 
start with something called a circle o 2
and<00:00:19.260> that's<00:00:20.220> basically<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.730> circle<00:00:21.000> with<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
and that's basically a circle with the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.550 
and that's basically a circle with the
hollow<00:00:21.539> bow<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> middle<00:00:21.900> then<00:00:22.320> going

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
hollow bow in the middle then going

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.970 
hollow bow in the middle then going
great

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
great

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.340 
great

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
grab that's full air 5 layer 2 we go and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.070 
grab that's full air 5 layer 2 we go and
grab<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:26.160> thing<00:00:26.369> called<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.609> kiss<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.090> it

grab this thing called a kiss and it

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.570 
grab this thing called a kiss and it
sort<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.619> helps<00:00:28.949> us<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> middle<00:00:29.490> bit

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
sort of helps us with the middle bit

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.950 
sort of helps us with the middle bit
cone<00:00:29.880> over<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> layer<00:00:30.300> 3<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:30.810> make<00:00:30.929> it

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
cone over to layer 3 and then make it

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.260 
cone over to layer 3 and then make it
red<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.410> then<00:00:31.859> reduce<00:00:32.189> its<00:00:32.340> size<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
red and then reduce its size on the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.709 
red and then reduce its size on the
freescale<00:00:33.750> or<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.800> use<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.480> fake<00:00:36.480> scale

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
freescale or you can use the fake scale

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
freescale or you can use the fake scale
to<00:00:36.870> complete<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> use<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> free

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to complete up to you but I use the free

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.590 
to complete up to you but I use the free
scale<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.910> little<00:00:39.090> bit<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
scale just to get that little bit of a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.420 
scale just to get that little bit of a
bit<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> top<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> bomb<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
bit at the top of the bomb and the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.340 
bit at the top of the bomb and the
bottom<00:00:42.390> bit<00:00:42.540> being<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> slightly<00:00:42.989> bit<00:00:43.170> thinner

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
bottom bit being a slightly bit thinner

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.110 
bottom bit being a slightly bit thinner
so<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.739> more<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.160> outside<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> white

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
so you get more for outside of the white

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880 
so you get more for outside of the white
there<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.870> getting<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.110> full<00:00:46.500> circle

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
there then going getting a full circle

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
there then going getting a full circle
for<00:00:46.980> there<00:00:47.129> 7<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.530> sort<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.590> trying<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
for there 7 here and sort of trying to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.430 
for there 7 here and sort of trying to
put<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> outline<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.140> press<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
put it into the outline so you press the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.540 
put it into the outline so you press the
start<00:00:52.680> button<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.039> will<00:00:53.129> make<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.250> into<00:00:53.370> an

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
start button and it will make it into an

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.400 
start button and it will make it into an
outline<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.660> cloning<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.079> over

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
outline then going and cloning that over

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.520 
outline then going and cloning that over
putting<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.770> from<00:00:55.980> layer<00:00:56.160> 8<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.530> initially

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
putting it from layer 8 and initially

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.630 
putting it from layer 8 and initially
when<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.710> did<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.160> wouldn't<00:00:59.370> move

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
when I did this then I wouldn't move

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.750 
when I did this then I wouldn't move
layer<00:00:59.879> 7<00:01:00.210> 8<00:01:00.449> -<00:01:00.600> layer<00:01:00.719> 6<00:01:00.989> &amp;<00:01:01.140> 7<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:02.370> reduced

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
layer 7 8 - layer 6 &amp; 7 and then reduced

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.399 
layer 7 8 - layer 6 &amp; 7 and then reduced
its<00:01:02.910> size<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.170> it's

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
its size in so as you can see there it's

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.649 
its size in so as you can see there it's
looking<00:01:04.650> more<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.159> PSG<00:01:05.640> emblem<00:01:06.390> already

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
looking more like the PSG emblem already

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
looking more like the PSG emblem already
and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.560> realized<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.310> middle<00:01:08.820> bit

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and then I realized that my middle bit

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.160 
and then I realized that my middle bit
of<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:09.150> emblem<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.750> kind<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.960> hollow

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
of my emblem is actually kind of hollow

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.219 
of my emblem is actually kind of hollow
so<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.680> had<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:11.700> back<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.060> fill<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> out<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
so I had to go back and fill it out and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
so I had to go back and fill it out and
in<00:01:13.530> order<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.070> I'm<00:01:14.250> gonna<00:01:14.400> go<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:15.509> by<00:01:15.630> 2

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
in order to do that I'm gonna go in by 2

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.140 
in order to do that I'm gonna go in by 2
layer<00:01:15.869> 1<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> rounded<00:01:17.700> square

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
layer 1 here and I got a rounded square

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.240 
layer 1 here and I got a rounded square
you<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:19.020> use<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> circle<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.830> complete<00:01:20.070> up<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you can use a circle it's complete up to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.800 
you can use a circle it's complete up to
you<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.430> make<00:01:20.580> sure<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.850> get<00:01:20.970> your<00:01:21.119> color<00:01:21.570> off

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you but make sure you get your color off

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
know when I did do this the first time I

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.230 
know when I did do this the first time I
can<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.549> colors<00:01:26.820> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.090> messed

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
can to go all the colors kind of messed

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
can to go all the colors kind of messed
up<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:28.110> didn't<00:01:28.439> look<00:01:28.530> very<00:01:28.740> good<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.220> as

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
up so it didn't look very good but as

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.289 
up so it didn't look very good but as
you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.700> here<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> colors

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you can see here I got the colors

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
you can see here I got the colors
correct<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.409> go<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:31.979> it's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
correct and then I go get I think it's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.819 
correct and then I go get I think it's
called<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> half<00:01:32.579> column<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.619> that's<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
called a half column and that's just to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.170 
called a half column and that's just to
cover<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> excess<00:01:35.610> bit<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> bottom

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
cover up the excess bit at the bottom

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.280 
cover up the excess bit at the bottom
you<00:01:36.270> don't<00:01:36.390> want<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.750> standing<00:01:37.170> out

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.160 
you don't want it to be standing out
when<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.009> got<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.549> gun<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:40.049> go

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
you can actually get a half column for

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.260 
you can actually get a half column for
the<00:01:45.750> top<00:01:45.930> bit<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.610> got<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.820> move<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.119> right

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the top bit and you got to move it right

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.080 
the top bit and you got to move it right
to<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> front<00:01:48.930> pretty<00:01:49.320> much<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.790> cover<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> up

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
opponents are come up against because

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.710 
opponents are come up against because
I've<00:02:44.460> actually<00:02:44.550> put<00:02:44.760> em<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.390> gotta<00:02:45.540> include

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
I've actually put em I gotta include

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.710 
I've actually put em I gotta include
that<00:02:45.990> in<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.200> episode<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.740> you'll<00:02:47.160> see<00:02:47.280> how

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
that in the episode and you'll see how

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.900 
that in the episode and you'll see how
crazy<00:02:48.720> their<00:02:49.020> squads<00:02:49.350> are<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.850> hopefully<00:02:50.850> you

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
crazy their squads are but hopefully you

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.090 
crazy their squads are but hopefully you
guys<00:02:51.000> will<00:02:51.060> enjoy<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.590> as<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.710> can<00:02:52.800> see<00:02:52.920> here

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
guys will enjoy that as you can see here

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.140 
guys will enjoy that as you can see here
trying<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.310> figure<00:02:53.460> out<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.730> bits<00:02:53.970> with<00:02:54.090> a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
trying to figure out the bits with a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.790 
trying to figure out the bits with a
circle<00:02:54.510> they're<00:02:54.630> 9<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:54.990> 10<00:02:55.140> are<00:02:55.170> your<00:02:55.380> circles

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
circle they're 9 and 10 are your circles

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.580 
circle they're 9 and 10 are your circles
for<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> mid<00:02:56.220> bond<00:02:56.550> bit<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.590> eventually

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
for a mid bond bit and eventually

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.140 
for a mid bond bit and eventually
figured<00:02:58.830> out<00:02:58.920> if<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.070> get<00:02:59.190> called<00:02:59.730> press<00:02:59.970> D

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
figured out if you get called press D

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.400 
figured out if you get called press D
free<00:03:00.390> scaling<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.900> actually<00:03:00.990> make<00:03:01.230> into

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
free scaling you can actually make into

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.620 
free scaling you can actually make into
an<00:03:01.530> oval<00:03:01.830> clone<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.460> over<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:02.880> layer<00:03:03.060> 10<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
an oval clone it over for layer 10 and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.710 
an oval clone it over for layer 10 and
then<00:03:04.580> make<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.610> blue<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:05.940> slightly<00:03:06.270> shrink<00:03:06.600> it

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
then make it blue and slightly shrink it

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.420 
then make it blue and slightly shrink it
slightly<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.200> get<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.500> two<00:03:08.040> circles<00:03:08.370> in

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
slightly so you get the two circles in

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.680 
slightly so you get the two circles in
the<00:03:08.490> middle<00:03:08.550> then<00:03:08.790> working<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.360> actually

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
the middle then working on actually

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.600 
the middle then working on actually
right<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.960> ps3<00:03:10.350> at<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> top<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:11.070> this<00:03:11.490> is

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
right in the ps3 at the top and this is

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.680 
right in the ps3 at the top and this is
one<00:03:11.790> bit<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:11.970> initially<00:03:12.300> didn't<00:03:12.510> take<00:03:12.600> into

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
one bit I initially didn't take into

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.180 
one bit I initially didn't take into
consideration<00:03:13.200> when<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.440> first<00:03:13.860> made<00:03:14.010> it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
consideration when I first made it

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.250 
consideration when I first made it
because<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.460> didn't<00:03:14.640> take<00:03:14.730> into<00:03:14.940> account<00:03:15.260> all

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
because I didn't take into account all

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.900 
because I didn't take into account all
the<00:03:16.320> actual<00:03:16.950> letters<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.370> are<00:03:17.460> needed<00:03:17.760> and

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the actual letters that are needed and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.940 
the actual letters that are needed and
when<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.750> went<00:03:18.930> back<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.260> made<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.500> then<00:03:19.770> it

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
when I went back and made it then it

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.040 
when I went back and made it then it
sort<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.190> made<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.370> bit<00:03:20.550> more<00:03:20.700> sense<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.540> think

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
sort of made a bit more sense so I think

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.320 
sort of made a bit more sense so I think
we<00:03:22.170> start<00:03:22.560> with<00:03:22.620> layer<00:03:22.890> 11<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.520> that's<00:03:24.090> all

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
we start with layer 11 and that's all

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.280 
we start with layer 11 and that's all
going<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.510> take<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.720> over<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.050> end<00:03:25.170> of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
going to take you over to the end of

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.310 
going to take you over to the end of
this<00:03:25.350> emblem<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:27.510> can<00:03:27.630> see<00:03:27.780> me<00:03:27.930> going<00:03:28.110> on

a minute I've been getting kind of bored
of<00:03:58.080> fee<00:03:58.230> for<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.709> lot<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.370> lot<00:03:59.850> of<00:03:59.940> the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
of fee for just a lot of a lot of the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
of fee for just a lot of a lot of the
same<00:04:00.180> stuff<00:04:00.450> for<00:04:00.600> people<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:00.870> doing

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
same stuff for people just doing

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.380 
same stuff for people just doing
cutbacks<00:04:01.530> just<00:04:01.740> to<00:04:01.830> win<00:04:01.950> those<00:04:02.130> games<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.610> it's

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
cutbacks just to win those games so it's

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.190 
cutbacks just to win those games so it's
just<00:04:03.510> one<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.630> those<00:04:03.720> things<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.020> think<00:04:04.080> that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
just one of those things I think that

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.699 
just one of those things I think that
become<00:04:04.470> part<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.860> FIFA<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:06.709> something

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
become part of a FIFA but it's something

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.750 
become part of a FIFA but it's something
you've<00:04:07.860> got<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.070> learn<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.190> counter<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.700> I've

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
you've got to learn to counter and I've

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.479 
you've got to learn to counter and I've
learned<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.060> way<00:04:09.270> of<00:04:09.390> countering<00:04:09.810> cutbacks<00:04:10.230> so

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
learned a way of countering cutbacks so

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.800 
learned a way of countering cutbacks so
hopefully<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.610> can<00:04:11.730> last<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.150> while<00:04:12.360> before

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
hopefully that can last a while before

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.470 
hopefully that can last a while before
everyone<00:04:13.800> figures<00:04:14.100> out<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.940> technique<00:04:15.300> but

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
everyone figures out the technique but

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.110 
everyone figures out the technique but
I'll<00:04:15.540> show<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.750> guys<00:04:15.930> if<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.169> want<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.919> know

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
finishing off the PSG and then have to

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.300 
finishing off the PSG and then have to
work<00:04:39.790> on<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.090> numbers<00:04:40.480> I<00:04:40.540> do<00:04:40.600> know<00:04:41.310> the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
work on the numbers I do know the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
numbers for this one have found a

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.030 
numbers for this one have found a
correct<00:04:44.050> image<00:04:44.290> originally<00:04:44.680> when<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.830> went

have<00:04:45.160> made<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.550> badge<00:04:45.790> I<00:04:46.390> think<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.110> other

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
have made this badge I think the other

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.470 
have made this badge I think the other
one<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.440> did<00:04:47.800> before<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:48.370> had<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:49.210> wrong

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
one I did before it had the wrong

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.350 
one I did before it had the wrong
numbers<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.460> think<00:04:51.460> someone<00:04:51.700> edited<00:04:51.850> up<00:04:52.210> him

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
numbers and think someone edited up him

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.030 
numbers and think someone edited up him
I<00:04:52.420> know<00:04:52.510> in<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.690> Google<00:04:52.990> didn't<00:04:53.830> go<00:04:53.920> and

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
I know in a Google didn't go and

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.960 
I know in a Google didn't go and
research<00:04:54.250> all<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.430> other<00:04:54.580> ones<00:04:54.730> just<00:04:54.760> when

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
research all the other ones just when

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.880 
research all the other ones just when
did<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.150> quickly<00:04:55.470> read<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.560> can<00:04:56.650> see<00:04:56.740> again

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
did it quickly read you can see again

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.950 
did it quickly read you can see again
the<00:04:57.010> numbers<00:04:57.310> correct<00:04:57.640> on<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:57.820> PSG<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.420> then

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
the numbers correct on the PSG and then

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.780 
the numbers correct on the PSG and then
I've<00:04:59.080> left<00:04:59.380> one<00:04:59.710> layer<00:04:59.920> spare<00:05:00.340> which<00:05:00.520> is<00:05:00.640> for

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
I've left one layer spare which is for

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.890 
I've left one layer spare which is for
the<00:05:00.880> middle<00:05:01.060> bit<00:05:01.360> which<00:05:01.480> I<00:05:01.570> think<00:05:01.750> there's

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
the middle bit which I think there's

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.680 
the middle bit which I think there's
some<00:05:02.080> sort<00:05:02.230> of<00:05:02.290> caught<00:05:02.610> I'm<00:05:03.610> not<00:05:03.970> too<00:05:04.270> sure<00:05:04.480> so

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
some sort of caught I'm not too sure so

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.240 
some sort of caught I'm not too sure so
we're<00:05:04.780> just<00:05:04.810> gonna<00:05:04.960> put<00:05:05.230> that<00:05:05.320> in<00:05:05.470> there<00:05:05.650> so<00:05:06.130> if

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
we're just gonna put that in there so if

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.710 
we're just gonna put that in there so if
