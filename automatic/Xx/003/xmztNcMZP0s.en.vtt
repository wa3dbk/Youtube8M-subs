00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939 

hey<00:00:00.269> it's<00:00:00.510> I<00:00:00.719> don't<00:00:00.840> know<00:00:00.900> what's<00:00:01.079> RCM<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.829> is

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hey it's I don't know what's RCM this is

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.980 
hey it's I don't know what's RCM this is
a<00:00:01.979> new<00:00:02.190> progression<00:00:02.970> video<00:00:03.300> so<00:00:03.689> over<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.959> last

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
a new progression video so over the last

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.050 
a new progression video so over the last
days<00:00:04.500> I've<00:00:04.650> been<00:00:04.680> thinking<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.370> lot<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.879> a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
days I've been thinking a lot about a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.230 
days I've been thinking a lot about a
new<00:00:06.359> way<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.569> Train<00:00:07.429> runecrafting<00:00:08.429> since<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
new way to Train runecrafting since the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.810 
new way to Train runecrafting since the
price<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> Lorentz<00:00:10.110> started<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.769> lower<00:00:11.070> so

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
price of the Lorentz started to lower so

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.180 
price of the Lorentz started to lower so
after<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> lot<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.630> calculation<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.530> testing<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
after a lot of calculation and testing I

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.640 
after a lot of calculation and testing I
found<00:00:14.700> out<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.849> by<00:00:15.269> far<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.020> best<00:00:16.350> way<00:00:16.590> to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
found out that by far the best way to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.269 
found out that by far the best way to
train<00:00:17.220> when<00:00:17.910> crafting<00:00:18.330> now<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.500> my<00:00:19.710> level<00:00:20.010> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
train when crafting now with my level is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.330 
train when crafting now with my level is
to<00:00:20.789> make<00:00:21.119> air<00:00:21.420> routes<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.590> main<00:00:22.890> reason

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
to make air routes and the main reason

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.480 
to make air routes and the main reason
is<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.550> are<00:00:24.029> now<00:00:24.269> level<00:00:24.570> 88<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.890> runecrafting

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
is that are now level 88 in runecrafting

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.290 
is that are now level 88 in runecrafting
so<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.539> means<00:00:27.840> i<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.410> make<00:00:28.619> nine<00:00:29.300> errands

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so this means i can make nine errands

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.650 
so this means i can make nine errands
for<00:00:30.539> every<00:00:31.140> rule<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.740> essence<00:00:32.160> i<00:00:32.369> use<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:33.510> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
for every rule in essence i use like you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.860 
for every rule in essence i use like you
can<00:00:33.840> see<00:00:34.170> right<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:36.030> i<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.149> make<00:00:36.360> nine<00:00:36.660> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
can see right here so i can make nine of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780 
can see right here so i can make nine of
them<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.620> level<00:00:37.950> 19<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.399> couldn't<00:00:38.670> even

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
them and at level 19 I couldn't even

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.479 
them and at level 19 I couldn't even
make<00:00:39.239> ten<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.440> even<00:00:40.620> more<00:00:40.860> perfect<00:00:41.070> so

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
make ten of them so even more perfect so

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.010 
make ten of them so even more perfect so
the<00:00:41.610> great<00:00:41.910> thing<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the great thing is not really the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.709 
the great thing is not really the
experience<00:00:43.920> I've<00:00:44.250> donated<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.820> slightly<00:00:45.180> less

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
experience I've donated it slightly less

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.639 
experience I've donated it slightly less
than<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.170> LA<00:00:46.559> room<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:48.200> 15k<00:00:49.200> experience

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
than the LA room about 15k experience

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.110 
than the LA room about 15k experience
per<00:00:49.800> hour<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> main<00:00:51.090> difference<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
per hour but the main difference is the

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
per hour but the main difference is the
money<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.390> will<00:00:54.510> make<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.440> right<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
money you will make so right now the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.979 
money you will make so right now the
price<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:58.079> errands<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:58.920> 35<00:00:59.910> each<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.809> let's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
price of the errands or 35 each so let's

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.560 
price of the errands or 35 each so let's
just<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> max<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> make<00:01:02.489> nine<00:01:02.940> errands

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
just do the max so I make nine errands

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.080 
just do the max so I make nine errands
each<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.559> are<00:01:04.650> 35<00:01:05.159> each<00:01:05.430> oh<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.850> there

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
each there are 35 each oh right there

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.050 
each there are 35 each oh right there
can<00:01:06.890> clearly<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.400> making<00:01:08.760> more

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
can clearly see that I'm making more

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.450 
can clearly see that I'm making more
than<00:01:09.090> lauren's<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.950> worth<00:01:11.189> more

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
than lauren's because this is worth more

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.070 
than lauren's because this is worth more
than<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> roads<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.210> top<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.810> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
than the roads and on top of that you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.969 
than the roads and on top of that you
need<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> include<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.860> fact<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.460> i'm<00:01:15.210> using

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
need to include the fact that i'm using

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.410 
need to include the fact that i'm using
rune<00:01:16.979> essence<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.640> pure<00:01:17.939> thing<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.270> it's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
rune essence and not pure thing so it's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
rune essence and not pure thing so it's
even<00:01:18.540> more<00:01:19.020> profit<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.850> need<00:01:22.189> per<00:01:23.189> trip

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
even more profit then you need per trip

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
even more profit then you need per trip
I<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.240> make<00:01:26.240> 405<00:01:27.240> rooms<00:01:28.080> per<00:01:28.350> trip<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:30.840> make

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
I can make 405 rooms per trip and I make

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.940 
I can make 405 rooms per trip and I make
approximately<00:01:31.950> 10<00:01:32.490> trips<00:01:33.000> per<00:01:33.150> hour<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.950> then

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
approximately 10 trips per hour and then

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.910 
approximately 10 trips per hour and then
on<00:01:35.159> top<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.090> add<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> 5k<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.650> I'm

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
on top of that I add a 5k because I'm

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.920 
on top of that I add a 5k because I'm
epic<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.970> I'm<00:01:39.119> making<00:01:39.479> about<00:01:40.850> 1.3<00:01:41.850> million<00:01:42.390> gb

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
epic so I'm making about 1.3 million gb

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.770 
epic so I'm making about 1.3 million gb
per<00:01:43.079> hour<00:01:43.320> by<00:01:43.680> making<00:01:44.360> errands<00:01:45.360> which<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
per hour by making errands which is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.770 
per hour by making errands which is
nearly<00:01:46.110> double<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> cash<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.579> make<00:01:47.970> with

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
nearly double the cash I can make with

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.460 
nearly double the cash I can make with
la<00:01:49.590> rooms<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.490> even<00:01:50.850> maybe<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.810> level<00:01:52.110> 99

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
la rooms and it's even maybe at level 99

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.280 
la rooms and it's even maybe at level 99
it<00:01:52.680> will<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.950> even<00:01:53.189> better<00:01:53.759> than<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> double

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it will be even better than the double

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 
it will be even better than the double
nature<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.159> naturally<00:01:56.340> quite<00:01:56.880> sure<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
nature but I'm naturally quite sure the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.499 
nature but I'm naturally quite sure the
prices<00:01:57.719> may<00:01:57.990> change<00:01:58.409> over<00:01:58.710> time<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.520> like

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
prices may change over time but like

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.560 
prices may change over time but like
I've<00:02:00.689> said<00:02:01.490> I'm<00:02:02.490> using<00:02:02.670> ruinous<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.299> instead

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
I've said I'm using ruinous and instead

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.660 
I've said I'm using ruinous and instead
of<00:02:03.689> pure<00:02:03.930> sent<00:02:04.229> mains<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.770> friends<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.399> also

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
of pure sent mains of friends and I also

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.260 
of pure sent mains of friends and I also
don't<00:02:06.299> need<00:02:06.630> any<00:02:06.899> energy<00:02:07.890> potion<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:09.000> only

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
don't need any energy potion the only
