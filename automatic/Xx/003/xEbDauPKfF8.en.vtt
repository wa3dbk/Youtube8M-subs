00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
basically you can tell this wire right

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.680 
basically you can tell this wire right
here<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.030> basically<00:01:03.359> looped

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
here it's got it's basically looped

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.130 
here it's got it's basically looped
together<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.720> lockout<00:01:06.720> plug

together here this is your lockout plug
and<00:01:08.180> controls<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.450> high-speed<00:01:10.140> operation

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
and controls the high-speed operation

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.399 
and controls the high-speed operation
basically<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.330> we'll<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.630> doing<00:01:12.810> from<00:01:13.229> this

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
basically what we'll be doing from this

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
basically what we'll be doing from this
point<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.460> connect<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
point on is I have to connect the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.700 
point on is I have to connect the
positive<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.409> negative<00:01:20.180> wire<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.960> new<00:01:22.320> 6

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710

to one side and the negative to the
other<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.210> have<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> diagram<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:38.000> kind<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
other I have a diagram that kind of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.210 
other I have a diagram that kind of
explains<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> want<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
explains which one because you want to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.940 
explains which one because you want to
be<00:01:41.369> sure<00:01:41.420> when<00:01:42.420> you're<00:01:42.540> modifying<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
be sure when you're modifying this that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.100 
be sure when you're modifying this that
you<00:01:44.130> put<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.729> positive<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> correct<00:01:45.930> side

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you put the positive on the correct side

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.310 
you put the positive on the correct side
and<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> negative<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> correct<00:01:47.850> side<00:01:48.320> you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and the negative on the correct side you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.340 
and the negative on the correct side you
don't<00:01:49.350> want<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.909> these<00:01:51.149> mixed<00:01:51.960> because

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
don't want to have these mixed because

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.520 
don't want to have these mixed because
it<00:01:52.619> could<00:01:52.770> cause<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:54.329> wires<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.930> melt<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
it could cause the wires to melt and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.209 
it could cause the wires to melt and
could<00:01:56.100> even<00:01:56.219> cause<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:57.090> fire<00:01:57.540> or<00:01:58.040> cause<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
could even cause a fire or cause the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.770 
could even cause a fire or cause the
batteries<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.790> explode<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.689> be

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
batteries to explode so you have to be

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.469 
batteries to explode so you have to be
extremely<00:02:00.899> careful<00:02:01.350> when<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
extremely careful when you do this and

first video I'm going to be placing the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.170 
first video I'm going to be placing the
the<00:02:25.520> extra<00:02:25.850> six<00:02:26.210> volt<00:02:26.450> battery<00:02:26.960> in<00:02:27.200> this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
the extra six volt battery in this

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.090 
the extra six volt battery in this
saddle<00:02:29.180> bag<00:02:29.360> here<00:02:29.900> I'll<00:02:30.350> be<00:02:30.410> drilling<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:31.070> hole

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
saddle bag here I'll be drilling a hole

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.450 
saddle bag here I'll be drilling a hole
through<00:02:32.090> here<00:02:32.630> I've<00:02:33.470> already<00:02:33.650> got<00:02:33.950> my<00:02:34.190> wire

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
through here I've already got my wire

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.820 
through here I've already got my wire
that<00:02:35.420> I'm<00:02:35.570> actually<00:02:35.810> going<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.140> run<00:02:36.470> through

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
that I'm actually going to run through

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.270 
that I'm actually going to run through
here<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:39.550> back<00:02:40.550> up<00:02:40.880> in<00:02:41.180> through<00:02:41.630> here<00:02:42.110> up<00:02:42.680> to

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
here and back up in through here up to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.460 
here and back up in through here up to
where<00:02:44.240> I'm<00:02:44.480> going<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.900> tie<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:47.470> lockout

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
where I'm going to tie in to the lockout

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.780 
where I'm going to tie in to the lockout
plug<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.300> I'm<00:02:50.300> also<00:02:50.570> going<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.890> took<00:02:52.100> off<00:02:52.580> of

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
plug and I'm also going to I took off of

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.440 
plug and I'm also going to I took off of
another<00:02:52.910> power<00:02:53.510> wheel<00:02:54.160> basically<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.910> female

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
another power wheel basically the female

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.830 
another power wheel basically the female
connector<00:02:57.200> six<00:02:58.160> volt<00:02:58.400> connector<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.570> actually

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
connector six volt connector so actually

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.120 
connector six volt connector so actually
i'll<00:03:00.470> be<00:03:00.830> wiring<00:03:01.190> this<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:02.210> the<00:03:02.330> main<00:03:02.570> wiring

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
i'll be wiring this to the main wiring

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.040 
i'll be wiring this to the main wiring
so<00:03:04.130> i<00:03:04.160> can<00:03:04.460> kind<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.790> keep<00:03:05.410> mostly<00:03:06.410> original

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
so i can kind of keep mostly original

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.400 
so i can kind of keep mostly original
wiring<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:09.700> connections<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.810> original

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
wiring and connections like the original

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.430 
wiring and connections like the original
power<00:03:12.620> wheels<00:03:12.890> would<00:03:13.100> have<00:03:13.250> had
