system what's special about this is that
it<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.659> operate<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.259> lower<00:01:58.439> temperature

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it can operate at a lower temperature

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.980 
it can operate at a lower temperature
which<00:01:59.460> provides<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.090> much<00:02:00.299> more<00:02:00.540> efficient

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
which provides for much more efficient

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.690 
which provides for much more efficient
charging<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.560> battery<00:02:01.649> now<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.430> notice

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
charging of the battery now you notice

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.370 
charging of the battery now you notice
the<00:02:02.820> controls<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> test

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the controls so this is really a test

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.130 
the controls so this is really a test
