00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.709
 in the volkswagen center rosenheim is much 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.969
 going on and accordingly little space similar 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.709
 it is the many autohouses the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.240
 inner cities go to their customers 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.700
 to provide a good and fast service 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.500
 would like 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.410
 The transport of vehicles can do that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.880
 quickly become a challenge 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.220
 not only in such cases 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.930
 lightning loader of car transporter from 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.120
 all with a sensational 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.710
 concept we have in Rosenheim 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.700
 asked how the lightning load 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.460
 is used and how it works 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.600
 who are their drivers are their own 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.050
 people or different people think that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.200
 often make like one of us with 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.840
 workshop master this technical 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:01:02.190
 can cover the services of customers 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:05.720
 pick up our box about what is so 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.880
 the typical use of this vehicle 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.619
 So it will be the main use 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.399
 to tow vehicles which have remained lying down 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.100
 if you have an emergency service for volkswagen 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.590
 the audi center and there it is 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.460
 starting point in the terminal vehicle 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.069
 tow 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.720
 in the following we use the vehicle 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:34.729
 to the rock and with vehicles and at 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.729
 service or ask 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.390
 for a middleman for us 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.850
 new vehicles 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.130
 what do you appreciate about lightning charge overall 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 I think that it comes from the operation 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.480
 we see yes we have a change 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.220
 at the olympics and they demand 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:05.140
 explain today and above all very much 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:06.180
 Relatively and they only have one vehicle 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.690
 in use 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.670
 the house right and of course mingles 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:21.580
 often a second or even one 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:24.420
 thirds back times but that now 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.900
 the lightning chief especially 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.200
 such a vehicle just because it is 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:36.660
 Easy to use, the car is going on too 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.510
 driving is just great that said now 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.340
 they actually the remote who the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.050
 Remote because it is often like that 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.940
 the car somewhere in a parking bay there 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.340
 is the possibility with the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.239
 Remote control to earn everything 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.989
 Complete group was the winch over 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.540
 the remote so deserve better 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.069
 it does not work 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.630
 the server specialists from Rosenheim 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.019
 are with the services of their vehicle 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.519
 transporters probably completely satisfied 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.410
 for the lightning unfortunately that's good grades 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.090
 from rough practice and a real one 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.519
 recognition for the innovative concept 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.120
 of the upper bavarian vehicle manufacturer 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.120
