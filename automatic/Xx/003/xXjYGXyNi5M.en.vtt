00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
center speaker the previous owners

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.479

other receivers that were more expensive

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.880 
other receivers that were more expensive
didn't<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> hookup<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.350> turntable

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
