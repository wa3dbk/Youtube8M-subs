00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
 The Nissan Sunny. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 I do not know where to start. 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.480
 I mean, there are uglier cars and cars that are harder to drive, but that's the problem. 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.440
 It is their insipid side that characterizes them. 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.310
 This is the worst of all ... This insipid side. 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:28.150
 God presumably gave us celery as the criterion of nothingness and, incredible as it may seem, men have improved this criterion to give ... this Thing. 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.150
 I hesitate to call it an abomination, she does not have enough personality. 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.120
 Do not even try to find her features, she has none. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.460
 Another thing I do not understand. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.150
 The draggers. 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.570
 I mean, yes of course, it has a big engine. 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.980
 It is a turbojet engine and yes, it can go from zero to 320 km / h in 3.8 seconds. 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.070
 But it will be hard to consume less than 235 liters per kilometer. 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.400
 And whenever you want to get in, you have to open it in two. 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.990
 And I do not think there is a reverse. 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.040
 That said, it has a useful feature. 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.430
 So it was funny? 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.830
 So it was funny? 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 Awesome! 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.530
 But remember, we have a theme for tonight's show. 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.880
 Jeremy looked at the little roadsters, the little cars. 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.030
 The easy sensations are second to none. 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.960
 This dragster burned about 100 pounds of gasoline to do that. 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.220
 And that's about the best way to spend 100 pounds!
