00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 good friends of youtube in 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.430
 this video I will teach you how to do 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.049
 these paper airplanes are very easy 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.880
 to do and also when he throws them and 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.160
 they fly back towards you they are 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.690
 having listed to do it alone 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.969
 we will need a sheet of vienna four 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.289
 of all life we will take a 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.039
 sheet that we have by almost we will speak it 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.640
 in half 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.640
 A) Yes 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.849
 when we have this we will open 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.750
 we will go from this side to this other 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.750
 bending like this 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.410
 and we will reopen 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.610
 we will turn it over on paper 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.950
 and now we have to double from this 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.590
 fold that we have made up to this other 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.530
 fold bending over here going through the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.950
 center we will take the sheet and make them 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.010
 thus 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.340
 which is at the center we put together the two 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340
 folds 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.309
 A) Yes 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.719
 and we double 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.710
 if you look at next to the two folds 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.730
 those match then it will be better 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.880
 we open 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.800
 We do the same bending around you 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.880
 we give this one up to this other one from here 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.880
 form 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.030
 the two clients match their two 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.500
 plans are trusting we open 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.560
 but now something similar to 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.930
 this 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.450
 well now we have to put these 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.450
 two tabs inwards do so 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.780
 and this we download 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.250
 now this part of here this piece 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.440
 A) Yes 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.180
 we will climb it up by folding 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.580
 making this fold coincide with 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.180
 this 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.180
 A) Yes 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.240
 so the sheet hits and the top is 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.070
 where the previous super ends 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.610
 here ends this fold because it is the 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.080
 stop 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.080
 we turn it around and do the same 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.170
 and when we have this we go from this 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.790
 tip this from here to here to this 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.790
 point here achieving 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.250
 so it has to stay like this 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.250
 we open and unfold everything 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.180
 Now you will see that here you are left as 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.640
 a square square with the fold that 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.079
 we have done before I recommend that what 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.329
 paint with your fingers because you have to 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.819
 put it in, it will have to be returned 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.950
 to fold everything and put it in or 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.180
 if we take this and little by little with the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.920
 fingers like that we have and we're painting for 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.700
 mark customers 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.700
 I 'm sorry 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.170
 they are framed 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.010
 when we have it, so let's go towards 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.010
 inside we make pressure draw 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.310
 A) Yes 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.319
 and it is already 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.180
 and we have left something similar to this 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.069
 with this inside 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.680
 well then now what we have to do 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.079
 is to unfold everything to there not 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.060
 unfold the figure but this towards 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.730
 outside 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.030
 open the square that we had of this 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.030
 shape 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.510
 A) Yes 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.150
 note that this side does not arrive 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.020
 until this fold is normal it is thus not 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.940
 have to get there 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.669
 when we have this we will give you the 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.400
 return to the paper that we will go from this 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.050
 side to this fold from here this 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.319
 side with this folding fold of this 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.319
 shape 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.979
 and with this same side 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.260
 So we must have been something 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.260
 similar to this 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:02.569
 now we will double with this part with this 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:07.449
 part up like this 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.449
 leaving the part of the square low like this 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.509
 and now we have to double here 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:20.989
 around here wearing this crease that 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.989
 we have here 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.159
 this 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.159
 towards this side 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.879
 that is to say we take this we fold it like this 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:43.120
 making this match this well 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.010
 You see how he stays 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.180
 and with this side we do the same thing 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.180
 we turn around and bend 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.630
 A) Yes 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.660
 and now these tips this here this 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.610
 fold is not here but is 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:06.129
 separated the first one only we doubled it 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.289
 upwards like this 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:12.669
 we speak at the same height as this is 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.679
 you see the same height more or less then no 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:19.110
 we bend up and with this side 

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:19.110
 equal the same height up 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.620
 we deploy 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.150
 and they must have left something 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.449
 similar to this we would have our 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.620
 plane finished very fast very easy and 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.990
 well this has been all here until now 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.000
 tutorial thanks for watching me you know that 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.680
 if you liked it, you can give like 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.150
 tell me what you want to do this 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.699
 figure as it is I liked a lot 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.889
 I did not like anything well like it and it has 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.419
 liked nothing favorites has liked a lot 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.430
 and share so that the channel continues 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:50.800
 growing those things and that has been all 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.800
 thanks for watching me and see you again
