you<00:00:09.929> what's<00:00:10.110> new<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:10.530> 2013<00:00:11.059> we<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.240> four

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
you what's new for 2013 we have four

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.970 
you what's new for 2013 we have four
families<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.170> wheels<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:13.799> we're<00:00:13.950> doing

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
families of wheels and what we're doing

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.160 
families of wheels and what we're doing
is<00:00:14.400> separating<00:00:14.759> everything<00:00:15.179> based<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
is separating everything based on the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.170 
is separating everything based on the
hub<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.680> have<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> spline<00:00:17.310> series<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.060> is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
hub so we have a spline series which is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.510 
hub so we have a spline series which is
our<00:00:18.300> straight<00:00:18.630> pole<00:00:18.840> line<00:00:19.220> we<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.400> our

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
is the lightest rear shock on the market

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.629 
is the lightest rear shock on the market
it's<00:05:47.660> going<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:47.870> retail<00:05:48.320> in<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.530> $700<00:05:49.340> range

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
it's going to retail in the $700 range

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.330 
it's going to retail in the $700 range
so<00:05:50.060> quite<00:05:50.300> pricey<00:05:50.630> but<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:51.650> features<00:05:52.010> of<00:05:52.039> our

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
so quite pricey but the features of our

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.850 
so quite pricey but the features of our
x3<00:05:52.910> 13<00:05:53.360> are<00:05:53.539> we<00:05:53.660> now<00:05:53.810> have<00:05:54.050> three<00:05:54.380> modes<00:05:54.560> we

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
x3 13 are we now have three modes we

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.130 
x3 13 are we now have three modes we
have<00:05:55.010> an<00:05:55.130> open<00:05:55.460> mode<00:05:55.729> we<00:05:56.479> have<00:05:56.510> kind<00:05:56.960> of<00:05:57.020> a

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
have an open mode we have kind of a

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.550 
have an open mode we have kind of a
halfway<00:05:57.860> mode<00:05:58.430> and<00:05:58.729> a<00:05:59.360> we<00:06:00.229> call<00:06:00.380> it<00:06:00.500> the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
halfway mode and a we call it the

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.710 
halfway mode and a we call it the
climbing<00:06:00.979> mode<00:06:01.160> or<00:06:01.520> completely<00:06:02.330> locked<00:06:02.539> out

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
climbing mode or completely locked out

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.760 
climbing mode or completely locked out
we<00:06:03.380> do<00:06:03.530> it<00:06:03.680> in<00:06:03.800> carbon<00:06:04.280> at<00:06:04.700> 145<00:06:05.690> grams<00:06:05.960> and<00:06:06.500> then

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
we do it in carbon at 145 grams and then

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.279 
we do it in carbon at 145 grams and then
we<00:06:06.890> do<00:06:07.039> it<00:06:07.190> on<00:06:07.370> our<00:06:07.400> x3<00:06:08.030> 13<00:06:08.479> available<00:06:09.020> here<00:06:09.200> in

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
we do it on our x3 13 available here in

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.740 
we do it on our x3 13 available here in
white<00:06:09.530> that's<00:06:09.740> just<00:06:10.130> under<00:06:10.370> 200<00:06:10.910> grams<00:06:11.150> so

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
white that's just under 200 grams so

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.020 
white that's just under 200 grams so
you're<00:06:11.900> saving<00:06:12.229> about<00:06:12.320> 50<00:06:12.740> grams<00:06:12.950> or<00:06:13.190> so<00:06:13.220> when

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
you're saving about 50 grams or so when

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.100 
you're saving about 50 grams or so when
you're<00:06:14.180> moving<00:06:14.300> to<00:06:14.600> the<00:06:14.630> carbon<00:06:15.080> versus<00:06:15.470> the<00:06:15.650> X

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
you're moving to the carbon versus the X

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.080 
you're moving to the carbon versus the X
and<00:06:17.470> that's<00:06:17.650> what's<00:06:17.889> new<00:06:18.069> for<00:06:18.280> DT<00:06:18.610> Swiss<00:06:18.849> for

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
and that's what's new for DT Swiss for

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.689 
and that's what's new for DT Swiss for
2015
