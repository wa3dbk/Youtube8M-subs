how to apply a hair relaxer for all
intensive<00:00:05.430> purposes<00:00:05.580> we're<00:00:06.180> going<00:00:06.299> to

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
intensive purposes we're going to

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.789 
intensive purposes we're going to
pretend<00:00:06.629> like<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:06.960> mannequin<00:00:07.440> has<00:00:07.589> never

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
pretend like this mannequin has never

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.970 
pretend like this mannequin has never
had<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> relaxer<00:00:08.519> before<00:00:08.990> so<00:00:09.990> first<00:00:10.380> we're

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
had a relaxer before so first we're

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.430 
had a relaxer before so first we're
going<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.250> apply<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.880> base<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.540> base<00:00:13.170> is

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
going to apply a base a base is

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.730 
going to apply a base a base is
basically<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.179> petroleum-based<00:00:15.230> product<00:00:16.230> that

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
basically a petroleum-based product that

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.800 
basically a petroleum-based product that
you<00:00:16.830> apply<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.789> hairline<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
you apply to the hairline and to the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.710 
you apply to the hairline and to the
scalp<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.890> protects<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:21.570> skin<00:00:21.930> from

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
scalp and that protects the skin from

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.310 
scalp and that protects the skin from
any<00:00:24.769> burning<00:00:25.769> from<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> chemical<00:00:27.320> we're

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
any burning from the chemical we're

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.310 
any burning from the chemical we're
using<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.710> sodium<00:00:29.099> based<00:00:29.189> relaxer<00:00:29.939> today<00:00:30.320> there

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
using a sodium based relaxer today there

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.840 
using a sodium based relaxer today there
is<00:00:31.500> another<00:00:31.650> kind<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.550> don't<00:00:32.759> really

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
is another kind that you don't really

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.670 
is another kind that you don't really
need<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> base<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> think<00:00:34.530> that's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
need a base with and I think that's

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.000 
need a base with and I think that's
called<00:00:34.890> guanidine<00:00:35.460> based<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.710> then<00:00:37.710> of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
called guanidine based and then of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.910 
called guanidine based and then of
course<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.489> traditional<00:00:39.360> ammonium

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
course the traditional ammonium

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:52.910 
course the traditional ammonium
thiosulfate<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.079> apply<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
thiosulfate and you do apply it all the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.619 
thiosulfate and you do apply it all the
way<00:00:53.010> through<00:00:53.370> each<00:00:53.699> section<00:00:54.059> without<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
way through each section without a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.160 
way through each section without a
quarter<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> an<00:00:55.289> inch<00:00:56.090> sections<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.870> apply<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
quarter of an inch sections you apply it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.990 
quarter of an inch sections you apply it
to<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> scalp<00:01:01.520> keep<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
to the scalp keep going like that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.100 
to the scalp keep going like that
through<00:01:03.390> all<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> sections<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.110> this

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
through all the sections and then this

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.970 
through all the sections and then this
is<00:01:07.260> when<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> apply<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:08.100> relaxer

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.790 

first<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.970> always<00:01:15.480> like<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.660> apply<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> relaxer

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
first I always like to apply the relaxer

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.070 
first I always like to apply the relaxer
first<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.280> areas<00:01:17.670> where<00:01:18.120> it<00:01:18.480> tends<00:01:18.870> to<00:01:18.990> be

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
first to the areas where it tends to be

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200 
first to the areas where it tends to be
the<00:01:19.260> curliest<00:01:19.710> except<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> hairline<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the curliest except the hairline the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.210 
the curliest except the hairline the
hairline<00:01:21.330> around<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> front<00:01:22.590> since<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.010> tends

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
hairline around the front since it tends

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.500 
hairline around the front since it tends
to<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> weakest<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.970> always<00:01:24.120> leave<00:01:24.300> that

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
to be the weakest I always leave that

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.550 
to be the weakest I always leave that
out<00:01:24.690> first<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:30.900> using<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.260> flat
