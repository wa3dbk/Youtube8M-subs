swell still lives and I don't think

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.269 
swell still lives and I don't think
luffy<00:00:25.690> would<00:00:25.869> it<00:00:25.960> because<00:00:26.380> he<00:00:26.560> never<00:00:26.740> intent

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
luffy would it because he never intent

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.130 
luffy would it because he never intent
on<00:00:27.490> eating<00:00:27.520> it<00:00:27.970> in<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.240> first<00:00:28.539> place<00:00:28.660> and

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
on eating it in the first place and

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.050 
on eating it in the first place and
wanted<00:00:29.650> to<00:00:29.680> give<00:00:30.010> to<00:00:30.190> one<00:00:30.340> of<00:00:30.520> his<00:00:30.609> crewmates

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
wanted to give to one of his crewmates

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.209 
wanted to give to one of his crewmates
dot<00:00:31.390> but<00:00:31.750> with<00:00:31.960> a<00:00:31.990> fight<00:00:32.349> with<00:00:32.590> burgers<00:00:33.070> I

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
dot but with a fight with burgers I

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.809 
dot but with a fight with burgers I
think<00:00:33.579> Sabo<00:00:34.530> could<00:00:35.530> be<00:00:35.710> very<00:00:35.949> hard<00:00:36.280> on<00:00:36.550> him

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:36.819 
think Sabo could be very hard on him

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:38.430 
think Sabo could be very hard on him
even<00:00:36.999> thought<00:00:37.449> I<00:00:37.479> would<00:00:37.839> says<00:00:38.109> that<00:00:38.350> he

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
even thought I would says that he

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.849 
even thought I would says that he
stronger<00:00:39.249> than<00:00:39.429> Luffy<00:00:39.850> so<00:00:40.690> I<00:00:40.719> think<00:00:41.199> some<00:00:41.530> kind

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
stronger than Luffy so I think some kind

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.950 
stronger than Luffy so I think some kind
of<00:00:41.979> event<00:00:42.129> would<00:00:42.579> allow<00:00:42.909> Bartolomeo<00:00:43.809> to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
of event would allow Bartolomeo to

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.229 
of event would allow Bartolomeo to
snatch<00:00:44.469> it<00:00:44.499> and<00:00:44.889> give<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.129> Luffy<00:00:45.670> dot<00:00:45.909> once

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
snatch it and give it Luffy dot once

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.259 
snatch it and give it Luffy dot once
Luffy<00:00:46.809> has<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.109> he<00:00:47.289> will<00:00:47.440> give<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:47.769> Sabo<00:00:48.429> did

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269
