00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
probably not unique I don't think they

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.119 
probably not unique I don't think they
are<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:55.020> I've<00:00:55.140> seen<00:00:55.320> those<00:00:55.469> before<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:55.920> I

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
are I think I've seen those before but I

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.290 
are I think I've seen those before but I
can't<00:00:56.430> remember<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.820> sure

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
can't remember for sure

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.180

then<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> Cape<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> unique<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:58.980> good

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
then the Cape is unique so that's good

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.520 
then the Cape is unique so that's good
but<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.460> pretty<00:00:59.609> stiff<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.870> don't<00:01:01.050> expect<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
but it's pretty stiff so don't expect to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.950 
but it's pretty stiff so don't expect to
move<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.100> too<00:01:02.280> much<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.489> posing<00:01:02.910> his<00:01:03.719> head

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
move that too much for posing his head

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.289 
move that too much for posing his head

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
whatever those are it's not great but

whatever those are it's not great but
it's<00:02:02.880> definitely<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.270> bad<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.899> then<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.089 
and the red hand shading throughout the
body<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:09.840> not<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.959> bad<00:02:10.170> figure<00:02:10.500> at<00:02:10.619> all<00:02:10.739> as

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
body so it's not a bad figure at all as

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.360

far<00:02:11.129> as<00:02:11.310> articulation<00:02:12.000> goes<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.390> head<00:02:12.569> can

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
far as articulation goes the head can

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.630 
far as articulation goes the head can
up<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.700> down<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:13.909> little<00:02:14.239> bit<00:02:14.510> side-to-side

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
up and down a little bit side-to-side

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.589 
up and down a little bit side-to-side
rotation<00:02:16.640> pretty<00:02:16.940> much<00:02:17.090> whatever<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.480> need

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599

to<00:02:17.720> do<00:02:17.950> shoulders<00:02:18.950> have<00:02:19.370> really<00:02:19.790> big<00:02:20.150> lumps

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
to do shoulders have really big lumps

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.479 
to do shoulders have really big lumps
here<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.260> think<00:02:21.319> that's<00:02:21.650> new<00:02:22.010> for<00:02:22.280> him<00:02:22.400> I

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
here and I think that's new for him I

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.009 
here and I think that's new for him I
think<00:02:22.519> they<00:02:22.879> made<00:02:23.060> unique<00:02:23.360> shoulders<00:02:23.840> to

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
think they made unique shoulders to

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.559 
think they made unique shoulders to
broaden<00:02:24.319> his<00:02:24.670> stance<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.909> has<00:02:26.090> brought<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.480> his

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
broaden his stance it has brought in his

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.649 
broaden his stance it has brought in his
stance<00:02:26.900> broaden<00:02:27.470> his<00:02:28.420> enough<00:02:29.420> shoulders

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
stance broaden his enough shoulders

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.780 
stance broaden his enough shoulders
whatever<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:31.069> know<00:02:31.220> what<00:02:31.310> I'm<00:02:31.400> saying<00:02:31.640> that's

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
whatever you know what I'm saying that's

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.220 
whatever you know what I'm saying that's
pointing<00:02:32.239> up<00:02:32.329> here<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.659> it's<00:02:32.750> not<00:02:32.870> normally

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
pointing up here and it's not normally

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.750 
pointing up here and it's not normally
pointy<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.040> does<00:02:34.190> get<00:02:34.370> in<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.489> way<00:02:34.549> of

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
pointy so that does get in the way of

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.160 
pointy so that does get in the way of
articulation<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> little<00:02:35.720> bit<00:02:35.870> but<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.140> can

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
articulation a little bit but you can

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.850 
articulation a little bit but you can
still<00:02:36.470> make<00:02:36.650> him<00:02:36.769> fly<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:38.150> fine<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.739> that's

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
still make him fly just fine so that's

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.069 
still make him fly just fine so that's
okay<00:02:40.250> bicep<00:02:40.730> swivel<00:02:41.150> elbow<00:02:41.629> hinge

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
okay bicep swivel elbow hinge

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.960 
okay bicep swivel elbow hinge
he's<00:02:42.530> got<00:02:42.709> fists<00:02:43.069> for<00:02:43.280> both<00:02:43.459> hands<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:43.909> they

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
he's got fists for both hands and they

both<00:02:44.120> swivel<00:02:44.599> ab<00:02:44.900> crunch<00:02:45.470> works<00:02:45.769> okay<00:02:46.400> but

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
both swivel ab crunch works okay but

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.130 
both swivel ab crunch works okay but
they<00:02:46.910> didn't<00:02:47.180> connect<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.540> lightning<00:02:47.930> bolt

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
they didn't connect the lightning bolt

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
they didn't connect the lightning bolt

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160

imagine<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.410> probably<00:03:18.470> want<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.859> get<00:03:18.980> a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
imagine you probably want to get a

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.890 
imagine you probably want to get a
classic<00:03:19.489> Shazam<00:03:20.269> figure<00:03:20.690> if<00:03:20.780> you're

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
classic Shazam figure if you're

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.729 
classic Shazam figure if you're
collecting<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:22.690> dc-dc<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.810> see<00:03:23.989> figures<00:03:24.410> or

Captain<00:03:25.190> Marvel<00:03:25.639> I<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.940> guess<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.299> should<00:03:26.450> have

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
Captain Marvel I I guess I should have

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.449 
Captain Marvel I I guess I should have
called<00:03:26.720> him<00:03:26.870> Captain<00:03:27.230> Marvel<00:03:27.650> instead<00:03:28.340> of

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
called him Captain Marvel instead of

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.610 
called him Captain Marvel instead of
Shazam<00:03:28.669> but<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.299> believe<00:03:29.870> on<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.139> packaging

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620

Shazam but I believe on the packaging
he's<00:03:30.769> called<00:03:31.040> Shazam<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:31.700> we'll<00:03:31.819> go<00:03:31.940> with<00:03:32.090> that
