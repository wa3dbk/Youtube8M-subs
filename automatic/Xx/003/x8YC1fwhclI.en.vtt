00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
week I ate a lot of bread
a<00:01:58.469> lot<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.100> eggs<00:01:59.460> for<00:01:59.820> breakfast<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.570> was

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
a lot of eggs for breakfast and that was

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.580 
a lot of eggs for breakfast and that was
pretty<00:02:00.929> much<00:02:01.409> my<00:02:01.679> diet<00:02:01.950> while<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.969> away<00:02:03.590> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
pretty much my diet while I was away and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.319 
pretty much my diet while I was away and
that<00:02:04.799> might<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.159> affected<00:02:05.460> how<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.030> was

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.320 
that might have affected how I was
feeling<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.960> well<00:02:07.789> but<00:02:08.789> needless<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> say

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
feeling as well but needless to say

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.930 
feeling as well but needless to say
