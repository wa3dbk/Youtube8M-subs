hey<00:00:01.530> guys<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.010> mark<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.639> um<00:00:03.440> let's<00:00:04.440> test

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
hey guys this is mark and um let's test

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.089 
hey guys this is mark and um let's test
if<00:00:05.420> overclock<00:00:06.420> widget<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:07.049> able<00:00:07.799> to

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
if overclock widget is able to

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.770 
if overclock widget is able to
underclock<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.820> processor<00:00:09.300> when<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.599> phone

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
underclock the processor when the phone

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.799 
underclock the processor when the phone
is<00:00:09.809> asleep<00:00:10.700> so<00:00:11.700> right<00:00:12.090> now<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.300> already<00:00:12.660> know

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
is asleep so right now we already know

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.709 
is asleep so right now we already know
that<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.380> HTC<00:00:13.889> evo<00:00:14.250> does<00:00:14.940> not<00:00:15.120> allow<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.540> to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
that the HTC evo does not allow you to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.420 
that the HTC evo does not allow you to
overclock<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:17.630> CPU<00:00:18.630> there's<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.529> block<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
overclock the CPU there's a block in the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.750 
overclock the CPU there's a block in the
kernel<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.830> no<00:00:22.830> matter<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.250> do<00:00:23.490> it

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
kernel and no matter what you do it

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.460 
kernel and no matter what you do it
won't<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.449> anything<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.930> right<00:00:25.080> now<00:00:25.109> I'm

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
won't do anything so right now I'm

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.250 
won't do anything so right now I'm
having<00:00:25.710> set<00:00:26.250> cpu<00:00:26.460> set<00:00:27.180> max<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.990> way<00:00:28.080> down

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
having set cpu set max all the way down

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.349 
having set cpu set max all the way down
to<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.439> bottom<00:00:28.699> if<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.760> keep<00:00:30.029> refreshing

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to the bottom if you keep refreshing

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.650 
to the bottom if you keep refreshing
take<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> look<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.410> number<00:00:32.120> it<00:00:33.120> does<00:00:33.540> not

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
take a look at this number it does not

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.590 
take a look at this number it does not
follow<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.739> rules<00:00:34.980> set<00:00:35.219> by<00:00:35.280> set<00:00:35.489> cpu<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.969> let's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
follow the rules set by set cpu so let's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.090 
follow the rules set by set cpu so let's
try<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> benchmark<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
try to benchmark this there is a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.410 
try to benchmark this there is a
benchmarking<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:42.050> in<00:00:43.050> system<00:00:43.440> info<00:00:44.390> go<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
benchmarking to do in system info go to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
benchmarking to do in system info go to
long<00:00:45.690> bench<00:00:45.989> it'll<00:00:46.739> take<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> while<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.829> around

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
long bench it'll take a while so around

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.900 
long bench it'll take a while so around
1000<00:00:50.460> let's<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> couple<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.539> times

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.689 

1036<00:00:59.329> 997<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.660> pretty<00:01:00.960> much<00:01:01.109> 1000<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.010> what

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
1036 997 so pretty much 1000 so what

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.359 
1036 997 so pretty much 1000 so what
happens<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.210> press<00:01:03.750> long<00:01:04.260> bench<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.890> then

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
happens we press long bench and then

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
happens we press long bench and then
turn<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> screen<00:01:06.540> off<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.229> what

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
turn the screen off that see what

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:17.390 
turn the screen off that see what
happens<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> should<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.619> done<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:16.400> 2735

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
happens so should be done by now 2735

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.210 
happens so should be done by now 2735
milliseconds<00:01:18.060> ok<00:01:22.189> should<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.310> done

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.160 

1000<00:01:27.220> milliseconds

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.719 

and<00:01:35.210> 1000<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.530> 333<00:01:37.530> milliseconds<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and 1000 and 333 milliseconds so it

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.350 
and 1000 and 333 milliseconds so it
looks<00:01:38.880> like<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.180> phone<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.630> automatically<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
looks like the phone is automatically a

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.130 
looks like the phone is automatically a
stepping<00:01:42.360> down<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.659> CPU<00:01:43.080> in<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:44.070> cases<00:01:45.140> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
stepping down the CPU in some cases and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.499 
stepping down the CPU in some cases and
in<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.710> cases<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.610> running<00:01:48.420> at

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
in some cases it's not it's running at

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.050 
in some cases it's not it's running at
1000<00:01:49.290> sometimes<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.460> even<00:01:50.700> went<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:50.940> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
1000 sometimes and it even went up to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.260 
1000 sometimes and it even went up to
2000<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.280> slower<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
2000 I think so this is the slower the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.399 
2000 I think so this is the slower the
lower<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.690> number<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> faster<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> CPU

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
lower the number the faster of the CPU

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.620 
lower the number the faster of the CPU
so<00:01:58.409> now<00:01:58.860> let's<00:01:59.310> try<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.580> install<00:01:59.939> overclock

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so now let's try to install overclock

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.789 
so now let's try to install overclock
widget<00:02:00.659> or<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:03.479> clock<00:02:03.689> widgets<00:02:04.080> get<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.680> on

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
widget or a clock widgets get that on

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.070 
widget or a clock widgets get that on
there

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.880 

do

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.340 

installing<00:02:21.800> still<00:02:22.800> installing<00:02:24.440> okay

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
installing still installing okay

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.040 
installing still installing okay
overclock<00:02:28.350> widget<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:29.040> here<00:02:29.600> let's<00:02:30.600> add<00:02:30.780> it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
overclock widget is on here let's add it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.390 
overclock widget is on here let's add it
to<00:02:31.200> our<00:02:31.230> home<00:02:31.590> screen

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.820 

there<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.360> whoops

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.860 

it<00:02:45.280> needs<00:02:45.610> root<00:02:45.820> permissions<00:02:46.300> let's<00:02:46.600> give<00:02:46.840> it

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
it needs root permissions let's give it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.780 
it needs root permissions let's give it
rip<00:02:47.080> your<00:02:47.260> mission<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:47.770> right<00:02:48.010> now<00:02:50.790> let's

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
rip your mission so right now let's

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.140 
rip your mission so right now let's
follow<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.690> guide<00:02:52.960> that<00:02:53.470> um<00:02:53.770> we<00:02:54.700> saw<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.060> the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
follow the guide that um we saw on the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.440 
follow the guide that um we saw on the
forums<00:02:55.510> I'll<00:02:56.080> post<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.560> link<00:02:56.590> down<00:02:57.130> below<00:02:57.450> but

forums I'll post a link down below but

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.970 
forums I'll post a link down below but
basically<00:03:00.780> set<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.930> max<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.560> little<00:03:02.800> higher

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
basically set the max a little higher

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.100 
basically set the max a little higher
when<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.490> screen<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:04.030> say<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.540> differ

blah<00:03:18.340> let's<00:03:18.700> do<00:03:18.850> safe<00:03:19.920> so<00:03:20.920> right<00:03:21.130> now<00:03:21.420> some

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
blah let's do safe so right now some

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.650 
blah let's do safe so right now some
people<00:03:22.570> are<00:03:22.810> saying<00:03:23.459> when<00:03:24.459> we<00:03:24.700> shut<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.450> phone

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
people are saying when we shut the phone

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.920 
people are saying when we shut the phone
down<00:03:25.950> overclock<00:03:26.950> widget<00:03:26.980> will<00:03:27.850> somehow<00:03:28.180> force

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
down overclock widget will somehow force

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.750 
down overclock widget will somehow force
the<00:03:29.110> CPU<00:03:29.530> down<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:30.670> around<00:03:31.330> 200<00:03:31.810> megahertz<00:03:32.350> and

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
the CPU down to around 200 megahertz and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.960 
the CPU down to around 200 megahertz and
we've<00:03:33.760> already<00:03:33.940> seen<00:03:34.240> that<00:03:35.550> when<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:36.640> when<00:03:36.880> the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
we've already seen that when it when the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.060 
we've already seen that when it when the
phones<00:03:37.180> awake<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.959> CPU<00:03:38.560> can't<00:03:38.890> be

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
phones awake the CPU can't be

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.699 
phones awake the CPU can't be
underclocked<00:03:39.700> but<00:03:40.630> some<00:03:40.930> are<00:03:41.050> claiming<00:03:41.320> that

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
underclocked but some are claiming that

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.330 
underclocked but some are claiming that
when<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.250> seat<00:03:42.459> when<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.760> screens<00:03:43.180> asleep

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
when the seat when the screens asleep

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.780 
when the seat when the screens asleep
for<00:03:45.340> some<00:03:45.520> reason<00:03:45.820> it<00:03:46.000> will<00:03:46.330> be<00:03:46.510> underclocked

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
for some reason it will be underclocked

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.640 
for some reason it will be underclocked
so<00:03:49.769> let's<00:03:50.769> try<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.280> long<00:03:51.700> bench<00:03:52.470> when<00:03:53.470> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
so let's try a long bench when the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:17.340 
so let's try a long bench when the
screen<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:53.890> awake<00:03:58.260> 1300<00:04:02.760> 1100<00:04:10.050> 1996<00:04:13.380> 400<00:04:16.350> okay

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
screen is awake 1300 1100 1996 400 okay

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.020 
screen is awake 1300 1100 1996 400 okay
so<00:04:17.620> we<00:04:17.890> can<00:04:18.040> see<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.430> when<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.730> screens

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
so we can see that when the screens

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.080 
so we can see that when the screens
awake<00:04:19.980> it's<00:04:20.980> not<00:04:21.130> really<00:04:21.250> doing<00:04:21.489> much<00:04:21.580> and<00:04:21.940> we

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
awake it's not really doing much and we

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.659 
awake it's not really doing much and we
didn't<00:04:22.330> expect<00:04:22.540> it<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.810> do<00:04:22.900> much<00:04:23.080> because<00:04:23.320> we

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
didn't expect it to do much because we

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.140 
didn't expect it to do much because we
didn't<00:04:24.669> tell<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:25.090> underclock<00:04:25.660> not<00:04:25.930> much

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
didn't tell it to underclock not much

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.360 
didn't tell it to underclock not much
but<00:04:28.150> now<00:04:28.410> when<00:04:29.410> we<00:04:29.440> do<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.770> benchmark<00:04:30.220> and

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
but now when we do the benchmark and

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.480 
but now when we do the benchmark and
when<00:04:30.490> we<00:04:30.550> close<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.000> screen<00:04:31.830> if<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:32.890> still

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
when we close the screen if you still

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:41.480 
when we close the screen if you still
should<00:04:34.000> get<00:04:34.210> around<00:04:34.540> 1000<00:04:37.710> should<00:04:38.710> be<00:04:38.800> done

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.589 

962<00:04:43.349> on<00:04:44.349> bitch<00:04:44.639> some<00:04:45.639> are<00:04:45.759> claiming<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.360> when

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
962 on bitch some are claiming that when

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.990 
962 on bitch some are claiming that when
you<00:04:46.720> close<00:04:47.319> the<00:04:47.470> screen<00:04:47.970> overclock<00:04:48.970> widget

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
you close the screen overclock widget

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.270 
you close the screen overclock widget
somehow<00:04:49.979> manages<00:04:50.979> to<00:04:50.979> underclock<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.729> CPU

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
somehow manages to underclock the CPU

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.010 
somehow manages to underclock the CPU
unexplainable<00:04:54.280> but<00:04:54.759> as<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.719> can<00:04:55.810> see<00:04:55.990> right

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
unexplainable but as you can see right

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.409 
unexplainable but as you can see right
now<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:56.979> definitely<00:04:57.189> not<00:04:57.789> underclocking

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
now it is definitely not underclocking

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.189 
now it is definitely not underclocking
the<00:04:58.780> cpu<00:04:59.229> when<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.039> phone<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.280> asleep<00:05:01.199> let's

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
the cpu when the phone is asleep let's

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:13.950 
the cpu when the phone is asleep let's
try<00:05:02.379> it<00:05:02.439> some<00:05:02.620> more<00:05:10.439> 972<00:05:12.240> so<00:05:13.240> right<00:05:13.750> now<00:05:13.780> the

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
try it some more 972 so right now the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.770 
try it some more 972 so right now the
phone<00:05:14.319> is<00:05:14.349> actually<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:15.039> bit<00:05:15.580> faster<00:05:16.210> when<00:05:16.750> the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
phone is actually a bit faster when the

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.520 
phone is actually a bit faster when the
screen<00:05:17.080> is<00:05:17.110> asleep<00:05:17.469> and<00:05:17.889> it<00:05:18.039> is<00:05:18.190> usually<00:05:18.610> I

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
screen is asleep and it is usually I

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.189 
screen is asleep and it is usually I
can't<00:05:20.530> really<00:05:20.740> explain<00:05:20.979> that<00:05:21.190> it's<00:05:22.199> obviously

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
can't really explain that it's obviously

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.670 
can't really explain that it's obviously
fluctuating<00:05:23.979> but<00:05:24.219> I<00:05:24.780> think<00:05:25.780> this<00:05:26.139> shows<00:05:26.500> it

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
fluctuating but I think this shows it

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.459 
fluctuating but I think this shows it
very<00:05:27.009> clearly<00:05:27.340> that<00:05:27.599> overclock<00:05:28.599> widget<00:05:28.629> does

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
very clearly that overclock widget does

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.399 
very clearly that overclock widget does
not<00:05:30.099> affect<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.180> phone<00:05:31.360> at<00:05:31.629> all<00:05:31.810> right<00:05:32.259> now

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
not affect the phone at all right now

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.980 
not affect the phone at all right now
until<00:05:33.310> we<00:05:33.490> get<00:05:33.639> a<00:05:33.669> kernel<00:05:34.000> patch<00:05:34.150> out<00:05:34.389> that

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
until we get a kernel patch out that

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.709 
until we get a kernel patch out that
allows<00:05:35.199> you<00:05:35.409> to<00:05:35.440> underclock<00:05:35.919> or<00:05:36.190> overclock

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
allows you to underclock or overclock

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.860 
allows you to underclock or overclock
that's<00:05:37.719> 947<00:05:39.060> alright<00:05:40.060> let's<00:05:40.240> do<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.360> final<00:05:40.599> one

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
that's 947 alright let's do a final one

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:48.869 
that's 947 alright let's do a final one
before<00:05:41.289> we<00:05:41.349> go<00:05:46.650> 956<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.979> I<00:05:48.219> guess<00:05:48.520> just<00:05:48.699> for

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:48.879 
before we go 956 and I guess just for

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:50.550 
before we go 956 and I guess just for
control<00:05:49.330> let's<00:05:49.599> just<00:05:49.750> do<00:05:49.900> one<00:05:50.110> with<00:05:50.440> the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
control let's just do one with the

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.839 
control let's just do one with the
screen<00:05:50.800> on<00:05:54.449> 1166<00:05:55.449> so<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:56.259> phone<00:05:56.500> is<00:05:56.529> actually

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
screen on 1166 so the phone is actually

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.689 
screen on 1166 so the phone is actually
slower<00:05:57.849> with<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.240> screen<00:05:58.659> on<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.699> faster

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
slower with the screen on and faster

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.570 
slower with the screen on and faster
when<00:06:00.969> the<00:06:01.000> screens<00:06:01.360> off<00:06:02.490> yeah<00:06:03.490> I<00:06:03.909> don't<00:06:04.599> think

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
when the screens off yeah I don't think

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.969 
when the screens off yeah I don't think
no<00:06:06.580> this<00:06:07.270> is<00:06:09.719> yeah<00:06:10.719> so<00:06:10.900> to<00:06:10.960> me<00:06:11.229> this<00:06:11.500> definitely

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
no this is yeah so to me this definitely

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.240 
no this is yeah so to me this definitely
proves<00:06:12.339> that<00:06:12.490> overclock<00:06:13.120> widget<00:06:13.560> does<00:06:14.560> not<00:06:14.740> do

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
proves that overclock widget does not do

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.110 
proves that overclock widget does not do
a<00:06:15.279> single<00:06:15.400> thing<00:06:15.759> when<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.300> phone<00:06:16.449> is<00:06:16.479> asleep

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
a single thing when the phone is asleep

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.589 
a single thing when the phone is asleep
if<00:06:19.120> you<00:06:19.990> find<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.889> results<00:06:21.310> ambiguous<00:06:21.909> let<00:06:22.479> me

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
if you find the results ambiguous let me

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.980 
if you find the results ambiguous let me
know<00:06:22.750> and<00:06:23.020> I<00:06:23.169> will<00:06:23.199> do<00:06:23.500> a<00:06:23.529> more<00:06:23.860> stringent<00:06:24.279> test

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
know and I will do a more stringent test

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.110 
know and I will do a more stringent test

settings you can see max is on five to

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.240 
settings you can see max is on five to
eight<00:06:33.129> hundred<00:06:34.409> but<00:06:35.409> max<00:06:35.650> when<00:06:35.860> the<00:06:35.949> screen<00:06:36.219> is

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
eight hundred but max when the screen is

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.870
