recently I've had numerous requests for
yoga<00:00:17.520> for<00:00:17.699> sinus<00:00:18.270> drainage<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.289> you'll<00:00:19.560> go

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
yoga for sinus drainage and you'll go

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
yoga for sinus drainage and you'll go
for<00:00:19.800> allergies<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.910> yoga<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.480> boost<00:00:21.750> your

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
for allergies and yoga to boost your

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.189 
for allergies and yoga to boost your
immune<00:00:21.960> system<00:00:22.400> and<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.240> all<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.630> these<00:00:24.930> things

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
immune system and so all of these things

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.990 
immune system and so all of these things
tie<00:00:25.529> together<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.400> thought<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.730> would<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
tie together and I thought it would be a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.400 
tie together and I thought it would be a
great<00:00:27.420> idea

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
great idea

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.429
