what what you expect to find on a
downhill<00:00:23.540> bike<00:00:23.980> this<00:00:24.980> bike<00:00:25.220> here<00:00:25.610> as<00:00:26.360> you<00:00:26.509> can

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
downhill bike this bike here as you can

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.950 
downhill bike this bike here as you can
see<00:00:26.720> it<00:00:27.050> has<00:00:27.079> a<00:00:27.439> triple<00:00:28.279> clamp<00:00:28.610> for<00:00:28.960> this

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
see it has a triple clamp for this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.889 
see it has a triple clamp for this
allows<00:00:30.680> for<00:00:30.710> eight<00:00:31.160> inches<00:00:31.489> of<00:00:31.550> travel<00:00:31.899> so

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
allows for eight inches of travel so

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.049 
allows for eight inches of travel so
it'll<00:00:33.110> get<00:00:33.260> you<00:00:33.410> over<00:00:33.559> almost<00:00:34.340> anything

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
you'll find out on the trail in the back

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.430 
you'll find out on the trail in the back

2.5 inches on a on a cross-country bike
you're<00:01:24.740> looking<00:01:25.070> around<00:01:26.110> now<00:01:27.110> 2<00:01:27.170> inches<00:01:27.710> so

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
you're looking around now 2 inches so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.440 
you're looking around now 2 inches so
there's<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.159> quite<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.520> significant<00:01:29.119> difference

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
there's a quite a significant difference

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.389 
there's a quite a significant difference
there<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:30.350> just<00:01:30.500> allows<00:01:30.799> for<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.130> little<00:01:31.250> bit

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
there that just allows for a little bit

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.010 
there that just allows for a little bit
more<00:01:31.520> traction<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.329> little<00:01:32.780> bit<00:01:32.899> more

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
more traction and a little bit more

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.319 
more traction and a little bit more
supple<00:01:33.320> ride<00:01:35.590> also<00:01:36.590> you'll<00:01:36.799> notice<00:01:37.329> there's

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
supple ride also you'll notice there's

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.510 
supple ride also you'll notice there's
only<00:01:38.509> one<00:01:38.780> chain<00:01:39.049> ring<00:01:39.259> up<00:01:39.380> front<00:01:39.710> that's

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
only one chain ring up front that's

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.429 
only one chain ring up front that's
because<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.060> bike<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.299> made<00:01:41.719> just<00:01:42.140> for<00:01:42.350> going

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
because this bike is made just for going

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.429 
because this bike is made just for going
downhill<00:01:42.969> basically<00:01:43.969> a<00:01:44.000> specialty<00:01:44.570> purpose

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
downhill basically a specialty purpose

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.859 
downhill basically a specialty purpose
bike<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:45.979> throw<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.520> on<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.729> lift<00:01:46.909> weighs

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
bike you throw it on the lift weighs

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.679 
bike you throw it on the lift weighs
about<00:01:48.049> 40<00:01:48.799> plus<00:01:49.070> pounds<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:49.850> it's<00:01:50.119> definitely

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
about 40 plus pounds so it's definitely

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.569 
about 40 plus pounds so it's definitely
not<00:01:50.810> something<00:01:50.869> you'll<00:01:51.289> be<00:01:51.490> wanting<00:01:52.490> to

sometimes on downhill bike it just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.080 
sometimes on downhill bike it just
depends<00:02:12.870> its<00:02:12.990> rider<00:02:13.200> preference<00:02:13.770> but<00:02:14.090> with

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
with me i prefer the flat pedals we have

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.330 
with me i prefer the flat pedals we have
a<00:02:18.270> special<00:02:18.990> shoe<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.560> we've<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.950> lot<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.220> us

a special shoe that we've a lot of us

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.240 
a special shoe that we've a lot of us
use<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.940> has<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> sticky<00:02:22.170> rubber<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:23.130> it

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
use and it has a sticky rubber so it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.820 
use and it has a sticky rubber so it
really<00:02:23.430> grips<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.970> pedals<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.830> it's

really grips to the pedals and it's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.350 
really grips to the pedals and it's
almost<00:02:25.980> like<00:02:26.250> you're<00:02:26.370> clipped<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.240> when

most<00:03:23.519> typical<00:03:24.000> bikes<00:03:24.209> I've<00:03:24.450> got<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.780> front

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
most typical bikes I've got the front

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.840 
most typical bikes I've got the front
suspension<00:03:25.170> going<00:03:25.830> on<00:03:25.980> here<00:03:26.220> with<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> hundred

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
suspension going on here with a hundred

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.509 
suspension going on here with a hundred
mils<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.269> travel<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.900> disc<00:03:28.769> brakes<00:03:29.100> as<00:03:29.310> well

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
mils of travel and disc brakes as well

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.910 
mils of travel and disc brakes as well
so<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.360> rotors<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:30.930> these<00:03:31.080> disc<00:03:31.350> brakes<00:03:31.650> will

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
so the rotors on these disc brakes will

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.280 
so the rotors on these disc brakes will
grab<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.459> stop<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:33.000> in<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.209> heartbeat<00:03:33.390> keep
