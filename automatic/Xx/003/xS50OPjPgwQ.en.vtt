00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.320
 hello everyone guys are the ones to give to 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:14.239
 and today we are here in the twelfth episode 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.110
 of the clash of plans series 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.150
 from the beginning 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.400
 let's take our beautiful village like 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.230
 you can well see I finally changed 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.910
 available so I have one for the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.249
 city ​​hall level if I even set 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.439
 the flywheel in this strategic position 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.630
 and I must say that I like the village 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.669
 because from above it is difficult to break through 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.739
 because there are sorcerer's readers from 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.600
 below however it is well protected 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.850
 because there are the castle archers of the 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.449
 clan the defense was therefore from the is not 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.670
 very bad 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.260
 strangely I am a little cold 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.730
 so sorry in this video then 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.530
 what are we going to do we will go as to 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.170
 usually improve some buildings 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.989
 take away our beautiful gem house 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.850
 then we improve this 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.440
 elixir deposit which is the last ad 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.870
 make level 10 so not 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.699
 we immediately improve perfect very well 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.609
 it only takes one day so shawl e 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.500
 then I thought about improving a barracks but 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.450
 we improve everything after so we try 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.730
 someone to attack and meanwhile there 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.750
 take our beautiful gems from yesterday 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.150
 let's look for someone 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.920
 I think I'm a bit high on trophies 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.660
 so I should in fact I'm down 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.130
 attack type taking resources and 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.650
 descending pits of trophies 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.500
 however, I found many more before that 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.060
 resources before the update 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.730
 no more resources are found 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.950
 maybe if any of you on the first one on 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.320
 second on the third on the fourth account at 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.780
 city ​​hall at level 10 and level 6 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.710
 sorry maybe write me in what range 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.930
 of trophies to stand because I am not dead 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.930
 and the wing this one there is at 200,000 gold and 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.000
 maybe yesterday we can also take 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.550
 try not harm as they say 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.040
 let's put some barbarian almost just o 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.260
 mortars from 4 to 5 that will do everything for us 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.710
 But let's see let's put troops 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.350
 case archers to the serial look for me so much 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.030
 of fela guys just a little bit by 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.730
 at least we need this deposit 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.990
 get gold you give something for sure 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.880
 we can open 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.079
 I was very well this here instead 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.050
 I do not think so 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.670
 we destroy the town hall and 80 thousand gold 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.670
 we certainly brought them home 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.830
 better than nothing, however, the cabbage attack 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.620
 I would say that the next attack is 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.620
 we can do with some nice little wizard 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.380
 just completely randomly then 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.870
 since I have 708 gems from the can also 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.220
 jane marvel meanwhile to the thousand gems of the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.989
 we'll get to the fourth bricklayer 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.060
 quietly the fifth mason 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.060
 instead I thought not to take it 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.700
 so let's make 10 mag i spending well 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.640
 23 gm then we do some kind giant 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.900
 we grownups do what we do 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.459
 let's make two other five- giant giants 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.430
 so we spend 6 cm and we are okay 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.680
 this is like the giants and magi agi 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.480
 it could be that in theory it comes 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.650
 also used at high levels, however, us 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.739
 we have the town hall at 6 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.019
 we have giants on 2 and sorcerers on 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.730
 2 so we'll make a mess or better more 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.310
 what a mess we will make a super mega 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.620
 fail and see who we found 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.810
 very very interesting guys can 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.730
 do you can do we put in so much a little 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.370
 of archers a bit of barbarians like that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.500
 external to make percentage and then 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.150
 we must basically destroy 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.920
 these two mortars they will give us 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.959
 really annoying these two actors 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.000
 of the sorcerer and the game is made in 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.730
 theory our things you let me understand 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.670
 I find around me at all clear 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.170
 our things so perfect to go 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.120
 back seen that of montali but that 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.359
 we also destroy this actor of 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.209
 sorcerer up here perfect very much 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.489
 much less and in theory now the worst 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.870
 should be passed and could be 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.880
 do even three stars 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.520
 I do not know their own children do not know the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.580
 magician from no 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.580
 all 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.620
 but I don't believe it was going so well 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.180
 the attack guys see who too 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.190
 he wants nothing tightens if he attacked 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.870
 from above I would have taken all the gold 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.500
 but the elixir would not have done three 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.380
 stars instead I took only 138 thousand of 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.330
 rising guys last attack hopefully 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.550
 not to fail a point with what 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.120
 we attack only barbarian boys 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.920
 look at 135 level 3 barbarians ready to 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.170
 make the devastation from in theory the 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.920
 proverb says that there is no two without three 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.250
 but let 's hope not from I don't want to do 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.020
 I don't want another film though with 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.900
 135 blasts and difficult not to fail 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.970
 the peppa boys today what finds resources 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.730
 on resources are also enough 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.800
 outside and then something will succeed 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.020
 to get it low battery trignano 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.540
 these here we put some here 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.490
 barbarians below bar barozzi good 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.490
 good good take them take 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.290
 lease take everything ok here 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.780
 we must destroy this tower of the 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.330
 sorcerer who gave us too much trouble 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.610
 we also destroy mortar and of course 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.980
 iris nor joke we are taking more 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.140
 resources with only barbarics with wizards 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.900
 giants and smashes them all 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.630
 complex economic army tactics 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.300
 easy it costs little it takes little time e 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.120
 great results are made 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.460
 there are 45 left we can 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.660
 put it here and slowly should 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.669
 start entering 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.230
 let's get the boys back very well 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.690
 very very good 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.640
 if you notice in my videos I do the first one 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.380
 attack a shit the second a little 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.210
 better the third attack an attack of the 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.820
 madonna della madonna goes well in this 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.590
 case regarding resources however 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.600
 anyway all the videos immediately channels 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.710
 I am so I do not know why you people can the 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.000
 curse of the three attacks 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.430
 we took practically everything from 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.440
 I am very very happy and it is the first 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.010
 time we exceed the best of 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.000
 elixir 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.560
 so let's say we are 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.500
 maybe for the first time ok enough 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.660
 so then therefore we have 700 thousand d 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.010
 gold and a million-dollar elixir that it is 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.140
 really a lot of stuff 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.420
 we certainly need to strengthen the 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.250
 barracks so we do healers e 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.680
 then with the healers we can do the 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.740
 attacks children then we have a 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.580
 Another Freemason have my 700 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.250
 gold the shuttlecock costs 750 thousand a mortar 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.320
 to make level 4 placed at 400,000 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.480
 so I would enhance this one here 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.680
 it gets very very cool with gold then 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.210
 by yes yes we do 321 perfect not 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.950
 I told you but obviously I did 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.680
 these walls level 6 that you look at 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.910
 how beautiful they are with the new graphics 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.650
 probably they are the only wall that is 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.570
 got nicer but look at that 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.580
 the boys are really cool 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.290
