00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
really good technique I kind of like

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.150 
really good technique I kind of like
mind<00:00:59.070> doing<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.430> ever<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.090> lightly<00:01:01.039> if<00:01:02.039> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
mind doing this ever so lightly if you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.630 
mind doing this ever so lightly if you
don't<00:01:02.370> want<00:01:02.579> too<00:01:02.820> much<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.339> kind<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
don't want too much so I'm just kind of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.270 
don't want too much so I'm just kind of
dotting<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> gets<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> gets

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
dotting so that it gets it so it gets

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.480 
dotting so that it gets it so it gets
read<00:01:11.520> spotty<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.510> also<00:01:12.920> so<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.250> gets

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
read spotty but also so that it gets

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.039 
read spotty but also so that it gets
nice<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.420> faint<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.680> bring<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.810> then

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
nice and faint as I bring it in and then

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
nice and faint as I bring it in and then
try<00:01:19.320> not<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> move<00:01:19.740> too<00:01:19.799> much<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.520> going

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
try not to move too much I'm just going

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
try not to move too much I'm just going
to<00:01:20.729> take<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> blender<00:01:21.330> brush<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.900> begin<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
to take a blender brush and begin to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.810 
to take a blender brush and begin to
blend<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.729> that's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
blend that in you can see that that's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
blend that in you can see that that's
moving<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.570> shadow<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.530> blending

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
moving the shadow so that's blending

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.810 
moving the shadow so that's blending
