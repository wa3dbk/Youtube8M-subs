 the industrialization of the country is another 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.309
 large facility and care production 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.200
 electric locomotives today was launched in 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.389
 free economic zone 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.590

 the country's railway industry and 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.079
 implemented over the years appreciated the scale 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.880
 construction high tech 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.800
 manufactured products Daniyar

 electric locomotive enterprise rostrud 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.279
 gold began to build back in 2010 its 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.399
 production design capacity 50 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.750
 here are such two-section 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.809
 locomotives per year 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.390
 new line of locomotives 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.859
 specially projected a 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.989
 french company alstom transport for 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.670
 Kazakhstan, CIS and Baltic countries 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.640
 today it is the most powerful in 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.520
 the world electric locomotive which is capable 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.770
 pull up to nine thousand tons except 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.820
 this is also environmentally friendly 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.190
 Rector of the university he is fully responsible 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920
 all the requirements of a green economy with 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.470
 its operation impact 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.410
 environment is minimal 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.250
 over the past 20 years, the country laid 1100 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.450
 kilometers of railways now goes 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.860
 railway construction 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.229
 zhezkazgan benyuk branches next year 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.310
 will take the first freight flights 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.890
 electric locomotives and after a couple of years the passenger 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.870
 but unparalleled ratio 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.790
 price quality 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670
 locomotive possess large export 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.880
 potential 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 we just know you georgia 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.110
 but we run one of the most 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.740
 technologically 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.229
 so objects with high 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.439
 labor productivity I'm glad our 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.390
 last year's look 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.070
 and other interest 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.070
 we will deliver in the amount of Ilchenko 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.060
 so cried victor petrunenko volume we 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 think son device see 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.210
 from year to year amount 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.060
 produced locomotive will be 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.939
 grow as well as Kazakhstan 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.079
 content in the production process promises 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.130
 factory workers so far this indicator 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770
 is 5 percent 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.490
 our year finders 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.160
 72 percent we will reach 19 this 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.240
 good plan is impossible right away 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.310
 vaccinations and all at once it means to do 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.580
 Kazakhstan 30 percent we will have 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.050
 16 per annum why 300 are settled 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.140
 patients we intend to open production 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.340
 traction engines in atbasar built in 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.099
 2009 locomotive will be called if 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.170
 presented his products 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.910
 Kazakhstani slow 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.360
 locomotives are interested 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.350
 our neighbors

 locomotives four of them are ready for export 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.860
 and tajikistan buys the second 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.860
 batch up to 28 percent 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.389
 fuel economy making a list 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.139
 locomotive 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.549
