as<00:03:46.810> he<00:03:46.900> continues<00:03:47.349> down<00:03:47.530> this<00:03:47.709> path

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
as he continues down this path

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.490 
as he continues down this path
especially<00:03:48.099> with<00:03:49.000> what<00:03:49.239> he<00:03:49.389> has<00:03:49.479> set<00:03:49.689> out<00:03:49.840> with

especially with what he has set out with
this<00:03:50.650> chapter<00:03:51.159> and<00:03:51.970> I<00:03:52.090> wonder<00:03:52.449> if<00:03:52.599> a<00:03:52.720> line<00:03:52.930> can

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
this chapter and I wonder if a line can

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.319 
this chapter and I wonder if a line can
stop<00:03:53.500> his<00:03:53.709> brother<00:03:54.009> Hawker<00:03:54.579> do<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.000> Cohen

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
from fighting I wonder if you can

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.409 
from fighting I wonder if you can
actually<00:03:57.069> stop<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.549> because<00:03:57.819> if<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.060> fight

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
actually stop that because if that fight

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.039 
actually stop that because if that fight
does<00:03:58.599> go<00:03:58.780> down<00:03:58.810> one<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.859> them<00:04:00.009> will<00:04:00.609> die<00:04:01.049> it's
