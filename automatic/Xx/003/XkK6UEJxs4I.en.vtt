if you could just you've everyone at

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.360 
if you could just you've everyone at
home<00:00:26.990> maybe<00:00:27.170> who<00:00:27.410> hasn't<00:00:27.830> done<00:00:27.950> much<00:00:28.100> street

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
home maybe who hasn't done much street

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.400 
home maybe who hasn't done much street
photography<00:00:28.910> an<00:00:29.000> idea<00:00:29.360> of<00:00:29.420> what<00:00:30.080> they<00:00:30.200> need<00:00:30.380> to

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
photography an idea of what they need to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.770 
photography an idea of what they need to
get<00:00:30.680> started<00:00:30.950> so<00:00:31.310> what<00:00:31.850> gear<00:00:32.119> you<00:00:32.300> need<00:00:32.480> or

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
get started so what gear you need or

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.510 
get started so what gear you need or
what<00:00:33.020> things<00:00:33.260> you<00:00:33.350> need<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.559> consider<00:00:33.800> when

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
what things you need to consider when

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.549 
what things you need to consider when
heading<00:00:34.879> out<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.149> shoot<00:00:35.390> on<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.870> street<00:00:36.110> okay

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
heading out to shoot on the street okay

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.180 
heading out to shoot on the street okay
I<00:00:36.590> think<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.610> first<00:00:37.760> thing<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:39.130> think<00:00:40.130> about

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
I think the first thing to think about

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.390 
I think the first thing to think about
is<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.880> camera<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:42.410> answer<00:00:42.950> to<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.190> best

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
is the camera and the answer to the best

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.700 
is the camera and the answer to the best
camera<00:00:43.790> is<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.300> camera<00:00:44.630> in<00:00:44.720> your<00:00:44.780> hand<00:00:45.050> it

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
camera is the camera in your hand it

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.319 
camera is the camera in your hand it
doesn't<00:00:46.190> matter<00:00:46.400> what<00:00:46.610> kind<00:00:46.820> of<00:00:47.000> camera<00:00:47.210> that

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
doesn't matter what kind of camera that

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.270 
doesn't matter what kind of camera that
you<00:00:47.570> have<00:00:47.780> you're<00:00:48.200> able<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:48.650> go<00:00:48.770> out<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:48.980> get

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
you have you're able to go out and get

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.960 
you have you're able to go out and get
and<00:00:49.790> getting<00:00:50.360> some<00:00:50.960> great<00:00:51.140> images<00:00:51.820> you<00:00:52.820> know<00:00:52.910> I

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
and getting some great images you know I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.440 
and getting some great images you know I
would<00:00:53.660> suggest<00:00:53.870> that<00:00:54.260> if<00:00:54.950> you're<00:00:55.450> just

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
would suggest that if you're just

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.090 
would suggest that if you're just
starting<00:00:56.570> out<00:00:57.079> or<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:57.530> have<00:00:57.680> access<00:00:58.070> to

the<00:00:58.970> wide<00:00:59.180> angle<00:00:59.390> lenses<00:01:00.370> whether<00:01:01.370> it's<00:01:01.520> 24

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
the wide angle lenses whether it's 24

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.179 
the wide angle lenses whether it's 24
millimeter<00:01:02.329> or<00:01:02.480> 35<00:01:02.899> millimeter<00:01:03.410> they're<00:01:03.950> my

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
millimeter or 35 millimeter they're my

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.959 
millimeter or 35 millimeter they're my
personal<00:01:04.909> preference<00:01:05.149> in<00:01:05.479> shooting<00:01:06.820> but<00:01:07.820> the

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
personal preference in shooting but the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.789 
personal preference in shooting but the
quid<00:01:08.390> pro<00:01:08.420> quo<00:01:08.869> for<00:01:09.079> that<00:01:09.229> means<00:01:09.469> that<00:01:09.680> you

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
quid pro quo for that means that you

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.090 
quid pro quo for that means that you
need<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.130> get<00:01:10.310> up<00:01:10.490> close<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:12.229> need<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.650> be
