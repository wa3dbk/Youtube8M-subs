00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
we know in order to get the most range

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
we know in order to get the most range
of<00:00:15.630> movement<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.880> most<00:00:18.150> mobility<00:00:18.779> out<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
of movement and the most mobility out of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.650 
of movement and the most mobility out of
our<00:00:19.529> hand<00:00:19.830> fretting<00:00:20.520> hand<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.180> place<00:00:21.420> our

our hand fretting hand is to place our

our hand fretting hand is to place our
thumb<00:00:21.930> somewhere<00:00:22.800> around<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.130> middle<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
thumb somewhere around the middle of the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
middle and index finger and it's kind of

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.430 
middle and index finger and it's kind of
like<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> pinching<00:00:30.710> motion<00:00:31.710> kind<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> deal<00:00:33.440> then

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
like a pinching motion kind of deal then

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.500 
like a pinching motion kind of deal then
that's<00:00:34.710> gonna<00:00:35.040> allow<00:00:35.489> us<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.969> most

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
that's gonna allow us the most

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.680 
that's gonna allow us the most
you<00:00:37.079> know<00:00:37.200> range<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.649> movements<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.690> mobility

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
you know range of movements and mobility

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
you know range of movements and mobility
to<00:00:40.079> move<00:00:40.350> around<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.739> neck<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.160> nice<00:00:41.399> bow

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to move around the neck it's nice bow

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.729 
to move around the neck it's nice bow
nice<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.270> balanced<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.290> move<00:00:43.559> around

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
nice and balanced and it can move around

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.709 
nice and balanced and it can move around
real<00:00:44.160> quick<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:45.469> it's<00:00:46.469> when<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.510> hang<00:00:48.510> our

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
real quick and it's when we hang our

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.560 
real quick and it's when we hang our
thumb<00:00:49.020> over<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.559> top<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.550> gets<00:00:50.789> cradled

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
thumb over the top and it gets cradled

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.660 
thumb over the top and it gets cradled
into<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> palm<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.530> our<00:00:52.649> hands<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.370> this

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
into the palm of our hands like this

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.170 
into the palm of our hands like this
that's<00:00:54.210> when<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:55.440> lose<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:56.100> our<00:00:56.129> mobility<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that's when we lose all our mobility and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.770 
that's when we lose all our mobility and
range<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.289> motion<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.920> really<00:00:59.280> can't<00:00:59.730> hit<00:01:00.030> too

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
range of motion you really can't hit too

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.070 
range of motion you really can't hit too
many<00:01:00.809> different<00:01:01.530> notes<00:01:02.660> when<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.690> set<00:01:04.049> up

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
many different notes when you set up

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.810 
many different notes when you set up
like<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.680> without<00:01:04.890> ruining<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.610> whole

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
like this without ruining your whole

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.469 
like this without ruining your whole
hand<00:01:06.060> around<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.280> you're<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.670> losing<00:01:09.210> all

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
hand around and you're really losing all

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.280 
hand around and you're really losing all
your<00:01:09.780> subtlety<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:12.290> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
your subtlety when you do that and you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
your subtlety when you do that and you
know<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.650> bass<00:01:13.860> players<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:15.060> no<00:01:15.240> big<00:01:15.479> deal

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
know or bass players so it's no big deal

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.880 
know or bass players so it's no big deal
if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.619> want<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.130> hang<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:18.869> play<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.680> one

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
if you want to just hang and play on one

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.660 
if you want to just hang and play on one
note<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:24.619> sometimes<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.890> might<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
note but sometimes you might want to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
note but sometimes you might want to
learn<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> song<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.720> you're<00:01:28.140> sitting<00:01:28.380> there

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
learn a song and you're sitting there

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800 
learn a song and you're sitting there
going<00:01:28.710> well<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.369> can't<00:01:29.850> play<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.390> bass<00:01:30.630> line

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
going well I can't play this bass line

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.480 
going well I can't play this bass line
for<00:01:31.200> some<00:01:31.409> reason<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.799> don't<00:01:31.860> know<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.280> other

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
for some reason I don't know I see other

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
for some reason I don't know I see other
guys<00:01:32.670> doing<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.630> try<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:33.900> play<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
guys doing it but when I try and play it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.260 
guys doing it but when I try and play it
I<00:01:34.439> can't<00:01:34.710> really<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.579> notes<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.060> time

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
I can't really get to the notes in time

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.080 
I can't really get to the notes in time
and<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:37.320> could<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.939> your

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and it could be just the way that your

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
and it could be just the way that your
thumb<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.540> set<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.229> dropped<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.740> down

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
thumb is set up if you dropped it down

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.810 
thumb is set up if you dropped it down
maybe<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:43.530> able<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.920> hit<00:01:44.369> all<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.790> notes

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
maybe you be able to hit all the notes

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.060 
maybe you be able to hit all the notes
in<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> more<00:01:45.479> timely<00:01:45.780> fashion<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.770> how<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
in a more timely fashion like how the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.039 
in a more timely fashion like how the
song<00:01:47.610> goes

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
song goes

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.319 
song goes
so<00:01:49.049> now<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.500> another<00:01:49.770> quick<00:01:50.100> thing<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.579> when
