00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.520
 I go to the railway yard for 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.800
 defuse the militia device either 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.540
 prudent they will send drones to his 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:28.570
 position as soon as they see who has 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:34.770
 deactivated the excellent device 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.770
 bomb defused failure 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.840
 Weighs 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.490
 apparently his attack has 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.530
 alerted the new commander of the 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.560
 militia successor of the knight of 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.390
 arkham is a rather warlike type ha 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.460
 asked to speak directly with her 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.080
 on an open channel 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.280
 then give him what he asks very well 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.160
 what a pleasure it has been for so long 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.190
 slade codename right and i'm 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.190

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.120
 I remember you telling me I didn't 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.520
 worry but our mutual friend e 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.290
 the knight has another version 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.940
 I have tried said they are 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.940
 the most fearsome adversary you had 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.340
 faced the knight is gone 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.030
 you are an unemployed mercenary not 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.760
 exactly 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.340
 I was paid in advance for this 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.430
 it is a professional obligation to finish the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.430
 work 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.180
 but the fight on gotham is now a 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.560
 the rider of 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.479
 arcana was wrong 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.789
 it is not a matter of brute force nor of 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.240
 numbers to beat pact but must 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.240
 be good 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.330
 congratulations bomb destroyed but not 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.230

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.230
 like sheep 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.800
 controlled explosion the bomb succeeded 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.750
 is no longer a threat to send 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:58.490
 tins to do the work of a 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:59.970
 assassin a gentleman gentleman minister 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.330
 Russian 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.760

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.830

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.830
 on the trigger my eyes on the viewfinder 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.930
 bomb destroyed at work a 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.060
 magnificent yes good try to reach me 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.040
 at our first meeting he inflicted me 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.040
 of damages and I can't wait to repay them 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.780
 well signorino bruce a threat and less 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.310
 harmful machines I will fight better the 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.310
 ask when the time comes 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:19.720
 as eliminated big master 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.850

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.360
 80 with a rocket two bullets and one 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.360
 perforated lung 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:40.680
 I'm loading the virus missing notes le 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.680
 bombs I will not allow them to explode 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.439
 but the truth is superior 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.559
 still two bombs no one will land in 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:07.300
 gotham hostage no one passes it smooth 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:10.289
 I'm not seeing the battle like that 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.289
 from the massacre of care 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.450
 only one explosive device remains 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.520
 the militia's grip is at the entrance 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.520
 both would be good 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.810
 paz 6 hard to die I admit me 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.970
 remember an old warrior who is there 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.770
 looted the field too many dr 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.840
 in the end we also got another one 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.450
 his head on the wall gives me a chance 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.710
 she leaves to gotham 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:11.260
 now I really think you eliminated the bombs 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.450
 congratulations but the roads are still 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.110
 blocked and our towers monitor i 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.110
