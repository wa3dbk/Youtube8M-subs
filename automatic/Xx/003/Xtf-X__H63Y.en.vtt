kind of curious about is whether or not
I<00:00:52.199> could<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> potential<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:54.530> offensive

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
I could have the potential for offensive

oh right over here since it easier for
both<00:02:30.490> let's<00:02:31.490> call<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.760> three<00:02:31.940> minutes<00:02:32.180> 45

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
both let's call it three minutes 45

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.250 
both let's call it three minutes 45
seconds<00:02:33.200> or<00:02:33.440> 55<00:02:34.160> seconds<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:35.630> puts<00:02:35.900> him<00:02:36.080> in

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
seconds or 55 seconds that puts him in

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.740 
seconds or 55 seconds that puts him in
slightly<00:02:36.860> faster<00:02:37.280> than<00:02:37.490> normal<00:02:37.700> these<00:02:38.090> get<00:02:38.390> he

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
slightly faster than normal these get he

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.420 
slightly faster than normal these get he
does<00:02:38.900> get<00:02:39.050> kind<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.650> low<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:39.890> mean<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.220> missed

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
does get kind of low I mean I missed

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.940 
does get kind of low I mean I missed
some<00:02:40.580> weird<00:02:40.790> things<00:02:40.930> here<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:41.959> mean<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:42.740> guess

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
some weird things here I mean so I guess

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.199 
some weird things here I mean so I guess
you<00:02:43.070> could<00:02:43.100> have<00:02:43.280> shaved<00:02:43.430> off<00:02:43.670> at<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.880> couple

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
you could have shaved off at a couple

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.920 
you could have shaved off at a couple
seconds<00:02:44.570> which<00:02:44.720> yeah<00:02:44.930> makes<00:02:45.170> him<00:02:45.410> really<00:02:45.860> fast

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
seconds which yeah makes him really fast

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.510 
seconds which yeah makes him really fast
so<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:47.989> know<00:02:48.170> realistically<00:02:48.560> if<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.160> hadn't

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
so you know realistically if I hadn't

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.250 
so you know realistically if I hadn't
done<00:02:50.030> some<00:02:50.239> dumb<00:02:50.390> things<00:02:50.450> because<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.080> wasn't

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
done some dumb things because I wasn't

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.100 
done some dumb things because I wasn't
paying<00:02:51.500> attention<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:52.010> finish<00:02:52.459> it<00:02:52.580> about

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
paying attention you finish it about

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.800 
paying attention you finish it about
five<00:02:54.110> minutes<00:02:54.380> 43<00:02:55.130> set<00:02:55.400> or<00:02:55.550> 53<00:02:56.060> seconds<00:02:56.540> or<00:02:56.660> so

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
five minutes 43 set or 53 seconds or so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.070 
five minutes 43 set or 53 seconds or so
the<00:02:57.769> fastest<00:02:58.340> junglers<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:59.540> basically<00:02:59.900> why

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
the fastest junglers like basically why

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.050 
the fastest junglers like basically why
wasn't<00:03:00.500> considering<00:03:00.950> them<00:03:01.130> very<00:03:01.310> fast<00:03:01.700> here

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
wasn't considering them very fast here

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.180 
wasn't considering them very fast here
it's<00:03:02.870> kind<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.110> unusual<00:03:03.260> he's<00:03:03.739> finishing<00:03:04.040> in

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
it's kind of unusual he's finishing in

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.110 
it's kind of unusual he's finishing in
the<00:03:04.220> middle<00:03:04.489> summer<00:03:04.640> because<00:03:04.820> there<00:03:04.970> was<00:03:05.060> a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
the middle summer because there was a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.610 
the middle summer because there was a
fairly<00:03:05.330> distinct<00:03:05.930> dichotomy<00:03:06.530> between

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
fairly distinct dichotomy between

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.160 
fairly distinct dichotomy between
champions<00:03:07.280> who<00:03:07.489> were<00:03:07.640> finishing<00:03:08.120> at<00:03:08.299> 450<00:03:08.989> and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
champions who were finishing at 450 and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.050 
champions who were finishing at 450 and
champions<00:03:09.739> were<00:03:09.860> finishing<00:03:10.160> at<00:03:10.489> four<00:03:10.910> minutes

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
champions were finishing at four minutes

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.550 
champions were finishing at four minutes
exactly<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.780> then<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.959> slower<00:03:12.200> ones<00:03:12.290> are

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
exactly and then the slower ones are

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.110 
exactly and then the slower ones are
slower<00:03:12.769> than<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.310> was<00:03:13.430> like<00:03:13.610> for<00:03:13.850> 10

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
slower than that and it was like for 10

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.820 
slower than that and it was like for 10
but<00:03:14.840> he's<00:03:14.959> finishing<00:03:15.260> somewhere<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:15.739> between

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
but he's finishing somewhere in between

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.039 
but he's finishing somewhere in between
that<00:03:16.130> probably<00:03:16.459> has<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.760> do<00:03:16.880> with<00:03:17.030> me<00:03:17.060> Lessing

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
that probably has to do with me Lessing

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.690 
that probably has to do with me Lessing
that<00:03:18.230> stuff<00:03:18.440> up<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:19.100> he's<00:03:19.310> going<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.519> finish

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
that stuff up so he's going to finish

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.940 
that stuff up so he's going to finish
somewhere<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:20.360> with<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.690> very<00:03:21.260> defensive

of<00:03:31.670> that<00:03:32.500> now<00:03:33.500> he<00:03:33.560> did<00:03:34.070> get<00:03:34.220> actually<00:03:34.519> quite

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
of that now he did get actually quite

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.850 
of that now he did get actually quite
low<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.090> do<00:03:35.150> use<00:03:35.390> all<00:03:35.630> my<00:03:35.840> potions<00:03:36.350> it

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
didn't feel dangerous it's not like oh

again<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:41.959> also<00:03:42.140> have<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.260> consider<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.620> didn't

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
again you also have to consider I didn't

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.160 
again you also have to consider I didn't
have<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.040> leash<00:03:43.250> which<00:03:43.489> is<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.640> big<00:03:44.090> kind<00:03:44.600> of<00:03:44.750> you

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
have a leash which is a big kind of you

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.660 
have a leash which is a big kind of you
know<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.320> finished<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.220> faster<00:03:46.549> you<00:03:46.610> finish

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
know you finished the faster you finish

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.670 
know you finished the faster you finish
gold<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.330> better<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.320> kind<00:03:48.620> of

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
gold is the better because I can kind of

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.009 
gold is the better because I can kind of
chunky<00:03:48.890> pretty<00:03:49.250> early<00:03:49.549> on<00:03:49.580> less<00:03:50.360> durable

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
chunky pretty early on less durable

chunky pretty early on less durable
champions<00:03:52.930> if<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.230> had<00:03:54.470> leash<00:03:54.739> perhaps<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.989> can

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
champions if you had leash perhaps I can

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.909 
champions if you had leash perhaps I can
see<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.350> going<00:03:57.650> 21<00:03:58.100> 90<00:03:59.440> you<00:04:00.440> don't<00:04:00.680> have<00:04:00.889> a

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
see you going 21 90 you don't have a

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.600 
see you going 21 90 you don't have a
leash<00:04:01.130> then<00:04:01.340> know<00:04:01.579> you<00:04:01.639> will

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
leash then know you will

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.010 
leash then know you will
probably<00:04:02.910> would<00:04:03.030> have<00:04:03.090> died<00:04:03.300> in<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.510> jungle

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.000 

he<00:04:07.020> would<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.260> been<00:04:07.350> making<00:04:07.650> incredible

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
he would have been making incredible

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.980 
he would have been making incredible
time<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.760> probably<00:04:08.910> really<00:04:09.360> close<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.720> you

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
time and probably really close and you

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.240 
time and probably really close and you
could<00:04:10.110> probably<00:04:10.320> do<00:04:10.500> some<00:04:10.710> very<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:11.220> know

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
could probably do some very you know

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.460 
could probably do some very you know
crafty<00:04:11.760> dancing<00:04:12.210> around<00:04:12.330> mobs<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.050> you<00:04:13.380> know

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
crafty dancing around mobs and you know

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.770 
crafty dancing around mobs and you know
not<00:04:13.650> taking<00:04:14.580> it<00:04:14.670> i<00:04:14.910> can<00:04:15.120> summon<00:04:15.300> it<00:04:15.480> would<00:04:15.630> be

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
not taking it i can summon it would be

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.120 
not taking it i can summon it would be
fine<00:04:16.049> but<00:04:16.079> i<00:04:16.410> don't<00:04:16.560> think<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.739> really<00:04:16.890> want

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
fine but i don't think you really want

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.830 
fine but i don't think you really want
to<00:04:17.220> do<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.459> when<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.000> lose<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.420> element<00:04:18.570> of

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
to do that when you lose the element of

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.060 
to do that when you lose the element of
the<00:04:18.930> counter<00:04:19.230> jungler<00:04:19.590> i<00:04:19.620> think<00:04:19.890> probably

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the counter jungler i think probably

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.650 
the counter jungler i think probably
what<00:04:20.310> you're<00:04:20.370> going<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.579> want<00:04:20.700> up<00:04:20.850> doing<00:04:21.180> is

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
what you're going to want up doing is

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.440 
what you're going to want up doing is
yen<00:04:22.070> 921<00:04:23.070> with<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.490> leash<00:04:23.670> stay<00:04:23.940> relatively

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
yen 921 with the leash stay relatively

sometimes even talk jungle said it's

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.880 
sometimes even talk jungle said it's

I<00:04:43.080> don't<00:04:43.710> think<00:04:43.890> I'm<00:04:43.950> really<00:04:44.310> qualified<00:04:44.700> to

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
I don't think I'm really qualified to

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.280 
I don't think I'm really qualified to
think<00:04:45.090> about<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.540> too<00:04:45.750> much<00:04:45.780> since<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.140> don't

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
think about that too much since I don't

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.190 
think about that too much since I don't
really<00:04:46.470> play<00:04:46.830> said<00:04:48.890> certainly<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:50.040> farm<00:04:50.430> that

really play said certainly the farm that
the<00:04:52.200> one<00:04:52.350> thing<00:04:52.380> I<00:04:52.590> suppose<00:04:52.860> I'm<00:04:53.040> qualified<00:04:53.280> a

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
the one thing I suppose I'm qualified a

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.010 
the one thing I suppose I'm qualified a
thing<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:53.790> say<00:04:53.910> talk<00:04:54.150> about<00:04:54.360> is<00:04:54.480> because<00:04:54.930> I've

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
thing to say talk about is because I've

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.900 
thing to say talk about is because I've
been<00:04:55.140> testing<00:04:55.470> out<00:04:55.560> out<00:04:55.740> full<00:04:56.130> jungle<00:04:56.760> games

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
been testing out out full jungle games

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.310 
been testing out out full jungle games
in<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.120> public<00:04:57.360> test<00:04:57.540> realm<00:04:57.660> mind<00:04:58.080> I'm<00:04:58.230> going

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
in the public test realm mind I'm going

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.480 
in the public test realm mind I'm going
to<00:04:58.410> ramble<00:04:58.680> on<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.830> bit<00:04:59.040> longer<00:04:59.220> than<00:04:59.430> I

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
to ramble on a bit longer than I

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.740 
to ramble on a bit longer than I
normally<00:04:59.580> do<00:04:59.910> because<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.570> last

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
normally do because this is the last

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.470 
normally do because this is the last
video<00:05:01.020> at<00:05:01.320> least<00:05:01.380> last<00:05:02.340> official<00:05:02.940> video<00:05:03.419> I

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
video at least last official video I

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.690 
video at least last official video I
might<00:05:03.810> tag<00:05:04.380> on<00:05:04.650> some<00:05:04.980> way<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.130> other<00:05:05.490> stuff

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
might tag on some way and other stuff

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.340 
might tag on some way and other stuff
that's<00:05:05.850> weird<00:05:06.360> like<00:05:06.480> Soraka<00:05:06.930> John<00:05:07.200> was

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
that's weird like Soraka John was

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.760 
that's weird like Soraka John was
something<00:05:07.620> later<00:05:07.800> but<00:05:08.840> yeah<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:09.900> have<00:05:10.320> tested
