and<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.350> instant<00:00:40.860> action<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.280> into<00:00:41.700> one<00:00:42.030> of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and so I instant action on into one of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.280 
and so I instant action on into one of
these<00:00:42.300> bases<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:42.870> you've<00:00:42.989> never<00:00:43.079> played

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
these bases and if you've never played

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.990 
these bases and if you've never played
planetside<00:00:43.770> 2<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.250> basically<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.850> way

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
planetside 2 you it's basically the way

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.940 
planetside 2 you it's basically the way
you<00:00:45.030> find<00:00:45.570> action<00:00:46.050> easily<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:46.559> instant

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you find action easily like instant

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.709 
you find action easily like instant
action<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.430> pretty<00:00:47.640> self-explanatory

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
action it's pretty self-explanatory

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.130 
action it's pretty self-explanatory
and<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.620> quickly<00:00:50.100> realize<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.510> base<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and I quickly realize that this base is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
and I quickly realize that this base is
swarming<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.010> enemy<00:00:53.370> teams<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.090> are

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
swarming with enemy teams they are

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.810 
swarming with enemy teams they are
everywhere<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:55.170> allies<00:00:55.620> dying<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.789> I

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
can hold on to the base and maybe cross

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.650 
can hold on to the base and maybe cross
our<00:01:02.460> fingers<00:01:02.640> there's<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> lot<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.300> people<00:01:03.510> here

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
maybe push them away and so I start to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.969 
maybe push them away and so I start to
revive<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:06.600> allies<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> start<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> heal<00:01:07.770> down

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.490 
revive my allies I start to heal down
and<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.460> slowly<00:01:08.909> start<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.630> whittle<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and then slowly start to whittle the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.020 
and then slowly start to whittle the
enemies<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:11.130> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> taking<00:01:11.790> potshots

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
enemies down kind of taking potshots

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330 
enemies down kind of taking potshots
trying<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> find<00:01:13.200> where<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> frontlines<00:01:14.040> are

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
trying to find where the frontlines are

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.190 
trying to find where the frontlines are
and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:14.880> flanking<00:01:15.299> around<00:01:15.570> or<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.810> from

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and then flanking around or just from

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
and then flanking around or just from
doing<00:01:16.470> my<00:01:16.619> best<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.979> kind<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.310> survive<00:01:17.640> with

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
doing my best to kind of survive with

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.640 
doing my best to kind of survive with
the<00:01:18.210> amount<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.600> enemies<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.049> around<00:01:19.409> me

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the amount of enemies that are around me

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.480 
the amount of enemies that are around me
and<00:01:19.830> eventually<00:01:20.960> slowly<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.830> start<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> push

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and eventually slowly we start to push

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.850 
and eventually slowly we start to push
away<00:01:23.759> from<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:24.180> spawn<00:01:24.540> point<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> start<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
away from our spawn point and start to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.520 
away from our spawn point and start to
get<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.100> more<00:01:26.280> closer<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.630> enemy<00:01:27.810> sunder

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
get them more closer to the enemy sunder

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350 
get them more closer to the enemy sunder
and<00:01:28.740> eventually<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.790> start<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> push<00:01:30.240> them

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and eventually we start to push them

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.660 
and eventually we start to push them
down<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.810> hill<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.320> while<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.250> was<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> slow

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
down the hill and while it was a slow

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.010 
down the hill and while it was a slow
process<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.840> kind<00:01:33.990> of

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
process it's not like we just kind of

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.810 
process it's not like we just kind of
steamrolled<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.860> enemy<00:01:35.159> team<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.729> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
steamrolled the enemy team just as you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.730 
steamrolled the enemy team just as you
know<00:01:35.909> all<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.420> nowhere<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.650> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
know all out of nowhere we kind of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.590 
know all out of nowhere we kind of
established<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> front<00:01:38.610> line<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.150> slowly

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
established a front line we slowly

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.149 
established a front line we slowly
started<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.079> whittle<00:01:40.290> everyone<00:01:40.650> down<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
started to whittle everyone down and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
started to whittle everyone down and
that<00:01:41.579> allowed<00:01:41.850> us<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.390> push<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that allowed us to kind of push up a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.660 
that allowed us to kind of push up a
little<00:01:43.290> bit<00:01:43.500> establish<00:01:44.070> another<00:01:44.220> front<00:01:44.520> line

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
little bit establish another front line

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.980 
little bit establish another front line
who<00:01:44.850> shuffled<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.180> little<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:45.780> bit

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
who shuffled a little bit a little bit

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.690 
who shuffled a little bit a little bit
further<00:01:46.229> established<00:01:46.979> another<00:01:47.220> front<00:01:47.520> line

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
further established another front line

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.969 
further established another front line
start<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> flank<00:01:48.780> around<00:01:48.930> kind<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> condense

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
start the flank around kind of condense

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.649 
start the flank around kind of condense
them<00:01:50.159> around<00:01:50.340> their<00:01:50.579> sunders<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.270> then

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
them around their sunders and then

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.149 
them around their sunders and then
finally<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.409> were<00:01:52.500> able<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.740> blow<00:01:52.979> them

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
finally what we were able to blow them

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.980 
finally what we were able to blow them
up<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.390> guys<00:01:54.479> we'll<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.720> I

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
up but because of you guys we'll see I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.810 
up but because of you guys we'll see I
mean<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.350> takes<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.680> while<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.729> I'm

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
mean it takes a while to do this and I'm

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.399 
mean it takes a while to do this and I'm
kind<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.030> getting<00:01:57.119> ahead<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.420> myself<00:01:57.630> but

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
kind of getting ahead of myself but

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.620 
kind of getting ahead of myself but
eventually<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:59.280> slowly<00:01:59.700> start<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> take<00:02:00.450> out

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
eventually we slowly start to take out

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
eventually we slowly start to take out
each<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.049> their<00:02:01.229> sunders<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.219> because

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
each of their sunders but because

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.130 
each of their sunders but because
there's<00:02:02.729> apparently<00:02:03.149> even<00:02:03.299> more<00:02:03.659> sunders

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
there's apparently even more sunders

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840 
there's apparently even more sunders
just<00:02:04.439> further<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.430> keep<00:02:05.579> spawning

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
just further out and they keep spawning

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.779 
just further out and they keep spawning
on<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.840> gets<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.259> point<00:02:07.439> where<00:02:07.789> it's

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
on them it gets to the point where it's

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.180 
on them it gets to the point where it's
just<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.060> waves<00:02:09.360> upon<00:02:09.929> waves<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.860> enemy

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
just like waves upon waves of enemy

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.309 
just like waves upon waves of enemy
trying<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.000> push<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.420> back<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.870> onto<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.110> hill

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
trying to push up back up onto the hill

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.440 
trying to push up back up onto the hill
trying<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.800> capture<00:02:14.129> our<00:02:14.160> base<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.849> I

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
trying to capture our base and I

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.369 
trying to capture our base and I
honestly<00:02:15.629> felt<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.110> was<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.319> a

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
honestly felt like I was in a

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.900 
honestly felt like I was in a
single-player<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.980> felt<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.489> was<00:02:17.640> playing

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
single-player I felt like I was playing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.640 
single-player I felt like I was playing
some<00:02:18.209> sort<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.450> single-player<00:02:18.930> where<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.560> was

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
some sort of single-player where it was

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.710 
some sort of single-player where it was
just<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.920> constant<00:02:20.430> stream<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.760> enemies<00:02:21.090> trying

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
just a constant stream of enemies trying

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.809 
just a constant stream of enemies trying
to<00:02:21.930> get<00:02:22.080> back<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.560> kill<00:02:22.800> me<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.670> was

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
to get back in to kill me and it was

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.460 
to get back in to kill me and it was
just<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:24.090> incredible<00:02:24.270> experience<00:02:25.260> that

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
just this incredible experience that

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.380 
just this incredible experience that
honestly<00:02:25.830> I've<00:02:25.980> never<00:02:26.010> really<00:02:26.849> had<00:02:27.000> in

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
honestly I've never really had in

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.300 
honestly I've never really had in
another<00:02:27.720> first-person<00:02:28.620> shooter<00:02:28.860> or<00:02:29.010> really

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
in any other video game like I can't

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.750

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
way that planetside 2 is set up with the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.920 
way that planetside 2 is set up with the
sunders<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.250> respawn<00:02:50.670> system<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.510> makes

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
sunders and the respawn system it makes

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.780 
sunders and the respawn system it makes
it<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:52.620> can<00:02:52.800> have<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.280> constant

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
it so that you can have this constant

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.000 
it so that you can have this constant
reinforcements<00:02:54.629> of<00:02:54.750> enemies<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.290> allies<00:02:55.739> on

reinforcements of enemies and allies on
your<00:02:56.220> team<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:56.819> it's<00:02:57.420> just<00:02:57.510> like<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.870> flood
