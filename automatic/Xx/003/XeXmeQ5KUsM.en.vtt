I<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.680> they<00:00:19.770> also<00:00:19.890> came<00:00:20.070> out<00:00:20.160> let's<00:00:20.310> see

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
I think they also came out let's see

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.230 
I think they also came out let's see
2500<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.119> 3500<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:23.250> an<00:00:23.490> under<00:00:23.699> hood<00:00:23.850> option

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
2500 to 3500 is an under hood option

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.730 
2500 to 3500 is an under hood option
most<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.570> them<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.810> these<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.289> great<00:00:25.500> little

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
most of them have these are great little

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.519 
most of them have these are great little
lights<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.449> this<00:00:27.449> cord<00:00:27.810> will<00:00:27.930> reach<00:00:28.109> for

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
lights to have this cord will reach for

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
lights to have this cord will reach for
an<00:00:28.590> 8<00:00:28.680> foot<00:00:28.859> long<00:00:29.099> bed<00:00:29.400> truck<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.810> works

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
an 8 foot long bed truck so it works

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810 
an 8 foot long bed truck so it works
great<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.260> my<00:00:31.410> step<00:00:31.650> side<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
great on my step side you know if you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.100 
great on my step side you know if you
ever<00:00:32.940> break<00:00:33.090> down<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.630> switch<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.840> on

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
ever break down you just switch it on

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.470 
ever break down you just switch it on
your<00:00:34.350> all<00:00:34.680> night<00:00:34.980> underneath<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.149> slide<00:00:36.270> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
your all night underneath and slide it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.790 
your all night underneath and slide it
everywhere<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> also<00:00:37.079> works<00:00:37.350> pretty<00:00:37.500> good<00:00:37.710> at

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
everywhere it also works pretty good at

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
style fuse panel all my wiring I ran up

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
style fuse panel all my wiring I ran up
in<00:00:51.120> there<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.199> conduit<00:00:52.649> all<00:00:53.160> done

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
pretty pretty good way I kept all my

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.279 
pretty pretty good way I kept all my
accessories<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.640> run<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.930> my

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
accessories are run on this all my

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
accessories are run on this all my
accessory<00:01:02.129> lights<00:01:02.340> everything<00:01:02.820> else<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.210> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
accessory lights everything else so that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.179 
accessory lights everything else so that
way<00:01:03.539> I'm<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.350> tapping<00:01:04.559> into<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> trucks

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
way I'm not tapping into the trucks

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.520 
way I'm not tapping into the trucks
existing<00:01:05.729> existing<00:01:06.240> wiring<00:01:06.689> system<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.409> do

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
existing existing wiring system to do

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 
existing existing wiring system to do
any<00:01:07.710> add-ons<00:01:08.460> which<00:01:08.790> i<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.540> pretty<00:01:09.689> good

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
any add-ons which i think is pretty good

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.300 
any add-ons which i think is pretty good
like<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> radio<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.710> everything's<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.159> done

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
like the radio and everything's all done

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.609 
like the radio and everything's all done
through<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.630> way<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.810> keep<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.229> simple

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
through here that way you keep it simple

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.350 
through here that way you keep it simple
and<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> don't<00:01:14.130> cut<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> factory<00:01:15.090> wiring

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and you don't cut up the factory wiring

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.280 
and you don't cut up the factory wiring
it<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.290> keeps<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> truck<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.979> reliable<00:01:17.460> I

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
it just keeps the truck more reliable I

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.060 
it just keeps the truck more reliable I
also<00:01:19.290> added<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.900> clutch<00:01:21.900> fan<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.890> see

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
also added a clutch fan you can see

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
also added a clutch fan you can see
right<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.570> kind<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.630> painting<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.049> like

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
right there kind of painting it up like

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.649 
right there kind of painting it up like
a<00:01:25.520> plane<00:01:26.520> propeller<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.180> something<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.600> don't

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
a plane propeller or something I don't

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.170 
a plane propeller or something I don't
know<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.530> does<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.430> did<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.880> mainly

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
know but it does I did that mainly

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
know but it does I did that mainly
because<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> go<00:01:30.840> through<00:01:30.869> deep<00:01:31.170> water

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
because when I go through deep water

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
because when I go through deep water
with<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> mechanical<00:01:32.700> fan<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> water

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
with the mechanical fan when the water

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.109 
with the mechanical fan when the water
comes<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.930> radiator<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.950> level<00:01:35.430> your

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
comes to the radiator that level your

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.280 
comes to the radiator that level your
fan<00:01:36.360> starts<00:01:36.689> hitting<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.170> you'll

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
fan starts hitting it and you'll

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.160 
fan starts hitting it and you'll
actually<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.130> even<00:01:38.250> break<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.460> fan<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
actually you can even break the fan so a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.539 
actually you can even break the fan so a
clutch<00:01:40.470> fan<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.829> once<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> hits<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> water

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
clutch fan it once it hits the water

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.760 
clutch fan it once it hits the water
will<00:01:41.729> actually<00:01:41.880> stop<00:01:42.240> spinning<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.590> that's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
will actually stop spinning so that's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.210 
will actually stop spinning so that's
why<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> added<00:01:44.220> that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.610 

inside<00:01:51.220> I<00:01:51.490> know<00:01:51.820> of<00:01:52.030> Auto<00:01:52.270> Meter<00:01:52.510> gauges<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:53.230> got

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
inside I know of Auto Meter gauges I got

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.050 
inside I know of Auto Meter gauges I got
those<00:01:53.740> out<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.070> plow<00:01:54.280> truck<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:55.000> I

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
those out of a plow truck that I

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.870 
those out of a plow truck that I
scrapped<00:01:55.390> out<00:01:55.540> for<00:01:55.750> free<00:01:56.640> they're<00:01:57.640> pretty

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
scrapped out for free they're pretty

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.820 
scrapped out for free they're pretty
nice<00:01:58.060> my<00:01:58.450> fuel<00:01:59.080> gauge<00:01:59.110> just<00:01:59.560> stopped<00:01:59.800> working

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
nice my fuel gauge just stopped working

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.760 
nice my fuel gauge just stopped working
again<00:02:00.460> I'm<00:02:00.700> not<00:02:00.820> sure<00:02:01.060> why<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:02.080> my

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
again I'm not sure why and my

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.800 
again I'm not sure why and my
temperature<00:02:03.160> gauge<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:03.610> dances<00:02:04.090> around<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:04.780> I

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
temperature gauge now dances around so I

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.140 
temperature gauge now dances around so I
need<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.170> figure<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.500> out<00:02:05.680> but<00:02:06.670> all<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.940> tack

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
need to figure that out but all the tack

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.420 
need to figure that out but all the tack
and<00:02:07.330> everything<00:02:07.630> else<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:07.930> hooked<00:02:08.140> up

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
and everything else is hooked up

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.520 
and everything else is hooked up
I<00:02:09.490> also<00:02:10.240> added<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.750> switch<00:02:11.080> right<00:02:11.320> here

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
I also added this switch right here

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.870 
I also added this switch right here
which<00:02:12.520> uses<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:14.350> which<00:02:14.740> does<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.220> reverse

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
which uses the which does the reverse

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.370 
which uses the which does the reverse
lights<00:02:16.180> because<00:02:16.570> right<00:02:16.810> now<00:02:16.960> in<00:02:17.080> writing<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
lights because right now in writing a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.490 
lights because right now in writing a
manual<00:02:17.800> was<00:02:18.400> an<00:02:18.610> automatic<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.470> because<00:02:20.470> of

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
manual was an automatic and because of

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.050 
manual was an automatic and because of
that<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.770> didn't<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.490> plug<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.030> plug

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
that I didn't have the plug to plug

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.850 
that I didn't have the plug to plug
directly<00:02:22.390> into<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.840> stick<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.410> ran<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.740> on<00:02:23.830> a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
directly into the stick so I ran it on a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.250 
directly into the stick so I ran it on a
toggle<00:02:24.160> switch<00:02:24.520> now<00:02:25.300> what<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.780> also<00:02:26.080> good

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
toggle switch now what this is also good

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.830 
toggle switch now what this is also good
for<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.650> if<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:26.880> off-road<00:02:27.880> at<00:02:28.030> night<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.690> can

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
for is if you off-road at night you can

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.860 
for is if you off-road at night you can
turn<00:02:28.990> on<00:02:29.170> your<00:02:29.290> lights<00:02:30.240> your<00:02:31.240> backup<00:02:31.630> lights

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
turn on your lights your backup lights

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.390 
turn on your lights your backup lights
and<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.110> helps<00:02:32.380> illuminate<00:02:32.590> what's<00:02:33.010> behind

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
and that helps illuminate what's behind

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.550 
and that helps illuminate what's behind
you<00:02:33.640> as<00:02:34.000> well<00:02:34.300> as<00:02:34.510> if<00:02:34.780> you're<00:02:35.140> hooking<00:02:35.380> up<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
you as well as if you're hooking up a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.990 
you as well as if you're hooking up a
trailer<00:02:35.830> or<00:02:36.010> something<00:02:36.310> tonight<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.580> can<00:02:36.850> just

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
trailer or something tonight I can just

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.970 
trailer or something tonight I can just
flip<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.209> on<00:02:37.330> on<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.540> toggle<00:02:37.900> switch<00:02:38.080> once<00:02:38.830> I

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
flip it on on the toggle switch once I

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.500 
flip it on on the toggle switch once I
do<00:02:39.040> get<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.520> right<00:02:39.640> connector<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:40.390> when

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
do get the right connector so that when

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.090 
do get the right connector so that when
I<00:02:40.540> put<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.020> reverse<00:02:41.050> on<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.560> transmission

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
I put it in reverse on that transmission

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.410 
I put it in reverse on that transmission
the<00:02:42.280> lights<00:02:42.459> will<00:02:42.610> automatically<00:02:43.090> come<00:02:43.300> on

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
the lights will automatically come on

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.510 
the lights will automatically come on
I'll<00:02:43.990> keep<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.320> toggle<00:02:44.650> switch<00:02:44.860> in<00:02:45.070> line<00:02:45.280> so

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
I'll keep the toggle switch in line so

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520 
I'll keep the toggle switch in line so
that<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.880> still<00:02:46.150> override<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.230> have

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
that I can still override it and have

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.229 
that I can still override it and have
them<00:02:47.740> on<00:02:48.030> now<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.150> an<00:02:49.270> automatic<00:02:50.850> up<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:52.060> there

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
them on now in an automatic up in there

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.850 
them on now in an automatic up in there
at<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.450> base<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.870> column<00:02:53.110> there's<00:02:53.830> a

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
at the base of the column there's a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.160 
at the base of the column there's a
couple<00:02:54.130> wires<00:02:54.459> going<00:02:54.760> in<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.209> figured<00:02:55.780> exactly

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
couple wires going in I figured exactly

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.440 
couple wires going in I figured exactly
which<00:02:56.350> set<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.860> but<00:02:57.130> one<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.430> sets<00:02:57.700> does

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
which set it is but one of the sets does

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.350 
which set it is but one of the sets does
the<00:02:59.230> reverse<00:02:59.440> lights<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.640> what<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.790> found<00:03:01.120> is

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
the reverse lights so what I found is

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.410 
the reverse lights so what I found is
that<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:02.320> could<00:03:03.160> use<00:03:03.370> Spade<00:03:03.730> connectors<00:03:04.209> on<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
that I could use Spade connectors on the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.970 
that I could use Spade connectors on the
two<00:03:04.690> posts<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.230> come<00:03:05.380> out<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.709> switch

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
two posts that come out of the switch

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.890 
two posts that come out of the switch
and<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.850> wire<00:03:07.060> directly<00:03:07.330> into<00:03:07.690> switch

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
and just wire directly into switch

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.050 
and just wire directly into switch
without<00:03:08.260> having<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.530> cut<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.709> single<00:03:08.920> wire<00:03:09.220> and

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
without having to cut a single wire and

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.460 
without having to cut a single wire and
obviously<00:03:10.540> whenever<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.050> avoid<00:03:11.200> cutting

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
obviously whenever you can avoid cutting

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.699 
obviously whenever you can avoid cutting
wires<00:03:11.739> it's<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.730> good<00:03:12.880> thing<00:03:13.140> I'm<00:03:14.140> planning<00:03:14.470> on

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
wires it's a good thing I'm planning on

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.320 
wires it's a good thing I'm planning on
putting<00:03:14.769> in<00:03:15.070> a<00:03:15.130> tilt<00:03:15.370> palm<00:03:15.550> in<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:15.880> truck<00:03:16.180> so

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
putting in a tilt palm in this truck so

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.110 
putting in a tilt palm in this truck so
when<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.510> do<00:03:16.630> that

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.589 

you<00:03:20.629> know<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.750> may<00:03:21.019> change<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.890> over<00:03:22.099> to<00:03:22.250> a

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
you know I may change it over to a

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.550 
you know I may change it over to a
standard<00:03:23.599> column<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.170> then<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.379> could

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
standard column and then I could

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.300 
standard column and then I could
eliminate<00:03:24.860> that<00:03:25.250> system<00:03:25.670> but<00:03:26.000> for<00:03:26.209> right<00:03:26.330> now

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
eliminate that system but for right now

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.330 
eliminate that system but for right now
see<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:30.080> you'll<00:03:30.260> only<00:03:30.410> come<00:03:30.739> on<00:03:30.860> with<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.160> key

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
see and you'll only come on with the key

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.680 
see and you'll only come on with the key
on<00:03:31.370> which<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.879> also<00:03:32.060> good<00:03:32.330> because<00:03:32.390> then<00:03:32.599> you

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
on which is also good because then you

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.809 
on which is also good because then you
can't<00:03:32.900> leave<00:03:33.050> your<00:03:33.200> averts<00:03:33.470> lights<00:03:33.739> on<00:03:33.920> if<00:03:34.340> you

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
can't leave your averts lights on if you

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.869 
can't leave your averts lights on if you
do<00:03:34.970> leave<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.209> switch<00:03:35.420> on<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:37.489> as<00:03:37.549> you<00:03:37.670> can<00:03:37.819> see

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
do leave the switch on so as you can see

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.539 
do leave the switch on so as you can see
that<00:03:39.940> on<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:42.410> also<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:42.739> did<00:03:42.920> this<00:03:43.069> light<00:03:43.280> under

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
that on and also I did this light under

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.589 
that on and also I did this light under
the<00:03:43.580> bumper<00:03:44.200> here<00:03:45.200> under<00:03:45.440> that<00:03:45.560> tilt<00:03:46.599> under

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.770 
the tail pan for the rear end of the bed
so<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:52.220> it's<00:03:52.579> protected<00:03:53.150> but<00:03:53.329> also<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.750> gives

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
so that it's protected but also it gives

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.720 
so that it's protected but also it gives
me<00:03:54.110> light<00:03:54.319> for<00:03:54.680> right<00:03:55.010> on<00:03:55.040> my<00:03:55.250> trailer<00:03:55.579> hitch

probably job throughout five but I've

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.689

again<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.460> is<00:05:14.550> cold<00:05:15.140> probably<00:05:16.140> like<00:05:16.350> I<00:05:16.470> said<00:05:16.680> 35

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
again it is cold probably like I said 35

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.640 
again it is cold probably like I said 35
degrees<00:05:17.400> Fahrenheit<00:05:17.850> out<00:05:18.350> maybe<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:19.470> little

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
degrees Fahrenheit out maybe a little

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.940 
degrees Fahrenheit out maybe a little
colder<00:05:20.010> so<00:05:20.630> that's<00:05:21.630> why<00:05:21.780> that's<00:05:21.990> slow<00:05:22.230> as<00:05:22.770> you

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
colder so that's why that's slow as you

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.890 
colder so that's why that's slow as you
can<00:05:22.980> see<00:05:23.190> it's<00:05:23.580> still<00:05:23.820> cold<00:05:24.030> on<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.330> motor

it's reading below e

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.780 
it's reading below e
so<00:05:38.320> I<00:05:38.350> need<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.800> figure<00:05:38.980> out<00:05:39.220> why<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.430> would<00:05:39.640> do

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
so I need to figure out why it would do

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.670 
so I need to figure out why it would do
that<00:05:39.910> I<00:05:40.030> know<00:05:40.090> if<00:05:40.300> it<00:05:40.420> reads<00:05:40.630> over<00:05:41.110> full<00:05:41.380> that

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
that I know if it reads over full that

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.280 
that I know if it reads over full that
your<00:05:41.950> lead<00:05:42.730> wire<00:05:43.000> he's<00:05:43.420> shorted<00:05:43.810> out<00:05:43.900> it's<00:05:44.140> not

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
your lead wire he's shorted out it's not

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.830 
your lead wire he's shorted out it's not
connecting<00:05:45.180> so<00:05:46.180> I'm<00:05:46.240> guessing<00:05:46.570> that<00:05:46.630> this<00:05:46.780> is

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
connecting so I'm guessing that this is

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.590

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230
