00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.330 
seven cars running this down and you had
proper<00:05:14.479> drivers<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:15.020> can<00:05:15.139> hold<00:05:15.320> a<00:05:15.470> line<00:05:15.710> this

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
proper drivers that can hold a line this

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.400 
proper drivers that can hold a line this
would<00:05:16.610> be<00:05:16.760> some<00:05:17.060> crazy<00:05:17.450> damn<00:05:17.840> footage<00:05:18.289> you

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
would be some crazy damn footage you

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.629 
would be some crazy damn footage you
guys<00:05:18.530> I'm<00:05:18.710> telling<00:05:18.979> you<00:05:19.039> this<00:05:19.160> right<00:05:19.220> now<00:05:19.580> it

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
guys I'm telling you this right now it

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.969 
guys I'm telling you this right now it
would<00:05:19.789> be<00:05:19.820> epic<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.570> watch<00:05:20.780> this<00:05:21.080> even<00:05:21.860> you

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
would be epic to watch this even you

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.879 
would be epic to watch this even you
know<00:05:22.070> saving<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.520> replay<00:05:22.910> if<00:05:23.870> there<00:05:24.260> was<00:05:24.470> but

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
know saving a replay if there was but

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.260 
know saving a replay if there was but
you<00:05:25.039> know<00:05:25.160> we<00:05:25.310> both<00:05:25.490> know<00:05:25.700> that<00:05:25.760> there's<00:05:26.060> not

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
you know we both know that there's not

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.450 
you know we both know that there's not
it<00:05:26.870> would<00:05:27.080> be<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.229> crazy<00:05:27.620> damn<00:05:27.950> race<00:05:28.220> now

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
it would be a crazy damn race now

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.100 
it would be a crazy damn race now
obviously<00:05:29.060> you<00:05:29.150> have<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.360> watch<00:05:29.660> out<00:05:29.870> for<00:05:29.990> the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
obviously you have to watch out for the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.290 
obviously you have to watch out for the
obstacles<00:05:30.620> so<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:31.220> is<00:05:31.400> a<00:05:31.430> little<00:05:31.700> bit<00:05:31.850> tougher

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
obstacles so it is a little bit tougher

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.879 
obstacles so it is a little bit tougher
obviously<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:32.810> got<00:05:32.990> to<00:05:33.080> be<00:05:33.229> really<00:05:33.770> really

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
obviously you got to be really really

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.230 
obviously you got to be really really
paying<00:05:34.250> attention<00:05:34.340> to<00:05:34.760> where<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.030> guys<00:05:35.180> are

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
paying attention to where you guys are

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.420 
paying attention to where you guys are
you<00:05:36.020> know<00:05:36.139> knowing<00:05:36.410> your<00:05:36.650> cornering<00:05:37.010> points

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
you know knowing your cornering points

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.400 
you know knowing your cornering points
and<00:05:37.580> stuff<00:05:37.669> like<00:05:37.820> that<00:05:38.030> too<00:05:38.300> but<00:05:38.539> making<00:05:39.260> sure

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
and stuff like that too but making sure

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.540 
and stuff like that too but making sure
that<00:05:39.500> you're<00:05:39.680> hitting<00:05:39.770> your<00:05:40.010> braking<00:05:40.340> lines

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
that you're hitting your braking lines

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.610 
that you're hitting your braking lines
are<00:05:40.850> essential<00:05:41.360> on<00:05:41.510> this<00:05:41.720> just<00:05:42.110> because<00:05:42.470> you

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
are essential on this just because you

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.930 
are essential on this just because you
know

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
know

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.970 
know
should<00:05:43.150> fall<00:05:43.330> off<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:43.690> track<00:05:43.990> it's<00:05:44.590> very

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
should fall off the track it's very

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.950 
should fall off the track it's very
tough<00:05:45.340> to<00:05:45.610> really<00:05:45.790> regain<00:05:46.090> what's<00:05:46.570> going<00:05:46.840> on

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
tough to really regain what's going on

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.840 
tough to really regain what's going on
and<00:05:47.140> forth<00:05:47.350> I<00:05:47.500> mean<00:05:47.650> on<00:05:47.800> gta5<00:05:48.430> you<00:05:48.760> know

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
and forth I mean on gta5 you know

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.730 
and forth I mean on gta5 you know
obviously<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.780> physics<00:05:50.170> aren't<00:05:50.440> as<00:05:50.530> well

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
obviously the physics aren't as well

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.100 
obviously the physics aren't as well
there<00:05:51.010> so<00:05:51.310> it<00:05:52.270> is<00:05:52.360> a<00:05:52.390> little<00:05:52.660> bit<00:05:52.780> easier<00:05:53.050> to

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
there so it is a little bit easier to

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.870 
there so it is a little bit easier to
save<00:05:53.440> it<00:05:53.650> but<00:05:54.190> just<00:05:54.310> making<00:05:54.550> sure<00:05:54.700> you<00:05:54.790> hit

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
save it but just making sure you hit

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.280 
save it but just making sure you hit
your<00:05:55.030> breaking<00:05:55.300> lines<00:05:55.480> will<00:05:55.660> ensure<00:05:55.930> you<00:05:56.080> guys

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
your breaking lines will ensure you guys

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.710 
your breaking lines will ensure you guys
have<00:05:56.530> like<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.890> fastest<00:05:57.520> damn<00:05:58.120> lap<00:05:58.480> time

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
have like the fastest damn lap time

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.590 
have like the fastest damn lap time
possible<00:05:59.470> so<00:05:59.710> um<00:06:00.520> right<00:06:01.120> there<00:06:01.330> we<00:06:01.480> hit<00:06:01.540> a

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
possible so um right there we hit a

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.900 
possible so um right there we hit a
minute<00:06:01.930> 30<00:06:02.200> I<00:06:02.350> was<00:06:02.800> you<00:06:03.070> know<00:06:03.100> I<00:06:03.430> had<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.730> catch

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
minute 30 I was you know I had to catch

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.300 
minute 30 I was you know I had to catch
up<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.240> little<00:06:04.390> bit<00:06:04.570> and<00:06:04.720> wait<00:06:04.900> up<00:06:05.080> but<00:06:05.350> I<00:06:05.560> said

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
up a little bit and wait up but I said

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.010 
up a little bit and wait up but I said
it's<00:06:06.460> not<00:06:06.580> bad<00:06:06.850> we<00:06:07.120> are<00:06:07.210> hitting<00:06:07.420> on<00:06:07.570> the<00:06:07.660> final

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
it's not bad we are hitting on the final

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.540 
it's not bad we are hitting on the final
lap<00:06:08.170> right<00:06:08.440> here<00:06:08.620> and<00:06:08.770> I'm<00:06:08.860> gonna<00:06:09.010> try<00:06:09.250> and<00:06:09.310> run

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
lap right here and I'm gonna try and run

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.450 
lap right here and I'm gonna try and run
IWI's<00:06:10.060> down<00:06:10.420> and<00:06:10.810> we<00:06:11.560> had<00:06:11.680> some<00:06:11.950> pretty<00:06:12.130> solid

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
IWI's down and we had some pretty solid

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.270 
IWI's down and we had some pretty solid
cars<00:06:12.910> I<00:06:13.030> mean<00:06:13.270> oh<00:06:13.480> my<00:06:13.900> god<00:06:14.710> I<00:06:14.740> cannot<00:06:15.220> believe

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
cars I mean oh my god I cannot believe

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.620 
cars I mean oh my god I cannot believe
it<00:06:15.520> at<00:06:15.730> that<00:06:15.880> tree<00:06:16.060> right<00:06:16.090> there

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
it at that tree right there

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.170 
it at that tree right there
we<00:06:17.020> had<00:06:17.110> some<00:06:17.290> solid<00:06:17.500> cars<00:06:17.920> he<00:06:18.430> did<00:06:18.670> pull<00:06:18.940> away

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
we had some solid cars he did pull away

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.850 
we had some solid cars he did pull away
from<00:06:19.390> me<00:06:19.510> right<00:06:19.540> here<00:06:19.840> but<00:06:20.050> obviously<00:06:20.470> the<00:06:20.650> use

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
from me right here but obviously the use

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.490 
from me right here but obviously the use
of<00:06:21.190> the<00:06:21.370> drafting<00:06:21.880> is<00:06:22.230> essential<00:06:23.230> in<00:06:23.350> this

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
of the drafting is essential in this

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.200 
of the drafting is essential in this
game<00:06:23.680> and<00:06:23.860> that's<00:06:23.950> really<00:06:24.250> what<00:06:24.520> saved<00:06:24.850> us<00:06:25.060> on

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
game and that's really what saved us on

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.180 
game and that's really what saved us on
there<00:06:25.450> getting<00:06:26.080> the<00:06:26.170> draft<00:06:26.470> and<00:06:26.680> also<00:06:26.950> hitting

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
there getting the draft and also hitting

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.710 
there getting the draft and also hitting
those<00:06:27.370> corners<00:06:27.850> properly<00:06:28.300> now<00:06:28.420> right<00:06:28.570> there

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
those corners properly now right there

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.200 
those corners properly now right there
as<00:06:28.810> I<00:06:28.900> said<00:06:28.930> we<00:06:29.200> hit<00:06:29.320> the<00:06:29.440> braking<00:06:29.800> lines

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
as I said we hit the braking lines

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.830 
as I said we hit the braking lines
perfectly<00:06:31.210> on<00:06:31.420> that<00:06:31.450> corner<00:06:32.050> and<00:06:32.260> really

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
perfectly on that corner and really

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.390 
perfectly on that corner and really
solidified<00:06:34.840> catching<00:06:35.830> up<00:06:35.980> and<00:06:36.190> really

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
solidified catching up and really

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.680 
solidified catching up and really
passing<00:06:36.880> them<00:06:36.970> right<00:06:37.120> there<00:06:37.300> that<00:06:37.480> was<00:06:37.600> the

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
passing them right there that was the

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.800 
passing them right there that was the
main<00:06:37.870> thing<00:06:38.080> just<00:06:38.380> out<00:06:39.220> and<00:06:39.520> during<00:06:40.480> the<00:06:40.630> other

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
main thing just out and during the other

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.330 
main thing just out and during the other
opponent<00:06:41.320> making<00:06:41.770> sure<00:06:42.010> that<00:06:42.190> you<00:06:42.250> know

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
opponent making sure that you know

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.920 
opponent making sure that you know
you're<00:06:42.670> waiting<00:06:42.880> for<00:06:43.210> their<00:06:43.330> slip-up<00:06:43.780> and

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
you're waiting for their slip-up and
