 Hi, I'm Cecilia and today I show you how 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.210
 make a relief in the kandinsky style and 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.920
 We are going to need a cardboard mounted 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.560
 buy in any art bookstore 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.379
 here I have cut out some forms in 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.419
 cardboard with a finite cardboard this relief 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.029
 in the style of kandinsky reminds us of the 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:24.689
 painter because he worked justly 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.680
 with simple geometric shapes we are going to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.130
 paste the shapes 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.080
 vinyl glue in the cardboard the cola 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.170
 vinyl has to be pure undiluted 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.420
 what is interesting for the relief is 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.000
 that you put the figures by 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 example that can be superimposed as 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.550
 Arrange different floors with the shapes 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.239
 changes that called to this 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.000
 composition and what we can add are 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.970
 some shapes that we think of in 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.149
 relief to the line with sticks of 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.470
 brooches and we have some sticks on hand 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.170
 we will also incorporate them into the 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:10.920
 and this game will stick 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.950
 paper painter's tape and now what 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.409
 let's do is the technique of the letter 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.850
 put and we're going to start covering all 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.330
 the surface of the relief with papers of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:29.340
 kitchen roll a container with cola 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.490
 biblical water in equal parts 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.340
 it has to dry and then we are going to paint 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.850
 Now that it's dry and we're going to paint it 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.640
 with fluorine colors 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.619
 you can mix the tones and so on 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 the relief remains in the Kandinsky style 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.330
 finished 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.670
 and what we did was the simple forms 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.159
 that we had trimmed them we went 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.530
 sticking with vinyl glue and then for 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.110
 make the chart we use the paper 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.170
 of stream with vinyl glue and water 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.050
 when it dried we painted it with colors 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.460
 fl uo to give it a pop touch 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.600
