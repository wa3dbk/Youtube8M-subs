00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:14.519
 Sweden's deepest winter and tested 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.519
 once more under extreme conditions 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.990
 it is the bare ice on which the 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.240
 fendt tractors have to prove 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.310
 Finally, the new abs system 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.649
 not just on dry ground anymore 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.720
 security but just on 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.190
 snow ice or gravel 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.190
 reacts accordingly 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.450
 the direct comparison shows the successes 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.270
 clearly far more effective 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.100
 evasive maneuvers and significantly shorter 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.100
 braking distances with abs 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.820
 thus stops one from the car and truck 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.430
 area known security feature now 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.880
 also with tractors indent abs 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.880
 Of course, first in the field, as standard
