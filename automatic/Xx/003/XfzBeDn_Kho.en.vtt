weight or losing weight you make that

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.150 
weight or losing weight you make that
target<00:05:32.570> so<00:05:32.720> we've<00:05:32.930> targeted<00:05:33.230> kids<00:05:33.710> starting

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
target so we've targeted kids starting

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.010 
target so we've targeted kids starting
spring<00:05:34.340> ball<00:05:34.610> target<00:05:34.850> weight<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:35.390> I<00:05:35.540> think

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
spring ball target weight and I think

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.240 
spring ball target weight and I think
we're<00:05:36.110> on<00:05:36.140> track<00:05:36.380> ball<00:05:36.650> see<00:05:36.920> we<00:05:37.070> need<00:05:37.190> to

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
we're on track ball see we need to

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.770 
we're on track ball see we need to
continue<00:05:37.640> to<00:05:37.700> get<00:05:37.820> faster<00:05:38.240> but<00:05:38.420> we<00:05:38.510> got<00:05:38.630> to<00:05:38.720> get

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
continue to get faster but we got to get

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.850 
continue to get faster but we got to get
bigger<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.140> stronger<00:05:39.320> as<00:05:39.530> we<00:05:39.560> do<00:05:39.710> those

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
bigger and stronger as we do those

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.070 
bigger and stronger as we do those
things
