00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
this case I separated my strings into a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.320 
this case I separated my strings into a
bunch<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.010> pre-recorded<00:02:56.670> instruments<00:02:57.209> I've

then on I had that set to ring for very

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.150 
then on I had that set to ring for very
long<00:03:05.760> time<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.900> solo<00:03:07.200> over<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.709> using

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
long time so I can solo over it using

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.770 
long time so I can solo over it using
this<00:03:08.880> synth<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.480> my<00:03:09.630> g<00:03:09.810> string<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:11.600> can<00:03:12.600> have
