00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.450
 we are back back with everything you and since one talks so much about 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.719
 technology 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.329
 that talks about new devices of crisis 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:16.309
 electronics 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.449
 behind all this there is something that is an extremely small device 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.710
 which is the reflection of the development of nanotechnology 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.990
 is the technology of the minutes and the microprocessors are what you in 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.720
 screens a microprocessor 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.160
 and that little one 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.550
 something that you are not used to seeing Slavic you do the brain of the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.670
 electronic devices the microprocessors as their name what 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.269
 indicates 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.449
 are small processors are what make possible all the activities that 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.920
 our electronic devices carry out and we are going now 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.969
 to present a video so you have more detail information on how 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.739
 is made of how this whole process of good myths occurs now let's go 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.739
 to see it thanks to the discovery people are backing 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.450
 the size of 20 refrigerators 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.550
 in the 50s the transistors replaced the bulky tubes of 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.160
 empty then integrated circuits replaced the transistors 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.340
 but the biggest breakthrough was achieved in 1971 with the microprocessor 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.040
 all the components were concentrated in a tiny chip 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 that was the starting point of the personal computer 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.460
 you start with a ceramic square called sustenance 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.000
 this is the one that will take the microchip 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.060
 a machine coats the surface that the substrate 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.430
 with a chemical that makes it sticky 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.520
 this will keep the microchip in place until it welds 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.390
 the factory receives the ready microchips with all the circuits in place 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.290
 a microchip is placed 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.290
 in each substrate 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.439
 an infrared light there to the machine for the placement of the chip in place 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.439
 Right 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.749
 a sample is removed from the production line to verify the 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.749
 positioning with a microscope 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.669
 the next step is to go to a soldering iron at 3 165 degrees Celsius 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.229
 the heat that melts small tailsheets positioned on the chip 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.189
 fixing ourselves to the substrate 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.339
 then an aluminum cap is prepared to release on each microchips 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.309
 the lid will have two functions 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.149
 protect the chip 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.499
 and dissipate the heat that this generates 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.499
 two 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.430
 a robotic arm 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.419
 collect four caps at a time 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.419
 and the positions on the microchip 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.909
 oo 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.219
 they remain for one hour in the welding furnace at 150 degrees centigrade 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:48.429
 the next step is to create the electrical connections that will connect the 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:52.129
 microprocessor with electronic computer board 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.349
 you start with small cylindrical eyelash pieces called colombia 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.219
 Tin conducts electricity 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.269
 a huge suction screen will live until the columns fall through the 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.709
 holes 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.759
 this makes them line up vertically so they can be fixed to the substrate 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.559
 a machine is like an error that adhesive paste 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.919
 and then fix the vertical columns to it from below 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.240
 I a robotic arm position the substrate that carries the chip on the 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.620
 Columns 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.990
 the result 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.990
 It is a microchip with thousands of connections 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.550
 To obtain more connections, tin pellets are used in replacement of the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.779
 columns 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:54.050
 they are more resistant and more reliable they also go through a screen 

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:58.619
 suction only that they do not fix compact decide if they do not confuse t the substance 

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:01.619
 chemistry used to position the microchip in the substrate 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.539
 min 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.089
 The finished microchip plus water and solvents 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.369
 To eliminate any excess flux there were other residues 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.919
 goody the last step is the quality control 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.439
 the microprocessors are put up to 12 hours in a furnace heated to 140 degrees 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.509
 centigrade 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.490
 then the units go to another factory 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.800
 where they are released to an electronic card that will later go inside 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.800
 of the computer 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.879
 you have lived gentlemen pp vilero 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:06.039
 courtesy of discovery channel what the ica how a microprocessor is manufactured 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.119
 and you may wonder but what has to do the best for asador with us 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.459
 good the micro why is now the basis of computing with ute as the 

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:16.689
 computer one of the fundamental elements that you have to take in 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.739
 account the processing in what aspect in its speed the speed of the processor 

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:24.580
 is what determines how fast your computer is still more than not 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.159
 only the hard drive ram memory and other elements have progressed 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.199
 but the processor determines how fast your computer works and in the 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.909
 currently controls buying a computer preferably having d1 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:41.349
 bundesliga onwards to arrive 3 or the number of cycles of markina 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:45.990
 task speed that can be this device so important that is the 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.059
 not from microelectronics and that's why we wanted to share with you these 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:53.400
 information do not know brave can peace poplar explain what is going on 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:56.979
 of the indotel I have an institutional crisis the indotel is not 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:59.539
 fulfilling its responsibility and we will tell you why 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:02.509
 after this brief commercial break you can not 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:03.639
 two
