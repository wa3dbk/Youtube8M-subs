00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
got 40 different and what we would like

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.710 
got 40 different and what we would like
to<00:03:44.830> hope<00:03:45.100> is<00:03:45.280> well<00:03:45.490> balanced<00:03:45.940> champions<00:03:46.510> that

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
to hope is well balanced champions that

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.660 
to hope is well balanced champions that
you<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.380> just<00:03:47.530> choose<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:48.040> pick<00:03:48.160> from<00:03:48.400> and

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
you can just choose and pick from and

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.310 
you can just choose and pick from and
your<00:03:49.000> friends<00:03:49.420> can<00:03:49.570> choose<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.020> pick<00:03:50.110> from

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
your friends can choose and pick from

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.050 
your friends can choose and pick from
and<00:03:50.560> develop<00:03:51.160> strategies<00:03:51.610> using<00:03:51.850> these

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
and develop strategies using these

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.090 
and develop strategies using these
characters<00:03:52.480> together<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.590> big<00:03:53.740> ones<00:03:53.950> are

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
characters together so the big ones are

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.830 
characters together so the big ones are
we<00:03:54.400> spend<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.670> lot<00:03:54.820> of<00:03:54.850> time<00:03:54.970> on<00:03:55.240> balance<00:03:55.630> and

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
we spend a lot of time on balance and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.780 
we spend a lot of time on balance and
like<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.680> said<00:03:56.740> earlier<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.250> most<00:03:57.430> important

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
like I said earlier the most important

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.280 
like I said earlier the most important
one<00:03:57.820> it's<00:03:58.150> free<00:03:58.420> we're<00:03:58.840> going<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.020> let<00:03:59.140> the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
one it's free we're going to let the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.930 
one it's free we're going to let the
consumer<00:03:59.470> be<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.950> judge<00:04:00.160> of<00:04:00.370> whether<00:04:00.730> they

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
consumer be the judge of whether they

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.670 
consumer be the judge of whether they
like<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.150> or<00:04:01.330> not<00:04:01.450> just<00:04:02.230> looking<00:04:02.500> at<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
like it or not just looking at the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.890 
like it or not just looking at the
graphics<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.280> garage<00:04:03.520> and<00:04:03.550> it's<00:04:03.910> very

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
graphics of the garage and it's very

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.960 
graphics of the garage and it's very
very<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.650> seems<00:04:05.980> at<00:04:06.220> least<00:04:06.250> very<00:04:06.730> very

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970
