a sheet of paper and drew out a handle
design<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.359> took<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.200> picture<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.889> which<00:01:44.189> I

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
design I took a picture of it which I

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.129 
design I took a picture of it which I
could<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.579> scanned<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.389> I<00:01:45.420> used<00:01:45.719> in<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.139 
could have scanned it then I used in the

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.239 
could have scanned it then I used in the
computer<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.859> I<00:01:47.039> used<00:01:47.340> gimp<00:01:48.209> which<00:01:48.869> is

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
computer and I used gimp which is

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.609 
computer and I used gimp which is
basically<00:01:50.249> free<00:01:50.579> photoshop<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:52.200> edited

copies<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.359> the<00:02:00.899> printout

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
copies of the printout

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.110 
copies of the printout
and<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.500> glued<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.040> onto<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.280> piece<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.550> wood<00:02:04.850> that

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
and I glued it onto a piece of wood that

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.080 
and I glued it onto a piece of wood that
I<00:02:06.020> cut<00:02:06.350> in<00:02:06.440> half<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.400> i<00:02:07.430> could<00:02:07.580> have<00:02:07.670> two<00:02:07.850> pieces

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
I cut in half so i could have two pieces

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.750 
I cut in half so i could have two pieces
and<00:02:08.630> then<00:02:09.619> i<00:02:09.650> used<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:11.200> dremel<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.340> carved

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
and then i used a dremel and I carved

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.970 
and then i used a dremel and I carved
out<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.150> shape<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.200> i<00:02:15.260> can<00:02:15.440> get<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.680> shape

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
out the shape so i can get the shape

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.090 
out the shape so i can get the shape
that<00:02:16.010> i<00:02:16.250> needed<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.350> most<00:02:18.620> challenging

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
that i needed and the most challenging

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.580 
that i needed and the most challenging
part<00:02:19.340> about<00:02:19.520> this<00:02:19.790> because<00:02:20.480> i'm<00:02:20.930> still<00:02:21.230> kind

fit into and after a while of working on

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.320 
fit into and after a while of working on
this<00:02:40.070> I've<00:02:40.850> gotten<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.540> fit<00:02:41.780> pretty<00:02:42.380> well

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
this I've gotten it to fit pretty well

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.210 
this I've gotten it to fit pretty well
basically<00:02:44.330> I<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:44.600> made<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> chisel<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.530> had<00:02:46.190> a

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
basically I just made a chisel I had a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.420 
basically I just made a chisel I had a
scrap<00:02:46.640> piece<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:47.000> steel<00:02:47.240> from<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.990> binder<00:02:48.440> this

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
scrap piece of steel from a binder this

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.430 
scrap piece of steel from a binder this
is<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.700> behind<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.900> thin<00:02:51.680> metal<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.110> see

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
is a behind the thin metal that you see

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.550 
is a behind the thin metal that you see
when<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:55.010> open<00:02:55.040> up<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.640> binder<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:57.320> thing's

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
when you open up a binder this thing's

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.540 
when you open up a binder this thing's
bent<00:02:57.920> for<00:02:58.190> some<00:02:58.370> reason<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:59.690> I<00:02:59.980> just<00:03:00.980> put<00:03:01.520> a

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
bent for some reason but I just put a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.630 
bent for some reason but I just put a
bevel<00:03:01.910> on<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.180> using<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:03.050> file<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.830> then

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
bevel on it using a file and then

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.340 
bevel on it using a file and then
sharpened<00:03:05.240> it<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.390> little<00:03:05.600> bit<00:03:05.810> using<00:03:06.110> very

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
sharpened it a little bit using very

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.190 
sharpened it a little bit using very
fine<00:03:06.620> sandpaper<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.420> got<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.600> good<00:03:08.840> edge<00:03:08.989> on

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
fine sandpaper and it got a good edge on

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.930 
fine sandpaper and it got a good edge on
it<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:11.120> then<00:03:11.270> I<00:03:11.300> simply<00:03:12.140> carved<00:03:13.040> out<00:03:13.280> this

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
it and then I simply carved out this

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.199 
it and then I simply carved out this
entire<00:03:14.180> thing<00:03:15.430> going<00:03:16.430> along<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.970> grain

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
entire thing going along the grain

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.640 
entire thing going along the grain
because<00:03:17.480> going<00:03:17.720> against<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.260> would<00:03:18.470> be

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
because going against it would be

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.160 
because going against it would be
impossible<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.180> had<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.360> go<00:03:20.480> with<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.959> grain

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
impossible so I had to go with the grain

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.910 
impossible so I had to go with the grain
which<00:03:22.010> took<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.250> long<00:03:22.489> time<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:23.500> after<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.530> got

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
which took a long time and after I got

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.280 
which took a long time and after I got
most<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.610> this<00:03:25.760> channel<00:03:26.060> doubt<00:03:26.300> i<00:03:26.540> managed<00:03:27.140> to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
most of this channel doubt i managed to

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.330 
most of this channel doubt i managed to
fit<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.190> Dremel<00:03:28.550> into<00:03:28.850> these<00:03:28.970> edges<00:03:29.600> and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
fit the Dremel into these edges and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.590 
fit the Dremel into these edges and
clean<00:03:31.340> them<00:03:31.519> up<00:03:31.640> just<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:32.000> little<00:03:32.150> bit<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:32.570> that

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
clean them up just a little bit so that

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.130 
clean them up just a little bit so that
it<00:03:32.930> would<00:03:33.080> fit<00:03:33.320> onto<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:34.010> tang<00:03:34.730> better

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.620 

for<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:37.800> back<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.580> have<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.730> bit

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
for the back of this I just have a bit

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.400 
for the back of this I just have a bit
of<00:03:39.660> cloth<00:03:40.350> but<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.010> taped<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.520> I<00:03:41.810> put<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.930> into<00:03:43.260> my

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
of cloth but I taped on I put it into my

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.460 
of cloth but I taped on I put it into my
palm<00:03:43.700> like<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.990> and<00:03:45.990> I<00:03:46.110> push<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.190> car

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
palm like this and I push on it to car

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.580 
palm like this and I push on it to car
so<00:03:49.470> after<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:50.430> lot<00:03:50.550> more<00:03:50.940> work<00:03:51.209> managed<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.410> get

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
so after a lot more work managed to get

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.050 
so after a lot more work managed to get
both<00:03:53.010> handle<00:03:53.550> scales<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.180> now<00:03:54.930> I'm<00:03:55.380> going<00:03:55.740> to

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
both handle scales and now I'm going to

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.000 
both handle scales and now I'm going to
do<00:03:57.060> something<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.720> also<00:03:57.959> didn't<00:03:58.440> do<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.830> my

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
do something that I also didn't do on my

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.440 
do something that I also didn't do on my
other<00:03:59.250> knife<00:03:59.580> which<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.720> drill<00:04:01.140> holes<00:04:01.470> and

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
other knife which is drill holes and

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.170 
other knife which is drill holes and
insert<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.510> pen<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.310> don't<00:04:05.310> have<00:04:05.489> any<00:04:05.640> breasts

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
insert a pen I don't have any breasts

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.390 
insert a pen I don't have any breasts
and<00:04:06.360> I<00:04:06.900> also<00:04:07.080> don't<00:04:07.530> know<00:04:07.709> where<00:04:07.920> i<00:04:07.950> could<00:04:08.100> buy

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
and I also don't know where i could buy

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.020 
and I also don't know where i could buy
these<00:04:08.700> in<00:04:09.120> my<00:04:09.660> small<00:04:10.050> little<00:04:10.290> town<00:04:10.670> so<00:04:11.670> i<00:04:11.700> found

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
these in my small little town so i found

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.290 
these in my small little town so i found
some<00:04:12.360> steel<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.250> guess<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:14.430> steel<00:04:14.700> wire<00:04:14.970> or

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
some steel I guess it's steel wire or

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.449 
some steel I guess it's steel wire or
something<00:04:15.450> it's<00:04:15.900> 18<00:04:16.350> inch<00:04:16.739> thick<00:04:17.130> it's

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
something it's 18 inch thick it's

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.810 
something it's 18 inch thick it's
actually<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.299> rod<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:19.350> really<00:04:19.980> hard<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.609> then

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
actually a rod it's really hard to then

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.390 
actually a rod it's really hard to then
so<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.780> figured<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.230> would<00:04:22.470> be<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.650> good<00:04:23.100> pin

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
so I figured this would be a good pin

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.840 
so I figured this would be a good pin
material<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.990> here<00:04:25.290> is<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.710> knife<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:26.310> far<00:04:26.610> i

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
material so here is the knife so far i

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.150 
material so here is the knife so far i
went<00:04:27.720> ahead<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:27.990> finished<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.680> handles

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
went ahead and finished the handles

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.700 
went ahead and finished the handles
drilled<00:04:29.970> holes<00:04:30.180> through<00:04:30.450> them<00:04:30.600> put<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.470> pins

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
drilled holes through them put the pins

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.659 
drilled holes through them put the pins
in<00:04:31.950> trim<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.610> pins<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.620> i<00:04:34.620> just<00:04:34.980> epoxy<00:04:35.520> dit

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
in trim the pins and i just epoxy dit

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.420 
in trim the pins and i just epoxy dit
and<00:04:35.880> clamped<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.960> get<00:04:37.080> i<00:04:37.350> said<00:04:38.040> screw<00:04:38.370> it

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
and clamped it to get i said screw it

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.490 
and clamped it to get i said screw it
and<00:04:38.610> went<00:04:38.820> ahead<00:04:38.880> epoxy<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.480> whole<00:04:39.720> edge<00:04:39.900> got

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
and went ahead epoxy the whole edge got

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.760 
and went ahead epoxy the whole edge got
much<00:04:40.710> work<00:04:40.980> done<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.669> now<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:42.410> took<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.560> out<00:04:43.620> of

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
much work done just now I took it out of

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.800 
much work done just now I took it out of
the<00:04:43.800> collapse<00:04:44.340> sanded<00:04:45.120> down<00:04:45.270> all<00:04:45.510> of<00:04:45.540> the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
the collapse sanded down all of the

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.560 
the collapse sanded down all of the
excess<00:04:46.260> glue<00:04:46.669> it's<00:04:47.669> not<00:04:47.790> just<00:04:47.850> has<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> nice

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
excess glue it's not just has a nice

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.679 
excess glue it's not just has a nice
dark<00:04:49.080> line<00:04:49.350> at<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.710> spine

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
dark line at the spine
