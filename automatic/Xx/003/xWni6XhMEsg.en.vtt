00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
was kind of the result of just playing

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.820 
was kind of the result of just playing
around<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.690> some<00:00:12.750> products<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.500> I've<00:00:13.620> had

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
around with some products that I've had

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.550 
around with some products that I've had
for<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.130> while<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:15.000> not<00:00:15.480> yet<00:00:15.929> played<00:00:16.230> with
