you would of course normally Windex your

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.970 
you would of course normally Windex your
windows<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> electrical<00:00:34.469> tape<00:00:34.680> you're

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
windows with the electrical tape you're

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
windows with the electrical tape you're
gonna<00:00:35.130> start<00:00:35.460> off<00:00:35.550> making<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:36.059> pattern<00:00:36.390> here

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
gonna start off making your pattern here

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.299 
gonna start off making your pattern here
I'm<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.110> making<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.590> simple<00:00:37.800> square

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
I'm just making this simple square

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.979 
I'm just making this simple square
pattern<00:00:38.550> that's<00:00:38.879> already<00:00:39.360> made<00:00:39.660> by<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.290> window

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.209 

biggest<00:00:45.989> thing<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.200> electrical<00:00:46.770> tape<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
biggest thing with electrical tape is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.029 
biggest thing with electrical tape is
that<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.430> very<00:00:47.730> young<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.710> shaped<00:00:49.710> very

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that it's very young it's shaped very

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
that it's very young it's shaped very
easily<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> wanted<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.530> some

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
easily so if you wanted to do like some

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.979 
easily so if you wanted to do like some
sort<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.250> curve<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:53.969> anything<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.780> sort

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
sort of curve or anything of that sort

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.549 
sort of curve or anything of that sort
in<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> pattern<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.989> do<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
in the pattern you can do that with the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.040 
in the pattern you can do that with the
electrical<00:00:59.010> tape<00:00:59.190> which<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.460> why<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.660> use<00:01:00.870> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
electrical tape which is why you use it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.300 
electrical tape which is why you use it
instead<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.649> x8<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> scotch<00:01:02.489> tape

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.440 

and<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.430> course<00:01:07.640> when<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.880> get<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.180> ends

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
and of course when you get to the ends

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.210 
and of course when you get to the ends
just<00:01:08.690> pick<00:01:09.230> pocket<00:01:09.650> scissors<00:01:12.040> all<00:01:13.040> right<00:01:13.190> oh

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
just pick pocket scissors all right oh

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.710 
just pick pocket scissors all right oh
you<00:01:13.370> just<00:01:13.610> finish<00:01:13.910> up<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.330> rest<00:01:14.360> of<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
you just finish up the rest of the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:38.610 
you just finish up the rest of the
window<00:01:15.020> with<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.380> illegible<00:01:15.830> tape

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.690 

factor<00:01:39.620> that<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.920> get<00:01:40.070> your<00:01:40.190> stippling<00:01:40.550> brush

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
factor that you get your stippling brush

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.480 
factor that you get your stippling brush
this<00:01:41.390> one<00:01:41.540> has<00:01:41.870> already<00:01:42.050> been<00:01:42.200> used<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.340> that's

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
this one has already been used so that's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.010 
this one has already been used so that's
why<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.670> looks<00:01:43.940> gross<00:01:44.120> but<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.420> promise<00:01:44.900> you

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
why it looks gross but I promise you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.500 
why it looks gross but I promise you
it's<00:01:45.170> clean<00:01:45.410> you'd<00:01:46.160> put<00:01:46.430> your<00:01:46.580> paint<00:01:47.150> on<00:01:47.330> it

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
it's clean you'd put your paint on it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.010 
it's clean you'd put your paint on it
and<00:01:48.130> then<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.640> just<00:01:49.670> start<00:01:50.180> stippling

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.750 

stippling<00:01:54.020> even<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.350> right<00:01:54.500> word<00:01:54.680> oh<00:01:55.010> I<00:01:55.700> don't

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
stippling even the right word oh I don't

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:22.260 
stippling even the right word oh I don't
know<00:01:55.910> but<00:01:56.210> you've<00:01:56.450> been<00:01:56.720> doing<00:01:56.960> this

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.699 

here's<00:02:23.270> a<00:02:23.360> better<00:02:23.720> angle<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.170> what<00:02:24.319> I'm<00:02:24.410> doing

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
here's a better angle of what I'm doing

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.559 
here's a better angle of what I'm doing
k-stew<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.400> couldn't<00:02:25.880> see<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.120> from<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
k-stew you couldn't see it from the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.790 
k-stew you couldn't see it from the
other<00:02:26.690> angle<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:30.110> you're<00:02:30.230> gonna<00:02:30.349> continue

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
other angle so you're gonna continue

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.380 
other angle so you're gonna continue
this<00:02:30.980> for<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.370> rest<00:02:31.520> of<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.730> window<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.239> can

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
this for the rest of the window you can

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.150 
this for the rest of the window you can
use<00:02:32.540> all<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.020> same<00:02:33.230> color<00:02:33.500> or<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.860> can<00:02:34.040> use

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
use all the same color or you can use

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.580 
use all the same color or you can use
various<00:02:34.430> colors<00:02:34.819> like<00:02:34.970> I'm<00:02:35.120> doing<00:02:35.330> here

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
various colors like I'm doing here

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.680 
various colors like I'm doing here
don't<00:02:37.190> worry<00:02:37.400> about<00:02:37.550> going<00:02:37.880> outside<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.569> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
don't worry about going outside of the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.150 
don't worry about going outside of the
line<00:02:39.050> because<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:41.330> will<00:02:41.630> get<00:02:41.810> smudges<00:02:42.470> as<00:02:42.770> I

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
line because you will get smudges as I

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.190 
line because you will get smudges as I
will<00:02:43.370> show<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.580> in<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.910> little<00:02:44.030> bit<00:02:44.270> but<00:02:44.900> you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
will show you in a little bit but you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.900 
will show you in a little bit but you
can<00:02:45.380> always<00:02:45.560> remove<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.130> tape<00:02:46.340> if<00:02:46.580> your

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
can always remove the tape if your
