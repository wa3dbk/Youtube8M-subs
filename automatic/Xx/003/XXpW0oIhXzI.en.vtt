here it's a very simple instrument it's

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.570 
here it's a very simple instrument it's
a<00:00:23.939> stringed<00:00:24.210> instrument<00:00:24.660> as<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.580> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
a stringed instrument as you can see the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.570 
a stringed instrument as you can see the
most<00:00:26.880> innovative<00:00:27.660> part<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.070> thing

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
most innovative part of it of thing

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.790 
most innovative part of it of thing
about<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.420> position<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.109> hands<00:00:31.619> so

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
about it is a position of your hands so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
about it is a position of your hands so
we're<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.030> an<00:00:33.149> answer<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> first

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
we're here at an answer for the first

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.990 
we're here at an answer for the first
time<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.829> show<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> instrument<00:00:35.610> there's<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
time to show the instrument there's a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.850 
time to show the instrument there's a
technique<00:00:36.360> called<00:00:36.390> tapping<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> guitar

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
technique called tapping on the guitar

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.479 
technique called tapping on the guitar
like<00:00:38.489> Steve<00:00:38.879> five<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.840> hair<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.129> hammer

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
like Steve five and hair so you hammer

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.520 
like Steve five and hair so you hammer
on<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> string<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.780> generate<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> energy

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
on a string and you generate the energy

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.670 
on a string and you generate the energy
to<00:00:44.129> make<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> string<00:00:44.640> vibrate<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:46.590> you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to make the string vibrate but when you

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.139 
to make the string vibrate but when you
do<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.340> quite<00:00:47.550> hard<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
do it like this it's quite hard to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.330 
do it like this it's quite hard to
hammer<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.780> stabilize<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.320> instrument<00:00:49.920> by

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
hammer and stabilize the instrument by

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000 
hammer and stabilize the instrument by
accident<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.850> lay<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.239> put<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:51.690> guitar<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.980> front

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
accident I lay I put my guitar in front

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.040 
accident I lay I put my guitar in front
of<00:00:53.340> me<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> table<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.420> started<00:00:54.780> hammering

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
of me on a table and I started hammering

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
of me on a table and I started hammering
like

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.080 

and<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.989> saw<00:01:01.260> well<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.710> perfect<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.940> my

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and I saw well this is perfect for my

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.050 
and I saw well this is perfect for my
hands<00:01:03.630> for<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> ergonomics<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.550> large

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
hands for the ergonomics I will a large

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.469 
hands for the ergonomics I will a large
area<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.140> huge<00:01:07.320> control<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.369> notes<00:01:11.640> so

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
area and a huge control of the notes so

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
area and a huge control of the notes so
this<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.050> a<00:01:13.350> flash<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.770> saw<00:01:13.800> this<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.430> when

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this is in a flash I saw this one when

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.800 
this is in a flash I saw this one when
we<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:14.880> ours<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.210> front<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.540> me

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
we get ours in front of me

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.780 
we get ours in front of me
this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> perfect<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.550> can

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
this is perfect I see what I do I can

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:32.279 
this is perfect I see what I do I can
see<00:01:17.970> my<00:01:18.119> audience<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.050> can<00:01:19.290> hammer

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.679 

you<00:01:33.289> see<00:01:33.649> I<00:01:33.680> had<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.829> lot<00:01:34.039> of<00:01:34.219> control<00:01:34.729> over<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
you see I had a lot of control over the

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.539 
you see I had a lot of control over the
note<00:01:35.929> almost<00:01:36.409> like<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.619> saxophone<00:01:37.340> playing

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
note almost like a saxophone playing

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.050 
note almost like a saxophone playing
when<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:37.820> go

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.600 

your<00:01:45.049> hand<00:01:45.290> is<00:01:45.409> on<00:01:45.560> top<00:01:45.740> of<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.100> strings<00:01:46.399> and

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
your hand is on top of the strings and

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.499 
your hand is on top of the strings and
one<00:01:47.390> hand<00:01:47.780> can<00:01:48.740> overlap<00:01:49.159> almost<00:01:49.759> four<00:01:50.030> octaves

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
one hand can overlap almost four octaves

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.289 
one hand can overlap almost four octaves
which<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.380> quite<00:01:51.890> unique<00:01:52.159> in<00:01:52.520> musical

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
which is quite unique in musical

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.510 
which is quite unique in musical
instruments<00:01:53.360> four<00:01:54.350> octaves<00:01:54.710> on<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.890> piano<00:01:55.220> it's

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
instruments four octaves on a piano it's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.490 
instruments four octaves on a piano it's
like<00:01:55.820> this<00:01:56.060> distance<00:01:56.570> or<00:01:56.899> your<00:01:57.079> hand<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.350> only

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
like this distance or your hand is only

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.300 
like this distance or your hand is only
like<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.520> here<00:01:58.729> you<00:01:58.880> can

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
