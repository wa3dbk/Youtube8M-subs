00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.530
 ah 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:13.970
 exercise for harmony of the salia sanjiao 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:18.260
 are the organs between the perineum 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:21.740
 and the thyroid gland here we will have to 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.429
 coordinate movement with breathing and 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.369
 with concentration work starting 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:31.759
 the exercise starting from a position 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.210
 balanced we press lightly the 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.879
 legs letting new flex a 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.510
 column causing the palms to come together 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.250
 knees are stretched while being 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.969
 they raise their arms and begin the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.149
 inspiration the mouth will always go to the 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.690
 height of the hands the knees the 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.420
 doll and mouth and breathing to the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.190
 time it expels 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.190
 up and swimming 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.260
 down ejects 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 inhale 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.829
 expelled 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.689
 inhale 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.049
 eject 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.980
 inhaling 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.689
 expel 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.510
 inhale 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.310
 expel 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.689
 and nothing 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.500
 eject 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 and not talking 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.229
 eject 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.590
 concluding 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.780
 important that both the inhalation and 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.289
 the expulsion for this exercise is for 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.900
 the mouth in addition to concentrating on the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.400
 different areas which I want 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.730
 directing like it 's important to master with 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.010
 time the thoracic capacity and the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.959
 lung capacity to be able to direct the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.530
 air to different areas of the thorax these 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.040
 areas are for example the lower area of â€‹â€‹the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.040
 rib cage 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.069
 the middle area of the rib cage 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.250
 the upper area of the rib cage 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.310
 also if he considered it appropriate that he should 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.550
 enter more air for example in my lung 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.550
 straight 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.370
 or in my left lung 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.130
 or I want for example to get to dominate 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.020
 that more air in the lower area of â€‹â€‹my 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.330
 lung right while entering more 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.960
 air in the upper area of my lung 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.960
 left 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.319
 ah
