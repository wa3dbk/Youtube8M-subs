00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
paper you should be able to see the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.300 
paper you should be able to see the
texture<00:03:25.900> of<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.170> paper<00:03:26.350> coming<00:03:26.890> through<00:03:27.160> the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
tape once this is done then I'm going to

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.550 
tape once this is done then I'm going to
start<00:03:32.620> putting<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.370> paint<00:03:33.640> now<00:03:34.560> going

start putting on the paint now going
back<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.010> idea<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.609> venetian<00:03:37.060> blind

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
back to the idea of the venetian blind

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.750 
back to the idea of the venetian blind
the<00:03:38.109> first<00:03:38.350> color<00:03:38.620> I'm<00:03:38.799> going<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.100> put<00:03:39.310> on<00:03:39.459> will

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
the first color I'm going to put on will

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.330 
the first color I'm going to put on will
be<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.910> color<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.450> blind<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:41.290> blue<00:03:41.530> sky

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
be the color of the blind the blue sky

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.000 
be the color of the blind the blue sky
and<00:03:42.609> it's<00:03:43.480> going<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.750> be<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.900> graded<00:03:44.410> wash<00:03:44.650> from

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
and it's going to be a graded wash from

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.479 
and it's going to be a graded wash from
dark<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.820> foreground<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.900> light<00:03:47.140> in<00:03:47.489> the

dark in the foreground to light in the
background

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.020 

now<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.840> grade<00:03:59.170> my<00:03:59.409> wash<00:03:59.769> I<00:04:00.099> don't<00:04:00.640> need<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.879> get

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
now to grade my wash I don't need to get

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.819 
now to grade my wash I don't need to get
more<00:04:01.209> paint<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:01.959> need<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.319> get<00:04:02.439> as<00:04:02.590> more

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
more paint but I need to get as more

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.350 
more paint but I need to get as more
water<00:04:03.069> so<00:04:03.370> I'll<00:04:03.489> just<00:04:03.700> dip<00:04:03.939> in<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.209> water

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
water so I'll just dip in the water

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.800 
water so I'll just dip in the water
right<00:04:04.900> back<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.290> couple<00:04:05.590> of<00:04:05.739> times<00:04:06.599> dip<00:04:07.599> in<00:04:07.750> the

grades<00:04:11.680> naturally<00:04:12.370> on<00:04:12.459> its<00:04:12.640> own<00:04:12.849> we<00:04:13.599> now<00:04:13.780> let

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
grades naturally on its own we now let

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.439 
grades naturally on its own we now let
this<00:04:14.230> dry<00:04:14.730> because<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.849> next<00:04:16.090> thing<00:04:16.150> we're

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
this dry because the next thing we're

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.289 
this dry because the next thing we're
going<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.720> do<00:04:16.900> is<00:04:17.169> paint<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:18.519> spaces<00:04:19.269> between

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
going to do is paint the spaces between

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.760 
going to do is paint the spaces between
the<00:04:20.049> venetian<00:04:20.530> blind<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:23.169> next<00:04:23.410> color<00:04:23.620> I'm

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
the venetian blind the next color I'm

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.820 
the venetian blind the next color I'm
going<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.190> work<00:04:24.370> with<00:04:24.669> is<00:04:24.910> a<00:04:25.199> green<00:04:26.199> Brown

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
going to work with is a green Brown

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.640 
going to work with is a green Brown
mixture<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.000> represents<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.720> cracks

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
mixture and this represents the cracks

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.279 
mixture and this represents the cracks
between<00:04:29.949> the<00:04:30.310> blind<00:04:30.510> essentially<00:04:31.510> it's<00:04:31.960> what

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
between the blind essentially it's what

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.260 
between the blind essentially it's what
you<00:04:32.470> see<00:04:32.770> when<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.220> look<00:04:33.430> through<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:34.030> water

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
you see when you look through the water

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.060 
you see when you look through the water
at<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.870> bottom<00:04:34.990> we're<00:04:35.500> not<00:04:35.620> going<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.830> paint

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
at the bottom we're not going to paint

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.770 
at the bottom we're not going to paint
this<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.520> venetian<00:04:37.030> blind<00:04:37.060> with<00:04:37.510> straight

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
this like a venetian blind with straight

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.570 
this like a venetian blind with straight
lines<00:04:38.080> what<00:04:38.560> we're<00:04:38.680> going<00:04:38.889> to<00:04:38.949> do<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.310> paint

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
lines what we're going to do is paint

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.790 
lines what we're going to do is paint
the<00:04:39.789> lines<00:04:40.060> for<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.810> cracks<00:04:41.110> between<00:04:41.380> the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
the lines for the cracks between the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
the lines for the cracks between the
blind<00:04:42.490> in<00:04:43.000> long<00:04:43.780> flowing<00:04:44.500> strokes<00:04:45.250> that<00:04:45.580> fit

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
blind in long flowing strokes that fit

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.580 
blind in long flowing strokes that fit
together<00:04:48.570> I'm<00:04:49.570> going<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:49.900> start<00:04:50.139> somewhere

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
together I'm going to start somewhere

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.040 
together I'm going to start somewhere
here<00:04:51.010> in<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.280> foreground<00:04:52.150> because<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.810> want<00:04:52.990> to

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
here in the foreground because I want to

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.310 
here in the foreground because I want to
put<00:04:53.169> in<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.350> few<00:04:53.620> good<00:04:53.940> long<00:04:54.940> sweeping<00:04:55.930> marks

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
put in a few good long sweeping marks

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.400 
put in a few good long sweeping marks
here<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:57.850> represents<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.720> movement<00:04:59.169> of<00:04:59.289> the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
here this represents the movement of the

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.490 
here this represents the movement of the
water<00:04:59.699> and<00:05:00.699> you'll<00:05:01.030> notice<00:05:01.210> how<00:05:01.479> I'm<00:05:01.780> trying

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
water and you'll notice how I'm trying

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.100 
water and you'll notice how I'm trying
to<00:05:02.710> keep<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.330> marks<00:05:04.330> from<00:05:04.479> touching<00:05:04.840> each

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
to keep the marks from touching each

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.219 
to keep the marks from touching each
other<00:05:09.060> sometimes<00:05:10.060> they're<00:05:10.300> long<00:05:10.510> sometimes

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
other sometimes they're long sometimes

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.730 
other sometimes they're long sometimes
they're<00:05:11.620> short<00:05:11.979> and<00:05:16.139> I'm<00:05:17.139> going<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.500> try<00:05:17.650> to

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
they're short and I'm going to try to

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.029 
they're short and I'm going to try to
make<00:05:17.919> these<00:05:18.360> flow<00:05:19.360> around<00:05:22.320> these<00:05:23.320> rocks<00:05:23.710> that

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
make these flow around these rocks that

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:59.579 
make these flow around these rocks that
are<00:05:24.190> sticking<00:05:24.460> out

00:05:59.579 --> 00:05:59.589 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.939 

and<00:06:00.039> so<00:06:00.339> one<00:06:00.639> March<00:06:00.939> sort<00:06:01.479> of<00:06:01.599> keys<00:06:02.229> into<00:06:02.829> the

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
and so one March sort of keys into the

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:10.289 
and so one March sort of keys into the
next<00:06:07.979> not<00:06:08.979> at<00:06:09.249> exactly<00:06:09.879> the<00:06:10.059> same<00:06:10.239> distance

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:10.299 
next not at exactly the same distance

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:14.849 
next not at exactly the same distance
each<00:06:11.019> time<00:06:12.539> but<00:06:13.539> more<00:06:13.809> or<00:06:13.899> less<00:06:13.959> parallel<00:06:14.619> to
