00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.560
 friendly friends a recipe more than given 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.119
 that we are going towards summer and it is also 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.830
 like these are economic the winter that 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.570
 summer but good they say that the pies 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.520
 cool are for the summer or were the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.650
 bicycle no longer bad color for that matter 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.470
 is that I'm going to make a fresh cake of 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.860
 pineapple that we do not need oven and that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.570
 makes in bread out look I have in the 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.050
 little thing is that it looks out of the pro 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.150
 right I have the pineapple caldito there 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.549
 at the bottom as you can see the pineapple I have 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.960
 Lemon jelly two jelly sachets 

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:45.949
 of this lemon write in prepared 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.640
 where you can buy at any 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:52.540
 part and I'm going to add a couple of 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.330
 teaspoons of gelatin 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.820
 neutral in dust because because it stays 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.559
 a little soft and how I want to do 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.229
 a tall thing for the integration in this 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.140
 so handsome mold that I have I want it to be 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.960
 there is a high form I do not want that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.540
 that for whatever reason the height may 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.310
 to gravity can with the gelatin of 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.320
 always from the envelopes that come 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.810
 prepared and I want it to stay more 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.270
 he visited well I also have cream 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.280
 and condensed milk that I forgot and 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.649
 Astro I add 4 teaspoons of 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.329
 sugar and the procedure is the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.009
 next I will beat 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.009
 with a blender to make it look good 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.250
 titula said this time the pineapple with 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.990
 cream the condensed milk and sugar in the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.000
 I'm going to heat the pineapple broth 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.270
 Libya adds a jelly later what 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.640
 I put everything in the mold that I eat 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.640
 you can see in your candy 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.470
 and the riverbank 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 this is all there is to do easy 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.119
 then it is demold and we stick 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.820
 know who eats more in this is 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.690
 this service 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.710
 well I have the pineapple chili 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.050
 tempered 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.260
 jelly 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.360
 and more than the lemon tub and now I'm going to 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.210
 add the two tablespoons 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.600
 a few tablespoons of these poster type 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.230
 tiny one 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.400
 and two with this jelly is more than 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.769
 enough 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.350
 so that this will stay solid and 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.600
 now 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.730
 remove some rods to mix 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.409
 well the gelatin with the liquid 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.090
 and I'm going to leave you for a bit of 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.930
 milk 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.930
 to silver 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.280
 if I were 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.780
 with this is more than enough for the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.580
 fire this with what with this cup the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.550
 what did you do to make us 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.600
 undo the gelatin 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.600
 It is more than enough 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.790
 Well, he travels at that time a little 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.560
 before casting it to the altar 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.310
 good good, good, I'm going to throw 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.310
 those of the way 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.880
 it is a final removed 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.990
 that nothing is required 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.750
 erekat 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.049
 Y 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.000
 with the same shake in front of everyone 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.490
 if you drink rich comes from the jelly of 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.650
 lemon 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.850
 a very rich lemon smell 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.410
 nice 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.980
 Well this now and then in 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.710
 that peru is cooled theoretically it 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.780
 It remains solid as if it were a flan 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.490
 to make it a pannacotta that in the end 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.880
 this is almost as if it were a 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.140
 very large pannacotta 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.200
 good and now see if there is luck 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.630
 and I fit everything in the mold is already 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.890
 starting to solidify simply with 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.890
 the cold of 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.890
 but 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.170
 this is for everyone 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.450
 let's see what he got us today 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.280
 and well I'm going to put it like that and this 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.320
 had cast is not that to put in another 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.849
 side that more or less mentally and adjusted 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.119
 but I do not want to get to the bottom 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.999
 in this case up I'm going to 

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:39.860
 throw this somewhere else and we'll take care of 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:42.279
 other 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.039
 sticks this now takes in the fridge 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:47.479
 and I will show you the end the end will 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.899
 be that we will not have to eat the 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.899
 last trick
