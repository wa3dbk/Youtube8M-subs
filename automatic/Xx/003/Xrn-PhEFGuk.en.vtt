00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.349
 there yes showing the relative amount of each of the harmonics in the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.579
 phase current 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.749
 here the third republic 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.689
 41% of the fundamental 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.759
 in the secondary of transhipment determine the king 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:20.550
 time 4 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.919
 orca of phase current harmonics 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.089
 the factor k 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.539
 is a relative number that indicates the amount of additional heating that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.519
 can be generated 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.349
 on a path 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.349
 best standard for a specific combination of harmonic 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.900
 this number 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.070
 Can be used to select a replacement transformer 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.230
 designed for those loads 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.170
 a factor 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.170
 indicates that there are no harmonicas 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.629
 the currents of peace in a commercial office building 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.469
 with loads of computers can have a factor k 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.000
 d up very well 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 but a critical factor for a commercial building is fourth 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.270
 the individual currents of branched circuits 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.760
 a computers can have factors k of 15 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.010
 but secondary of the shuttle is going to have a much lower k factor for the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.530
 harmonic cancellation 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.870
 If there are significant levels of current harmonics there are some 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.000
 steps that can be taken to reduce the possibility of failure of a 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.070
 transformer 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.600
 The solutions however vary depending on the configuration of the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 system wiring a solution that works in a system type 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 can aggravate the problems in another 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.530
 an option for a conventional transformer 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.440
 is to reduce the capacity had to operate a reduced load using a formula 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.470
 accepted and then and pique for the transformer 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.060
 with a lower rated load 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.230
 was his wife can be applied to the load centers 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.280
 to reduce harmonic charges 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.320
 in the transformer and from that but other system problems 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.789
 as well 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.979
 the pilots must be carefully designed to comply with the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.370
 needs of individual systems 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.069
 the others in detailed analysis of the harmonicas 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.610
 and calculation of the interest of the system 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.920
 an existing transformer that can be replaced by a unit for 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.760
 communicate 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.869
 or with a kan classification 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.859
 and this unit should be chosen 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.589
 to get married in the most accurate way possible 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:13.909
 in the factor 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.909
 of the system in full charge 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.089
 a replacement transformer for a factor k too high 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.889
 can increase the harmonics because of their very low importance in the frequencies 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:27.869
 harmonicas 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.510
 when changes are proposed 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.839
 the design of the wiring configuration should be considered 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.280
 the existing load 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.280
 and future load changes 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.209
 in the load center the harmonic currents can produce the shot 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.479
 of the switch 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.769
 the switches 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.819
 thermomagnetic can be triggered prematurely by both hamilton chasi 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.209
 a the board caused by the harmonic currents 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.919
 These switches can produce a pacheco trigger if the loads 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.919
 police with high peak values ​​are present 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.869
 a political consensus instructor 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.519
 responds to the waveform 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.819
 already critical can be higher due to the harmonicas 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.609
 This kind of switch can jump prematurely to a rms current more 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.719
 OK 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.269
 to detect the agüitas the center of caracas 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.799
 bush that phase voltage 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.859
 and check if there are tips plans 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.660
 then look at the current in the feeding computation 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.499
 using an rms instrument 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.459
 remember that these instruments 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.370
 indicate the actual heating value of the current 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.619
 including alcoholics 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:46.319
 verify that you are operating within the viral load for this board 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.779
 Look at the current while you will see limited 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:49.740
 if it is high 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.559
 There may be presence of triple harmonic frequency 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.319
 then compare the reading with a nominal 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.779
 for drivers 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.180
 for the busbar 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.309
 and the terminal 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:02.789
 compare family readings almost a month with the switch 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:05.060
 bent and that if there is harmonic overload 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.060
 triple frequency 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.829
 the same process can be repeated the rest of the freight charging centers 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.019
 from the same source 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.590
 once you are sure that the board of the current outlet affected by the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.280
 americas 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.280
 some options to correct that situation 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.199
 is to balance the load 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.190
 if the current mentors of 50 or 60 sherry the predisposition of the 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:31.520
 private circuits 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.270
 for the purpose of internet 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.740
 in some cases 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.210
 the bridge is to redistribute the load or constable the existing public ones 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.879
 can add extinct harmonics of sequences 0 to the board 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.879
 to reduce the flow of the frac in the feeders 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.300
 The pistons should always be installed after having consulted with a 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.740
 qualified engineer 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.229
 if the business driver 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.490
 it is overloaded 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.919
 maybe it requires a major driver 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.059
 or the existing board can be replaced for caracas bolivia alex 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.719
 the excessive heat produced by the harmonics in the conductors of 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:28.529
 Illumination can cause a failure in the computation isolation 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.199
 the ballasters 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.880
 with US power supply to save energy 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.880
 can contain unique parm 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.729
 existing standards for the number of drivers in conflict do not 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.279
 they always realize the heat that these harmonicas cause 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.849
 to find the overload of harmonics in circuits and lighting 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.259
 you can make the same forecasts that were made in the load center of 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.999
 power outlets 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.449
 Take care of the current regulated minutes 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:02.969
 if high levels like 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.099
 for the measurement with the nominal value 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.099
 for conductors / collector and terminal 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.539
 I feel if the excessive heat in the controls to determine the level 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.909
 general of harmonicas 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.080
 look at the total harmonic distortion in the phase current 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:24.029
 the total harmonic distortion normally refers to the rms value of 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.330
 all harmonic currents divided by the fundamental 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.960
 portal harmonic distortion can be a problem 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.990
 sipse of 20% 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.600
 to prevent the harmonics from affecting a lighting load center 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.930
 in the designs games 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.190
 can be specified - drivers for driving or can be installed new 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.850
 high performance ballasts that produce less harmonic currents and 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.850
 improve the power factor 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:04.029
 induction motors can arise from heating harmonic committees 

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:07.189
 If you vote that the supply is distorted and the presence of 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:08.319
 seedlings of negative sequence
