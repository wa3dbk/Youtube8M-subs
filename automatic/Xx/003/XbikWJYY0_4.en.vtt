multiple<00:02:03.000> facilities<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:04.320> Fukushima<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.369> now

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
multiple facilities at Fukushima and now

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.130 
multiple facilities at Fukushima and now
we<00:02:05.580> have<00:02:05.820> Onagawa<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.600> well

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
we have Onagawa as well

we have Onagawa as well
you<00:02:07.440> remember<00:02:07.920> than<00:02:08.070> 11<00:02:08.610> reactors<00:02:09.240> were<00:02:09.420> shut

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
you remember than 11 reactors were shut

you remember than 11 reactors were shut
possibility<00:02:10.740> so<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:13.040> Leverkusen
