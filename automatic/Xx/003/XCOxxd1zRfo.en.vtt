the idea that I'm going for is very
similar<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:05.569> how<00:00:06.620> lace<00:00:07.620> closures<00:00:08.280> are<00:00:08.610> made

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the edges you don't have to do that if

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.060 
the edges you don't have to do that if
you<00:00:14.370> don't<00:00:14.580> want<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.170> finished<00:00:16.770> on

the edges and then the hair sits on top
of<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.000> would<00:00:21.060> consider<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.199> a

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
of what I would consider to be like a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
it has somewhat of the same idea where

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.020

and if you notice it's finished in this

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.229 
and if you notice it's finished in this
area<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:45.920> that's<00:00:46.920> kind<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> idea<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.030> I'm

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
area so that's kind of the idea that I'm

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
area so that's kind of the idea that I'm
going<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
going for and you can see that the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.110 
going for and you can see that the
tracks<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:51.270> been<00:00:51.300> sewn<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.129> net

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
tracks have been sewn on to this net

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.200 
tracks have been sewn on to this net
which<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.719> similar<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.340> net<00:00:56.550> we're<00:00:56.760> using

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
which is similar to the net we're using

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.439 
which is similar to the net we're using
in<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:58.020> video<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.710> I'm<00:01:01.710> gonna<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.969> same

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
in this video so I'm gonna have the same

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.149 
in this video so I'm gonna have the same
idea<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:05.270> I'm<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.659> gonna<00:01:06.930> cut<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> nice

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
idea but I'm just gonna cut out a nice

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.830 
idea but I'm just gonna cut out a nice
large<00:01:09.000> size<00:01:09.450> square<00:01:10.049> that's<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.460> work

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
large size square that's going to work

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:30.929 
large size square that's going to work
for<00:01:12.840> me

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:47.289 

and<00:01:31.939> then<00:01:32.329> I'm<00:01:32.990> going<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:34.689> curve<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:38.149> edges<00:01:46.299> so

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
and then I'm going to curve the edges so

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.350 
and then I'm going to curve the edges so
this<00:01:47.659> is<00:01:47.840> just<00:01:48.080> based<00:01:48.350> on<00:01:48.619> my<00:01:49.159> eye<00:01:49.399> I'm<00:01:50.179> gonna

this is just based on my eye I'm gonna

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.639 
this is just based on my eye I'm gonna
cut<00:01:50.600> this<00:01:50.780> something<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:54.289> could<00:01:54.470> definitely

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
cut this something you could definitely

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
cut this something you could definitely
take<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.189> ruler<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.700> do<00:01:56.030> this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.059 

it<00:02:03.689> should<00:02:04.109> be<00:02:04.350> larger<00:02:05.100> than<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.700> usual<00:02:07.069> lace

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
it should be larger than the usual lace

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.290 
it should be larger than the usual lace
closures<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.950> larger<00:02:10.950> than<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.370> usual<00:02:11.849> clip

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
