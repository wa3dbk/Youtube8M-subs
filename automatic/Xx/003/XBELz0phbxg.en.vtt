00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
mixing a plaster to to set some of those

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.799 
mixing a plaster to to set some of those
footprints

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
footprints

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.030 
footprints
so<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.170> basically<00:00:11.070> got<00:00:11.340> my<00:00:11.550> stuff<00:00:11.850> here<00:00:12.890> and<00:00:13.890> I'm

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
so I basically got my stuff here and I'm

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.710 
so I basically got my stuff here and I'm
gonna<00:00:14.160> mix<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:15.500> basically<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.220> soil

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
gonna mix it up basically in this soil

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.929 
gonna mix it up basically in this soil
it<00:00:18.720> has<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.259> be<00:00:19.409> fairly<00:00:19.829> runny<00:00:20.480> because<00:00:22.939> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
it has to be fairly runny because the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.759 
it has to be fairly runny because the
water<00:00:24.329> just<00:00:24.659> sucks<00:00:25.050> right<00:00:25.319> out<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.589> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
water just sucks right out of the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.189 
water just sucks right out of the
plaster<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.749> hard<00:00:27.989> to<00:00:28.079> work

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
plaster and it's really hard to work

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.220 
plaster and it's really hard to work
with<00:00:28.499> so<00:00:31.070> we<00:00:32.070> decided<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.730> needed<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
with so we decided we needed to do the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
with so we decided we needed to do the
plastering<00:00:34.800> real<00:00:35.399> quick<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.269> wind

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
plastering real quick because the wind

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.990 
plastering real quick because the wind
is<00:00:36.600> coming<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.399> gonna<00:00:38.609> turn<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
is coming up and it's gonna turn the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.060 
is coming up and it's gonna turn the
footprints<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:40.170> we're<00:00:40.379> gonna<00:00:40.469> lose<00:00:40.559> detail

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
footprints now we're gonna lose detail

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.580 
footprints now we're gonna lose detail
it's<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.399> gonna<00:00:41.579> turn<00:00:41.789> them<00:00:41.940> into<00:00:42.590> basically

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it's just gonna turn them into basically

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.110 
it's just gonna turn them into basically
compressions<00:00:46.309> this<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.519> about<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
compressions this is about the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:08.890 
compressions this is about the
consistency<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:56.089> okay<00:00:58.190> yep

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.180

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
so you want to pour it thick enough to

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.120 
so you want to pour it thick enough to
cover<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.260> cover<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.440> all<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.860> can

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
after 8 o'clock just trying to figure it

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.990 
after 8 o'clock just trying to figure it
out<00:03:40.019> ok<00:03:41.019> we<00:03:41.200> came<00:03:41.440> up<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.040> hill<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:42.849> that

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
we could look down

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.330 
we could look down
that's<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.430> mud<00:03:46.360> basin<00:03:46.959> or<00:03:47.200> mud<00:03:47.650> flat<00:03:47.980> down

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
that's the mud basin or mud flat down

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.170 
that's the mud basin or mud flat down
there<00:03:48.670> Oh<00:03:48.940> easy<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.959> would<00:03:50.140> be<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.670> walk<00:03:51.670> in<00:03:51.970> and

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
there Oh easy it would be to walk in and

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.890 
there Oh easy it would be to walk in and
out<00:03:52.329> of<00:03:52.540> here<00:03:52.750> with<00:03:52.959> without<00:03:53.799> detection<00:03:54.370> I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
out of here with without detection I

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.860 
out of here with without detection I
mean<00:03:55.900> it's<00:03:56.879> pretty<00:03:57.879> easy<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.599> there's

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
mean it's pretty easy and there's

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.949 
mean it's pretty easy and there's
there's<00:03:59.470> nobody<00:03:59.950> up<00:04:00.160> here<00:04:00.220> I<00:04:00.549> mean<00:04:01.000> there's<00:04:01.810> a

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
there's nobody up here I mean there's a

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.080 
there's nobody up here I mean there's a
mountain<00:04:02.260> here<00:04:02.440> behind<00:04:02.650> us<00:04:04.859> no<00:04:05.859> these<00:04:06.849> are<00:04:07.030> all

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
mountain here behind us no these are all

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.089 
mountain here behind us no these are all
pinyon<00:04:08.079> Pines<00:04:08.410> here<00:04:13.410> but<00:04:14.410> we're<00:04:14.590> kind<00:04:15.010> of

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
pinyon Pines here but we're kind of

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.810 
pinyon Pines here but we're kind of
thinking<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:15.819> possibly<00:04:20.609> trailer<00:04:21.609> down

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
thinking that possibly trailer down

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.880 
thinking that possibly trailer down
there<00:04:22.120> is<00:04:23.430> source<00:04:24.430> of<00:04:24.610> water
