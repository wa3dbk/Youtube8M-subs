let me give you a tip on dune buggies

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.030 
let me give you a tip on dune buggies
pole<00:00:07.140> wheelers<00:00:07.849> mud<00:00:08.849> boggers<00:00:09.530> all<00:00:10.530> manner<00:00:10.860> of

pole wheelers mud boggers all manner of

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.780 
pole wheelers mud boggers all manner of
everything<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.849> sits<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.719> mud<00:00:13.549> this<00:00:14.549> is

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
everything that sits in the mud this is

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.730 
everything that sits in the mud this is
a<00:00:14.820> four<00:00:15.240> seater<00:00:15.540> I've<00:00:15.750> had<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> long<00:00:16.410> time

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
a four seater I've had for a long time

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.260 
a four seater I've had for a long time
and<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:17.220> been<00:00:17.279> sitting<00:00:17.699> back<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> woods

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
and it's been sitting back in the woods

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.529 
and it's been sitting back in the woods
and<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.840> finally<00:00:19.080> decided<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:20.029> drag<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.180> out<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and I finally decided to drag it out and

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.540 
and I finally decided to drag it out and
bring<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.869> up<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.260> get<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.800> back<00:00:22.830> running<00:00:23.220> good

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
bring it up and get it back running good

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.330 
bring it up and get it back running good
and<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:27.390> master<00:00:27.810> cylinder<00:00:28.050> was<00:00:28.500> bad<00:00:28.740> from

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and the master cylinder was bad from

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.749 
and the master cylinder was bad from
sitting<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> had<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.439> put<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> new<00:00:31.859> master

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
sitting so I had to put a new master

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.360 
sitting so I had to put a new master
cylinder<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.079> reservoir<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
cylinder and the reservoir on it and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.910 
cylinder and the reservoir on it and
then<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.210> went<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.450> bleed<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> brakes<00:00:37.370> and

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
then I went to bleed the brakes and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.940 
then I went to bleed the brakes and
looking<00:00:40.920> down<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> wheel<00:00:41.579> cylinder

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.979 

hopefully<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.840> looking<00:00:48.840> down

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
hopefully you can see that looking down

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.260 
hopefully you can see that looking down
the<00:00:49.110> wheel<00:00:49.289> cylinder<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:50.070> two<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.149> these

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the wheel cylinder on two out of these

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.250 
the wheel cylinder on two out of these
four<00:00:51.570> wheels<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.440> went<00:00:53.280> down<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:57.170> open<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
four wheels I went down to open the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.189 
four wheels I went down to open the
brake<00:00:58.500> bleeder<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> wheel<00:00:59.969> cell<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.420> there

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.230 

and<00:01:04.199> they're<00:01:04.530> rusted<00:01:04.920> shut<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.430> know<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.060> they

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and they're rusted shut you know so they

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.910 
and they're rusted shut you know so they
just<00:01:06.450> break<00:01:07.200> off<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> wheel

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
just break off so you know the wheel

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770 
just break off so you know the wheel
cylinders<00:01:11.460> only<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> couple<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.180> bucks<00:01:12.420> but

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
cylinders only a couple of bucks but

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.359 
cylinders only a couple of bucks but
it's<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.020> pain<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> ass<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.890> pulling<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
it's a pain in the ass so pulling the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
it's a pain in the ass so pulling the
tyre<00:01:14.610> pulling<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> wheel<00:01:17.930> tearing<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
tyre pulling the wheel tearing the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.870 
tyre pulling the wheel tearing the
brakes<00:01:19.229> apart<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.189> replace<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> wheel

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
brakes apart to replace the wheel

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.359 
brakes apart to replace the wheel
cylinder<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> seals<00:01:22.080> are<00:01:22.200> good<00:01:22.409> but

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
cylinder because the seals are good but

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.410 
cylinder because the seals are good but
the<00:01:23.520> bleeder<00:01:23.759> screw<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.710> broken<00:01:25.710> off<00:01:25.830> so

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
the bleeder screw is is broken off so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.179 
the bleeder screw is is broken off so
what<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> did<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.290> my<00:01:28.619> suggestion

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
what I did and this is my suggestion

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
what I did and this is my suggestion
it's<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.759> put<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.060> NDC's<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it's just put a little NDC's on the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.469 
it's just put a little NDC's on the
thread<00:01:31.290> any<00:01:31.890> any<00:01:32.280> C's<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.790> work<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
thread any any C's will work this is

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.850 
thread any any C's will work this is
just<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> keep<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.170> my<00:01:34.229> toolbox<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:36.860> if

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
just what I keep in my toolbox and if

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.679 
just what I keep in my toolbox and if
you'll<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.280> coat<00:01:38.490> those<00:01:38.729> threads<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.509> I've

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
you'll just coat those threads like I've

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.609 
you'll just coat those threads like I've
done<00:01:39.869> here

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:52.100 

hopefully<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.799> focuses

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.050 

people<00:01:53.110> have<00:01:53.200> never<00:01:53.410> cease<00:01:53.740> on<00:01:53.980> their<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.550> was

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
people have never cease on their I was

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.820 
people have never cease on their I was
bleeder<00:01:55.360> screws<00:01:55.780> hopefully<00:01:56.290> we<00:01:56.380> won't<00:01:56.470> seize

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
bleeder screws hopefully we won't seize

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.660 
bleeder screws hopefully we won't seize
up<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:57.370> rust<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:59.250> next<00:02:00.250> time<00:02:00.370> you<00:02:00.520> gotta

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
up and rust and next time you gotta

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.180 
up and rust and next time you gotta
change<00:02:00.910> your<00:02:01.030> wheel<00:02:01.210> cylinder<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.710> go<00:02:02.950> put

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
change your wheel cylinder and go put

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.580 
change your wheel cylinder and go put
that<00:02:03.220> seven<00:02:03.910> eight<00:02:04.030> millimeter<00:02:04.570> hex<00:02:05.170> nut<00:02:05.440> on

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
that seven eight millimeter hex nut on

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.880 
that seven eight millimeter hex nut on
there<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:06.870> won't<00:02:07.870> round<00:02:08.200> off<00:02:08.410> on<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.860> and

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
there it won't round off on you and

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.859 
there it won't round off on you and
break<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.880> got<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.179> replace<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.720> whole

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
break so you got to replace the whole

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.850 
break so you got to replace the whole
wheel<00:02:11.110> cylinder<00:02:11.850> later
