00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
that bring the water down and you can

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.960 
that bring the water down and you can
then<00:01:35.350> filter<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:35.920> we<00:01:36.340> are<00:01:36.399> filtering<00:01:36.580> to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
then filter it we are filtering to

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.450 
then filter it we are filtering to
remove<00:01:37.360> those<00:01:37.659> dissolved<00:01:38.229> gases<00:01:38.679> and<00:01:38.890> it's

remove those dissolved gases and it's

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.010 
remove those dissolved gases and it's
really<00:01:39.700> very<00:01:39.909> difficult<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.539> remove<00:01:40.840> that

really very difficult to remove that
that<00:01:41.530> particular<00:01:42.039> water<00:01:42.220> so<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:42.610> have<00:01:42.640> a

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759

there<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.840> no<00:03:40.870> Kaveri<00:03:41.320> supply<00:03:41.770> for<00:03:42.010> us<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.730> I

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
there is no Kaveri supply for us so I

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.240 
there is no Kaveri supply for us so I
thought<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.570> really<00:03:44.050> essential<00:03:44.320> for<00:03:44.680> me<00:03:45.040> to

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
thought it is really essential for me to

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.820 
thought it is really essential for me to
have<00:03:45.490> a<00:03:45.520> secondary<00:03:46.120> source<00:03:46.480> of<00:03:46.870> water<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.800> that

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
have a secondary source of water so that

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.590 
have a secondary source of water so that
is<00:03:48.130> why<00:03:48.310> we<00:03:48.520> thought<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.880> rainwater

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
is why we thought of rainwater

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.290 
is why we thought of rainwater
harvesting<00:03:49.980> basically<00:03:50.980> we<00:03:51.580> collect<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
harvesting basically we collect the

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.550 
harvesting basically we collect the
rooftop<00:03:52.840> rainwater<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:55.360> goes<00:03:56.260> through

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
rooftop rainwater and that goes through

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.070 
rooftop rainwater and that goes through
a<00:03:56.590> filter<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.460> collects<00:03:58.420> into<00:03:58.570> a<00:03:58.720> storage

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
a filter and collects into a storage

groundwater<00:04:38.620> recharge<00:04:38.890> this<00:04:39.640> was<00:04:39.760> about

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
groundwater recharge this was about

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.040 
groundwater recharge this was about
eight<00:04:40.180> years<00:04:40.390> ago<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.900> tried<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:42.900> figure<00:04:43.900> out

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
eight years ago I tried to figure out

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.890 
eight years ago I tried to figure out
what<00:04:45.010> I<00:04:45.040> could<00:04:45.370> do<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.910> at<00:04:46.360> that<00:04:46.570> point<00:04:46.810> I

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
what I could do and at that point I

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.300 
what I could do and at that point I
decided<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:47.350> was<00:04:47.470> going<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.710> do<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.950> simplest

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
decided I was going to do the simplest

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.480 
decided I was going to do the simplest
thing<00:04:49.320> again<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.470> idea<00:04:50.740> was<00:04:50.920> I<00:04:51.100> didn't<00:04:51.340> want

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
thing again the idea was I didn't want

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.550 
thing again the idea was I didn't want
to<00:04:51.580> sort<00:04:51.730> of<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:52.300> know<00:04:52.420> use<00:04:52.780> these<00:04:53.020> plastic

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
to sort of you know use these plastic

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.700 
to sort of you know use these plastic
pipes<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.420> connect<00:04:55.420> them<00:04:55.630> to<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.020> roof<00:04:56.350> on

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
pipes and connect them to the roof on

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.650 
pipes and connect them to the roof on
the<00:04:56.860> side<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:57.430> all<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:57.760> so<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.300> did<00:04:58.540> an

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
the side and all that so I did an

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.350 
the side and all that so I did an
integrated<00:04:59.410> channel<00:05:00.400> which<00:05:00.760> is<00:05:00.910> part<00:05:01.150> of<00:05:01.240> the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
integrated channel which is part of the

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.440 
integrated channel which is part of the
building<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:02.100> redraw<00:05:03.100> that<00:05:03.580> falls<00:05:04.150> on<00:05:04.419> the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
building a redraw that falls on the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.549 
building a redraw that falls on the
structure

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:05.559 
structure

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:09.570 
structure
goes<00:05:06.489> into<00:05:06.879> an<00:05:06.999> 8,000<00:05:07.599> liter<00:05:08.099> sum<00:05:09.099> the

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
goes into an 8,000 liter sum the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.019 
goes into an 8,000 liter sum the
rainwater<00:05:09.789> from<00:05:10.239> there<00:05:10.599> I<00:05:11.019> use<00:05:11.949> mainly<00:05:12.489> for

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:13.029 
rainwater from there I use mainly for

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:16.439 
rainwater from there I use mainly for
growing<00:05:13.959> vegetables<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:15.099> we<00:05:15.249> have<00:05:15.459> now<00:05:15.819> close

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
growing vegetables and we have now close

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.479 
growing vegetables and we have now close
to<00:05:17.789> 13<00:05:18.789> fruit<00:05:19.360> trees<00:05:19.689> just<00:05:20.439> around<00:05:21.009> the<00:05:21.279> house

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:21.489 
to 13 fruit trees just around the house

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:24.269 
to 13 fruit trees just around the house
and<00:05:22.119> now<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.419> terrace<00:05:23.019> garden<00:05:23.050> so<00:05:23.769> I<00:05:23.830> use<00:05:24.069> the

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
and now the terrace garden so I use the

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.759 
and now the terrace garden so I use the
water<00:05:24.459> for<00:05:24.759> that<00:05:24.879> some<00:05:25.629> people<00:05:25.959> argue<00:05:26.439> that<00:05:26.469> if

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:26.769 
water for that some people argue that if

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:28.409 
water for that some people argue that if
it<00:05:26.889> just<00:05:27.069> falls<00:05:27.279> on<00:05:27.459> your<00:05:27.610> garden<00:05:28.089> say<00:05:28.209> for

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
it just falls on your garden say for

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.119 
it just falls on your garden say for
instance<00:05:28.569> is<00:05:28.959> it<00:05:29.080> going<00:05:29.379> into<00:05:29.529> the<00:05:29.619> ground

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
instance is it going into the ground

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.369 
instance is it going into the ground
is<00:05:30.219> it<00:05:30.550> recharging<00:05:31.119> what<00:05:31.629> we've<00:05:31.809> observed<00:05:31.929> is

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
is it recharging what we've observed is

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.290 
is it recharging what we've observed is
it<00:05:32.469> doesn't<00:05:32.649> really<00:05:32.889> it<00:05:33.189> contributes<00:05:33.849> to<00:05:33.969> soil

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
it doesn't really it contributes to soil

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.540 
it doesn't really it contributes to soil
moisture<00:05:34.839> temporarily<00:05:35.439> so<00:05:36.159> it<00:05:36.249> makes<00:05:36.429> your

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
moisture temporarily so it makes your

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.639 
moisture temporarily so it makes your
ground<00:05:37.209> a<00:05:37.509> little<00:05:37.929> greener<00:05:38.169> there's<00:05:38.499> more

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:38.649 
ground a little greener there's more

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:41.159 
ground a little greener there's more
grass<00:05:38.889> that<00:05:39.129> grows<00:05:39.339> but<00:05:40.269> what<00:05:40.479> happens<00:05:40.839> is<00:05:40.959> any

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
grass that grows but what happens is any

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.379 
grass that grows but what happens is any
water<00:05:41.439> that's<00:05:41.709> going<00:05:41.949> only<00:05:42.759> up<00:05:42.879> to<00:05:42.999> say<00:05:43.149> six

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
water that's going only up to say six

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.449 
water that's going only up to say six
feet<00:05:43.599> below<00:05:43.749> the<00:05:43.869> ground<00:05:44.039> below<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.219> ground

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:45.459 
feet below the ground below the ground

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:48.029 
feet below the ground below the ground
level<00:05:45.669> is<00:05:45.939> lost<00:05:46.869> to<00:05:47.110> evaporation<00:05:47.319> or

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
level is lost to evaporation or

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.699 
level is lost to evaporation or
evapotranspiration<00:05:48.749> so<00:05:49.749> when<00:05:49.959> we<00:05:50.139> want<00:05:50.439> for

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:50.709 
evapotranspiration so when we want for

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:52.769 
evapotranspiration so when we want for
water<00:05:50.919> to<00:05:51.189> stay<00:05:51.429> deep<00:05:51.879> into<00:05:52.209> the<00:05:52.329> ground<00:05:52.599> we

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
water to stay deep into the ground we

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.529 
water to stay deep into the ground we

and<00:06:48.279> build<00:06:48.939> these<00:06:49.089> recharge<00:06:49.629> wells<00:06:49.959> so<00:06:50.139> the

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
and build these recharge wells so the

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.139 
and build these recharge wells so the
ones<00:06:50.439> that<00:06:50.679> we've<00:06:50.829> made<00:06:51.099> here<00:06:51.309> are<00:06:51.519> 20<00:06:51.939> feet

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:52.149 
ones that we've made here are 20 feet

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:55.049 
ones that we've made here are 20 feet
deep<00:06:52.419> and<00:06:52.629> three<00:06:53.169> feet<00:06:53.379> in<00:06:53.559> diameter<00:06:53.769> and<00:06:54.729> each

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:55.059 
deep and three feet in diameter and each

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:56.790 
deep and three feet in diameter and each
of<00:06:55.239> the<00:06:55.329> wells<00:06:55.539> is<00:06:55.779> about<00:06:56.050> a<00:06:56.079> four<00:06:56.469> thousand

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
of the wells is about a four thousand

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.709 
of the wells is about a four thousand
litre<00:06:56.979> capacity<00:06:57.249> so<00:06:57.699> that's<00:06:57.999> the<00:06:58.209> volume<00:06:58.419> of

00:06:58.709 --> 00:06:58.719 
litre capacity so that's the volume of

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.809 
litre capacity so that's the volume of
what<00:06:58.959> it<00:06:59.110> can<00:06:59.259> hold<00:06:59.529> at<00:06:59.649> any<00:06:59.829> one<00:07:00.039> time<00:07:00.069> but

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819 
what it can hold at any one time but

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.879 
what it can hold at any one time but
it's<00:07:00.999> continuously<00:07:01.629> putting<00:07:02.050> water<00:07:02.319> into<00:07:02.649> the

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
it's continuously putting water into the

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.409 
it's continuously putting water into the
ground<00:07:03.009> depending<00:07:03.610> on<00:07:03.699> how<00:07:03.849> much<00:07:03.999> it<00:07:04.149> rains

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:04.419 
ground depending on how much it rains

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.299 
ground depending on how much it rains
you<00:07:04.779> can<00:07:04.809> have<00:07:05.110> larger<00:07:05.499> wells<00:07:05.709> five<00:07:06.039> feet

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:06.309 
you can have larger wells five feet

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:09.149 
you can have larger wells five feet
diameter<00:07:06.489> and<00:07:07.059> 30<00:07:07.329> feet<00:07:07.659> deep<00:07:07.779> as<00:07:08.019> well<00:07:08.229> okay

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:09.159 
diameter and 30 feet deep as well okay

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:11.069 
diameter and 30 feet deep as well okay
so<00:07:09.579> obviously<00:07:09.669> somewhere<00:07:10.239> at<00:07:10.449> the<00:07:10.599> bottom<00:07:10.959> of

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:11.079 
so obviously somewhere at the bottom of

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:13.799 
so obviously somewhere at the bottom of
that<00:07:11.319> 20<00:07:12.159> feet<00:07:12.369> or<00:07:12.519> 30<00:07:12.699> feet<00:07:13.149> is<00:07:13.360> a<00:07:13.389> way<00:07:13.659> in

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:13.809 
that 20 feet or 30 feet is a way in

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:15.179 
that 20 feet or 30 feet is a way in
which<00:07:13.839> the<00:07:14.079> water<00:07:14.259> actually<00:07:14.559> then<00:07:14.889> goes<00:07:15.159> back

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:15.189 
which the water actually then goes back

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:17.279 
which the water actually then goes back
into<00:07:15.399> the<00:07:15.669> ground<00:07:15.909> exactly<00:07:16.689> it<00:07:16.839> goes<00:07:16.990> deep

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:17.289 
into the ground exactly it goes deep

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:18.540 
into the ground exactly it goes deep
into<00:07:17.469> the<00:07:17.680> ground<00:07:17.979> not<00:07:18.189> just

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
into the ground not just

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.950 
into the ground not just
the<00:07:18.700> bottom<00:07:19.090> but<00:07:19.270> there's<00:07:19.420> some<00:07:19.570> percolation

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
the bottom but there's some percolation

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.930 
the bottom but there's some percolation
from<00:07:20.230> the<00:07:20.350> sides<00:07:20.590> as<00:07:20.860> well<00:07:21.040> we<00:07:21.550> call<00:07:21.730> it<00:07:21.760> a

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
from the sides as well we call it a

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.300 
from the sides as well we call it a
leaky<00:07:22.390> well<00:07:22.570> the<00:07:23.110> rings<00:07:23.350> are<00:07:23.620> just<00:07:23.650> placed<00:07:24.070> one

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
leaky well the rings are just placed one

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.800 
leaky well the rings are just placed one
above<00:07:24.460> the<00:07:24.730> other<00:07:24.880> there<00:07:25.150> is<00:07:25.180> no<00:07:25.240> plastering

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
above the other there is no plastering

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.930 
above the other there is no plastering
at<00:07:26.050> all<00:07:26.200> so<00:07:26.710> the<00:07:26.830> water<00:07:27.010> just<00:07:27.250> percolates<00:07:27.730> out

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:27.940 
at all so the water just percolates out

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.210 
at all so the water just percolates out
from<00:07:28.180> wherever<00:07:28.360> it<00:07:28.630> fronts

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.220
