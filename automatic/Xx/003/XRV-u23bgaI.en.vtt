00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.280 
dynamic for video games or at least
that's<00:02:26.349> what<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.019> can<00:02:29.170> turn

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
that's what I like and then you can turn

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.869 
that's what I like and then you can turn
the<00:02:29.349> auto<00:02:29.560> Motion<00:02:29.769> Plus<00:02:30.040> off<00:02:30.370> because<00:02:30.549> video

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
the auto Motion Plus off because video

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.520 
the auto Motion Plus off because video
games<00:02:30.910> are<00:02:31.239> kind<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.480> multi-layered<00:02:32.049> anyway

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
games are kind of multi-layered anyway

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.850 
games are kind of multi-layered anyway
and<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:32.980> almost<00:02:33.129> works<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.989> advantage<00:02:35.019> but

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
and it almost works to the advantage but

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.180 
and it almost works to the advantage but
video<00:02:36.190> gaming<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:38.049> resolution<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.799> textures

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
video gaming the resolution and textures

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.490 
video gaming the resolution and textures
this<00:02:39.400> thing<00:02:39.580> we'll<00:02:39.700> put<00:02:39.849> out<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.120> ridiculous
