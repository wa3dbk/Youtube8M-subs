00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 only on Saturdays and Sundays the top hat 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.440
 Full welcome to another video 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.910
 captured in the video commentary of the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.370
 second round 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.040
 I am here today to speak this in the system of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.980
 go the third round to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.619
 you want to have many cartoletas this is the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.619
 only move that came 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.340
 the system of valuation of the third 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.010
 round is more different than that of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.870
 first and second round will be the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.480
 round now prices have already 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.280
 have stabilized and you should change your 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.940
 strategy from the third 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.070
 round 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.989
 always remember that the tendency is for the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.629
 player who went wrong in the previous round 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.680
 having to value and player that was well 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.239
 tends to devalue the system of 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.129
 valuing the third round 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.899
 employee follows the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.880
 player who went bad in the second round 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.729
 tends to value if you make the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.710
 greater than the last round. 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.070
 attacker example the attacker of goias 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.090
 bruno henrique to 19.70 in the round 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.130
 last 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.220
 to value you must have the highest grade 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.060
 than 19.70 even taking 20 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.680
 another example is the midfield 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.729
 mt 2.90 classes even taking 45 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.390
 tendency is to value the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.220
 devaluation of the third round 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.680
 work follows the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.119
 player who went well in the second round in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.509
 appreciation trend 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.630
 if you make the smallest note that will run 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.759
 example miner athletic Luanda turned 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.460
 19.20 will feel 18 he will devalue 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.100
 In order to appreciate, you have to take note 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.579
 greater than taught example control is the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.619
 Rodney from the black bridge went well on both 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.950
 rounds but what matters is the last 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.100
 round is the one that's going to say he's going 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.870
 appreciated or devalued on the second 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.390
 group round 14 points 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.620
 to devalue will have temperament that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.380
 Untie 14.30 will only value you will feel 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.600
 more than 14 points 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.270
 this video is not an indication 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.570
 third round policies there are not 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.420
 either because they advance and beauty players 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.590
 more suitable to put only the left 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.410
 it is not worth much slow but that 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.770
 have you seen play and who plays at home and 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.010
 note was not so good and not so bad 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.000
 I will give some examples the note that I 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.850
 I spoke 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.120
 the note from the last round beauty some 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.680
 examples are there on the screen is the gustavo 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.080
 athletic paranaense the team b sound 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.970
 and Basque gilberto and the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.250
 pierre do fluminense 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.620
 I put these four as an example not 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.200
 it means that they're going to leave 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.810
 now running to make it our team 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 so the video dedication comes out on Wednesday 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.239
 market 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.340
 beauty so let's go there good players 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.830
 to face this round only they 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.739
 that will debut because it has no note 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.739
 nor average and adding only a short story 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.930
 has a tendency to value beauty 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.760
 You guys want to know the players that I 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.030
