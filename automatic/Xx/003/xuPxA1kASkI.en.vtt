00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.480
 Please turn on the air-conditioner like this and there is no special odor 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.800

 Again, of course this is the way you go back to the monitor 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.840
 As we can hit even back camera, we want to actually put in back camera now

 It is a used car often sleeping and around the panel 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.519
 It is a noticeable scratch or black that there is dirt
