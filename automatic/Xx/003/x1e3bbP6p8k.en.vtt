00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.010
 It is very nice to see that very often when you talk about it on the ship 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.889
 people also think of star wars like robots on the terminal one's example 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.990
 typical of human form 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.950
 But you also get a lot of robots that the director doesn't like 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.439
 humanoid robot can be a lot more handy 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.699
 plysjes points 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.490
 also generally it is mainly 14 princess mathilde and dangerous 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.149
 chores office chores on 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.110
 do odd jobs 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.610
 the plan area he used was a very structured environment where she 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.680
 went to work 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.400
 The hague is that there are more and more information at Hoevelaken 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.130
 Saturday in Emmen she finds the hospital in the Netherlands and worldwide 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.910
 there is no petition on the internet 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.040
 immediately refuse a stage for operations performed in the hospital 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.150
 and that is also a high time that you would have that operation at a great distance 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.160
 can perform shishan surgery involving the surgeon in new 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.620
 york the patient was sitting on the operating table 18 in strasbourg i also see one 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.750
 treasure map 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.390
 he did a lot better 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.220
 and i can only do different facial expressions 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.750
 made the swedish union at stake yes but i was also moving a lot and 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.990
 sports park 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.070
 and then you can, for example, play games to learn today 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.030
 Being deployed to children we are going to learn things about fraud and it is 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.150
 actually a sort of yes interaction on the social around 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.600
 what kind of robots can be expected in the next few years 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.410
 perform specific tasks 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.070
 because that on 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
 it is also a task to focus and that we can perform well 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.630
 a humanoid robot so you have to have two high expectations of his child 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.700
 that lasted a long time because walking your feet is very difficult 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.890
 the robot basically responded to town like someone who is not happy or 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.829
 sad is the move and too complicated to be the technological one 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.310
 robot to build in so I think it is mainly with according to specific 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.560
 tasks of the apes with simon 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.030
 for example i still go over the seal after a few go into the scenery 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.920
 austria seals that he produces so he is also sound 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.400
 something about the roads to the multi responses he can also on you 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.149
 so respond if you talk to it more often than recognize quality system 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.390
 people who deal with it more often, especially the elderly, they do it anyway 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.950
 a bit calmer and more relaxed it would be elderly 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.230
 russcher just hoped that i like the difference 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.819
 to make the people 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.230
 never again it is not so much the roman more naturally interact with 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.519
 this quote is a seal so I can get in a traffic jam and get the back from m 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.069
 actually it is designed with the idea of ​​replacing one of the pet 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.439
 in a house type of course also always for a certain period of time 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.709
 and then it won't die 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.390
 9 Take it from me now and then
