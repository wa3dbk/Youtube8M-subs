that I'm going to link to that will be

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.629 
that I'm going to link to that will be
in<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> description<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.740> video<00:00:13.950> that

in the description of this video that
will<00:00:15.000> explain<00:00:15.260> what<00:00:16.260> DNS<00:00:17.060> settings<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
will explain what DNS settings and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.660 
will explain what DNS settings and
servers<00:00:18.779> are<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.740> why<00:00:19.920> they're<00:00:20.130> important<00:00:20.640> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
servers are and why they're important to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.019 
servers are and why they're important to
your<00:00:20.850> computer<00:00:21.439> now<00:00:22.439> you're<00:00:22.980> probably<00:00:23.310> not

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
your computer now you're probably not

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.400 
your computer now you're probably not
going<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.390> see<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> noticeable<00:00:25.019> difference

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
going to see a noticeable difference

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.140 
going to see a noticeable difference
unless<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.220> DNS<00:00:26.609> server<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.970> you're

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
unless the DNS server that you're

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.439 
unless the DNS server that you're
currently<00:00:27.539> using<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:28.310> slow<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.609> typically

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
currently using is slow as typically

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.540 
currently using is slow as typically
the<00:00:31.230> interaction<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> DNS<00:00:32.369> server

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the interaction with the DNS server

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.639 
the interaction with the DNS server
happens<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.239> milliseconds<00:00:33.960> instead<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.559> in

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
happens in milliseconds instead of in

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.319 
happens in milliseconds instead of in
seconds<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.000> show<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.149> how<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
seconds but I'm going to show you how to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.440 
seconds but I'm going to show you how to
change<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.750> anyway<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.940> first<00:00:39.210> place

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
change it anyway so the first place

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.319 
change it anyway so the first place
you're<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.960> want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:42.000> this
