 Hello, my name is Dmitry 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.500
 the tops I am the technical director 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.049
 tenge companies 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.820
 Our company is engaged in the development and 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.160
 production of multifunctional 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 ATVs I myself own 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.590
 one of all-terrain vehicles and very often when 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.440
 hunting and fishing trips 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.110
 there is a question of transporting large 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.559
 quantities will be especially relevant 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.100
 not on multi-day hunting trips and 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.790
 fishing 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.500
 so the idea was born in the creation 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.640
 multifunctional trailer 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.430
 which can be operated in any 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.610
 road conditions for which not 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.610

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.310
 such a trailer was created by tenge 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.100
 I want to tell you about his design 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.710
 and functionality based on 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.110

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.760
 the hull is that it's light 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.770
 sealed and hard case not 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.990
 prone to corrosion he carried that 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.470
 exploitation and blows a me even 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.470
