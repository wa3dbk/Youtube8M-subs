00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.230
 welcome these sketchup pills judge the cups. is one 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.540
 very precious instrument perra 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.239
 save a lot of time during the sun 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:11.939
 how to do it runs very very simple 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.349
 we select from the subject we take the tulle 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.269
 move 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.539
 we click on an object and start moving 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.249
 as for a normal couple 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.380
 press the key check 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.189
 in windos and other mac 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.499
 and positions I love our cochetto shipment thirst and thirty-five that a 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.700
 this point before moving the mouse to do any perfection 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.280
 we have the possibility to enter the number of copies using the keyboard 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.260
 we want 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.290
 for example by typing 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.610
 * 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.640
 4 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.140
 generate m or 4 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.240
 Marco 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 that the same distance is placed for the first one 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.120
 in the same way 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.870
 we are type 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.050
 4 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.050
 press inter and get the same result 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.750
 similarly seee instead of the number of copies we are interested to create hack 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 multiple instances of the same object within the range for example 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.520
 I know that 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.050
 and to the extremes 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.180
 of this group of objects are positioned at 105 micro on the other 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.920
 and there are 3 other couples inside after having done the abandon copy 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 mouse I go to the keyboard I write for example 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.960
 divided 4 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.880
 and 13 others are placed in the interval 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 or in the same way 5 divided 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.790
 and in this case 4 objects will be inserted 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.440
 so this depending on what makes us more comfortable if the number is if we know 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.780
 number of objects in a set interval even if we simply want 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.520
 create 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.520
 a large number I say that we can stand the deductions 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.800
 obviously this then 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 it can be repeated on all axes 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.169
 pes I give a small example for example here superquattro 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.689
 we see that they select all the objects we can repeat on the z axis 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.989
 for example 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.929
 50 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.929
 for 4 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.929
 selecting everything again 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.929
 if there is a way completely along the z axis 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:33.840
 and repeat 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.179
 r4 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:39.509
 here we see that in a few seconds we have created a set of rules 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.419
 of objects 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:48.019
 that we can group move directors reo simular mention as a pair 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.959
 the same features are offered by 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.989
 are you. because I love you so much you want me 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.349
 so first of all let's move 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.379
 the arrow catching fish how many centimeters along the axis 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.719
 and with the wheel tube we refuse the fires begins to be explained in the life of the 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.649
 pairs 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.659
 30 degree examples 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.599
 similarly at this point 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.120
 we can go back to the keyboard and type the number of shots we want 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.569
 for example reopen 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.569
 fairs we can cover a 90 degree angle 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.139
 chopper 11 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.469
 we will get keko faeces together for everything 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.469
 the circumference 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.849
 very similar to how we saw earlier we can create 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.849
 a pair 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.119
 and ask sketchup 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.669
 create a number of intermediate tiles for example 2 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.049
 and so on 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.739
 thanks for your attention to the next little one
