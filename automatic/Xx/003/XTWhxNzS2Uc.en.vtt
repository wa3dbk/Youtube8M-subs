I<00:00:12.019> painted<00:00:13.019> four<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.469> them<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.450> then<00:00:15.450> went<00:00:15.839> on

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
I painted four of them and then went on

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.420 
I painted four of them and then went on
the<00:00:16.080> space<00:00:16.350> Hawk<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.830> didn't<00:00:17.130> paint<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the space Hawk and didn't paint the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.670 
the space Hawk and didn't paint the
other<00:00:17.520> four<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.810> now<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> finished<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
other four but now that I finished the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.670 
other four but now that I finished the
gene<00:00:19.920> stealers<00:00:20.430> completely<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.619> went<00:00:22.619> ahead

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
gene stealers completely I went ahead

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.939

and<00:00:22.980> painted<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.910> remaining<00:00:24.390> four<00:00:24.660> bots<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.590> I

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and painted the remaining four bots so I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.589 
and painted the remaining four bots so I
thought<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> would<00:00:26.640> take<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> break<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
thought I would take a break here and

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.040

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.249 

I<00:01:56.640> gave<00:01:57.329> them<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.570> lot<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> battle-damaged
