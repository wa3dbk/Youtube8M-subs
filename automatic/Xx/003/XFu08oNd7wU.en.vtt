00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.220
 that's why burgmeier aus markt now 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.400
 indersdorf 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.030
 He has here in the trailer park Munich 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.519
 9 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.519
 the k three-way tipper for nonsense 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.010
 bought new to the trailer is 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.130
 actually the new steel alu band 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.600
 Steel wall called the big advantage 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.990
 So this new wall is actually 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 that it is a normal aluminum 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.199
 wall is the but in addition with inside 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 galvanized steel profiles is planned 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.520
 maybe we can do the sidewall 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.780
 is pads burg Meier all vehicle 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.879
 since about three months in use and the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.440
 castle wall drive a lot of road trash garbage 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.440
 what do you drive mainly hamburg 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.299
 Materials had to be so that 's it 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.880
 Here exactly the area where just 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.070
 These steel walls are used 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.090
 So you can see that very beautiful here 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.190
 So the material already at an alu 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.630
 wall here would wear out heavily 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.600
 however, with this galvanized 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.470
 planking, it is actually ideal for 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.440
 this for this material to drive what 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:43.310
 you look for a field of experience 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:48.500
 currently martin drive so stable and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.869
 also send the dtb as they equal 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.660
 have to keep up for piece of internet 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.090
 dimensionally stable broadcast exactly where not 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.410
 last of course the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.660
 Weight optimization but in comparison 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.759
 to a top double-walled steel profile 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.530
 of course, the wall is now wall 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.690
 but much easier in the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.380
 operability also holds the game 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.380
 certainly also a role 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.250
 despite ballack exactly 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.250
 exactly
