think<00:01:55.920> sweet<00:01:56.280> i'm<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.610> find<00:01:56.790> more<00:01:56.970> stuff

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
think sweet i'm going to find more stuff

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.980 
think sweet i'm going to find more stuff
or<00:01:58.370> no<00:01:59.370> now<00:02:00.150> they're<00:02:00.330> not<00:02:00.480> going<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.660> be<00:02:00.780> as

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
or no now they're not going to be as

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.770 
or no now they're not going to be as
rare<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.100> items<00:02:02.490> are<00:02:02.670> going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
rare and the items are going to be you

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.470 
rare and the items are going to be you
know<00:02:03.900> all<00:02:04.290> over<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.830> place<00:02:05.040> now<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:06.210> i<00:02:06.270> don't

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
know all over the place now but i don't

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.300 
know all over the place now but i don't
really<00:02:06.570> think<00:02:06.810> that's<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.650> case<00:02:07.830> because

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
really think that's the case because

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.520 
really think that's the case because
it's<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.119> there's<00:02:09.360> tons<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.170> them<00:02:10.350> now

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
it's not like there's tons of them now

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.620 
it's not like there's tons of them now
they're<00:02:10.770> pretty<00:02:11.040> hard<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> find<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.910> mean<00:02:12.360> all

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
they're pretty hard to find I mean all

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.040 
they're pretty hard to find I mean all
on<00:02:12.810> my<00:02:12.930> plane<00:02:13.200> I've<00:02:13.410> only<00:02:13.560> found<00:02:14.600> mmm<00:02:15.600> maybe

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
on my plane I've only found mmm maybe

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.500 
on my plane I've only found mmm maybe
five<00:02:16.470> legendaries<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.240> set<00:02:18.600> items<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:19.590> I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
five legendaries and to set items so I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.640 
five legendaries and to set items so I
don't<00:02:21.510> think<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.260> all<00:02:22.470> that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
don't think it's going to be all that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.240 
don't think it's going to be all that
bad<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.960> think<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.380> really<00:02:25.590> good<00:02:25.740> idea

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
bad and I think it's really good idea

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.140 
bad and I think it's really good idea
actually<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:29.040> lot<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.730> people<00:02:29.940> are

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
actually and a lot of people are

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.550 
actually and a lot of people are
complaining<00:02:30.450> about<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.930> wizard<00:02:31.260> stuff

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
complaining about the wizard stuff

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.620 
complaining about the wizard stuff
getting<00:02:31.890> their<00:02:32.130> sword<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.820> who<00:02:33.090> knows<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.450> might

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
getting their sword so who knows I might

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.470 
getting their sword so who knows I might
still<00:02:33.960> be<00:02:34.080> changed<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.030> thought<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.360> was

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
still be changed but I thought that was

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.660 
still be changed but I thought that was
really<00:02:36.660> cool<00:02:36.780> about<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.290> doubling<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:38.280> drops

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
really cool about the doubling the drops

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.130 
really cool about the doubling the drops
and<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> figured<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.300> guys<00:02:39.330> want<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:39.930> that

much<00:03:42.959> crap<00:03:43.319> on<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.650> PTR<00:03:44.099> and<00:03:44.519> there's<00:03:44.670> no<00:03:44.879> way

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
much crap on the PTR and there's no way

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.879 
much crap on the PTR and there's no way
I<00:03:45.060> could<00:03:45.329> be<00:03:45.420> monster<00:03:45.840> level<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.319> or<00:03:46.620> whatever
