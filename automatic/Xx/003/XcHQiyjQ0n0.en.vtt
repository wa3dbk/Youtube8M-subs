now<00:03:18.880> I'm<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.300> using<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.810> heated<00:03:20.350> thermal

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
round brush and I'm taking this through

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.470 
round brush and I'm taking this through
the<00:03:23.140> ends<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.590> my<00:03:23.620> hair<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:24.430> as<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.240> guys<00:03:25.330> can

see<00:03:25.660> I'm<00:03:25.780> wrapping<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.290> around<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.590> brush<00:03:26.890> and

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
see I'm wrapping it around the brush and

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.730 
see I'm wrapping it around the brush and
then<00:03:27.430> with<00:03:27.940> one<00:03:28.240> hand<00:03:28.540> I'm<00:03:28.780> turning<00:03:29.470> the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
then with one hand I'm turning the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.220 
then with one hand I'm turning the
handle<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.400> just<00:03:30.870> stabilizing<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:31.990> with<00:03:32.110> the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
handle and just stabilizing it with the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.110 
handle and just stabilizing it with the
other<00:03:32.380> hand<00:03:32.770> this<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.550> going<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.760> give<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
other hand this is going to give the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:43.580 
other hand this is going to give the
ends<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.570> really<00:03:34.870> polished<00:03:35.700> voluminous<00:03:36.700> look

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.280 

I'm<00:03:44.590> working<00:03:44.920> in<00:03:45.040> sections<00:03:45.520> about<00:03:46.120> two<00:03:46.750> two

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
I'm working in sections about two two

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.530 
I'm working in sections about two two
and<00:03:47.320> a<00:03:47.500> half<00:03:47.650> inches<00:03:48.100> wide<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.940> just<00:03:49.360> don't

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
and a half inches wide you just don't

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.850 
and a half inches wide you just don't
want<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.780> use<00:03:49.930> sections<00:03:50.380> that<00:03:50.530> are<00:03:50.650> bigger

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
want to use sections that are bigger

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.770 
want to use sections that are bigger
than<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.220> brush<00:03:51.460> because<00:03:51.790> then<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.600> can

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
than the brush because then that can

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.750 
than the brush because then that can
cause<00:03:52.960> tangling<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.740> it's<00:03:54.130> too<00:03:54.370> much<00:03:54.550> to

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
cause tangling and it's too much to

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.520 
cause tangling and it's too much to
handle<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.330> just<00:03:55.930> make<00:03:56.080> sure<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.230> the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
handle so just make sure that the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.250 
handle so just make sure that the
sections<00:03:56.920> you're<00:03:57.070> using<00:03:57.340> are<00:03:57.670> smaller<00:03:58.630> than

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
sections you're using are smaller than

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:21.230 
sections you're using are smaller than
the<00:03:59.470> width<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.830> your<00:03:59.890> brush

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.000 

and<00:04:22.240> now<00:04:23.110> I'm<00:04:23.199> going<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.440> be<00:04:23.500> doing<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.830> same

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
and now I'm going to be doing the same

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.590 
and now I'm going to be doing the same
thing<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.400> left<00:04:24.550> side<00:04:24.820> working<00:04:25.330> with

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
thing on the left side working with

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.360 
thing on the left side working with
sections<00:04:26.139> that<00:04:26.440> are<00:04:26.560> about<00:04:26.830> two

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
sections that are about two

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.120 
sections that are about two
two-and-a-half<00:04:28.000> inches<00:04:28.630> wide<00:04:28.960> just<00:04:29.830> making

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
two-and-a-half inches wide just making

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.469 
two-and-a-half inches wide just making
sure<00:04:30.160> that<00:04:30.280> it's<00:04:30.550> never<00:04:30.699> wider<00:04:31.030> than<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
sure that it's never wider than the

00:04:31.479 --> 00:05:25.579 
sure that it's never wider than the
brush

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:25.589 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:28.379 

for<00:05:26.589> this<00:05:26.709> last<00:05:26.949> section<00:05:27.219> that's<00:05:27.579> framing<00:05:28.119> the

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
for this last section that's framing the

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.600 
for this last section that's framing the
right<00:05:28.719> side<00:05:28.929> of<00:05:29.049> my<00:05:29.079> face<00:05:29.499> I<00:05:29.709> started<00:05:30.249> up<00:05:30.399> at

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
right side of my face I started up at

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.459 
right side of my face I started up at
the<00:05:30.729> root<00:05:30.939> rather<00:05:31.269> than<00:05:31.569> the<00:05:31.689> end<00:05:31.869> because<00:05:32.349> I

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
the root rather than the end because I

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.589 
the root rather than the end because I
wanted<00:05:32.739> to<00:05:32.799> give<00:05:33.039> some<00:05:33.219> volume<00:05:33.399> so<00:05:34.329> I<00:05:34.360> just

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
wanted to give some volume so I just

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.869 
wanted to give some volume so I just
wanted<00:05:34.839> to<00:05:34.899> heat<00:05:35.379> up<00:05:35.409> those<00:05:35.919> top<00:05:36.399> parts<00:05:36.729> of<00:05:36.819> the

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
wanted to heat up those top parts of the

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.119 
wanted to heat up those top parts of the
hair<00:05:37.179> so<00:05:37.449> that<00:05:37.509> they<00:05:37.809> stayed<00:05:38.589> away<00:05:38.769> from<00:05:38.979> the

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:39.129 
hair so that they stayed away from the

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:49.360 
hair so that they stayed away from the
face<00:05:39.429> a<00:05:39.459> little<00:05:39.819> bit

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370

I'm going to do this in two parts taking
sections<00:05:54.560> that<00:05:54.800> are<00:05:54.860> about<00:05:55.250> three<00:05:55.730> inches

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
sections that are about three inches

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
keep them up at the root just by turning

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.189 
keep them up at the root just by turning
the<00:06:00.800> brush<00:06:00.979> and<00:06:01.430> curling<00:06:02.330> these<00:06:02.510> pieces<00:06:02.990> in

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.390 

for<00:06:25.569> a<00:06:25.600> little<00:06:25.960> bit<00:06:26.110> more<00:06:26.500> extra<00:06:26.830> volume<00:06:27.220> I'm

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
for a little bit more extra volume I'm

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
that into my roots so that when I take

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.870 
that into my roots so that when I take
the<00:06:34.599> thermal<00:06:34.810> brush<00:06:35.139> it<00:06:35.470> heats<00:06:35.800> up<00:06:36.009> and<00:06:36.220> keeps

the<00:06:37.030> volume<00:06:37.419> in<00:06:37.630> the<00:06:37.750> roots

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.980 

now<00:06:57.190> I'm<00:06:57.370> just<00:06:57.550> going<00:06:57.760> to<00:06:57.880> brush<00:06:58.360> through<00:06:58.630> one

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990
