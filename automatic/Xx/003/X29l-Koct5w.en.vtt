like<00:00:25.810> so<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:29.349> hands<00:00:30.009> cross<00:00:30.989> like<00:00:31.989> so

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
like so and here the hands cross like so

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.170 
like so and here the hands cross like so
so<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:34.450> my<00:00:34.630> case<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.930> white<00:00:35.440> is<00:00:35.710> on<00:00:35.890> top<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.850> the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
so in my case the white is on top of the

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.389 
so in my case the white is on top of the
pink<00:00:37.450> and<00:00:37.810> the<00:00:38.640> white<00:00:39.640> wraps<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:41.039> the<00:00:42.039> pink

flexes<00:00:43.300> can<00:00:44.170> you<00:00:44.320> see<00:00:44.590> so<00:00:45.250> they<00:00:45.850> cross<00:00:47.340> one

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
flexes can you see so they cross one

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.720 
flexes can you see so they cross one
wraps<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.989> flexing<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.429> think<00:00:51.640> this

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
wraps one flexing and you think this

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.259 
wraps one flexing and you think this
switch<00:00:52.149> positions<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.370> white<00:00:54.670> will

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
switch positions and then the white will

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.520 
switch positions and then the white will
be<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.449> leading<00:00:55.929> hand<00:00:56.579> pulling<00:00:57.579> across<00:00:58.530> since

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.180 

hi<00:03:06.970> once<00:03:07.630> you've<00:03:07.810> got<00:03:08.020> your<00:03:08.050> five<00:03:08.530> eat<00:03:08.860> we've

hi once you've got your five eat we've
going<00:03:09.610> forwards<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.420> backwards<00:03:10.690> then<00:03:11.500> you

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
going forwards and backwards then you

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.920 
going forwards and backwards then you
can<00:03:11.800> think<00:03:12.010> about<00:03:12.190> linking<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.720> two

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
can think about linking the the two

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.670 
can think about linking the the two
together<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.430> start<00:03:15.970> with<00:03:16.090> your<00:03:16.660> 5b<00:03:17.440> tweet

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
together so start with your 5b tweet

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.580 
together so start with your 5b tweet
forwards<00:03:18.870> think<00:03:19.870> about<00:03:20.080> which<00:03:20.230> way<00:03:20.440> you're

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
forwards think about which way you're

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.290 
forwards think about which way you're
going<00:03:20.770> to<00:03:20.980> turn<00:03:21.220> I'm<00:03:21.520> going<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.700> turn<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.270> my

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
going to turn I'm going to turn to my

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.320 
going to turn I'm going to turn to my
right<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.920> I'm<00:03:23.980> going<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.250> just<00:03:24.310> get<00:03:24.820> my<00:03:25.060> right

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
right so I'm going to just get my right

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.170 
right so I'm going to just get my right
foot<00:03:25.630> behind<00:03:25.810> me<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:26.950> can<00:03:27.190> easily<00:03:27.430> go<00:03:27.850> into

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
foot behind me so I can easily go into

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:38.300 
foot behind me so I can easily go into
