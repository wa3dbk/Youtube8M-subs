that<00:03:15.900> was<00:03:16.019> pretty<00:03:16.169> much<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.379> only<00:03:16.500> chance<00:03:16.859> we

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
that was pretty much the only chance we

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.339 
that was pretty much the only chance we
did<00:03:17.220> get<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:17.729> game<00:03:18.060> because<00:03:18.810> yeah<00:03:19.139> when

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
did get in this game because yeah when

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.839 
did get in this game because yeah when
you<00:03:19.470> play<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.680> fellow<00:03:19.949> YouTube's<00:03:20.400> killer<00:03:20.639> or

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
you play a fellow YouTube's killer or

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.629 
you play a fellow YouTube's killer or
just<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.209> scalar<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.750> general<00:03:22.169> it's<00:03:22.639> pretty

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
just a scalar in general it's pretty

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.819 
just a scalar in general it's pretty
hard<00:03:23.909> to<00:03:24.000> create<00:03:24.419> chances<00:03:24.810> because<00:03:25.260> both<00:03:25.500> we

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
hard to create chances because both we

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.500 
hard to create chances because both we
use<00:03:26.129> a<00:03:26.159> lot<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.519> skill<00:03:26.849> moves<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.299> have<00:03:27.389> to

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
use a lot of skill moves so we have to

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.270 
use a lot of skill moves so we have to
get<00:03:27.659> past<00:03:28.109> like<00:03:28.379> pretty<00:03:28.799> much<00:03:28.979> his<00:03:29.129> whole

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
get past like pretty much his whole

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.099 
get past like pretty much his whole
defense<00:03:29.579> in<00:03:29.729> order<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.329> get<00:03:30.479> a<00:03:30.510> proper<00:03:30.810> shot

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
defense in order to to get a proper shot

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.479 
defense in order to to get a proper shot
on<00:03:31.229> target<00:03:31.409> and<00:03:31.739> sometimes<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.459> doesn't

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
on target and sometimes it doesn't

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.849 
on target and sometimes it doesn't
really<00:03:32.849> work<00:03:33.060> out<00:03:33.239> well<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.690> got<00:03:34.409> quite<00:03:34.590> lucky

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
really work out well I got quite lucky

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.110 
really work out well I got quite lucky
there<00:03:34.979> with<00:03:35.099> Michael<00:03:35.459> late<00:03:35.609> as<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.879> can<00:03:35.970> see

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
there with Michael late as you can see

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.759 
there with Michael late as you can see
is<00:03:36.239> well<00:03:36.389> we<00:03:36.510> almost<00:03:36.629> scored<00:03:36.840> from<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.409> bit<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.680> a

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
is well we almost scored from a bit of a

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.680 
is well we almost scored from a bit of a
long<00:03:38.010> shot<00:03:38.040> there<00:03:38.340> with<00:03:38.519> Williams<00:03:38.849> but<00:03:39.000> that

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
long shot there with Williams but that

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.059 
long shot there with Williams but that
was<00:03:39.810> pretty<00:03:39.959> much<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.169> game<00:03:40.409> not<00:03:40.620> really<00:03:40.680> much

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
was pretty much the game not really much

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.339 
was pretty much the game not really much
going<00:03:41.129> on<00:03:41.729> apart<00:03:42.120> from<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.329> lot<00:03:42.419> of<00:03:42.599> play<00:03:43.049> on<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
going on apart from a lot of play on the

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.860 
going on apart from a lot of play on the
midfield<00:03:43.799> which<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> think<00:03:44.459> pretty<00:03:45.299> boring

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
midfield which is I think pretty boring

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.199 
midfield which is I think pretty boring
to<00:03:46.079> watch<00:03:46.159> so<00:03:47.159> didn't<00:03:47.459> really<00:03:47.609> include<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.090> and

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
to watch so didn't really include it and

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.059 
to watch so didn't really include it and
as<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.329> can<00:03:48.419> see<00:03:48.449> as<00:03:48.690> well<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:49.229> only<00:03:49.470> like<00:03:49.829> one

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
as you can see as well we only like one

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.520 
as you can see as well we only like one
shot<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.459> target<00:03:50.669> and<00:03:50.940> he<00:03:51.060> had<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.329> so<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.379> game

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
shot on target and he had to so the game

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.740 
shot on target and he had to so the game
wasn't<00:03:52.739> really<00:03:52.949> that<00:03:53.099> interesting<00:03:53.639> but<00:03:53.750> it

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
wasn't really that interesting but it

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.439 
wasn't really that interesting but it
was<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.959> fun<00:03:55.709> game<00:03:55.949> to<00:03:55.979> play<00:03:56.159> so<00:03:56.669> again<00:03:57.060> we<00:03:57.209> move

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
was a fun game to play so again we move

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.059 
was a fun game to play so again we move
on<00:03:57.629> into<00:03:57.780> another<00:03:58.169> game<00:03:58.439> and<00:03:58.650> we<00:03:58.859> come<00:03:59.010> up

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
on into another game and we come up

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.250 
on into another game and we come up
