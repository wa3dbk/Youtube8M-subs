00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.090
 i 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.780
 two 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.910
 Y 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.910
 Today we prepare homemade wine 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.990
 if there was, it is believed that there was no 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.270
 alternative for the jelly beans you were 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.189
 very wrong in this video we will see 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.189
 how to make them taste delicious 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.480
 The first thing we are going to do is prepare 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.640
 the molds for this we paint the edges 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.890
 with sunflower oil we can use 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.300
 molds for chocolates or even make 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.300
 a fountain and cut it after 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.190
 we will start putting 200 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.230
 milliliters of water 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.650
 we throw the two jelly sachets of 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.050
 other 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.670
 they are 10 grams each on these two 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.190
 envelopes would be to throw them out of leaves 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.700
 of gelatine and we raise until it 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.700
 all right 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.390
 we throw the flavor jelly envelope 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.530
 we mix 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.700
 and once dissolved we will throw 300 grams 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.700
 of sugar 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.620
 we dissolve it well 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.430
 and we'll leave it on the fire for 3 or 4 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.430
 non-stop minutes 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.160
 in this case we have used raspberry 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.560
 although there are many cherry flavors 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.210
 apple orange strawberries tutti frutti 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.040
 the next thing we do and pour it in 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.790
 the mold we will do it when the gelatin 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.790
 It is not very hot 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.390
 remember that we can use different 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.390
 flavors 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.980
 the other option is to do it at the source and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.980
 cut it to us 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.460
 and now let's let it rest for 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.979
 some five or six final hours that 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.530
 we cut it to rest if we use or 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.450
 cut pasta a good trick is to wet the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.690
 in the sunflower oil and cut the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.690
 jelly 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.610
 we press move slightly for the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.610
 sides 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.939
 free from the mold 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.770
 and the next step is bathed in the 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.770
 sugar 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.709
 if we go and book 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.280
 and if you do not have a short pasteur, it does not happen 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.540
 nothing with the help of a knife 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.219
 cutting and making shapes 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.510
 good since we have our jellybeans 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.510
 these would be the sugar-free 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.609
 and for the sweet tooth we have here with 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.609
 sugar 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.310
 you see that it has been simple 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.630
 these are the ingredients that we have 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.580
 used 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.710
 and this has been everything I invite you to prepare 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.930
 our own jellybeans and if it has 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.680
 liked the video do not forget to share it 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.680
 and give the like 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.730
 how good they are today helped and I think not 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.480
 they'll be months later 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.480
 this truth 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.970
 I'm going to take a handful
