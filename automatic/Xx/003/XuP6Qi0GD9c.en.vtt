funky<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.160> think<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.610> correct<00:00:42.149> term<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
funky is I think the correct term the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.940 
funky is I think the correct term the
scientific<00:00:43.710> term<00:00:44.360> rancid<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.379> funky

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
scientific term rancid but I think funky

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.510 
scientific term rancid but I think funky
is<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.070> actual<00:00:47.489> scientific<00:00:48.090> term<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
is the actual scientific term for it and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.760 
is the actual scientific term for it and
I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.870> had<00:00:52.050> too<00:00:52.289> many<00:00:52.469> in

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
I think it's because I had too many in

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.400 
I think it's because I had too many in
there<00:00:53.039> now<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:54.210> first<00:00:54.360> time<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.629> did<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.230> had

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
there now the first time I did it I had

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
there now the first time I did it I had
i<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:57.590> yes<00:00:58.590> i<00:00:58.890> had<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:02.579> i

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
i think for yes i had for so and i

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
i think for yes i had for so and i
change<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> water<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.809> every<00:01:04.080> other<00:01:04.110> day

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
change the water but every other day

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.460 
change the water but every other day
something<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.390> last<00:01:06.659> time<00:01:07.020> i

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
something like that but this last time i

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.120 
something like that but this last time i
did<00:01:08.060> probably<00:01:09.060> 10<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:09.689> 12<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.380> i<00:01:10.680> change<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
did probably 10 or 12 and i change the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
did probably 10 or 12 and i change the
water<00:01:11.310> maybe<00:01:11.780> every<00:01:12.780> other<00:01:12.810> day<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.110> third

and I need to do three more so I just

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.900 
and I need to do three more so I just
got<00:02:23.150> some<00:02:23.360> packed<00:02:23.710> mason<00:02:24.710> jars<00:02:24.950> always<00:02:25.580> plenty

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
got some packed mason jars always plenty

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.270 
got some packed mason jars always plenty
of<00:02:26.000> mason<00:02:26.300> jars<00:02:26.510> around<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:26.930> house<00:02:27.280> anyway

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
so if you're doing the plant propagation

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.720 
so if you're doing the plant propagation
first<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.550> all<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.970> would<00:02:32.660> not<00:02:32.900> put<00:02:33.430> but<00:02:34.430> just

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.120 
the bottom of the cutting in the water
the<00:02:40.730> other<00:02:40.940> one<00:02:41.240> I<00:02:41.270> also<00:02:41.630> had<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.230> too<00:02:42.440> real

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
the other one I also had it too real

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.970 
the other one I also had it too real
full<00:02:43.460> it<00:02:43.790> was<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:43.970> taller<00:02:44.270> glass<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:45.080> had<00:02:45.860> him

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
full it was a taller glass I had him

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.850 
full it was a taller glass I had him
deep<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.490> there<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.030> had<00:02:47.660> probably<00:02:47.990> four<00:02:48.680> to

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
deep in there and had probably four to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.830 
deep in there and had probably four to
five<00:02:49.280> inches<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.970> water<00:02:50.150> in<00:02:50.300> there<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.660> could

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
five inches of water in there it could

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.130 
five inches of water in there it could
be<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:52.070> that<00:02:52.280> also<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.660> combined

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
be that that that also that combined

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.580 
be that that that also that combined
with<00:02:54.640> with<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:55.850> many<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.209> them<00:02:56.330> in<00:02:56.390> their<00:02:56.600> turn

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
with with so many of them in their turn

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.840 
with with so many of them in their turn
the<00:02:57.770> water<00:02:57.920> rancid<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.700> wasn't<00:02:58.970> dumping<00:02:59.480> as

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
going to do this just put the bottom at

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.250 
going to do this just put the bottom at
the<00:03:06.709> bottom<00:03:06.890> inch<00:03:07.900> or<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.750> cutting<00:03:12.020> in

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the bottom inch or so of the cutting in

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.229 
the bottom inch or so of the cutting in
water<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.870> then<00:03:15.610> rinse<00:03:16.610> your<00:03:16.820> water<00:03:17.030> out

this is a great way instead of starting

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.350 
this is a great way instead of starting
something<00:03:37.010> from<00:03:37.280> seed<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.940> watch<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.269> grow

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
something from seed and watch it grow

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.330

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
don't sell plans for fall garden but I'm

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.350 
don't sell plans for fall garden but I'm
gonna<00:03:42.890> do<00:03:43.010> some<00:03:43.220> updates<00:03:43.580> on<00:03:43.730> fall<00:03:43.970> gardens

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360

because uh last you might fall garden
works<00:03:46.640> better<00:03:46.850> than<00:03:47.060> my<00:03:47.239> spring<00:03:47.600> garden<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.140> if

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
works better than my spring garden so if

works better than my spring garden so if
you're<00:03:49.220> not<00:03:49.400> thinking<00:03:49.760> about<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.970> fall<00:03:50.180> garden

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
you need to do that it can be a real

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.580 
you need to do that it can be a real
real<00:03:54.590> good<00:03:55.150> real<00:03:56.150> pilot<00:03:56.480> prolific<00:03:56.989> time<00:03:57.350> of

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
real good real pilot prolific time of

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.560 
real good real pilot prolific time of
the<00:03:57.709> year<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.100> when<00:03:58.730> you're<00:03:58.850> picking<00:03:59.060> you're

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
the year and when you're picking you're

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.180 
the year and when you're picking you're
not<00:03:59.720> picking<00:04:00.019> a<00:04:00.320> hundred-degree<00:04:00.620> Heat<00:04:00.769> you're

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
not picking a hundred-degree Heat you're

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.020 
not picking a hundred-degree Heat you're
picking<00:04:01.580> in<00:04:01.700> september-october<00:04:02.269> it's<00:04:03.260> nice

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
picking in september-october it's nice

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.990 
picking in september-october it's nice
then<00:04:05.140> so<00:04:06.140> if<00:04:06.800> you've<00:04:06.950> got<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.130> long<00:04:07.280> road<00:04:07.519> season

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
then so if you've got a long road season

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.810 
then so if you've got a long road season
like<00:04:08.209> we<00:04:08.239> do<00:04:08.570> down<00:04:08.780> here<00:04:08.810> then<00:04:09.459> definitely<00:04:10.459> put

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
like we do down here then definitely put

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.070 
like we do down here then definitely put
