trellis for this container garden I knew

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.780 
trellis for this container garden I knew
I<00:00:13.320> wasn't<00:00:13.710> going<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.070> want<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.490> come

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
I wasn't going to want to have to come

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.939 
I wasn't going to want to have to come
out<00:00:14.820> here<00:00:15.000> twice<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> day<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> try<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.410> keep<00:00:16.770> the

out here twice a day to try to keep the
containers<00:00:17.550> moist<00:00:18.529> being<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.710> containers

they<00:00:21.000> easily<00:00:21.359> dry<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.340> needed<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.760> way

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
they easily dry out and we needed a way

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.790 
they easily dry out and we needed a way
to<00:00:23.970> make<00:00:24.300> sure<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> plant<00:00:25.199> stayed<00:00:25.560> well

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
to make sure that the plant stayed well

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.670 
to make sure that the plant stayed well
watered<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:27.060> seemed<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.539> me<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.080> least

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
watered it seemed to me that the least

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.040 
watered it seemed to me that the least
expensive<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.609> best<00:00:29.849> solution<00:00:30.390> was<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.869> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
expensive and best solution was going to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.250 
expensive and best solution was going to
be<00:00:31.199> drip<00:00:31.590> irrigation<00:00:32.270> but<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.719> never<00:00:33.960> done

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
be drip irrigation but I have never done

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.920 
be drip irrigation but I have never done
drip<00:00:34.559> irrigation<00:00:35.040> before<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:36.090> most<00:00:36.360> that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
drip irrigation before the most that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.750 
drip irrigation before the most that
I've<00:00:37.050> ever<00:00:37.290> come<00:00:37.559> close<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.430> simply

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
I've ever come close to that is simply

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.240 
I've ever come close to that is simply
buying<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.300> soaker<00:00:39.870> hose<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.800> use<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
buying a soaker hose to use with the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.720 
buying a soaker hose to use with the
garden<00:00:41.520> last<00:00:41.760> year<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.800> went<00:00:44.250> over<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
garden last year so I went over to the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
garden last year so I went over to the
hardware<00:00:45.090> store<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.480> took<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.870> look<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
hardware store and took a look at it and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
hardware store and took a look at it and
I<00:00:46.680> couldn't<00:00:46.950> understand<00:00:47.430> why<00:00:47.640> drip

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
I couldn't understand why drip

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.060 
I couldn't understand why drip
irrigation<00:00:49.110> might<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> little<00:00:49.860> bit

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
irrigation might be a little bit

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
irrigation might be a little bit
intimidating<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.020> many<00:00:52.199> different

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
intimidating there are so many different

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
intimidating there are so many different
parts<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.219> pieces<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:54.030> together

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
parts and pieces to go together

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.869 
parts and pieces to go together
so<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.530> configure<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.100> setup<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
so that you can configure your setup the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.910 
so that you can configure your setup the
way<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:58.770> know

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
way that you need but if you don't know

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.090 
way that you need but if you don't know
where<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> start<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.690> intimidating<00:01:01.100> so

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
where to start it can be intimidating so

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
where to start it can be intimidating so
let<00:01:02.250> me<00:01:02.340> show<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> did<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.120> fix<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.809> our

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
let me show you what I did to fix up our

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.670 
let me show you what I did to fix up our
container<00:01:04.920> garden<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.519> drip<00:01:05.760> irrigation

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
container garden with drip irrigation

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
container garden with drip irrigation
thankfully<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.979> bought<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.310> home<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
thankfully when we bought this home it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700 
thankfully when we bought this home it
was<00:01:08.820> easy<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> determine<00:01:09.869> where<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> wanted<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
was easy to determine where I wanted the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.580 
was easy to determine where I wanted the
garden<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.570> because<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> orientation

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
garden to be because of the orientation

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.899 
garden to be because of the orientation
of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> Sun<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> lay<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.790> land

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
of the Sun and the lay of the land

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.539 
of the Sun and the lay of the land
because<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.380> had<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> water<00:01:17.130> spigot

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
because of that we had a water spigot

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.120 
because of that we had a water spigot
installed<00:01:18.270> where<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.409> knew<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.740> would<00:01:19.890> want

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
installed where we knew we would want

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
installed where we knew we would want
the<00:01:20.280> garden<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.939> there's<00:01:21.119> water<00:01:21.330> very<00:01:21.630> close

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the garden so there's water very close

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.300 
the garden so there's water very close
by<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.909> connect<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.780> I'm<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> first

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
by to connect to this I'm going to first

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.080 
by to connect to this I'm going to first
split<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.689> line<00:01:27.900> using<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.100> Wye<00:01:29.310> splitter<00:01:29.850> that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
split the line using a Wye splitter that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.810 
split the line using a Wye splitter that
way<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:31.170> still<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> hose<00:01:32.009> available<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
way I can still have a hose available to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.539 
way I can still have a hose available to
me<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.000> manual<00:01:33.659> watering<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.280> using

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
me for manual watering as well as using

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.609 
me for manual watering as well as using
one<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.689> timer<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> drip

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
one for the timer and the drip

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.830 
one for the timer and the drip
irrigation<00:01:38.030> now<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.750> have

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
irrigation now you will see that I have

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
irrigation now you will see that I have
applied<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.619> flan<00:01:40.890> tape<00:01:41.130> throughout<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
applied to flan tape throughout the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
applied to flan tape throughout the
entire<00:01:42.000> video<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.720> I'll<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.869> make<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> point

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
entire video but I'll just make a point

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.969 
entire video but I'll just make a point
that<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.579> easier<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.090> yourself<00:01:45.329> by

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
that you make it easier on yourself by

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.289 
that you make it easier on yourself by
wrapping<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.130> around<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.610> threads<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
wrapping it around the threads in the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.920 
wrapping it around the threads in the
same<00:01:48.540> direction<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:49.979> going<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.670> screw<00:01:51.659> on

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
same direction you are going to screw on

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.710 
same direction you are going to screw on
your<00:01:52.259> hose<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.399> next<00:01:53.850> connector<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.509> line

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
your hose or the next connector in line

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.230 
your hose or the next connector in line
so<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:56.009> spin<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> around<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.729> right<00:01:56.939> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
so just spin it around to the right I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.600 
so just spin it around to the right I
always<00:01:57.810> find<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> 3<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> good<00:01:59.040> number<00:01:59.100> it's

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
always find that 3 is a good number it's

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.510 
always find that 3 is a good number it's
never<00:01:59.909> too<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:01.409> stop<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.159> water<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
never too little to stop the water and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.249 
never too little to stop the water and
it's<00:02:02.700> never<00:02:02.850> too<00:02:03.149> much<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.689> can't<00:02:04.020> fit

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
it's never too much that you can't fit

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.530 
it's never too much that you can't fit
the<00:02:04.560> next<00:02:04.860> connector<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.969> next<00:02:06.240> thing<00:02:06.420> in

the next connector on the next thing in

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.109 
the next connector on the next thing in
our<00:02:06.689> setup<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.129> timer<00:02:08.399> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
our setup is going to be the timer this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.089 
our setup is going to be the timer this
is<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> same<00:02:09.629> timer<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.080> used<00:02:10.410> last<00:02:10.679> year<00:02:11.009> in

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
is the same timer I used last year in

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.979 
is the same timer I used last year in
the<00:02:11.190> garden<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.730> other<00:02:12.150> than<00:02:12.330> having<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.750> swap

it's working perfectly fine it allows me

day the next thing we're going to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.600 
day the next thing we're going to
connect<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> short<00:02:28.020> garden<00:02:28.500> hose<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.040> I'm

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
connect is a short garden hose and I'm

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.730 
connect is a short garden hose and I'm
going<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.880> attach<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.480> garden<00:02:30.870> hose<00:02:31.110> here

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
going to attach the garden hose here

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.680 
going to attach the garden hose here
rather<00:02:32.250> than<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.730> components<00:02:33.300> you'll<00:02:33.450> see

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
rather than the components you'll see

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.990 
rather than the components you'll see
next<00:02:33.930> because<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:34.950> like<00:02:35.130> having<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.610> garden

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
next because I like having the garden

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.330 
next because I like having the garden
hose<00:02:36.180> being<00:02:36.540> what<00:02:37.050> goes<00:02:37.260> from<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.920> actual

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
hose being what goes from the actual

hose being what goes from the actual
hose<00:02:38.550> spigot<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.540> garden<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.500> maybe

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
hose spigot to the garden and maybe

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.410 
hose spigot to the garden and maybe
there's<00:02:40.920> nothing<00:02:41.100> really<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.210> just

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
there's nothing really to that it just

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.300 
there's nothing really to that it just
makes<00:02:42.630> me<00:02:42.870> feel<00:02:43.110> better<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.590> can't<00:02:43.830> really<00:02:44.010> give

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
makes me feel better I can't really give

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.100 
makes me feel better I can't really give
you<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.460> good<00:02:44.790> reason<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.300> why<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.570> should<00:02:45.840> do

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
you a good reason on why you should do

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.710 
you a good reason on why you should do
it<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.500> order<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.480> next<00:02:48.480> thing<00:02:48.690> that

it in this order the next thing that

be using to actually transmit the water
to<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.459> individual<00:04:21.060> plants<00:04:21.830> now<00:04:22.830> as<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.250> can

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
to the individual plants now as you can

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.640 
to the individual plants now as you can
see<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.669> have<00:04:23.970> all<00:04:24.120> these<00:04:24.270> components<00:04:24.990> on<00:04:25.169> one

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
see I have all these components on one

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.320 
see I have all these components on one
side<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.250> Arbor<00:04:26.610> but<00:04:27.150> I

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
side of the Arbor but I

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.939 
side of the Arbor but I
need<00:04:27.389> to<00:04:27.479> get<00:04:27.569> the<00:04:27.689> water<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:28.080> both<00:04:28.259> sides<00:04:28.620> and

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
need to get the water to both sides and

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.309 
need to get the water to both sides and
for<00:04:29.639> me<00:04:29.789> I<00:04:30.090> think<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.479> best<00:04:30.629> solution<00:04:30.780> is

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
for me I think the best solution is

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.589 
for me I think the best solution is
going<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.740> be<00:04:31.889> to<00:04:32.580> run<00:04:32.759> a<00:04:32.789> transmission<00:04:33.419> line

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
going to be to run a transmission line

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.679 
going to be to run a transmission line
from<00:04:34.050> one<00:04:34.289> side<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.979> another<00:04:35.090> up<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.419> around

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:36.689 
from one side to another up and around

from one side to another up and around
the<00:04:36.840> trellis<00:04:37.520> rather<00:04:38.520> than<00:04:38.819> putting<00:04:39.030> it

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
the trellis rather than putting it

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.540 
the trellis rather than putting it
across<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.719> floor<00:04:39.900> where<00:04:40.319> it<00:04:40.469> might<00:04:40.710> somehow

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
be tripped on or cut or damaged in some

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.629 
be tripped on or cut or damaged in some
way<00:04:45.090> I'm<00:04:45.569> going<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.560> use<00:04:46.740> these<00:04:47.039> zip<00:04:47.370> ties<00:04:47.400> to

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
way I'm going to use these zip ties to

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.510 
way I'm going to use these zip ties to
connect<00:04:48.509> the<00:04:48.719> tubing<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.319> arbor<00:04:49.830> but<00:04:50.400> I'm

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
connect the tubing to the arbor but I'm

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.820 
connect the tubing to the arbor but I'm
being<00:04:50.759> careful<00:04:51.090> not<00:04:51.389> to<00:04:51.659> over-tighten<00:04:52.229> the

being careful not to over-tighten the
zip<00:04:53.039> tie<00:04:53.250> which<00:04:53.699> could<00:04:53.939> pinch<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.599> restrict

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
zip tie which could pinch and restrict

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.890 
zip tie which could pinch and restrict
the<00:04:55.199> flow<00:04:55.409> of<00:04:55.830> water<00:04:56.340> through<00:04:56.759> the<00:04:56.879> tubing<00:04:57.240> now

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
the flow of water through the tubing now

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.740 
the flow of water through the tubing now
when<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.110> get<00:04:58.349> to<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.620> other<00:04:58.860> side<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.750> can

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
when I get to the other side I can

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.240 
when I get to the other side I can
extend<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.860> tubing<00:05:02.400> across<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.389> Arbor

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
extend the tubing across the Arbor

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.529 
extend the tubing across the Arbor
horizontally<00:05:05.250> for<00:05:05.580> now<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:05.759> just<00:05:06.000> need<00:05:06.479> to

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
horizontally for now I just need to

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.360 
horizontally for now I just need to
support<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.199> tubing<00:05:07.530> enough<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.009> I<00:05:08.039> can

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
support the tubing enough so I can

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.790 
support the tubing enough so I can
measure<00:05:08.729> how<00:05:09.030> much<00:05:09.300> I<00:05:09.479> need<00:05:09.780> so<00:05:10.409> I'm<00:05:10.500> not<00:05:10.620> going

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
measure how much I need so I'm not going

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.770 
measure how much I need so I'm not going
to<00:05:10.860> put<00:05:11.009> too<00:05:11.039> many<00:05:11.370> zip<00:05:11.759> ties<00:05:11.969> on<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.389> hold<00:05:12.599> this

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
to put too many zip ties on to hold this

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.170 
to put too many zip ties on to hold this
up<00:05:13.050> but<00:05:13.530> we'll<00:05:13.680> put<00:05:13.860> some<00:05:14.069> more<00:05:14.250> on<00:05:14.280> later<00:05:14.669> once

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
up but we'll put some more on later once

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.600 
up but we'll put some more on later once
I<00:05:15.330> reach<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.750> end<00:05:15.780> of<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.289> line<00:05:16.500> I'm<00:05:16.830> going<00:05:17.460> to

I reach the end of the line I'm going to

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.080 
I reach the end of the line I'm going to

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
terminate the line at an admit err so

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.850 
terminate the line at an admit err so
I'm<00:05:21.419> just<00:05:21.629> going<00:05:21.840> to<00:05:21.960> make<00:05:22.169> sure<00:05:22.229> that<00:05:22.469> I<00:05:22.740> don't

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
I'm just going to make sure that I don't

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.939 
I'm just going to make sure that I don't
cut<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.729> line<00:05:23.940> right<00:05:24.270> at<00:05:24.539> the<00:05:24.719> end<00:05:24.960> but<00:05:25.529> bring

these containers and I'm going to go
back<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:39.240> install<00:05:39.629> a<00:05:40.430> t-connector<00:05:41.430> so<00:05:42.150> that<00:05:42.360> I

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
back and install a t-connector so that I

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.290 
back and install a t-connector so that I

that's<00:06:53.280> it<00:06:53.550> all<00:06:53.880> I<00:06:53.940> had<00:06:54.420> to<00:06:54.540> do<00:06:54.690> is<00:06:54.870> repeat<00:06:55.170> that

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
that's it all I had to do is repeat that

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.790 
that's it all I had to do is repeat that
process<00:06:55.680> numerous<00:06:56.520> times<00:06:56.870> 17<00:06:57.870> times<00:06:57.900> actually

Kiwi that I am growing up this trellis
here<00:07:07.710> you<00:07:07.890> can<00:07:08.070> see<00:07:08.250> how<00:07:08.430> all<00:07:08.640> of<00:07:08.790> the<00:07:08.910> emitters

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
here you can see how all of the emitters

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.810 
here you can see how all of the emitters
work<00:07:09.660> and<00:07:09.900> I<00:07:10.380> really<00:07:10.830> do<00:07:11.040> hope<00:07:11.310> that<00:07:11.370> one

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
work and I really do hope that one

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.850 
work and I really do hope that one
emitter<00:07:12.180> is<00:07:12.390> enough<00:07:12.780> for<00:07:12.960> this<00:07:13.140> container<00:07:13.590> and

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
emitter is enough for this container and

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.920 
emitter is enough for this container and
I<00:07:14.130> think<00:07:14.370> that<00:07:14.520> it<00:07:14.640> will<00:07:14.790> be<00:07:14.850> but<00:07:15.570> if<00:07:15.690> for<00:07:15.870> some

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
I think that it will be but if for some

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.020 
I think that it will be but if for some
reason<00:07:16.440> we<00:07:16.560> find<00:07:16.890> out<00:07:17.070> that<00:07:17.250> there's<00:07:17.520> just<00:07:17.850> not

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.030 
reason we find out that there's just not

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.910 
reason we find out that there's just not
enough<00:07:18.240> moisture<00:07:18.660> getting<00:07:19.260> to<00:07:19.380> the<00:07:19.500> corners

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:19.920 
enough moisture getting to the corners

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.530 
enough moisture getting to the corners
I'll<00:07:20.160> be<00:07:20.340> sure<00:07:20.520> to<00:07:20.670> let<00:07:20.790> you<00:07:20.970> guys<00:07:21.090> know<00:07:21.150> in
