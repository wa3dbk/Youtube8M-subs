first symphony again in Basel
about<00:01:31.360> three<00:01:31.660> weeks<00:01:31.690> ago<00:01:32.050> I<00:01:32.500> was<00:01:32.979> struck<00:01:33.190> by

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
about three weeks ago I was struck by

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.499 
about three weeks ago I was struck by
the<00:01:34.210> similarity<00:01:34.929> of<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.200> language<00:01:35.710> but<00:01:36.550> the

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
the similarity of the language but the

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.419 
the similarity of the language but the
deep<00:01:37.750> differences<00:01:38.050> in<00:01:38.679> what<00:01:38.830> he<00:01:38.950> does<00:01:39.190> with

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
deep differences in what he does with

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.419 
deep differences in what he does with
the<00:01:39.550> language<00:01:39.940> so<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.720> think<00:01:40.960> that's<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:42.369> like

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
the language so I think that's it's like

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.070 
the language so I think that's it's like
the<00:01:42.700> great<00:01:42.880> composers<00:01:43.390> will<00:01:43.630> bring<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.929> lot<00:01:44.050> of

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
the great composers will bring a lot of

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.569 
the great composers will bring a lot of
