00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.940 

hooking<00:02:29.640> up<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.819> voice<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.680> think<00:02:31.800> is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
hooking up the voice so I think is

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.090 
hooking up the voice so I think is
causing<00:02:32.160> my<00:02:32.640> stress<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:34.500> know<00:02:34.590> because<00:02:34.739> often

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739
