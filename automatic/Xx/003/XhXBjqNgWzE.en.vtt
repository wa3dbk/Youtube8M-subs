00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 open the refrigerator in the morning and he and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.610
 speaks in a human voice it is no longer 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.010
 just household appliances 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.320
 and real family members are caring and 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.660
 warning refrigerator reminds 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.760
 what products are missing and washing 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.949
 the car gives a fresh weather forecast 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.230
 robot cleaner knows when to go out 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.640
 the work needs only to be loaded into it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.760
 memory working area plan 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.949
 and where to collect the garbage, he decides to himself all 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.170
 the system is connected to the internet it is not 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.030
 lounge chair and home doctor 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.489
 data on the ratio of height and weight 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.800
 temperature and pulse pressure and even 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.910
 blood oxygen level will enlighten 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.280
 forefinger 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.770
 infrared ray, he determines for 10 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.030
 seconds we plan as much as possible 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.399
 simplify the medical system 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.200
 diagnosis and treatment let 's say a chair 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.600
 will transmit the received data to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.399
 wireless network to the attending physician and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 receive recommendations from him 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.829
 regarding further treatment 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.730
 car companies are closely engaged 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.680
 pedestrians 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.260
 if it goes on like this the person risks 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.420
 generally unlearn how to walk this remedy 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.150
 the movement of a new generation is called 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 you engle them designed to move 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.600
 maximum walking speed 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.119
 speed of 6 kilometers per hour 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 in fact it is a robot it adapts 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.380
 by human movement and starts 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.119
 act like its continuation to 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.979
 start off slightly enough 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.259
 submit the case forward pass 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.040
 turning is vaguely reminiscent of riding on 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.009
 downhill skiing 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.930
 and to stop just get up right in 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 In this case, the engineers went even further. 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.159
 here you don't even have to stand all that 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.960
 it is necessary to just sit and lightly 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.750
 shift the center of gravity everything else 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.409
 the robot chair will make itself extremely simple in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.479
 management 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.759
 the skill is acquired literally in one 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.380
 a minute and here and no skill 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.509
 required to ride such 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 car to take on the rights of the entity not 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.130
 be sure to turn the steering acceleration and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.640
 braking light on 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.620
 but 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.050
 tones to at traffic lights and in front of pedestrians 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.030
 fully offline in 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.270
 navigator clogged end point 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.710
 else the matter more precisely technology 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.690
 robotics well kurma him in this 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.090
 car embodied in fundamentally 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.370
 new technologies first sensory 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.290
 system it consists of a mixture of timer and 5 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.090
 laser scanners they allow 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.880
 control everything that happens in the window 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.590
 360 degree machine to and evaluate 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.720
 road situation bait second 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.910
 artificial intelligence he analyzes 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.709
 information obtained from the sensors I 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 determines the most acceptable option 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.209
 technology movements have reached the level 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.190
 when you canâ€™t understand the reality right away 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.810
 or not as an image on new 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.420
 8k TVs 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.890
 ultra high definition capacity in 16 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.500
 times higher than modern 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.300
 hd while the availability of all this for 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.680
 consumer wide business at all 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.989
 near future 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.030
 for example , hands-free machines will appear in 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.670
 sale until 2020 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.330
 Sergey Mingazhev Alexey Pichko to lead 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.330
