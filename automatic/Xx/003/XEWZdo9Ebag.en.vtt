00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
both of the bumpers and the triggers and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.250 
both of the bumpers and the triggers and
the<00:04:22.890> all<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.640> same<00:04:23.850> buttons<00:04:24.300> are<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.870> the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
the all the same buttons are in the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.040 
the all the same buttons are in the
exact<00:04:25.620> same<00:04:25.830> order

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
exact same order

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.899 
exact same order
but<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.379> best<00:04:28.590> thing<00:04:28.740> about<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:29.069> the<00:04:29.370> d-pad<00:04:29.879> is

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:29.909 
but the best thing about it the d-pad is

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:33.290 
but the best thing about it the d-pad is
different<00:04:30.719> so<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:32.069> is<00:04:32.340> going<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.819> be<00:04:32.939> better

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
different so that is going to be better

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.999 
different so that is going to be better
for<00:04:33.830> sort<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.919> arcade-style<00:04:35.370> games<00:04:35.930> which<00:04:37.009> I'm

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
for sort of arcade-style games which I'm

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.119 
for sort of arcade-style games which I'm
looking<00:04:38.400> forward<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.879> that<00:04:38.909> so<00:04:39.740> that's<00:04:40.740> pretty

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
looking forward to that so that's pretty
