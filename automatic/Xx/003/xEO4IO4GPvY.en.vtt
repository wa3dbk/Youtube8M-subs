00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.890 

all<00:00:12.190> right<00:00:12.370> now<00:00:12.880> for<00:00:12.940> the<00:00:13.180> rear<00:00:13.510> shocks

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
all right now for the rear shocks

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.860 
all right now for the rear shocks
they're<00:00:14.740> being<00:00:14.920> held<00:00:15.160> held<00:00:15.580> by<00:00:15.820> two<00:00:15.880> bolts<00:00:16.209> one

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:16.870 
they're being held held by two bolts one

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.220 
they're being held held by two bolts one
of<00:00:17.020> them<00:00:17.140> being<00:00:17.560> underneath<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.779> bed<00:00:19.779> which

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
of them being underneath the bed which

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.310 
of them being underneath the bed which
is<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:22.300> here<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.520> second<00:00:24.910> one<00:00:25.029> is<00:00:25.330> by

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
is right here and the second one is by

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.970 
is right here and the second one is by
the<00:00:26.380> wheel<00:00:29.130> that's<00:00:30.130> samam<00:00:31.590> which<00:00:32.590> is<00:00:32.770> right

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
the wheel that's samam which is right

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.130 
the wheel that's samam which is right
here<00:00:33.010> so<00:00:33.610> I<00:00:33.940> think<00:00:34.480> this<00:00:34.690> should<00:00:34.840> be<00:00:34.960> fairly

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
here so I think this should be fairly

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.190 
here so I think this should be fairly
easy<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:36.760> taking<00:00:37.150> those<00:00:37.270> two<00:00:37.540> off<00:00:37.720> should

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
easy just taking those two off should

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.979 
easy just taking those two off should
make<00:00:38.890> it<00:00:39.250> slip<00:00:39.670> bottom<00:00:40.030> right<00:00:40.420> out<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.840> should

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
make it slip bottom right out and should

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.160 
make it slip bottom right out and should
we<00:00:41.050> put<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.590> new<00:00:41.710> one<00:00:41.860> on<00:00:43.740> right<00:00:44.740> uh<00:00:44.950> just<00:00:46.170> as

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
we put the new one on right uh just as

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.560 
we put the new one on right uh just as
the<00:00:47.650> front<00:00:47.980> ones<00:00:48.250> you'll<00:00:48.520> need<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:49.060> wear<00:00:49.270> just

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
the front ones you'll need to wear just

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.540 
the front ones you'll need to wear just
one<00:00:49.720> of<00:00:50.020> them<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.260> actually<00:00:50.590> hold<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:51.070> shock

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
one of them to actually hold the shock

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.970 
one of them to actually hold the shock
in<00:00:51.790> place<00:00:52.030> or<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.420> doesn't<00:00:53.380> spin<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:53.830> the

inches and that looks about right so I'm

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.750 
inches and that looks about right so I'm
going<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.829> put<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:36.620> bolt<00:03:37.620> then<00:03:37.950> tighten<00:03:37.980> it

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
going to put this bolt then tighten it

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.789 
going to put this bolt then tighten it
up

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
up

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.220 

then<00:03:41.220> lower<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:42.000> bed<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.480> then<00:03:42.720> tighten<00:03:43.139> up

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
then lower the bed and then tighten up

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.449 
then lower the bed and then tighten up
the<00:03:43.380> screw<00:03:43.650> up<00:03:43.739> there<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.549> should<00:03:44.760> be<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
the screw up there and that should be it

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.260 
the screw up there and that should be it
it's<00:03:47.459> fairly<00:03:47.730> easy

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.240 

definitely<00:03:51.270> a<00:03:51.300> lot<00:03:51.780> easier<00:03:52.320> than<00:03:52.530> changing

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
definitely a lot easier than changing

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.680 
definitely a lot easier than changing
out<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.520> front<00:03:53.790> once<00:03:55.700> if<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.970> set<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.330> video

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
out the front once if you set that video

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.570 
out the front once if you set that video
that<00:03:57.720> actually<00:03:58.320> took<00:03:58.590> me<00:03:58.740> a<00:03:58.770> while<00:03:58.980> much

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
that actually took me a while much

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.790 
that actually took me a while much
longer<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:01.200> didn't<00:04:01.500> make<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> couple

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
longer and it didn't make a couple

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:11.420 
longer and it didn't make a couple
mistakes<00:04:02.070> there<00:04:02.580> but<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.630> did<00:04:04.020> get<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.230> done<00:04:10.430> so

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
mistakes there but I did get it done so

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.190 
mistakes there but I did get it done so
I'm<00:04:11.610> just<00:04:12.030> going<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.270> tighten<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.780> up<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.050> little

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
I'm just going to tighten it up a little

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.150 
I'm just going to tighten it up a little
now<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:15.110> finish<00:04:16.110> tightening<00:04:16.530> everything

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
now and finish tightening everything

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:32.960 
now and finish tightening everything
later<00:04:27.950> okay<00:04:28.980> well<00:04:29.520> that's<00:04:29.700> that<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:31.730> now<00:04:32.730> for

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
later okay well that's that and now for

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.590 
later okay well that's that and now for
the<00:04:33.060> final<00:04:33.240> part<00:04:37.790> like<00:04:38.790> I<00:04:38.910> say<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.150> can<00:04:39.270> see

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
the final part like I say you can see

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.810 
the final part like I say you can see
that<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:39.810> only<00:04:40.320> lifted<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:40.830> lifted<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.520> body

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
that I only lifted it lifted the body

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.250 
that I only lifted it lifted the body
without<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.540> actual<00:04:42.960> wheels<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.960> kind

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
without the actual wheels and that kind

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.660 
without the actual wheels and that kind
of<00:04:46.350> got<00:04:46.980> me<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.400> separation<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.120> needed<00:04:48.480> and

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
of got me the separation I needed and

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.520 
of got me the separation I needed and
really<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.940> only<00:04:51.090> thing<00:04:51.300> that's<00:04:51.330> left<00:04:51.780> is

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
really the only thing that's left is

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.510 
really the only thing that's left is
just<00:04:53.480> tightening<00:04:54.480> up<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.870> one<00:04:55.020> up<00:04:55.170> here<00:04:55.520> which

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
just tightening up the one up here which

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.050 
just tightening up the one up here which
I'm<00:04:56.670> guessing<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:57.090> fairly<00:04:57.570> trivial<00:04:58.020> so

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
I'm guessing is fairly trivial so

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.040 
I'm guessing is fairly trivial so
guessing<00:05:00.060> I'll<00:05:00.150> probably<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.570> end<00:05:00.750> the

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
guessing I'll probably just end the

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.870 
guessing I'll probably just end the
video<00:05:01.200> right<00:05:01.500> here<00:05:02.450> thanks<00:05:03.450> for<00:05:03.600> watching
