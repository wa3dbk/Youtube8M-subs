cost a lot of GTA cash which means

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.460 
cost a lot of GTA cash which means
people<00:02:36.299> on<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.630> used<00:02:36.810> often<00:02:36.959> because<00:02:37.350> I'm

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
people on a used often because I'm

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.860 
people on a used often because I'm
acrostic<00:02:37.920> I'll<00:02:38.190> bet<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.940> grenade<00:02:42.450> launcher

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
acrostic I'll bet the grenade launcher

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.340 
acrostic I'll bet the grenade launcher
also<00:02:43.620> can<00:02:44.609> be<00:02:46.790> very<00:02:47.790> inaccurate<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.930> would<00:02:49.139> put

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
also can be very inaccurate I would put

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.199 
also can be very inaccurate I would put
it<00:02:49.500> because<00:02:49.829> sometimes<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.579> fire<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:50.880> to

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
it because sometimes you can fire it to

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.000 
it because sometimes you can fire it to
write<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.660> outer<00:02:51.810> person<00:02:52.410> you're<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.769> line

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
left or a bit to the right I don't know

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.000 
left or a bit to the right I don't know
if<00:02:57.630> that's<00:02:57.810> actually<00:02:57.959> affect<00:02:58.350> by<00:02:58.530> wind<00:02:58.799> con

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
if that's actually affect by wind con

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.949 
if that's actually affect by wind con
wind<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.819> this<00:02:59.940> game<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.329> don't<00:03:00.600> believe<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
wind in this game but I don't believe I

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.180 
wind in this game but I don't believe I
had<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.170> think<00:03:01.319> it's<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.709> going<00:03:01.920> left<00:03:02.100> or

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
had to think it's just going left or

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.190 
had to think it's just going left or
right<00:03:02.370> randomly<00:03:02.760> because<00:03:03.389> like<00:03:03.540> as<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.049> can

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
right randomly because like as you can

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.509 
right randomly because like as you can
see<00:03:04.319> here<00:03:04.530> we're<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:04.739> testing<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.250> see<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.430> we

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
see here we're just testing to see if we

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.599 
see here we're just testing to see if we
get<00:03:05.609> walk<00:03:05.819> on<00:03:06.620> someone<00:03:07.620> try<00:03:07.799> selling<00:03:08.040> me<00:03:08.220> mine

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
get walk on someone try selling me mine

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.180 
get walk on someone try selling me mine
that's<00:03:11.609> play<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.940> those<00:03:12.090> ways<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.190> so

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
that's play in those ways I go and so

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.280 
that's play in those ways I go and so
basically<00:03:14.639> we<00:03:15.000> go<00:03:15.239> for<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> bit<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.750> range<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.260> we

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
basically we go for a bit of range so we

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.809 
basically we go for a bit of range so we
can<00:03:16.500> see<00:03:16.650> how<00:03:16.680> hard<00:03:17.130> they're<00:03:17.400> going<00:03:17.639> to<00:03:17.730> go

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
can see how hard they're going to go

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.780 
can see how hard they're going to go
into<00:03:17.970> ranges<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:20.100> walk<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.459> those

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
into ranges and the walk on those

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.089 
into ranges and the walk on those
basically<00:03:21.329> no<00:03:21.480> rain<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:21.989> obviously<00:03:22.889> we<00:03:23.010> have

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
basically no rain so obviously we have

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.809 
basically no rain so obviously we have
to<00:03:23.160> test<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.519> by<00:03:23.639> firing<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:26.280> let's<00:03:26.730> just

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
to test it by firing it so let's just

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.729 
to test it by firing it so let's just
give<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.269> second<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.900> hopefully<00:03:28.290> I'll

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
give it a second and hopefully I'll

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:36.980 
give it a second and hopefully I'll
fight<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.040> looking<00:03:29.310> up<00:03:29.400> to

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.190 

and<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:39.400> go<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:39.610> said<00:03:39.790> direct<00:03:40.090> invite<00:03:40.390> kill<00:03:40.600> so

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
and they go I said direct invite kill so

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.990 
and they go I said direct invite kill so
as<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.620> can<00:03:41.680> see<00:03:41.860> after<00:03:42.040> their<00:03:42.400> aim<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.850> make

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
as you can see after their aim to make

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.520 
as you can see after their aim to make
sure<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.270> fight<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.900> then<00:03:44.020> got<00:03:44.200> hit<00:03:44.410> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530

sure it fight and then got hit the
target<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.310> how<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.790> would<00:03:46.090> class<00:03:46.330> this<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.600> a

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
target that how I would class this is a

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.790 
target that how I would class this is a
pro<00:03:47.140> weapon<00:03:47.680> now<00:03:48.460> I<00:03:49.110> would<00:03:50.110> also<00:03:50.140> cost<00:03:50.590> as<00:03:50.770> a

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
pro weapon now I would also cost as a

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
shots in that general direction I try to

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.460 
shots in that general direction I try to

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
pie more than that there's no point

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.760 
pie more than that there's no point
because<00:04:01.690> ill<00:04:01.780> have<00:04:01.960> cost<00:04:02.200> too<00:04:02.380> much<00:04:02.410> in<00:04:02.680> the

because ill have cost too much in the

because ill have cost too much in the
end<00:04:02.890> anyway<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.670> only<00:04:06.880> one<00:04:07.060> place<00:04:07.300> waiting<00:04:07.510> to

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
end anyway the only one place waiting to

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.040 
end anyway the only one place waiting to
prior<00:04:07.960> model<00:04:08.220> one<00:04:09.540> close<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.630> can<00:04:10.750> see<00:04:10.900> I'm

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
prior model one close you can see I'm

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.020 
prior model one close you can see I'm
just<00:04:11.260> firing<00:04:11.440> randomly<00:04:11.710> here<00:04:12.160> showing<00:04:12.850> me

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
just firing randomly here showing me

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:20.460 
just firing randomly here showing me
this<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.390> how<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.690> would<00:04:13.870> be<00:04:14.020> new<00:04:19.170> so<00:04:20.170> basically

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
this is how it would be new so basically

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.620 
this is how it would be new so basically
it<00:04:20.739> would<00:04:20.920> be<00:04:21.040> new<00:04:21.220> if<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:21.640> decide<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.390> for

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
it would be new if you decide it for

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.070 
it would be new if you decide it for
example<00:04:23.280> continuously<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.490> get<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.760> kill<00:04:28.080> now

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
example continuously to get the kill now

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.750 
example continuously to get the kill now
i<00:04:29.110> would<00:04:29.650> say<00:04:29.860> we'd<00:04:30.070> have<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.220> little<00:04:30.400> fight

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
i would say we'd have a little fight

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.550 
i would say we'd have a little fight
with<00:04:30.790> these<00:04:31.150> but<00:04:31.420> they<00:04:31.600> have<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:31.960> little<00:04:32.200> mo

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
with these but they have so little mo

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.560 
with these but they have so little mo
and<00:04:32.800> with<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.190> dropping<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.670> mag<00:04:33.910> every<00:04:34.390> time

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
and with you dropping a mag every time

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.830 
and with you dropping a mag every time
you<00:04:34.660> diet<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.140> if<00:04:35.410> you<00:04:35.740> are<00:04:35.770> selected

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
you diet this if you are selected

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.510 
you diet this if you are selected
granito<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:38.080> selected<00:04:38.530> explosive<00:04:39.160> weaponry

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
granito it selected explosive weaponry

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.630 
granito it selected explosive weaponry
or<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.760> heavy<00:04:40.210> weaponry<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:42.460> basically

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
or a heavy weaponry and you basically

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.280 
or a heavy weaponry and you basically
lose<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.240> arm<00:04:43.360> of<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.510> gun<00:04:43.720> which<00:04:43.900> means<00:04:44.140> you

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
lose the arm of the gun which means you

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.650 
lose the arm of the gun which means you
can't<00:04:44.530> really<00:04:45.010> have<00:04:45.280> just<00:04:45.970> been<00:04:46.180> able<00:04:46.360> into

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
can't really have just been able into

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.180 
can't really have just been able into
file<00:04:46.870> nice<00:04:47.230> you're<00:04:47.380> in<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.530> death<00:04:47.710> match<00:04:47.919> has

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
file nice you're in a death match has

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.400 
file nice you're in a death match has
been<00:04:48.220> ever<00:04:48.550> launched<00:04:48.700> around<00:04:49.050> i'm<00:04:50.050> in<00:04:50.290> the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
been ever launched around i'm in the

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.260 
been ever launched around i'm in the
ancient<00:04:50.590> everywhere<00:04:51.460> on<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.669> freaking<00:04:52.000> for

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
ancient everywhere on the freaking for

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.909 
ancient everywhere on the freaking for
so<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:52.990> can<00:04:53.080> just<00:04:53.110> pick<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:53.380> up<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.680> fight

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
so you can just pick it up to fight

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.200 
so you can just pick it up to fight
after<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.280> fired<00:04:54.520> at<00:04:54.669> you're<00:04:54.760> picking<00:04:54.970> up<00:04:55.060> two

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
after you fired at you're picking up two

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.630 
after you fired at you're picking up two
more<00:04:55.390> by<00:04:55.780> dictator<00:04:56.200> two<00:04:56.410> more<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:57.250> if<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.400> lap

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
more by dictator two more so if I lap

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.280 
more by dictator two more so if I lap
because<00:04:57.820> it's<00:04:58.090> not<00:04:58.300> going<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.570> work<00:04:58.750> any<00:04:59.140> other

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
because it's not going to work any other

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.680 
because it's not going to work any other
way<00:04:59.490> so<00:05:00.490> basically<00:05:01.150> you're<00:05:01.390> going<00:05:01.510> to<00:05:01.570> see

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
way so basically you're going to see

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.659 
way so basically you're going to see
people<00:05:01.990> rail<00:05:02.230> using<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.740> grain<00:05:02.890> moisture<00:05:03.130> so

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
people rail using the grain moisture so

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.580 
people rail using the grain moisture so
another<00:05:03.850> thing<00:05:03.910> like<00:05:04.180> we're<00:05:04.390> pro<00:05:04.810> weapon<00:05:07.590> but

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
another thing like we're pro weapon but

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.320 
another thing like we're pro weapon but
then<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:09.040> could<00:05:09.220> also<00:05:09.370> call<00:05:09.640> it<00:05:09.669> a<00:05:09.730> new<00:05:09.910> weapon

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
then you could also call it a new weapon

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.120 
then you could also call it a new weapon
for<00:05:10.510> example<00:05:10.900> if<00:05:10.960> someone<00:05:10.990> comes<00:05:11.380> at<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.710> in<00:05:11.980> a

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
for example if someone comes at you in a

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.150 
for example if someone comes at you in a
car<00:05:12.400> you're<00:05:13.000> spraying<00:05:13.480> boiling<00:05:14.200> yourself<00:05:14.890> up

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
car you're spraying boiling yourself up

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.950 
car you're spraying boiling yourself up
the<00:05:15.460> car<00:05:15.700> and<00:05:15.730> everything<00:05:16.180> around<00:05:16.510> you<00:05:16.810> up

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
the car and everything around you up

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.990 
the car and everything around you up
that<00:05:17.560> would<00:05:17.680> be<00:05:17.770> also<00:05:17.919> cost<00:05:18.220> another<00:05:18.520> new<00:05:18.760> way

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
that would be also cost another new way

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000 
that would be also cost another new way
but<00:05:19.240> then<00:05:19.360> if<00:05:19.510> you're<00:05:19.660> a<00:05:19.690> new<00:05:19.900> then<00:05:20.680> you<00:05:20.890> could

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
but then if you're a new then you could

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.370 
but then if you're a new then you could
have<00:05:21.130> this<00:05:21.340> as<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.610> pro<00:05:21.880> side<00:05:22.180> again<00:05:22.570> because

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
have this as a pro side again because

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.900 
have this as a pro side again because
you<00:05:23.470> could<00:05:23.620> fire<00:05:23.800> one<00:05:24.070> shot<00:05:24.100> from<00:05:24.580> quite<00:05:24.880> far

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
you could fire one shot from quite far

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.900 
you could fire one shot from quite far
away<00:05:25.270> hit<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.260> car<00:05:26.470> first<00:05:26.710> time<00:05:27.040> blow<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.790> up

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
away hit the car first time blow it up

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.670 
away hit the car first time blow it up
and<00:05:28.180> that's<00:05:28.479> either<00:05:28.630> a<00:05:28.750> lucky<00:05:29.050> shot<00:05:29.080> or<00:05:29.380> a<00:05:29.410> pro

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
and that's either a lucky shot or a pro

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.040 
and that's either a lucky shot or a pro
shot<00:05:29.950> so<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.610> probably<00:05:31.030> go<00:05:31.240> with<00:05:31.330> a<00:05:31.390> pro<00:05:31.600> shop<00:05:31.870> be

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
shot so I probably go with a pro shop be

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.600 
shot so I probably go with a pro shop be
honest<00:05:32.290> so<00:05:32.560> it<00:05:32.650> could<00:05:32.740> be<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:32.890> prototype<00:05:33.370> or

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
honest so it could be a prototype or

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.760 
honest so it could be a prototype or
clear<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:33.940> new<00:05:34.150> tooth<00:05:34.390> whatever<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.410> want<00:05:35.650> to

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
clear a new tooth whatever you want to

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.469 
clear a new tooth whatever you want to
call<00:05:35.919> it<00:05:35.979> I<00:05:36.340> want<00:05:36.580> your<00:05:36.700> opinions<00:05:37.060> on<00:05:37.180> this<00:05:37.330> in

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
call it I want your opinions on this in
