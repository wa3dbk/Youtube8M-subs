00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 video about disarming and assembling the ford engine 3 0 two year 1971 the first step 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.070
 before disassembling the motor is to wash it to remove any dirt and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.479
 ensure you have the necessary tools 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.560
 we start winning the whole cooling system and removing the battery 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.099
 we remove the upper and lower radiator hoses and remove it 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.460
 also the fan and disconnect the starter alternator cables and 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.979
 acceleration 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.450
 we disconnected the lines of the tank and the gasoline pump 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.460
 we remove the main cable of the country the cable of the pressure of the oil and 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.070
 the water's temperature 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.660
 we removed the starter and the steering wheel was disconnected the muffler the manifold 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.080
 escape and remove the shell 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.070
 we removed the valve cover and the intake manifold was removed 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.520
 also the valve lift system then we remove the cylinder head and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.200
 to disarm these we start by compressing the valve springs 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.170
 using a spring compressor then we remove the insurance from the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.790
 springs then the springs and finally the valves we removed there 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 the water pump followed by the fuel pump 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.990
 We removed the both and the crankcase removed the front and side cover and removed 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.560
 the chain of time 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.299
 we take out the oil pump and the connecting rods then we remove the benches and remove 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:21.860
 the crankshaft 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.840
 we take out all the punches 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.509
 and the camshaft insurance to continue with the camshaft and 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.550
 we could the cylinders 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.230
 motor arm 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.080
 before starting to work with him armentia moss the carburetor with a 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.380
 compressor 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.420
 we accept and place the crankshaft we put the benches and the ster was 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.299
 to 60 70 then we put the rings on the pistons the connecting rod metals and the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.450
 cranks 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.290
 we put in the camshaft and put the lock on the chain of the 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.360
 time checking that the gear points are aligned to give 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.530
 internal synchronization 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.570
 he put the tie with silicone carter and the oil pump after he was placed 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.570
 the poster put the packaging on his head and placed himself reviewing the sequence of 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.170
 tight and torque that was 65 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.280
 72 thickened the punches and put the system of elevation some put 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.080
 the admission packages that are the butts and the intake manifold are 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.850
 he put the tie to the water pump and then he put on the guide and elda 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:20.230
 in perth 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.749
 the fan and the radiator 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.749
 he put the exhaust manifold the rocker cover 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:29.669
 then we went to put the radiator hoses the fuel lines 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.479
 and the electrical system preparing the engine for the start
