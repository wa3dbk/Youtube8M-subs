in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> future<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.060> MLP<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.840> even<00:01:40.560> though

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
in the future for MLP and even though

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.469 
in the future for MLP and even though
there<00:01:40.890> are<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.220> kinds<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> reasons<00:01:42.060> why<00:01:42.420> these

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
there are all kinds of reasons why these

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.660 
there are all kinds of reasons why these
ideas<00:01:43.110> might<00:01:43.320> never<00:01:43.560> work<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> show<00:01:44.430> like

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
ideas might never work on a show like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.149 
ideas might never work on a show like
MLP<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.290> these<00:01:46.500> theories<00:01:46.829> can

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
MLP I do think that these theories can

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.130 
MLP I do think that these theories can
help<00:01:47.399> explain<00:01:47.790> parts<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> first<00:01:48.930> two

though<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:59.170> becomes<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.650> little<00:03:59.950> harder<00:04:00.340> to

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
though it becomes a little harder to

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.759 
though it becomes a little harder to
explain<00:04:00.970> each<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.989> their<00:04:02.170> challenge<00:04:02.680> is

allowed for them to show the elements
they<00:04:04.600> represented<00:04:05.319> now<00:04:06.069> I<00:04:06.100> suppose<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.910> this

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
they represented now I suppose that this

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.150 
they represented now I suppose that this
would<00:04:07.450> be<00:04:07.690> hard<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.109> believe<00:04:08.230> if<00:04:08.680> Nightmare

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
would be hard to believe if Nightmare

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.490 
would be hard to believe if Nightmare
Moon<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.519> causing<00:04:10.060> all<00:04:10.209> these<00:04:10.359> events<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:10.989> if

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
Moon is causing all these events and if

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500 
Moon is causing all these events and if
she<00:04:11.680> also<00:04:12.130> understood<00:04:12.549> how<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:12.880> elements

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
she also understood how the elements

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.930 
she also understood how the elements
worked<00:04:13.810> but<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:14.709> becomes<00:04:15.069> quite<00:04:15.489> apparent

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
worked but it becomes quite apparent

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.759 
worked but it becomes quite apparent
later<00:04:16.389> on<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.900> Nightmare<00:04:17.350> Moon<00:04:17.590> is

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769

some kind of knowledge of events to come

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.089 
some kind of knowledge of events to come
I<00:06:46.810> realized<00:06:47.810> that<00:06:47.990> these<00:06:48.139> explanations<00:06:48.949> are

I realized that these explanations are

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.339 
I realized that these explanations are
not<00:06:49.280> perfect<00:06:49.909> as<00:06:50.090> it<00:06:50.330> would<00:06:50.449> require<00:06:50.599> a<00:06:50.900> lot<00:06:51.110> of

time travel as well as a lot of trust

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:55.839 
time travel as well as a lot of trust
from<00:06:53.840> Celestia<00:06:54.409> in<00:06:54.590> what<00:06:54.830> Twilight<00:06:55.310> Sparkle

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:55.849 
from Celestia in what Twilight Sparkle

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.760 
from Celestia in what Twilight Sparkle
had<00:06:56.000> told<00:06:56.360> her<00:06:56.569> in<00:06:56.719> the<00:06:56.810> ancient<00:06:56.960> past<00:06:57.349> and

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
had told her in the ancient past and

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.700 
had told her in the ancient past and
these<00:06:58.580> explanations<00:06:59.000> only<00:06:59.750> cover<00:06:59.990> most<00:07:00.409> of

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
these explanations only cover most of

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.950 
these explanations only cover most of
the<00:07:00.860> coincidences<00:07:01.580> that<00:07:01.639> a<00:07:01.969> NY<00:07:02.300> Pony<00:07:02.689> had

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
the coincidences that a NY Pony had

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.290 
the coincidences that a NY Pony had
asked<00:07:03.229> others<00:07:03.590> to<00:07:03.620> explain<00:07:04.219> but<00:07:04.729> I<00:07:04.759> think<00:07:05.120> that

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
asked others to explain but I think that

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.999 
asked others to explain but I think that
these<00:07:05.449> theories<00:07:05.930> about<00:07:06.199> the<00:07:06.319> ancient<00:07:06.770> past

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:07.009 
these theories about the ancient past

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.189 
these theories about the ancient past
can<00:07:07.340> actually<00:07:07.819> get<00:07:08.000> these<00:07:08.210> inconsistencies

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 
can actually get these inconsistencies

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:12.010 
can actually get these inconsistencies
to<00:07:09.590> fit<00:07:09.800> together<00:07:09.979> rather<00:07:10.490> well<00:07:10.849> what<00:07:11.750> do<00:07:11.900> you

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
to fit together rather well what do you

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.589 
to fit together rather well what do you
think<00:07:12.379> is<00:07:12.680> it<00:07:13.009> possible<00:07:13.610> for<00:07:13.669> Celestia<00:07:14.389> to

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 
think is it possible for Celestia to

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:16.119 
think is it possible for Celestia to
have<00:07:14.779> had<00:07:15.020> knowledge<00:07:15.349> of<00:07:15.710> these<00:07:15.830> future

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 
events is there some other explanation

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:20.559 
events is there some other explanation
as<00:07:19.069> to<00:07:19.099> how<00:07:19.250> she<00:07:19.460> could<00:07:19.939> have<00:07:19.969> known<00:07:20.300> that

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:20.569 
as to how she could have known that

as to how she could have known that
Twilight<00:07:20.840> Sparkle<00:07:21.529> could<00:07:21.710> have<00:07:21.800> come<00:07:22.039> upon

Twilight Sparkle could have come upon
