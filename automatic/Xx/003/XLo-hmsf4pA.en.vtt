for some comparison there's a link
underneath<00:00:33.580> this<00:00:33.879> video<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:35.350> what<00:00:35.500> i'm<00:00:35.620> doing

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
underneath this video so what i'm doing

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.490 
underneath this video so what i'm doing
here<00:00:36.070> is<00:00:36.129> some<00:00:36.580> manual<00:00:37.210> pull<00:00:37.510> focuses<00:00:38.050> using

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
here is some manual pull focuses using

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.799 
here is some manual pull focuses using
that<00:00:38.680> ring<00:00:39.010> on<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:39.370> front<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.850> x<00:00:40.059> 900<00:00:40.659> m

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
that ring on the front of the x 900 m

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.039 
that ring on the front of the x 900 m
and<00:00:41.049> it<00:00:41.650> creates<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.159> nice<00:00:42.430> smooth<00:00:43.239> pull<00:00:43.780> focus

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:44.049 
and it creates a nice smooth pull focus

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:46.530 
and it creates a nice smooth pull focus
it<00:00:44.320> does<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.470> very<00:00:44.559> good<00:00:44.949> job<00:00:45.129> of<00:00:45.549> this<00:00:46.089> indeed

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
it does a very good job of this indeed

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.780 
it does a very good job of this indeed
now<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:47.409> particular<00:00:47.589> shot<00:00:48.190> I<00:00:48.220> struggled

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
now this particular shot I struggled

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.729 
now this particular shot I struggled
with<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:49.119> sony<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:50.049> actual<00:00:50.320> weight<00:00:50.500> of<00:00:50.650> the

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
with the sony the actual weight of the

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.590 
with the sony the actual weight of the
lens<00:00:50.949> but<00:00:51.220> no<00:00:51.610> such<00:00:51.850> problem<00:00:52.299> with<00:00:52.449> the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
lens but no such problem with the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.619 
lens but no such problem with the
panasonic<00:00:53.229> and<00:00:53.470> then<00:00:54.369> this<00:00:54.580> zoom<00:00:54.850> out<00:00:55.000> shot<00:00:55.360> is

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
panasonic and then this zoom out shot is

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.229 
panasonic and then this zoom out shot is
using<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.619> rocker<00:00:57.070> switch<00:00:57.400> on<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.670> top<00:00:58.059> of

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
using the rocker switch on the top of

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.929 
using the rocker switch on the top of
the<00:00:58.540> camcorder<00:00:59.199> so<00:00:59.320> i'm<00:00:59.379> not<00:00:59.500> using<00:00:59.710> the<00:01:00.070> ring

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:00.939 
the camcorder so i'm not using the ring

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:02.579 
the camcorder so i'm not using the ring
on<00:01:01.119> the<00:01:01.269> front<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.629> camera<00:01:01.960> which<00:01:02.110> can<00:01:02.140> be

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
on the front of the camera which can be

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.229 
on the front of the camera which can be
assigned<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.070> zoom<00:01:03.309> as<00:01:03.489> well<00:01:03.640> i'm<00:01:03.850> using<00:01:04.150> the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
assigned to zoom as well i'm using the

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.090 
assigned to zoom as well i'm using the
actual<00:01:04.570> rocker<00:01:04.869> switch<00:01:05.229> on<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.530> top<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:05.920> the

actual rocker switch on the top of the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.320 
actual rocker switch on the top of the
unit<00:01:07.439> performs<00:01:08.439> very<00:01:09.070> very<00:01:09.369> well<00:01:09.580> nice<00:01:09.939> clean

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
really surprised at the level of detail

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040 
really surprised at the level of detail
it<00:01:15.640> resolves<00:01:16.090> as<00:01:16.210> well<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.510> can<00:01:16.630> see<00:01:16.840> this

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
it resolves as well you can see this

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.470 
it resolves as well you can see this
here<00:01:17.410> when<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.070> snaps<00:01:18.400> into<00:01:18.640> focus<00:01:18.940> we've<00:01:19.300> got

here when it snaps into focus we've got

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.780 
here when it snaps into focus we've got
the<00:01:19.630> grain<00:01:20.080> that's<00:01:20.740> picked<00:01:21.010> up<00:01:21.220> in<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.460> actual

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
the grain that's picked up in the actual

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.110 
the grain that's picked up in the actual
bezel<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:23.140> mini<00:01:23.470> dashboard<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.430> again

focus and the smooth handheld panning

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.290 
focus and the smooth handheld panning
that's<00:01:30.820> achievable<00:01:31.170> using<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.290> x<00:01:32.470> 900<00:01:33.070> m

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300

detail in this you can see these a

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.200 
detail in this you can see these a
little<00:02:05.830> bit<00:02:06.010> worse<00:02:06.190> for<00:02:06.220> where's<00:02:06.670> but<00:02:07.060> the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
little bit worse for where's but the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.449 
little bit worse for where's but the
