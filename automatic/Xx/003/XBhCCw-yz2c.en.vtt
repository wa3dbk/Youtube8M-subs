00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.800
 hello everyone today we are going to make a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.289
 experiment to make a magneto jump 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.180
 excess heat consumption for this 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.480
 we have an auxiliary table where 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.610
 we have a thermal and a differential that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.000
 it protects us the line that passes through 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.220
 of this thermal 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.410
 and it goes to a multiple base where we have 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.150
 connected a series of equipment 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.160
 electric 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.850
 we also have a perimetric clamp 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.430
 to check the intensity 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.550
 we connect the thermal magnet and 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.659
 we see that it has an intensity 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.980
 clip in perimetric we put another equipment 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.820
 plus 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.040
 and we see that the intensity goes up 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.830
 if we leave it 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.530
 enough time to pass the amperage of the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.310
 limit that the thermal magnet has 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.130
 would jump because it would heat up there and 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.160
 would act that way let's do what 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.870
 make it faster by connecting another 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.290
 apparatus more in this case for example a 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.290
 drill 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.269
 [Music] 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.710
 well we have verified that I have passed a 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.900
 hold on but in the end the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.440
 thermal because it's heated 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.200
 and this causes it to simply fire 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.930
 an experiment to verify that the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.880
 overconsumption through a magneto 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.270
 thermal because there are many appliances 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.380
 connected or because the intensity exceeds 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.380
 its limit makes this jump 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.120
 thank you very much I hope it will help you 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 And until next time 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.870

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:22.490
