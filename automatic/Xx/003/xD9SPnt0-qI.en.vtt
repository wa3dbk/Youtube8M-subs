here's<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> thing<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.009> thought<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> trailer

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
here's the thing I thought the trailer

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.600 
here's the thing I thought the trailer
was<00:01:45.680> fanfreakintastic<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.799> love<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.040> there's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
was fanfreakintastic I love that there's

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.940 
was fanfreakintastic I love that there's
so<00:01:47.880> much<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.780> difficult<00:01:49.140> for<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.619> filmmaker

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so much it's difficult for a filmmaker

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.069 
so much it's difficult for a filmmaker
to<00:01:50.189> really<00:01:50.460> produce<00:01:50.610> tension<00:01:51.509> especially<00:01:51.659> in

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to really produce tension especially in

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.170 
to really produce tension especially in
a<00:01:52.140> stillroom<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.759> takes<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.000> really

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.490 
and everything to transcendence too and
i'm<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.549> going<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.760> say<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.209> his<00:02:21.390> fault<00:02:21.719> but

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
i'm not going to say was his fault but

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.559 
i'm not going to say was his fault but
he<00:02:22.950> didn't<00:02:23.310> deliver<00:02:23.670> nor<00:02:23.969> did<00:02:24.120> he<00:02:24.269> deliver

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
he didn't deliver nor did he deliver

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.880 
he didn't deliver nor did he deliver
what<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:24.900> thought<00:02:25.140> he<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.379> going<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.769> deliver

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
what I thought he was going to deliver

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.240 
what I thought he was going to deliver
in<00:02:26.189> that<00:02:26.310> film<00:02:26.609> and<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.629> I<00:02:27.959> think<00:02:28.349> Johnny<00:02:28.950> Depp

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
in that film and so I think Johnny Depp

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.990 
in that film and so I think Johnny Depp
is<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:30.000> best<00:02:30.540> actor<00:02:31.439> not<00:02:31.829> giving<00:02:32.370> us<00:02:32.519> his<00:02:32.730> best

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
is the best actor not giving us his best

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
is the best actor not giving us his best
in<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.269> last<00:02:33.450> 10<00:02:33.689> years<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.200> think<00:02:34.769> he<00:02:34.889> still<00:02:35.129> is

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
in the last 10 years I think he still is

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.160 
in the last 10 years I think he still is
capable<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:35.969> I<00:02:36.120> think<00:02:36.480> he's<00:02:36.629> got<00:02:36.930> an

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
capable of it I think he's got an

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.920 
capable of it I think he's got an
academy<00:02:37.650> award-winning<00:02:37.889> performance<00:02:38.549> in<00:02:38.700> him

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
academy award-winning performance in him

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.149 
academy award-winning performance in him
hopefully<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.139> is<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.319> one<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.769> trailer

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
hopefully this is the one the trailer

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.220 
hopefully this is the one the trailer
certainly<00:02:42.090> puts<00:02:42.599> us<00:02:42.689> off<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.079> right<00:02:43.200> start

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
certainly puts us off to the right start

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.050 
certainly puts us off to the right start

fascinating character a true life human

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.069 
fascinating character a true life human
to<00:03:38.639> base<00:03:38.849> this<00:03:39.030> off<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.449> and<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.659> bad<00:03:39.840> bad

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
to base this off of and the bad bad

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.809 
to base this off of and the bad bad
things<00:03:40.319> he<00:03:40.470> did<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.859> everything<00:03:41.579> about<00:03:41.760> this

but at the helm I think it's really good
at<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.169> so<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.739> think<00:03:47.040> all<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.400> elements

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
at this so I think all the elements

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.030 
at this so I think all the elements
intact<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.389> think<00:03:48.930> Depp<00:03:49.259> is<00:03:49.470> going<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.859> deliver

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
intact I think Depp is going to deliver

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.379 
intact I think Depp is going to deliver
and<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.489> still<00:03:50.729> think<00:03:50.970> he<00:03:51.090> was<00:03:51.209> good<00:03:51.359> in
