in<00:00:03.389> front<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.140> me<00:00:04.230> here<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.740> quick

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
in front of me here of a quick

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.959 
in front of me here of a quick
comparison<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.880> x<00:00:06.149> 98<00:00:06.510> and<00:00:07.049> 3G<00:00:07.920> and<00:00:08.100> the

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969 
comparison of the x 98 and 3G and the

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.290

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
x10 HD 3g both of these tablets come

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.160 
x10 HD 3g both of these tablets come
from<00:00:12.509> tech<00:00:12.719> last<00:00:13.639> come<00:00:14.639> out<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.880> China<00:00:15.170> both

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
from tech last come out of China both

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.200 
from tech last come out of China both
featuring<00:00:16.770> high-resolution<00:00:17.550> screens<00:00:17.939> and

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
featuring high-resolution screens and

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.600 
featuring high-resolution screens and
atom<00:00:18.689> processors<00:00:19.349> just<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> quick<00:00:20.550> look

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
atom processors just have a quick look

atom processors just have a quick look
at<00:00:20.939> Windows<00:00:21.329> 8.1<00:00:21.540> gaming<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> machines

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
at Windows 8.1 gaming on the machines

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.600 
at Windows 8.1 gaming on the machines
both<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.660> them<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.989> the<00:00:25.559> brightness<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
both of them have the brightness up the

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.299 
both of them have the brightness up the
maximum<00:00:27.029> city<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:29.390> I'll<00:00:30.390> quickly<00:00:30.570> load

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
maximum city and I'll quickly load

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.000 
maximum city and I'll quickly load
asheville<00:00:32.309> 8<00:00:33.059> airborne<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.750> hopefully<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
asheville 8 airborne at hopefully at the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:45.569 
asheville 8 airborne at hopefully at the
same<00:00:35.220> time

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.399 

I<00:00:45.640> think<00:00:46.480> I<00:00:46.539> was<00:00:46.629> a<00:00:46.659> little<00:00:46.870> slow<00:00:47.079> there<00:00:47.260> with

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
I think I was a little slow there with

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.840 
I think I was a little slow there with
my<00:00:47.530> fingers<00:00:47.949> wasn't<00:00:48.879> exactly<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.719> same<00:00:49.929> time

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.979 

hopefully<00:00:54.850> you<00:00:55.030> can<00:00:55.149> see<00:00:55.329> on<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.510> camera<00:00:55.690> here

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
hopefully you can see on the camera here

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.950 
hopefully you can see on the camera here
that<00:00:56.229> it's<00:00:56.469> slightly<00:00:56.829> smoother<00:00:57.549> on<00:00:57.729> the<00:00:57.969> x<00:00:58.359> 98

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.460 

and<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.299> down<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.869> resolution

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
and that is down to the resolution

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.050 
and that is down to the resolution
because<00:01:05.920> it's<00:01:06.159> bringing<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.460> lower<00:01:06.640> resolution

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
because it's bringing a lower resolution

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.749 
because it's bringing a lower resolution
than<00:01:07.509> now<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.439> stellar<00:01:08.680> here<00:01:08.920> which<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.250> quite

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
than now the stellar here which is quite

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.230 
than now the stellar here which is quite
high<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.509> this<00:01:10.750> is<00:01:10.869> running<00:01:11.549> 2560<00:01:12.549> x<00:01:12.729> 1600

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
high and this is running 2560 x 1600

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.779 
high and this is running 2560 x 1600
it's<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.049> really<00:01:14.200> high<00:01:14.470> resolution<00:01:15.009> especially

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
it's a really high resolution especially

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:22.169 
it's a really high resolution especially
for<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.060> tablet<00:01:16.840> running<00:01:17.200> an<00:01:17.409> atom<00:01:17.740> chip<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:22.000> as

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
for a tablet running an atom chip so as

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.389 
for a tablet running an atom chip so as
I<00:01:22.299> said<00:01:22.360> before<00:01:22.479> I<00:01:22.780> forgot<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:23.530> but<00:01:24.069> it<00:01:24.190> is<00:01:24.250> tell

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
I said before I forgot it but it is tell

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.580 
I said before I forgot it but it is tell
us<00:01:24.429> on<00:01:24.610> there<00:01:24.789> hi<00:01:25.030> pointless<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.720> thereby

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
us on there hi pointless and thereby

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.410 
us on there hi pointless and thereby
fronting<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.039> latest<00:01:27.369> Intel<00:01:27.759> graphics

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
fronting the latest Intel graphics

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:38.090 
fronting the latest Intel graphics
driver<00:01:29.190> so<00:01:30.190> just<00:01:30.369> go<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.549> play<00:01:30.729> game<00:01:31.000> now

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.559 

before<00:01:39.100> I<00:01:39.130> do<00:01:39.220> have<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.640> look<00:01:39.789> at<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.000> contrast

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
before I do have a look at the contrast

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:48.240 
before I do have a look at the contrast
and<00:01:40.840> blank<00:01:41.200> levels<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.860> two<00:01:42.039> screens<00:01:47.250> they

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
and blank levels of the two screens they

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.880 
and blank levels of the two screens they
are<00:01:48.490> very<00:01:48.520> similar<00:01:52.140> may<00:01:53.140> be<00:01:53.170> hard<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.560> pick<00:01:53.800> up

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
are very similar may be hard to pick up

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.499 
are very similar may be hard to pick up
on<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.129> camera<00:01:54.550> but<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:57.670> think<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.269> the

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
on the camera but I do think that the

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.300 
on the camera but I do think that the
black<00:01:58.899> levels<00:01:59.259> are<00:01:59.410> actually<00:01:59.679> better<00:01:59.890> on<00:02:00.160> the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
black levels are actually better on the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:09.710 
black levels are actually better on the
x10<00:02:01.830> sorry<00:02:02.830> on<00:02:03.129> the<00:02:03.160> x<00:02:03.459> 98<00:02:06.629> slightly<00:02:07.629> better

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
x10 sorry on the x 98 slightly better

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.150 
x10 sorry on the x 98 slightly better
and<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.780> brightness<00:02:11.050> is<00:02:11.319> slightly<00:02:11.590> higher<00:02:11.739> on

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
and the brightness is slightly higher on

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.270 
and the brightness is slightly higher on
the<00:02:12.370> x<00:02:12.580> 10<00:02:13.090> HD<00:02:13.540> ok<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.319> i<00:02:14.530> will<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.830> go<00:02:15.069> in<00:02:15.159> and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
the x 10 HD ok so i will just go in and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.940 
the x 10 HD ok so i will just go in and
load<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.489> game<00:02:15.640> yo<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:17.290> course<00:02:17.590> i<00:02:17.650> won't<00:02:17.769> be

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
load the game yo of course i won't be

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.000 
load the game yo of course i won't be
able<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.159> actually<00:02:18.459> steer<00:02:19.030> or<00:02:19.180> drive<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.980> you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
able to actually steer or drive but you

00:02:21.010 --> 00:03:13.230 
able to actually steer or drive but you
get<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.400> idea

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.750 

so<00:03:14.240> you<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.660> see<00:03:14.870> there<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:16.190> does<00:03:16.520> run

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
so you can see there that it does run

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.610 
so you can see there that it does run
faster<00:03:17.330> on<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.349> x<00:03:18.470> 980<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.890> 3g<00:03:19.750> naturally<00:03:20.750> with

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
faster on the x 980 a 3g naturally with

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.839 
faster on the x 980 a 3g naturally with
a<00:03:21.650> lot<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:21.890> resolution<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.520> would<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:25.700> can

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
a lot of resolution it would and you can

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.420 
a lot of resolution it would and you can
see<00:03:26.000> care<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.330> also<00:03:26.780> one<00:03:26.959> does<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.890> does<00:03:28.160> seem

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
see care that also one does it does seem

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.900 
see care that also one does it does seem
to<00:03:28.459> fit<00:03:28.970> better<00:03:29.330> on<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.720> 16<00:03:30.170> x<00:03:30.319> 10<00:03:30.530> ratio<00:03:31.010> but

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
to fit better on the 16 x 10 ratio but

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.699 
to fit better on the 16 x 10 ratio but
the<00:03:32.030> tiles<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.810> see<00:03:32.930> there's<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.200> larger

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
the tiles you can see there's a larger

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.070 
the tiles you can see there's a larger
gap<00:03:33.920> here<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.459> hit<00:03:35.000> more<00:03:35.360> time<00:03:35.600> sent<00:03:35.930> if<00:03:36.020> you

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
gap here and hit more time sent if you

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.590
