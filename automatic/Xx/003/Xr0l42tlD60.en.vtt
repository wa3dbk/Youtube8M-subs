00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:12.539
 we could define it 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.459
 the public space 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.480
 a month ago 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.720
 many things but adn 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.720
 all between blocks 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.519
 p that allows 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.519
 the agent and I looked for this situation 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.630
 p house 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.940
 the citizen 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.630
 they shared 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.210
 space 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.100
 private citizen 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.410
 intimate and there happened to them 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 for which the client 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.770
 of babies 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.110
 p like him 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 well the patient 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.050
 lima abr 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.160
 because the district 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.760
 Supu Spa is confused 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.440
 the ornament of the city 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.570
 there is island the agency that space 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.940
 these profiles he 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.920
 it's a space like it has to be a nice space 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.030
 to be seen 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.080
 organized 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.650
 a public space 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.910
 it may be that but not that 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.050
 public space is something that according to 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.430
 the the ornate 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.430
 many times it is disputed with the use 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.370
 keep them or not 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 lie 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.620
 that people can know public 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.400
 what you have to do is anticipate those events 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.780
 and give them a space 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.320
 the aladi citizen inclusion can not be 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.620
 p 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.570
 based on repression 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.860
 but based on the inclusion presence there 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.860
 percent in children or young people who love lescay 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.510
 they have taken a space 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:10.599
 because they feel 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.549
 with citizen right 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.719
 certainly another side can do 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.789
 it may be that in some cases 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.249
 that untied more disturbed or a little 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:21.599
 round trip 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.279
 development of others 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.389
 among other activities but just for that is the public power 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.029
 give to that citizen who likes to be written we have to do an activity 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.419
 with the other spaces where you can do them 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:41.480
 sink disturb other people the solution is not is simply to ban them 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:47.249
 those activities and we started accelerating we started to discriminate 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.119
 ee is the end of space 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.279
 you also have to see the common positive sign 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.429
 the fact that people bone the city 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:00.179
 is claiming these this would be the right to these places 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.089
 these events for me 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:06.169
 they are extremely positive 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.729
 because there is a real awareness 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:12.569
 in which there were flowers but that should continue to painted the hotels 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.959
 this controversy is this is very useful 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.599
 to realize 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.569
 this is a flaw
