00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.519
 hello it 's common that with the passage of time 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.290
 in the plants and the garden that 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.809
 we plan to lose their original form 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.639
 in this case we have these agapanthus 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.130
 whose excessive growth are 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.630
 affecting not only the general design but 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.119
 that its own development and flowering 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.869
 to prevent this happening today the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.869
 transplant we will do 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.110
 the agapantos are adaptable and it's easy 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.820
 crops are characterized by their long 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.950
 vera floral that finally has a 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.880
 inflorescence which may vary from 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.880
 white to lilac 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.059
 The first thing we will do is prepare the 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.339
 place of destination for that we have to 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.859
 drop the earth add compost and make 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.659
 an orifice this has to be greater than 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.430
 bread size of plant roots 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.180
 that we can estimate taking as 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.180
 reference to the leaves 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.089
 the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.920
 We water to facilitate the extraction of 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.140
 the plant and then with a shovel we do 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.820
 a deep hole at a distance 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.820
 adequate not to damage the roots 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.109
 we take the foliage base to 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.299
 lift the plant from the ground and take it 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.600
 to the final place we cover and 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.600
 we arrange 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.760
 víctor rodríguez did not describe in our 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.220
 site telling us that he planted grass and 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.930
 as he could not water it, it was dried and 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.960
 He wants to know if you may grow 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.460
 new or if you need to replant 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.020
 Vctor there are several types of pastures and 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.850
 those who are able to return to 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.770
 sprout even if they are a bit dry are 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.630
 those who have stolons this you what 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.970
 you recognize when you take the grass and leave 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.260
 as a network if this is not your case what 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.590
 more advisable is that you return to 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.590
 plant 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.890
 to promote the development of roots 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.489
 you can apply a liquid instant on 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.489
 the irrigation water 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.310
 the water for a whole species that is 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.080
 sensitive to frost so the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.290
 Cold months that remain is recommended 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.940
 protect your roots using a lot if 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.890
 he was left any doubt can return to 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.750
 see this program at a point cl and 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.379
 share it on social networks is 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.379
 something that are well
