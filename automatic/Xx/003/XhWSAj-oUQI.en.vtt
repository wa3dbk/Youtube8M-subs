00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:15.150
 next candidate a ford focus rs me 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.160
 I'm the Ralf coming up close and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.140
 pour biebertals and small on the ground 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.730
 master toolmaker and in the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.130
 I like to have leisure time with me 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.560
 motorsport everything around it belongs 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.410
 So both active and passive 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.840
 to get even more motorsport experience 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.510
 Collecting the NÃ¼rburgring is an ideal 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.679
 training grounds focus rs year of construction 2003 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.079
 I have last year in november 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.569
 only bought before I was with mine 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 normal family carriages on the go 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.199
 was nothing more and more time than expected 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.769
 I can not do anything anymore 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.359
 I have favorably placed on the internet and 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.280
 To have as much fun on the 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.519
 ralf has his race track 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.600
 focus on all rules of the art 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.600
 upgraded and prepared 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.830
 Performance increase is in there how much 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.510
 I do not know exactly predecessors something 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.100
 tell about the dynamometer with 272 ps 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.770
 I believe him because it works 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.660
 pretty much to the point 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.370
 pepper in it so like the corners out 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.970
 and also think correctly 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.860
 made wahnsinns humor the auto a 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.350
 very good impression but also a lot 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.150
 respect he has before the nordschleife he 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.100
 appreciates them all and he knows that 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.100
 she is not easy to drive 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.970
 pad does not spread that fast though 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.159
 It is a race track is a myth 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.960
 and here are the biggest ones in motorsport 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.510
 have already driven here 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.700
 somehow gives me such a small war where 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.450
 to be driven where already the biggest 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.450
 the world are driven 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.450
 although he already knows the course 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.910
 he with tension but also with joy 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.310
 on the track now he can his 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.950
 Passengers show how to make quick turns 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.929
 driving on the nordschleife 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.110
 and that is then completely dry 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.110
 is 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.860
 and from 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.600
 on 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.360
 Next 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.170
 I 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.200
 and space 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.200
 July 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.049
 And at the end is also live with his 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.049
 Focus rs fully satisfied 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.150
 perfect street dry is really fun 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.720
 made a few slower times 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.549
 overtake 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.579
 It was absolute great fun 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.579
 made
