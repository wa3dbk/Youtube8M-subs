good amount of leanness because of the

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.540 
good amount of leanness because of the
low<00:05:51.719> amount<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.199> calories<00:05:52.620> not<00:05:53.129> only<00:05:53.339> the<00:05:53.430> low

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
low amount of calories not only the low

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.619 
low amount of calories not only the low
amount<00:05:53.759> of<00:05:53.879> calories<00:05:54.180> but<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.389> way<00:05:54.509> I'm

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629 
amount of calories but the way I'm

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:56.450 
amount of calories but the way I'm
timing<00:05:54.930> my<00:05:55.080> carbohydrates<00:05:55.500> I<00:05:56.219> actually

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
timing my carbohydrates I actually

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.999 
timing my carbohydrates I actually
believe<00:05:56.969> that<00:05:57.440> carbohydrate<00:05:58.440> timing<00:05:58.860> and

00:05:58.999 --> 00:05:59.009 
believe that carbohydrate timing and

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.420 
believe that carbohydrate timing and
insulin<00:06:00.259> preventing<00:06:01.259> insulin<00:06:01.740> resistance<00:06:02.279> in

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
insulin preventing insulin resistance in

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.089 
insulin preventing insulin resistance in
building<00:06:02.909> insulin<00:06:03.659> sensitivity<00:06:04.139> has<00:06:04.800> a<00:06:04.830> lot

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
building insulin sensitivity has a lot

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.559 
building insulin sensitivity has a lot
more<00:06:05.129> to<00:06:05.400> do<00:06:05.550> with<00:06:05.759> whether<00:06:06.089> or<00:06:06.150> not<00:06:06.360> you're
