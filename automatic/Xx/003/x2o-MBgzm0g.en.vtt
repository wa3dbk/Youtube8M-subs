00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and the more revolutions she's able to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.830 
and the more revolutions she's able to
do<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:58.950> addy<00:01:59.220> doing<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.790> same<00:01:59.970> thing<00:02:00.330> you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
