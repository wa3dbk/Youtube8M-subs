00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
easily so now I've been drinking some

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.009 
easily so now I've been drinking some
whiskey<00:03:04.950> -<00:03:05.129> like<00:03:07.310> syrup<00:03:08.480> do<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.569> think<00:03:09.840> that

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
whiskey - like syrup do you think that

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.839

the<00:03:10.500> fact<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.980> lost<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.370> draft<00:03:11.700> has

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
the fact that you lost the draft has

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.910 
the fact that you lost the draft has
anything<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.299> do<00:03:12.510> with<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.780> curse<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:15.920> don't

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
anything to do with the curse I don't

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.559 
anything to do with the curse I don't
think<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.250> curse<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:19.829> might<00:03:20.069> be<00:03:20.280> here<00:03:20.569> it

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
think the curse is it might be here it

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.229 
think the curse is it might be here it
might<00:03:21.840> not<00:03:22.909> probably<00:03:23.909> it<00:03:24.540> might<00:03:24.720> be<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.079> curse

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
might not probably it might be the curse

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.599 
might not probably it might be the curse
