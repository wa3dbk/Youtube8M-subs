00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
include this you go through the next

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.590 
include this you go through the next
step<00:01:24.840> which<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.460> drag<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.670> drop<00:01:26.820> these<00:01:27.240> two

download so what you're going to do is I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.590 
download so what you're going to do is I
like<00:01:40.530> i<00:01:40.950> said<00:01:41.130> before<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:41.729> computer<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.360> broke

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
like i said before my computer is broke

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.870 
like i said before my computer is broke
my<00:01:43.200> computer<00:01:43.500> screen<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.100> broken<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.549> i<00:01:44.580> cannot

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
my computer screen is broken so i cannot

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
my computer screen is broken so i cannot
record<00:01:45.180> my<00:01:45.390> xbox<00:01:45.810> because<00:01:46.170> i<00:01:46.260> can't<00:01:46.470> really

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
record my xbox because i can't really

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.250 
record my xbox because i can't really
see<00:01:47.040> where<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.370> record<00:01:47.670> button<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.150> it<00:01:48.330> um

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
see where the record button is on it um

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.850 
see where the record button is on it um
I<00:01:50.130> don't<00:01:50.640> really<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:52.650> only

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
I don't really think I can the only

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.080 
I don't really think I can the only
reason<00:01:53.010> that<00:01:53.130> I'm<00:01:53.280> able<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
reason that I'm able to do this is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.490 
reason that I'm able to do this is
because<00:01:54.150> I<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.630> computer<00:01:55.020> hooked<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
because I have my computer hooked up to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.380 
because I have my computer hooked up to
a<00:01:55.530> monitor<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.430> pretty<00:01:56.640> big<00:01:56.790> monitor<00:01:57.150> so

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
a monitor and it's pretty big monitor so

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.100 
a monitor and it's pretty big monitor so
it<00:01:57.680> doesn't<00:01:58.680> fit<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.280> where<00:01:59.760> math<00:01:59.909> boxes<00:02:00.390> close

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
it doesn't fit in where math boxes close

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.760 
it doesn't fit in where math boxes close
enough<00:02:01.440> that<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.770> hook<00:02:02.010> up<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:03.260> vga<00:02:04.260> cable

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
enough that I can hook up the vga cable

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.669 
enough that I can hook up the vga cable
through<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.750> computer<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.140> monitor<00:02:07.650> um

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
through the computer to the monitor um

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.160
