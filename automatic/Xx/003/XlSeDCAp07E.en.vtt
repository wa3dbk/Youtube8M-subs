00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
using the tangle tamer which is just a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.610 
using the tangle tamer which is just a
dupe<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> tangle<00:01:00.180> teezer<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.780> believe<00:01:01.500> it

dupe of the tangle teezer I believe it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.210 
dupe of the tangle teezer I believe it
works<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> exact<00:01:02.129> same<00:01:02.340> way<00:01:02.579> regardless<00:01:03.329> i

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220

you're<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.689> but<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.930> takes<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.650> tangles
