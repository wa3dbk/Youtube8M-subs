nut butters or something like that it

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.890 
nut butters or something like that it
works<00:00:18.960> fantastic<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:20.130> very<00:00:20.340> simple<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> use

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
works fantastic it's very simple to use

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.570 
works fantastic it's very simple to use
it<00:00:21.900> comes<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> kind<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.949> socket<00:00:23.400> end

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
it comes with a kind of a socket end

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.009 
it comes with a kind of a socket end
here<00:00:23.789> that's<00:00:23.970> tapered<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.510> fit<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> end<00:00:24.930> of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
here that's tapered to fit the end of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.800 
here that's tapered to fit the end of
the<00:00:25.080> shaft<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.590> then<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.939> also<00:00:27.150> got<00:00:27.390> splines

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the shaft and then it's also got splines

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.410 
the shaft and then it's also got splines
so<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.380> put<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> into<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:28.890> drill

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
so that when you put it into your drill

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.350 
so that when you put it into your drill
it<00:00:30.420> grabs<00:00:30.660> very<00:00:31.050> nicely<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.090> attach

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
it grabs very nicely so you just attach

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.469 
it grabs very nicely so you just attach
it<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.660> any<00:00:33.900> drill<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:34.559> we<00:00:35.460> recommend<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.269> is

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:36.479 
it to any drill now we recommend this is

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:42.439 
it to any drill now we recommend this is
a<00:00:37.549> nine<00:00:38.549> amp<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.030> believe<00:00:40.489> this<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.699> a<00:00:41.729> half<00:00:42.210> inch

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
a nine amp I believe this is a half inch

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.780 
a nine amp I believe this is a half inch
nine<00:00:42.720> amp<00:00:42.930> drill<00:00:43.320> works<00:00:43.949> very<00:00:44.339> good<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
nine amp drill works very good it

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.780 
nine amp drill works very good it
doesn't<00:00:45.089> seem<00:00:45.449> to<00:00:46.190> have<00:00:47.190> any<00:00:47.339> problem

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
doesn't seem to have any problem

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.979 
doesn't seem to have any problem
powering<00:00:48.150> anything<00:00:48.449> that<00:00:48.570> we've<00:00:48.690> tried<00:00:48.900> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
powering anything that we've tried to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.000 
powering anything that we've tried to
grind<00:00:49.229> if<00:00:49.949> you're<00:00:50.159> doing<00:00:50.400> nuts<00:00:51.320> or<00:00:52.320> oilier

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
grind if you're doing nuts or oilier

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.680 
grind if you're doing nuts or oilier
things<00:00:53.400> you<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.820> probably<00:00:54.119> get<00:00:54.360> away<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.540> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
things you can probably get away with a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600 
things you can probably get away with a
smaller<00:00:54.930> drill<00:00:55.409> but<00:00:55.650> typically<00:00:56.040> we<00:00:56.250> want<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
smaller drill but typically we want it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.759 
smaller drill but typically we want it
the<00:00:56.729> half-inch<00:00:57.150> drill<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.479> recommended<00:00:58.080> to

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
the half-inch drill is recommended to

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.250 
the half-inch drill is recommended to
get<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.309> use<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.670> drill<00:01:00.260> basically

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
get that to use the drill basically

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.829 
get that to use the drill basically
loosen<00:01:01.409> up<00:01:01.939> the<00:01:02.939> nut<00:01:03.150> on<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.479> end<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.720> your

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
loosen up the nut on the end of your

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.770 
loosen up the nut on the end of your
handle<00:01:04.610> take<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> nut<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:08.780> sometimes

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
handle take the nut out and sometimes

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
handle take the nut out and sometimes
because<00:01:10.410> this<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> tapered<00:01:11.190> fit<00:01:11.430> they're

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
because this is a tapered fit they're

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.670 
because this is a tapered fit they're
kind<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.210> stiff<00:01:12.480> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.110> take<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.440> hammer

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
kind of stiff if you take your hammer

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520 
kind of stiff if you take your hammer
and<00:01:14.010> tap<00:01:14.190> on<00:01:14.370> it<00:01:14.400> from<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> backside<00:01:15.530> it'll

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and tap on it from the backside it'll

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.460 
and tap on it from the backside it'll
pop<00:01:16.740> right<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:18.870> set<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.290> aside

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
pop right off and then set this aside

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.720 
pop right off and then set this aside
where<00:01:19.800> you're<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.010> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> lose<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
where you're not going to lose it

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.570 
where you're not going to lose it
now<00:01:21.660> you're<00:01:21.870> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.050> notice<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:22.580> this

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
now you're going to notice that this

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
now you're going to notice that this
taper<00:01:23.940> fits<00:01:24.450> right<00:01:24.660> on<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.230> taper<00:01:25.560> there

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
taper fits right on to the taper there

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190 
taper fits right on to the taper there
and<00:01:26.040> it'll<00:01:26.190> slide<00:01:26.490> into<00:01:26.880> place<00:01:27.120> when<00:01:28.050> you're

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and it'll slide into place when you're

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.770 
and it'll slide into place when you're
using<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.250> want<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.610> keep<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.270> slight

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
using it you want to just keep a slight

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.360 
using it you want to just keep a slight
amount<00:01:31.080> of<00:01:31.230> pressure<00:01:31.470> forward<00:01:32.010> it<00:01:32.130> doesn't

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
amount of pressure forward it doesn't

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.440 
amount of pressure forward it doesn't
take<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.730> don't<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.240> push

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
take all you don't have to really push

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.380 
take all you don't have to really push
on<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.530> want<00:01:34.740> those<00:01:34.950> two

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
on it but you just want those two

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.780 
on it but you just want those two
surfaces<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> engage<00:01:37.190> so<00:01:38.190> when<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.490> put<00:01:38.670> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
surfaces to engage so when you put that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.810 
surfaces to engage so when you put that
on<00:01:39.000> there<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:40.800> you<00:01:41.190> can<00:01:41.340> adjust<00:01:41.430> your

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
on there and then you can adjust your

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.200 
on there and then you can adjust your
mill<00:01:43.040> or<00:01:44.040> whatever<00:01:44.340> you're<00:01:44.490> grinding<00:01:44.909> it
