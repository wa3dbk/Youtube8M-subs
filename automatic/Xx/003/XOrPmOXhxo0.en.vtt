science<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.320> taking<00:00:49.770> off<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> modern

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
science was taking off that the modern

science was taking off that the modern
zoo<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.390> born<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.920> sure<00:00:53.190> zoos<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.210> received

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
zoo was born and sure zoos have received

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.080 
zoo was born and sure zoos have received
bad<00:00:54.960> press<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.590> past<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> modern<00:00:56.760> zoo

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
bad press in the past but the modern zoo

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
bad press in the past but the modern zoo
has<00:00:57.360> been<00:00:57.539> reinvented<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> center<00:00:59.250> of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
has been reinvented as a center of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.150 
has been reinvented as a center of
science<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> conservation<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
science and conservation so what are the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.060 
science and conservation so what are the
roles<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.969> modern<00:01:03.270> zoo<00:01:03.539> well<00:01:04.470> roughly

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
roles of a modern zoo well roughly

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.859 
roles of a modern zoo well roughly
speaking<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.729> divide<00:01:06.150> them<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:06.510> three

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
speaking we can divide them into three

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.620 
speaking we can divide them into three
categories<00:01:07.490> education<00:01:08.490> breeding<00:01:09.180> centers

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
categories education breeding centers

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.170 
categories education breeding centers
and<00:01:09.840> research<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.460> let's<00:01:11.670> start<00:01:12.030> with

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and research so let's start with

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.399 
and research so let's start with
education<00:01:14.659> it's<00:01:15.659> simple<00:01:16.110> really

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
education it's simple really

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.890 
education it's simple really
zoos<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> fun<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.759> safe<00:01:18.180> place<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.780> learn

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
zoos are a fun and safe place to learn

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.859 
zoos are a fun and safe place to learn
for<00:01:19.170> both<00:01:19.290> kids<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> adults<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:21.090> fact<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
for both kids and adults the fact is the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.749 
for both kids and adults the fact is the
animals<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.380> real<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.490> up<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
animals are real and you can get up and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850 
animals are real and you can get up and
close<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.570> some<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> more<00:01:24.990> exotic<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
close to some of the more exotic and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.859 
close to some of the more exotic and
threatened<00:01:26.610> creatures<00:01:27.060> from<00:01:27.390> around<00:01:27.659> the

threatened creatures from around the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.520 
threatened creatures from around the
world<00:01:28.310> every<00:01:29.310> year<00:01:30.110> 150<00:01:31.110> million<00:01:31.380> people

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.130 
world every year 150 million people
visit<00:01:32.250> zoos<00:01:32.490> around<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> world<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
visit zoos around the world and it's so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
visit zoos around the world and it's so
important<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> next<00:01:35.280> generation<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
important that the next generation is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480 
important that the next generation is
educated<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.950> understands<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> role<00:01:38.189> they

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
educated and understands the role they

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.690

still<00:01:42.090> many<00:01:42.570> zoos<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:42.930> education<00:01:43.860> centers

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
still many zoos have education centers

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
still many zoos have education centers
