00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.800
 It was beautiful where you can not see what designs 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.800
 they are and that knowing 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:36.710
 at this moment it is plastic a quality 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.710
 higher 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.820
 but we have some pretty points 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.620
 inconveniences the videos look at what 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.450
 black frames this maximum the balls 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.700
 that put buttons on the screen and this 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.100
 wasted and you have to tell me 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.110
 of the actor is little if I understand it 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.700
 been located in the part of the vera 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.470
 carlos and not cover with your hands and now 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.790
 he is not more comfortable but this is for the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.160
 design because it represents 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.630
 dust tips that change and 5 that is not so 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.330
 simple these other terminals 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.330
 they are very good but it is not like that 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.910
 in the ces de las vegas 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.580
 the problem that if you compare it with 0 of 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.280
 day 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.880
 digest the different areas and we 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.880
 go down at the same time 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 two 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.730
 at this moment 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.820
 4.1.2 presented six months ago and 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:33.760
 still have not deigned this 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:39.880
 x10 experience they had moments of 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:45.370
 sale with froyo the hesperia is a lot 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:48.420
 a long time will have but the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.160
 capita de personalizaciÃ³n 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.380
 here I have to make an intrusive layer 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.710
 that contributes good hey android pure not you 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.710
 complicate 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.740
 the multimedia section are and always 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.830
 clear 5-inch screen in mode 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.080
 how you can feel the software is that the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.290
 screen wanted to play but not cheat 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.290
 people 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.890
 5 inches when so with these 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.390
 lentils with the hand in the heart 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.310
 some minus 4.7 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.110
 but the buttons every day after 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.640
 they go in the video but now they are not 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.650
 claiming you are in any 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.890
 application and that lower bar subtracts you 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.190
 shrimp visibility thereof 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.190
 camera 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.760
 do you know which terminal has the same 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.020
 camera the same sensor but instead 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.490
 makes better pictures 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:51.240
 the s4 nor fa but it forces the camera that 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.240
 they tell me of the eu 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.350
 well seen the experience of where he came from 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.350
 the nice good performance 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.460
 It is the greatest virtue of a telephone 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.590
 submariners of the world if already fair 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.200
 raise your head surely this 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.910
 experience company because it 's a 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.180
 little better than almost all 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:39.980
 terminals after dipping me that has 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:39.980
 liked and why
