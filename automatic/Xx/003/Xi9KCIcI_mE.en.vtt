benchpress<00:00:46.800> day<00:00:47.190> worked<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.539> 4:15<00:00:49.260> for

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
benchpress day worked up to 4:15 for

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.020 
benchpress day worked up to 4:15 for
five<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.370> was<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.700> happy<00:00:50.879> about

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.869 
five and so I was really happy about
that<00:00:51.239> that's<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> good<00:00:51.870> improvement<00:00:52.699> even<00:00:53.699> over

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
that that's a good improvement even over

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.430 
that that's a good improvement even over
my<00:00:54.000> last<00:00:54.180> fiber<00:00:54.480> at<00:00:54.690> max<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:55.079> not<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.230> hundred

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
my last fiber at max I'm not a hundred

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.619 
my last fiber at max I'm not a hundred
percent<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:57.329> almost

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
percent what it was but I'm almost

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.130 
percent what it was but I'm almost
positive<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.410> wasn't<00:00:58.590> over<00:00:58.949> 400<00:00:59.430> pounds<00:00:59.820> so

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140

three weeks first two three week cycles
of<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> kingpin<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:26.009> following<00:01:26.880> my

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
of the kingpin and then following my

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.440 
of the kingpin and then following my
squatting<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:27.990> benching<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:30.090> meat

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
squatting and benching up with the meat

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.319 
squatting and benching up with the meat
prep<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.900> I've<00:01:31.020> done<00:01:31.229> before<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.180> that<00:01:33.180> may

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
prep that I've done before so that may

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.609 
prep that I've done before so that may
sound<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.630> confusing<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.290> may<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
sound a little confusing I may do a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.370 
sound a little confusing I may do a
video<00:01:34.860> explaining<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:37.259> not

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
video explaining it but really it's not

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
video explaining it but really it's not
so<00:01:37.500> much<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.790> program

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so much I think about what program

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.210 
so much I think about what program
you're<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.470> about<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:40.979> focus

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you're on but just about what your focus

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.580 
you're on but just about what your focus
is<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.270> my<00:01:42.420> focus<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.049> bring<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.470> my

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
is and so my focus is to bring up my

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.490 
is and so my focus is to bring up my
benchpress<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.780> make<00:01:45.780> sure<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.140> I'm<00:01:46.229> still

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
benchpress and make sure that I'm still

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
benchpress and make sure that I'm still
making<00:01:46.619> making<00:01:47.130> some<00:01:47.310> small<00:01:47.610> or<00:01:47.850> consistent

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
making making some small or consistent

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.149 
making making some small or consistent
progress<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:49.590> squatting<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
progress with my squatting and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.340 
progress with my squatting and
deadlifting<00:01:50.729> you'll<00:01:51.659> see<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.079> finished

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
deadlifting you'll see here I finished

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.800 
deadlifting you'll see here I finished
out<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.950> day<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.490> wide<00:01:53.790> grip<00:01:54.180> kind<00:01:54.689> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
out the day with a wide grip kind of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.560 
out the day with a wide grip kind of
three-quarter<00:01:55.320> rep<00:01:55.530> set<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.880> think<00:01:57.390> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
three-quarter rep set there I think I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.959 
three-quarter rep set there I think I
did<00:01:57.719> 25<00:01:58.049> reps<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.250> pretty<00:01:59.579> happy<00:01:59.850> about

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
did 25 reps so I was pretty happy about

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.800 
did 25 reps so I was pretty happy about
that<00:02:00.119> too<00:02:01.130> what<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.159> wanted<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> speak<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.509> as

that too what I wanted to speak on is as

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.990 
that too what I wanted to speak on is as
I<00:02:03.930> start<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.350> new<00:02:04.560> training<00:02:04.950> cycle<00:02:05.430> just

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000

it's<00:02:15.549> a<00:02:15.640> big<00:02:15.819> accomplishment<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.599> some

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
it's a big accomplishment and some

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.569 
it's a big accomplishment and some

people will never achieve anything like
that<00:02:18.609> but<00:02:19.090> for<00:02:19.120> me<00:02:19.359> I've<00:02:19.750> only<00:02:19.959> been<00:02:20.140> competing

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
that but for me I've only been competing

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.740 
that but for me I've only been competing
for<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.890> year<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.189> a<00:02:21.219> half<00:02:21.400> really<00:02:22.269> didn't<00:02:22.599> seem

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
for a year and a half really didn't seem

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.259 
for a year and a half really didn't seem
that<00:02:22.870> hard<00:02:23.079> for<00:02:23.319> me<00:02:23.469> to<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.829> that<00:02:23.890> level

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
that hard for me to get to that level

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.199 
that hard for me to get to that level
and<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.780> say<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.469> simply<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.459> say<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.849> I<00:02:28.030> have

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
and I say that simply to say that I have

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.649 
and I say that simply to say that I have
more<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.750> expect<00:02:29.170> more<00:02:29.349> from<00:02:29.500> myself<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:30.670> feel

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
more I expect more from myself I feel

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.270 
more I expect more from myself I feel
that<00:02:31.840> I'm<00:02:31.930> capable<00:02:32.139> with<00:02:32.500> more<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.219> don't

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
that I'm capable with more and I don't

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.699 
that I'm capable with more and I don't
think<00:02:33.609> I've<00:02:33.730> peaked<00:02:34.030> yet<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.530> this

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
think I've peaked yet and so at this

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.440 
think I've peaked yet and so at this
point<00:02:35.950> I'm<00:02:36.250> really<00:02:36.370> looking<00:02:36.790> forward<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.690 
point I'm really looking forward to
where<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.049> go<00:02:38.230> from<00:02:38.469> here<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.920> what<00:02:39.489> can<00:02:39.519> I

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
where can I go from here and what can I

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.030 
where can I go from here and what can I
do<00:02:39.760> from<00:02:40.090> here<00:02:40.359> and<00:02:41.200> I'm<00:02:41.409> not<00:02:41.560> focusing<00:02:41.950> on

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
