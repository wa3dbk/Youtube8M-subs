you how to drive animation in After
Effects<00:00:05.310> using<00:00:06.270> an<00:00:06.420> audio<00:00:06.660> clip<00:00:07.049> it's<00:00:07.890> pretty

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
Effects using an audio clip it's pretty

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.390 
Effects using an audio clip it's pretty
simple<00:00:08.460> using<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.849> built-in<00:00:09.150> tools<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:10.400> this

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
simple using the built-in tools and this

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.160 
simple using the built-in tools and this
is<00:00:11.580> also<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.849> short<00:00:12.570> introduction<00:00:13.019> to

is also a short introduction to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.390 
is also a short introduction to
expressions<00:00:14.929> here<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> timeline<00:00:16.650> with

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
expressions here I have a timeline with

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.340 
expressions here I have a timeline with
an<00:00:17.550> audio<00:00:17.789> clip<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.240> if<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.900> look<00:00:19.050> down<00:00:19.289> here

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
an audio clip in it if we look down here

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.599 
an audio clip in it if we look down here
at<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.520> waveform<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.109> see<00:00:22.609> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
at the the waveform we can see the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.790 
at the the waveform we can see the
volume<00:00:23.939> or<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.019> loudness<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.650> the

volume or the the loudness or the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.200 
volume or the the loudness or the
amplitude<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.939> wave<00:00:26.970> form<00:00:27.390> where<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.260> is

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
amplitude of the wave form where it is

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.730 
amplitude of the wave form where it is
where<00:00:30.210> these<00:00:30.300> lines<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.960> farthest<00:00:31.529> away<00:00:31.619> from

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
where these lines are farthest away from

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.430 
where these lines are farthest away from
the<00:00:31.920> center<00:00:32.279> point<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.730> line<00:00:33.140> it's<00:00:34.140> loud

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the center point of the line it's loud

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.560 
the center point of the line it's loud
and<00:00:34.739> where<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.460> kind<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.180> tapers<00:00:36.540> down

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and where it's a kind of tapers down

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.280 
and where it's a kind of tapers down
here<00:00:37.079> into<00:00:37.820> not<00:00:38.820> very<00:00:39.510> far<00:00:39.780> away<00:00:39.899> from<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
here into not very far away from the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.790 
here into not very far away from the
center<00:00:40.649> line<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.160> quiet<00:00:42.050> anyway<00:00:43.050> make<00:00:43.770> sure

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
center line it's quiet anyway make sure

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.180 
center line it's quiet anyway make sure
it's<00:00:44.129> selected<00:00:45.170> go<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.500> animation

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
it's selected go up to animation

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790

keyframes

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.770 
keyframes
this<00:00:51.210> creates<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.930> brand<00:00:52.350> new<00:00:52.530> layer<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.780> has

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
this creates a brand new layer that has

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
this creates a brand new layer that has
a<00:00:54.809> bunch<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.170> keyframes<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.770> I'll<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.399> say

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
a bunch of keyframes in it I'll just say

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.779 
a bunch of keyframes in it I'll just say
D<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.210> all<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.780> keyframes

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
D for all the keyframes

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.110 
D for all the keyframes
actually<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.359> uh<00:01:00.859> yeah<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.789> look<00:01:02.940> here

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
actually if I uh yeah if we look here

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
actually if I uh yeah if we look here
it's<00:01:03.300> an<00:01:03.570> effect<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> effects

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
it's an effect so it's in the effects

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.090 
it's an effect so it's in the effects
and<00:01:05.840> one<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> effects<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.470> both<00:01:07.710> channels

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and one of the effects is both channels

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.789 
and one of the effects is both channels
and<00:01:08.600> as<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> slider<00:01:11.420> channel<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.900> has<00:01:13.140> all

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and as a slider channel and that has all

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.830 
and as a slider channel and that has all
the<00:01:13.950> keyframes<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:15.090> want<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> use<00:01:15.479> these

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the keyframes in we want to use these

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.590 
the keyframes in we want to use these
keyframes<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:17.070> drive<00:01:17.310> animation<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.240> if

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
keyframes here to drive animation and if

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.149 
keyframes here to drive animation and if
you<00:01:18.720> look<00:01:18.900> closely<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> look<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you look closely if you look at the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.230 
you look closely if you look at the
number<00:01:20.640> down<00:01:20.850> here

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
number down here

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
number down here
you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.560> changes<00:01:23.100> based<00:01:23.460> on

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you can see that that changes based on

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.200 
you can see that that changes based on
the<00:01:24.180> loudness<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:26.100> audio<00:01:26.400> track<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.909> when

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the loudness of the audio track so when

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.539 
the loudness of the audio track so when
it<00:01:27.299> created<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.840> track<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it created this track it just kind of

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.469 
it created this track it just kind of
copied<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> amplitude<00:01:30.570> over<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.360> we

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
copied the amplitude over so what can we

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.710 
copied the amplitude over so what can we
do<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:34.250> lots<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.430> things<00:01:35.640> first<00:01:36.509> thing

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
do with this lots of things first thing

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.390 
do with this lots of things first thing
I'm<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.229> drag<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.470> picture<00:01:38.280> in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
I'm just going to drag this picture in

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.840 
I'm just going to drag this picture in
here<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.710> hit<00:01:40.950> T<00:01:41.579> for

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
here and I'm going to hit T for

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.730 
here and I'm going to hit T for
transparency<00:01:42.479> I'm<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> say<00:01:43.530> hey

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
transparency I'm going to say hey

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
transparency I'm going to say hey
wherever<00:01:44.310> there's<00:01:44.579> an<00:01:44.729> explosion<00:01:45.060> let's<00:01:45.689> make

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
wherever there's an explosion let's make

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.149 
wherever there's an explosion let's make
the<00:01:45.990> picture<00:01:46.320> show<00:01:46.470> up<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.860> where<00:01:47.009> there

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the picture show up and where there

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.469 
the picture show up and where there
isn't<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.390> be

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
isn't it will just you know kind of be

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660 
isn't it will just you know kind of be
faded<00:01:49.079> into<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> background<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.490> going

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
faded into the background so I'm going

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.789 
faded into the background so I'm going
to<00:01:50.729> first<00:01:51.689> thing<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to first thing I have to do is I have to

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.730 
to first thing I have to do is I have to
turn<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.520> an<00:01:53.820> expression<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.140> layer<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
turn on an expression on that layer so I

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.420 
turn on an expression on that layer so I
go<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> animation<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.110> add<00:01:58.219> expression<00:01:59.219> so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
go to animation and add expression so

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
go to animation and add expression so
now<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> opacity<00:02:00.240> channel<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.110> an

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
now on the opacity channel we have an

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.709 
now on the opacity channel we have an
expression<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.430> expression<00:02:02.939> says<00:02:03.210> hey

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
expression and the expression says hey

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.760 
expression and the expression says hey
be<00:02:04.320> yourself<00:02:04.799> transform<00:02:05.899> opacity<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.079> you

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
be yourself transform opacity and you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.770 
be yourself transform opacity and you
know<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> dot<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> separator

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
know the dot is the separator

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.950 
know the dot is the separator
we<00:02:10.679> don't<00:02:10.860> want<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.240> opacity

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
we don't want that we want the opacity

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.100 
we don't want that we want the opacity
to<00:02:13.560> be<00:02:13.880> driven<00:02:14.880> by<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.210> slider<00:02:15.600> keyframe<00:02:16.080> so

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
to be driven by the slider keyframe so

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.390 
to be driven by the slider keyframe so
I'm<00:02:16.350> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> grab<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.830> little<00:02:17.010> swirly

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
I'm going to grab this little swirly

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.220 
I'm going to grab this little swirly
thing<00:02:17.580> here<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.150> called<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.720> pick<00:02:18.960> whip

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
thing here this is called the pick whip

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.590 
thing here this is called the pick whip
which<00:02:19.830> makes<00:02:20.070> things<00:02:20.340> building<00:02:21.270> things<00:02:21.450> like

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
which makes things building things like

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.150 
which makes things building things like
this<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.900> After<00:02:22.110> Effects<00:02:22.320> really<00:02:22.590> simple<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
this and After Effects really simple and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.760 
this and After Effects really simple and
just<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:24.180> drag<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.600> slider<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.200> let<00:02:25.560> go

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
just to drag it up the slider and let go

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.050 
just to drag it up the slider and let go
and<00:02:26.010> what<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:27.300> creates<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:28.310> new<00:02:29.310> expression

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
and what this creates a new expression

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.660 
and what this creates a new expression
and<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.540> expression<00:02:30.990> says<00:02:31.170> hey<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:32.340> comp

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
and the expression says hey in this comp

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.150 
and the expression says hey in this comp
that<00:02:32.910> you're<00:02:33.060> working<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.450> now<00:02:33.890> go<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
that you're working on now go to the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.000 
that you're working on now go to the
layer<00:02:35.750> audio<00:02:36.750> amplitude<00:02:37.350> which<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.650> right

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
layer audio amplitude which is right

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.390 
layer audio amplitude which is right
there

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
there

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.670 
there
audio<00:02:39.180> amplitude<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.440> audio

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
audio amplitude and then in the audio

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.430 
audio amplitude and then in the audio
amplitude<00:02:41.220> layer<00:02:41.540> there's<00:02:42.540> an<00:02:42.690> effect<00:02:44.000> an

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
amplitude layer there's an effect an

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.550 
amplitude layer there's an effect an
effect<00:02:46.440> called<00:02:47.600> both<00:02:48.600> channels<00:02:49.170> which<00:02:49.410> is

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
effect called both channels which is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.930 
effect called both channels which is
right<00:02:49.709> here<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.190> both<00:02:50.610> channels

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
right here and in that both channels

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.270 
right here and in that both channels
layer<00:02:51.270> there's<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.600> slider<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:54.540> slider<00:02:54.570> is

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
layer there's a slider and the slider is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.390 
layer there's a slider and the slider is
where<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.370> keyframes<00:02:56.790> come<00:02:57.060> from<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:59.250> a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
where the keyframes come from so it's a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.770 
where the keyframes come from so it's a
very<00:02:59.580> simple<00:03:00.060> expression

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
very simple expression

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.630 
very simple expression
it<00:03:00.930> looks<00:03:01.590> more<00:03:01.800> complicated<00:03:01.980> than<00:03:02.459> it

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
it looks more complicated than it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.770 
it looks more complicated than it
actually<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:04.310> let's<00:03:05.310> say<00:03:05.459> that's<00:03:05.910> great<00:03:06.390> but

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
actually is let's say that's great but

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.360 
actually is let's say that's great but
you<00:03:07.140> know<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> actually<00:03:07.680> wanted<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.190> get

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you know I actually wanted to get

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.990 
you know I actually wanted to get
brighter<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.060> wanted<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.390> get<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.660> 100%<00:03:11.000> 100%

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
brighter I wanted to get to 100% 100%

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.570 
brighter I wanted to get to 100% 100%
when<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.360> full<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.890> I'm<00:03:14.130> just<00:03:14.280> going<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.430> hit

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
when it's full so I'm just going to hit

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.110 
when it's full so I'm just going to hit
the<00:03:14.730> star<00:03:15.209> key<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.780> hit<00:03:16.410> -<00:03:16.830> star<00:03:17.340> -<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.880> means

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
the star key and hit - star - that means

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.830 
the star key and hit - star - that means
multiply<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.830> value<00:03:20.370> here<00:03:20.820> this<00:03:21.450> keyframe

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
multiply this value here this keyframe

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.180 
multiply this value here this keyframe
up<00:03:22.260> here<00:03:22.470> multiply<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.100> by<00:03:23.160> 2<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.980> hit

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
up here multiply that by 2 and I hit

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.610 
up here multiply that by 2 and I hit
enter<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:27.269> inter<00:03:27.540> on<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.080> numeric<00:03:28.590> keypad

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
enter the inter on the numeric keypad

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.009 
enter the inter on the numeric keypad
and<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.340> closes<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.910> out<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.330> as<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:30.870> can

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
and that closes that out and as you can

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.800 
and that closes that out and as you can
see<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.739> opacity<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.220> now<00:03:32.310> 95%<00:03:33.269> instead<00:03:33.660> of

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
see the opacity is now 95% instead of

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.590 
see the opacity is now 95% instead of
with<00:03:34.440> 49%<00:03:34.950> or<00:03:35.400> whatever<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:35.760> was<00:03:35.880> before

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.480 

and<00:03:41.600> that's<00:03:41.780> just<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.230> brightness<00:03:42.710> now<00:03:43.430> we

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
and that's just the brightness now we

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.210 
and that's just the brightness now we
can<00:03:43.730> do<00:03:43.880> other<00:03:44.090> things<00:03:44.210> with<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.780> like<00:03:44.990> say

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
can do other things with the to like say

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.760 
can do other things with the to like say
rotate<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:47.600> keyboard<00:03:48.080> command<00:03:48.290> for<00:03:48.440> making

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
rotate the keyboard command for making

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.800 
rotate the keyboard command for making
this<00:03:48.860> into<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.520> adding<00:03:49.850> expression<00:03:50.360> here<00:03:50.570> is

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
this into and adding expression here is

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.470 
this into and adding expression here is
alt<00:03:51.290> shift<00:03:52.120> equals<00:03:54.190> grab<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.340> pick<00:03:55.550> whip<00:03:55.760> drag

alt shift equals grab the pick whip drag
it<00:03:56.600> up<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.720> slider<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:58.100> now<00:03:58.160> we<00:03:59.060> have<00:03:59.330> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it up the slider and now we have the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.150 
it up the slider and now we have the
slider<00:04:00.200> again<00:04:02.410> just<00:04:03.410> for<00:04:03.560> fun<00:04:03.620> I'm<00:04:03.950> going<00:04:04.100> to

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
slider again just for fun I'm going to

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.330 
slider again just for fun I'm going to
drag<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.060> anchor<00:04:05.600> point<00:04:05.930> down<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.380> bottom

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.100 

now<00:04:10.340> we<00:04:10.400> can<00:04:10.580> see<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:10.820> rotating<00:04:11.000> based<00:04:11.750> on<00:04:11.990> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
now we can see it rotating based on the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.229 
now we can see it rotating based on the
volume<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:15.739> if<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.579> want<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.880> reverse<00:04:17.209> that

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
volume and if you want to reverse that

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.000 
volume and if you want to reverse that
you<00:04:17.720> want<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:17.959> rotate<00:04:18.350> in<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.680> opposite

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
you want to rotate in the opposite

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.530 
you want to rotate in the opposite
direction<00:04:19.130> put<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.579> minus<00:04:19.970> in<00:04:20.150> front<00:04:20.180> of<00:04:20.419> the

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
direction put a minus in front of the

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.500 
direction put a minus in front of the
line<00:04:21.130> minus<00:04:22.130> in<00:04:22.250> front<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.700> expression<00:04:23.360> I

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
line minus in front of the expression I

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.540 
line minus in front of the expression I
have<00:04:23.840> an<00:04:23.930> extra<00:04:24.200> one<00:04:24.230> there<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:27.400> now<00:04:28.400> it's

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
have an extra one there so now it's

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.930 
have an extra one there so now it's
rotating<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.030> opposite<00:04:29.390> direction<00:04:30.910> say<00:04:31.910> I

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
rotating the opposite direction say I

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.940 
rotating the opposite direction say I
want<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.419> be<00:04:32.540> more<00:04:32.720> centered<00:04:33.080> okay<00:04:33.560> I'll

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
want it to be more centered okay I'll

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.390 
want it to be more centered okay I'll
just<00:04:34.100> add<00:04:34.340> 30<00:04:34.820> degrees<00:04:35.210> on<00:04:35.390> to<00:04:35.600> it<00:04:36.040> so<00:04:37.040> now<00:04:37.070> it's

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
just add 30 degrees on to it so now it's

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.980 
just add 30 degrees on to it so now it's
kind<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.700> waving<00:04:38.120> back<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.570> forth<00:04:38.660> in<00:04:38.900> the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
kind of waving back and forth in the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.280 
kind of waving back and forth in the
center<00:04:39.230> as<00:04:39.380> you<00:04:39.440> can<00:04:40.130> imagine<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.930> can<00:04:41.960> make

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
center as you can imagine you can make

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:50.650 
center as you can imagine you can make
an<00:04:42.500> audio<00:04:43.540> needle<00:04:44.540> doing<00:04:44.870> this<00:04:48.520> so<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.820> T<00:04:50.390> let

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
an audio needle doing this so and T let

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.080 
an audio needle doing this so and T let
me<00:04:50.690> on<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.830> opacity<00:04:52.070> I'll<00:04:52.430> just<00:04:52.580> turn<00:04:52.790> off

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
me on the opacity I'll just turn off

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.790 
me on the opacity I'll just turn off
that<00:04:53.390> so<00:04:53.660> that<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:53.990> very<00:04:54.470> basic

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
that so that is a very basic

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.750 
that so that is a very basic
introduction<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:58.180> expressions<00:04:59.180> an<00:04:59.450> audio
