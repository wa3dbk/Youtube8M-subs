more ways to get 50 BP which I think I
think<00:03:01.319> they<00:03:01.410> should<00:03:01.560> add<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> pvp<00:03:02.370> arena<00:03:02.700> every

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
think they should add a pvp arena every

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.199 
think they should add a pvp arena every
day<00:03:03.360> one<00:03:03.989> once<00:03:04.290> every<00:03:04.590> two<00:03:04.799> days<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.340> pvp<00:03:05.910> arena
