00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.440 
red spruce in my opinion it's a more
woody<00:02:52.549> sound<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:54.170> volume<00:02:54.530> may<00:02:54.680> not<00:02:54.890> be<00:02:55.450> more

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
woody sound the volume may not be more

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.259 
woody sound the volume may not be more
in<00:02:56.599> every<00:02:56.870> case<00:02:57.110> than<00:02:57.409> other<00:02:57.709> spruces<00:02:58.700> but<00:02:59.239> I

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
in every case than other spruces but I

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.649 
in every case than other spruces but I
believe<00:02:59.599> that<00:02:59.629> quality<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.440> sound<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:01.659> and

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
believe that quality of the sound is and

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.720 
believe that quality of the sound is and
I<00:03:02.840> like<00:03:03.019> using<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.650> all<00:03:04.159> the<00:03:04.340> guitars<00:03:04.670> that
