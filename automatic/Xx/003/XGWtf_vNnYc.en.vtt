00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.340 

the<00:04:31.830> 1-4<00:04:32.340> 6-2<00:04:32.729> can<00:04:33.419> be<00:04:33.540> really<00:04:33.960> frustrating

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
the 1-4 6-2 can be really frustrating

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.040 
the 1-4 6-2 can be really frustrating
because<00:04:35.040> you<00:04:35.580> need<00:04:35.790> perfect<00:04:36.120> timing<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:36.960> if

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
because you need perfect timing and if

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.690 
because you need perfect timing and if

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
you don't time it right you'll have to

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:53.810 
you don't time it right you'll have to
do<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.940> previous<00:04:39.300> part<00:04:39.720> again

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.880 

this<00:04:54.540> one<00:04:54.920> 4-6<00:04:56.240> 6-1<00:04:57.240> can<00:04:57.780> be<00:04:57.900> really<00:04:58.530> really

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
this one 4-6 6-1 can be really really

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.260 
this one 4-6 6-1 can be really really
frustrating<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.670> it's<00:04:59.760> probably<00:05:00.030> the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
frustrating and it's probably the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.870 
frustrating and it's probably the
hardest<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.780> them<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.140> get<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.410> ball<00:05:01.800> you<00:05:02.790> have

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
hardest of them to get a ball you have

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.120 
hardest of them to get a ball you have
to<00:05:03.060> quickly<00:05:03.660> rush<00:05:04.050> through<00:05:04.350> that<00:05:04.530> area<00:05:04.890> there

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
to quickly rush through that area there

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.390 
to quickly rush through that area there
and<00:05:05.280> then<00:05:05.970> you'll<00:05:06.150> finally<00:05:06.750> get<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.770> this<00:05:07.950> room

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
and then you'll finally get to this room

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.420 
and then you'll finally get to this room
if<00:05:08.730> you<00:05:08.910> turn<00:05:09.330> left<00:05:09.780> at<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.710> fork<00:05:10.920> in<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.220> road

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
if you turn left at the fork in the road

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.720 
if you turn left at the fork in the road
