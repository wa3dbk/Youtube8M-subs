you<00:00:10.590> won't<00:00:10.800> notice<00:00:10.980> any<00:00:11.309> difference<00:00:11.730> hardly

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969

at<00:00:12.059> all<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.990> really<00:00:13.230> want<00:00:13.790> the<00:00:14.790> reason<00:00:14.940> you

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
at all do you really want the reason you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.900 
at all do you really want the reason you
get<00:00:15.360> away<00:00:15.480> with<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.199> because<00:00:16.800> when<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.670> put

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
get away with it is because when you put

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.080 
get away with it is because when you put
regular<00:00:18.270> petroleum<00:00:19.220> in<00:00:20.220> there<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.699> starts

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
regular petroleum in there that starts

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.380 
regular petroleum in there that starts
at<00:00:22.070> 7.5<00:00:23.070> which<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.640> probably<00:00:23.970> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.180> just

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
at 7.5 which is probably going to just

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.990 
at 7.5 which is probably going to just
get<00:00:24.510> by<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> system<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.619> about<00:00:26.279> 10,000

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
get by in the system in about 10,000

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.960 
get by in the system in about 10,000
miles<00:00:27.180> it'll<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:27.750> 8.5<00:00:28.609> because<00:00:29.609> it'll<00:00:29.880> be

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
miles it'll be an 8.5 because it'll be

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.730 
miles it'll be an 8.5 because it'll be
changing<00:00:30.420> viscosity<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.199> temperature<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
changing viscosity with temperature and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740 
changing viscosity with temperature and
oxidizing<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.610> fast<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.270> transmission

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
oxidizing that fast and the transmission

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.870 
oxidizing that fast and the transmission
so<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.620> they're<00:00:34.770> doing<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.219> making<00:00:35.489> sure<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
so what they're doing is making sure you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.930 
so what they're doing is making sure you
start<00:00:36.210> low<00:00:36.780> enough<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.590> band<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.730> it'll

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
start low enough in the band that it'll

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940 
start low enough in the band that it'll
go<00:00:39.059> 30,000<00:00:39.870> miles<00:00:40.079> before<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> would<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.739> too

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
go 30,000 miles before it would get too

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.760 
go 30,000 miles before it would get too
thick<00:00:41.629> Barty<00:00:42.629> had<00:00:42.780> some<00:00:42.930> guys<00:00:43.110> made<00:00:43.320> mistakes

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
thick Barty had some guys made mistakes

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.850 
thick Barty had some guys made mistakes
and<00:00:44.100> put<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.000> Universal<00:00:45.660> ATF<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.379> some

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and put in this Universal ATF and some

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.080 
and put in this Universal ATF and some
of<00:00:46.950> these<00:00:47.039> new<00:00:47.219> vehicles<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.760> never<00:00:47.940> knew

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
of these new vehicles they never knew

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.940 
of these new vehicles they never knew
the<00:00:48.180> difference<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.620> just

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the difference that's because I just

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.920 
the difference that's because I just
does<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.489> break<00:00:50.820> down<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> doesn't<00:00:51.809> get

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
does not break down and it doesn't get

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.569 
does not break down and it doesn't get
thick<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.680> change<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.370> stays

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
thick so if they change it and it stays

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.240 
thick so if they change it and it stays
at<00:00:53.789> 7.5<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> problem<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
at 7.5 that's not a problem but that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.160 
at 7.5 that's not a problem but that
petroleum<00:00:56.699> fluid<00:00:57.090> will<00:00:57.270> start<00:00:57.300> oxidizing<00:00:57.809> see

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
petroleum fluid will start oxidizing see

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.770 
petroleum fluid will start oxidizing see

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
about 900 hours before it hits the end
of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> test<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.530> stopped<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.310> there

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
of the test but they stopped it there

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.570 
of the test but they stopped it there
for<00:01:08.670> their<00:01:08.820> own<00:01:08.850> purposes<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.430> what<00:01:11.430> you've

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
for their own purposes but what you've

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940 
for their own purposes but what you've
got<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.119> what's<00:01:12.630> failing<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> petroleum<00:01:13.770> is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
got is what's failing the petroleum is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
got is what's failing the petroleum is
its<00:01:14.100> oxidizing<00:01:14.670> due<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> temperature<00:01:15.479> during

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
its oxidizing due to temperature during

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330 
its oxidizing due to temperature during
that<00:01:15.960> period<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> raise<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that period and if you raise the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.100 
that period and if you raise the
temperature<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.810> product<00:01:19.280> outside<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
temperature of that product outside the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.719 
temperature of that product outside the
195<00:01:22.110> degrees<00:01:22.350> testing<00:01:22.979> temperature<00:01:23.340> raise<00:01:23.580> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
195 degrees testing temperature raise it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.120 
195 degrees testing temperature raise it
up<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> 205<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:25.080> red<00:01:25.320> line<00:01:25.560> will<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.890> cut<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
up to 205 that red line will be cut to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.429 
up to 205 that red line will be cut to
about<00:01:26.340> one-third<00:01:27.000> where<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> anzo<00:01:28.020> line<00:01:28.229> will

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
about one-third where the anzo line will

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.420 
about one-third where the anzo line will
stay<00:01:28.650> right<00:01:28.799> where<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.100> is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
stay right where it is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.210 
stay right where it is
so<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.840> temperature<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> killer<00:01:32.100> for

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
so the temperature is a killer for

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.880 
so the temperature is a killer for
transmission<00:01:33.000> fluids<00:01:33.360> okay<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.530> let's<00:01:34.829> just

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
transmission fluids okay so let's just

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.530 
transmission fluids okay so let's just
back<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.369> for<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.549> second<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:35.970> talk<00:01:36.360> about

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
back up for a second and talk about

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.179 
back up for a second and talk about
transmission<00:01:37.140> fluid<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.560> what<00:01:37.740> ansel<00:01:38.070> has

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
transmission fluid and what ansel has

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.469 
transmission fluid and what ansel has
for<00:01:38.340> products<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.820> let<00:01:38.880> me<00:01:39.000> give<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.360> of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
fluid for constant CVT is the short term

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.310 
fluid for constant CVT is the short term
we<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.520> no<00:02:14.700> CVT<00:02:15.240> fluid<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:15.870> somebody<00:02:16.170> asks

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320

ask games all about that and they said

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.170 
ask games all about that and they said
hey<00:02:24.740> it's<00:02:25.740> not<00:02:25.920> clear<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> us<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.610> Honda<00:02:27.030> is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
hey it's not clear to us that Honda is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.580 
hey it's not clear to us that Honda is
going<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.360> produce<00:02:27.540> enough<00:02:27.960> CVT

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
going to produce enough CVT

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.140 
going to produce enough CVT

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
transmissions in the United States for

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.390 
transmissions in the United States for
us<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.360> bother<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:31.530> put<00:02:31.680> together<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.980> product

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
us to bother to put together a product

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.370 
us to bother to put together a product
they<00:02:33.240> stick<00:02:33.480> around<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.870> start<00:02:34.080> expanding

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
they stick around and start expanding

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.960 
they stick around and start expanding
that<00:02:34.650> transmission<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.550> more<00:02:35.730> things

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
that transmission and the more things

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.430 
that transmission and the more things
and<00:02:36.150> maybe<00:02:36.330> they'll<00:02:36.570> go<00:02:36.720> look<00:02:36.900> at<00:02:37.050> making<00:02:37.290> a

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
and maybe they'll go look at making a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.350 
and maybe they'll go look at making a
product<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.790> not<00:02:38.940> worth<00:02:39.180> our

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
product for that but it's not worth our

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.490 
product for that but it's not worth our
time<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.660> mess<00:02:39.959> with<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.290> okay<00:02:40.730> alright<00:02:41.730> so

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
time to mess with it okay alright so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.720 
time to mess with it okay alright so
when<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.530> look<00:02:43.830> they'll<00:02:44.190> ask<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.580> lot<00:02:44.700> of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
when you look they'll ask you a lot of

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.250 
when you look they'll ask you a lot of
times<00:02:45.000> people<00:02:45.150> call<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.750> up<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.020> they'll<00:02:46.110> say

the new Mart the new transmission fluid

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.100 
the new Mart the new transmission fluid
that<00:03:09.420> we've<00:03:09.540> got<00:03:09.690> low<00:03:09.840> viscosity<00:03:10.020> okay

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
that we've got low viscosity okay

that we've got low viscosity okay
Ford<00:03:13.110> SP<00:03:13.800> fluid<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.760> was<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.970> problem<00:03:15.300> for<00:03:15.390> us

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
Ford SP fluid that was a problem for us

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.330 
Ford SP fluid that was a problem for us
over<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.750> past<00:03:15.900> couple<00:03:16.140> years<00:03:16.470> that's<00:03:16.739> met<00:03:17.070> by

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
over the past couple years that's met by

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.420 
over the past couple years that's met by
the<00:03:17.880> new<00:03:18.090> transmission<00:03:18.720> fluid<00:03:19.200> if<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.250> hit

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
the new transmission fluid if you hit

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.729 
the new transmission fluid if you hit
this<00:03:20.580> Toyota<00:03:20.940> WS<00:03:21.600> effect<00:03:21.930> that's<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.380> new<00:03:22.530> one

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
this Toyota WS effect that's the new one

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.470 
this Toyota WS effect that's the new one
because<00:03:22.830> it's<00:03:23.100> thinner<00:03:23.370> okay<00:03:23.940> we<00:03:24.150> couldn't

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
because it's thinner okay we couldn't

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.640 
because it's thinner okay we couldn't
meet<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:24.810> one<00:03:24.930> till<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.140> new<00:03:25.260> fluid<00:03:25.470> came

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
meet that one till the new fluid came

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
you to use Dexron six fluid okay but it

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.879 
you to use Dexron six fluid okay but it
should<00:05:54.599> be<00:05:54.720> a<00:05:54.750> dexter<00:05:55.080> on<00:05:55.169> six<00:05:55.470> fluid<00:05:55.770> that

Mo's<00:06:01.220> so<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.340> point<00:06:02.580> is<00:06:02.700> amaz<00:06:03.060> all<00:06:03.180> did<00:06:03.330> a<00:06:03.360> good

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
Mo's so the point is amaz all did a good

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.670 
Mo's so the point is amaz all did a good
thing<00:06:03.570> there<00:06:03.900> for<00:06:04.080> us<00:06:04.139> because<00:06:04.289> they<00:06:04.470> stuck

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
thing there for us because they stuck

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.230 
thing there for us because they stuck
that<00:06:04.860> speckle<00:06:05.190> there<00:06:05.430> so<00:06:05.580> we<00:06:05.700> know<00:06:05.880> it<00:06:06.030> meets

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
that speckle there so we know it meets

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.990 
that speckle there so we know it meets
it<00:06:06.450> because<00:06:07.200> our<00:06:07.380> dexter<00:06:07.740> on<00:06:07.830> six<00:06:08.160> also<00:06:08.460> meets

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
it because our dexter on six also meets

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.409 
it because our dexter on six also meets
the<00:06:09.590> allison<00:06:10.590> transmission<00:06:11.270> requirement<00:06:12.270> so

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
the allison transmission requirement so

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.350 
the allison transmission requirement so
