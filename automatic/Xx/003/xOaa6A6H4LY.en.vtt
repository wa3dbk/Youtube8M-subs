00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.990 
think they have it some people think
just<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.100> they're<00:00:17.310> hitting<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.730> right

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
just because they're hitting it right

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.189 
just because they're hitting it right
they're<00:00:18.330> stuck<00:00:19.460> basically<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:21.390> opinion

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
they're stuck basically in my opinion

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.720 
they're stuck basically in my opinion
there's<00:00:22.439> two<00:00:22.650> kinds<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.160> stuck

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
there's two kinds of stuck

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.700 
there's two kinds of stuck
there's<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.660> stuck<00:00:25.019> where<00:00:25.910> your<00:00:26.910> turn<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.779> out

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
there's the stuck where your turn is out

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.040 
there's the stuck where your turn is out
ahead<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.699> hands<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.390> arms<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
ahead of your hands and arms and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.530 
ahead of your hands and arms and
clubhead<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.550> looks<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.300> is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
clubhead so what that looks like is is

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.600 
clubhead so what that looks like is is
if<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> turn<00:00:34.680> too<00:00:35.040> much<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:36.420> hands<00:00:36.719> drop

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
if you turn too much and your hands drop

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.450 
if you turn too much and your hands drop
everything<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.820> stuck<00:00:39.450> behind<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.460> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
everything is stuck behind you the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.889 
everything is stuck behind you the
problem<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> face<00:00:42.420> right<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.899> my

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
problem that I face right now is is my

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.040 
problem that I face right now is is my
hands<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.590> stuck<00:00:47.039> behind<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:47.730> turn<00:00:48.059> from

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
hands are stuck behind my turn from

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.680 
hands are stuck behind my turn from
holding<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.559> lag<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.070> many<00:00:50.309> years<00:00:50.730> my<00:00:51.300> release

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
holding the lag so many years my release

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
holding the lag so many years my release
is<00:00:51.930> late<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.770> either<00:00:52.920> lock<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is late and then I either lock it to the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.720 
is late and then I either lock it to the
right<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.840> flip<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.280> I'm<00:00:56.610> going

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
right or I have to flip it so I'm going

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.400 
right or I have to flip it so I'm going
to<00:00:56.760> talk<00:00:56.940> about<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.420> kind<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.690> stuck<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
to talk about what kind of stuck that is

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.819 
to talk about what kind of stuck that is
next<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.550> second<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.329> stuck<00:01:00.829> people

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
next the second kind of stuck people

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.290 
next the second kind of stuck people
will<00:01:01.980> say<00:01:02.219> they're<00:01:02.430> not<00:01:02.640> stuck<00:01:03.059> because

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
will say they're not stuck because

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.590 
will say they're not stuck because
they're<00:01:03.660> swinging<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.260> plane<00:01:04.760> but<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
they're swinging on plane but this is a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
they're swinging on plane but this is a
whole<00:01:06.930> new<00:01:07.200> problem<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.799> has<00:01:08.070> resulted<00:01:08.430> from

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
whole new problem that has resulted from

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.080 
whole new problem that has resulted from
the<00:01:09.090> whole<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.659> lag<00:01:10.460> mentality<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.790> what

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the whole the lag mentality is what

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.750 
the whole the lag mentality is what
happens<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.920> perfectly<00:01:14.460> on

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
happens is is you can be perfectly on

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.480 
happens is is you can be perfectly on
plane<00:01:15.290> but<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.979> go<00:01:17.189> wide<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:18.360> narrow<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
plane but if you go wide to narrow and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
plane but if you go wide to narrow and
your<00:01:20.490> hands<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.150> too<00:01:21.570> close<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.080> your<00:01:22.170> body

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
your hands get in too close to your body

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.920 
your hands get in too close to your body
they<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.390> front<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.810> your

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
they can be right out in front of your

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.219 
they can be right out in front of your
turn<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:26.220> plane<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.570> too<00:01:27.840> narrow

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
turn and on plane but you're too narrow

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.740 
turn and on plane but you're too narrow
coming<00:01:28.950> into<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.400> ball<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.939> that's<00:01:30.390> also

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
coming into the ball and that's also

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.240 
coming into the ball and that's also
being<00:01:31.229> stuck<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:34.170> fix<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.220> just

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
being stuck so to fix that one you just

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.700 
being stuck so to fix that one you just
need<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> release<00:01:36.000> properly<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.960> gradual

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
need to release properly that gradual

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.380 
need to release properly that gradual
release<00:01:37.950> i've<00:01:38.340> talked<00:01:38.579> about<00:01:38.700> from<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> top

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
release i've talked about from the top

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.370 
release i've talked about from the top
that<00:01:40.020> will<00:01:40.259> get<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.740> narrow<00:01:41.810> stuck<00:01:42.810> undone

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that will get that narrow stuck undone

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.800 
that will get that narrow stuck undone
and<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.520> know<00:01:44.610> maybe<00:01:44.790> setting<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.420> hands

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
letting your hands set properly instead

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.749
