 already ski episodes both tops 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.579
 as for the last episode I 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.960
 excuse my voice actually I recorded 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.779

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.520
 stride so sorry this mawae a little 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.480
 disgusting is that this game of sick 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:34.140
 short episode important because there we have 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 opportunity my friends to be promoted in 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.750

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.269
 and yes already well managed the end of the seasons 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.610

 joe jimenez once again present us 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 that's like you and ten episodes 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.930
 important because we have three matches 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.629
 and if I remember a victory we 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.350
 are enough to ensure we 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.280
 climb but three victories we sure 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.490
 the title 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 so that's against the current game 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.910
 power still dominate it at the level of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.200
 the possession 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.220
 it was here ie circus guarded 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.830
 many balloons - fall a lot 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.959
 more direct and it pays 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.849
 look from goal to zero thiago silva from 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.860
 the head on a courteous corner that comes out that 

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:24.119
 made the mistake of going out and it was necessary 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.810
 not get out of this rude trap needs to 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.880
 to be faster 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.770
 and now I've thiago silva you 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
 No pressure was alone it 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.970
 simply goal goal to 0 us 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.670
 what a first victory that is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.640
 maquis which is drawn easily you can 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.800
 say lead to the 56th ducasse at the plaza 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.890
 quietly streamer I stop 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.759
 re-accelerating feint strike 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.560

 very beautiful goal but who from whom or 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.530

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.400

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.690
 some very nice zeros that makes it 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.920
 pleasure it gives us three points three 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.620
 points needed for the title of 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.570
 division 2 we have fifteen points 15 points 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.740

 duo of the assured climb in division a 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.209

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.820
 bench i take the barclays team on 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.970
 falls against a nice team 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.540
 again quite happy like 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.090
 with guillaume and hitch and a match 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.590
 complicated complicated to keep from her 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.230
 this action even clichés of this 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.700
 mitsou license joe hart complicated match 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.690
 because parents a lot of action 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.580
 is good summarizes it to be quite short but 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.240
 was a tense match and there ben arfa 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.250
 look up 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.690
 the mic argument with the con it serves all 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.330
 simply go back to abusing purpose 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.590
 perfect the balloon is a bit advanced 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.970
 does that ben arfa is launched at full 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.450
 speed he shoots a magnificent shot 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.810
 left foot 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.550
 it's a goal that's just simple 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.320
 it's not an extraordinary goal 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.690
 the discipline mcs is used as it 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.269
 must yes opt to get back into the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.920
 running left and it's perfect a 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.660
 goal to zero thanks to ben arfa again a 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.370
 once at half time we can see that good 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.590
 I still dominate the shots 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.500
 and possession sign us I lead 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.890
 logically to the score 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.290
 our duo benteke de bruyne down again 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.390
 still good unfortunately it's not okay 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.010
 it's not going well this time but 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.440
 he is often highlighted a beautiful 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.450
 combination the first stop of joe hart 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.310
 has not dried up benteke gives in 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.989
 depth the speed the power the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.820
 strikes once again very nice stop of 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.040
 joe hart 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.920
 when r1 from the client to the head 1 in 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.540
 this team is fellini 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.359
 love on the ring that do not happen to 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.250
 follow right after and that's a lot 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.760
 missed opportunities and we will be done 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.950
 sanction 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.440
 look at this hatch of vertonghen any 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.669
 my defense that tackled it was necessary 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.460
 that Saturday night my players than that 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.800
 take it take my world joe hart to 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.419
 counter-foot equalization the balls 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.860
 clear the balls because there is 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.490
 that was the match lille and win at 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.290
 any price to make sure the climb 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.419
 have reacted with bt who is almost at 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.590
 the late 87th benteke who passes all the 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.970
 world that strikes my left foot I 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.620
 wanted him to have a great forehand 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.130
 unfortunately two players is fine 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.530
 this corner there I hop exchange fire 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.750
 standing in a corner vain returning because 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.850
 I know who is present benteke screams on 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.520
 a ticket from the head and that's it 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.139
 the goal goes on it is taken from the head 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.700
 on corner again benteke 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.280
 that's why I put them in my 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.470
 team play an effective game and ben 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.139
 this is the goal of the head of benteke that we 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.389
 allows the last minute 89th of 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.060
 take the adventure and thus win 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.260
 here are two goals to one the match that we 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.210
 allows us to ascend 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.020
 division 1 so we managed to 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.090
 the internate division 1 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.030
 the next state you'll be the title of 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.550
 division 1 it's a bit more complicated 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.510
 so we have 18 points 6 wins a 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.090
 defeat we have three matches left 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.169
 three matches for the title so I'm 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.150
 said here we are going to play a team 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.940

 7th minute a goal to zero thanks to johnson 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.669
 which does not score a lot of goals 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.959
 how to say I'm not really 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.899
 transcended by this kind for the price that 

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:10.609

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:13.099

00:06:10.609 --> 00:06:14.479
 to lead 1 goal to 0 stop internal fans of 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.869
 strikes I present to the goalkeeper

 here without mercy 1 goal to 0 the goal can 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:20.899
 you stay from this match and get 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:23.059
 pleasure but have been maintained late 

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:24.769

 I should have tried a roulette for 

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:31.489
 may last defender but does not attempt 

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:33.829
 direct hit 

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:35.179

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:37.279
 comment

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:46.099
 in the second half of a drawing 

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:48.109
 ronaldinho alex it's not the most 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:50.359

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:59.779
 but that allows us to lead us 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:02.569
 take shelter clearly at the 89th of 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:05.959
