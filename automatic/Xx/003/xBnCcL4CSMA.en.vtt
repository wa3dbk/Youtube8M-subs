00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.820
 and today I bring you a very 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.870
 simple naruto anime character the 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.549
 game consists of graphically I do not know if 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 It smells to say that I have come but it is very 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.419
 simple what it does and a game to 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.170
 spend time during travel on the bus 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:23.040
 or anywhere do not get too much 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.240
 drift and good to pass the time the 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.280
 link will be in my dropbox account 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.990
 of the game that is not here in the 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.170
 place top 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.829
 the game is around the installation 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.239
 total about 40 megabytes what is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 very little but it is a game that is going to 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.410
 entertain the trips that I play it 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.390
 enough travel to not build 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.390
 so much battery and entertain me 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 the corporal portrays that this game was never 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.250
 finished or are there parts that are going to 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.309
 say commissions approximately but not 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.199
 go never since it was never finished no 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.409
 I would know if according to day he was in the place 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 the whole game would be lying to you but the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.890
 prolonged game that is here can be 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.229
 play a training mode that 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.460
 It is also quite difficult in some 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.680
 parts 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.680
 if we schedule to play is difficult 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.729
 going down in full volume 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.870
 weinberg 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.180
 Blood music sound for effects 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.890
 control it 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.830
 compute transparency 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.480
 together there was no cold I'm going to tell you 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.670
 more to console type 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.770
 I personally a comfortable more 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.190
 referred to the custom by the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.720
 Play Station 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:02:00.820
 looking for many filters 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.820
 and the law and is for example the commission 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.359
 for example a campaign mode that launches 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.359
 has zoom 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.320
 so 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.760
 it's very simple they will tell you what 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.760
 and a lot 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.880
 so they are a little less 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.860
 it's quite simple and entertaining to 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.989
 spend the travel moments but here it is 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.299
 I leave it to you to make the video I wish 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.980
 you liked it and well hopefully position 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.980
