and<00:03:10.540> do<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.989> see<00:03:11.500> if<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.800> could<00:03:13.170> check<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
and do is see if I could check the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.490 
and do is see if I could check the
transmission<00:03:14.890> fluid<00:03:15.430> level<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.750> problem<00:03:17.140> is

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
transmission fluid level the problem is

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.470 
transmission fluid level the problem is
john<00:03:17.920> deere<00:03:18.160> states<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> non

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
john deere states that this is a non

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.110 
john deere states that this is a non
serviceable<00:03:20.230> transmission<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.280> that's<00:03:21.880> what

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
serviceable transmission and that's what

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.050 
serviceable transmission and that's what

the problem is I don't know if I can get
I'll<00:03:58.050> check<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.320> transmission<00:03:59.220> fluid<00:03:59.400> level

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
I'll check the transmission fluid level

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.150 
I'll check the transmission fluid level
without<00:04:00.960> taking<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.470> whole<00:04:01.590> transmission

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
without taking the whole transmission

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.850 
without taking the whole transmission
apart<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.780> what<00:04:03.960> we're<00:04:04.080> going<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.230> do<00:04:04.380> right

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
apart so what we're going to do right

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.610 
apart so what we're going to do right
now<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.580> take<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.910> look<00:04:06.090> under<00:04:06.420> there<00:04:06.620> well

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
now is take a look under there well

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.560 
now is take a look under there well
everyone<00:04:08.100> I<00:04:08.340> did<00:04:08.670> some<00:04:08.820> more<00:04:08.970> research<00:04:09.030> online

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
everyone I did some more research online

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.930 
everyone I did some more research online
and<00:04:10.100> there's<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.190> way<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.400> check<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
and there's a way to check the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.930 
and there's a way to check the
transmission<00:04:12.690> fluid<00:04:13.100> up<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.280> transmission

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
transmission fluid up the transmission

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.960 
transmission fluid up the transmission
has<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.270> be<00:04:15.360> dropped<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.489> what<00:04:17.670> I<00:04:17.700> am

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
has to be dropped and that is what I am

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.200 
has to be dropped and that is what I am
doing<00:04:18.420> right<00:04:18.900> now<00:04:19.730> at<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:20.850> heater<00:04:21.090> going<00:04:23.210> so

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
doing right now at the heater going so

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.730 
doing right now at the heater going so
it<00:04:24.360> looks<00:04:24.540> like<00:04:24.810> we<00:04:25.020> get<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.620> all<00:04:25.710> I

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
it looks like we get to you and all I

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.400 
it looks like we get to you and all I
got<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.040> rear<00:04:26.220> what<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.610> wheels<00:04:26.820> off<00:04:27.380> kind<00:04:28.380> of

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
got the rear what the wheels off kind of

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.570 
got the rear what the wheels off kind of
a<00:04:28.500> pain<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.210> now<00:04:30.950> I'm<00:04:31.950> just<00:04:32.130> going<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.310> figure

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
a pain and now I'm just going to figure

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.400 
a pain and now I'm just going to figure
out<00:04:32.700> how<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:32.910> drop<00:04:33.270> this<00:04:33.450> we<00:04:33.630> got<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.900> undo<00:04:34.170> some

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
out how to drop this we got it undo some

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.660 
out how to drop this we got it undo some
linkages<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.010> then<00:04:35.100> there's<00:04:35.280> just<00:04:35.490> four

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
linkages and then there's just four

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.260 
linkages and then there's just four
bolts<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.360> believe<00:04:37.050> it's<00:04:37.200> just<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.500> u-bolts

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
bolts I believe it's just the u-bolts

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.940 
bolts I believe it's just the u-bolts
holding<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.390> sucker<00:04:39.720> on<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.740> thing

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
holding this sucker on and the thing

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.550 
holding this sucker on and the thing
should<00:04:41.420> smash<00:04:42.420> to<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.750> ground<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.290> then

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
should smash to the ground and then

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.820 
should smash to the ground and then
we'll<00:04:43.740> throw<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:44.070> in<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.280> lake<00:04:48.830> alright

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
we'll throw it in the lake alright

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.030 
we'll throw it in the lake alright

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
tractor here it's hard to see but I did

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.860 
tractor here it's hard to see but I did
not<00:04:59.310> get<00:04:59.580> too<00:04:59.880> much<00:05:00.060> done<00:05:00.330> because<00:05:00.540> I<00:05:00.660> had<00:05:00.780> the

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
not get too much done because I had the

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.170 
not get too much done because I had the
babysit<00:05:01.380> my<00:05:01.530> sister<00:05:02.040> tonight<00:05:02.220> which<00:05:02.730> meant<00:05:03.000> I

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
babysit my sister tonight which meant I

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.220 
babysit my sister tonight which meant I
couldn't<00:05:03.420> really<00:05:03.600> come<00:05:03.810> out<00:05:03.960> in<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.140> garage

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
couldn't really come out in the garage

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.890 
couldn't really come out in the garage
and<00:05:04.350> work<00:05:04.740> for<00:05:05.010> an<00:05:05.550> extended<00:05:06.090> period<00:05:06.300> of<00:05:06.570> time

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
and work for an extended period of time

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.590 
and work for an extended period of time
which<00:05:07.740> meant<00:05:08.040> it<00:05:08.580> really<00:05:08.880> wasn't<00:05:09.060> just<00:05:09.390> worth

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
which meant it really wasn't just worth

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.280 
which meant it really wasn't just worth
it<00:05:09.810> because<00:05:10.020> of<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.440> heat<00:05:10.590> cost<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:12.290> broken

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
it because of the heat cost a broken

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.800 
it because of the heat cost a broken
cost<00:05:14.150> but<00:05:15.150> anyways<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:17.120> did<00:05:18.120> find<00:05:18.420> out<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.570> little

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
cost but anyways I did find out a little

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.850 
cost but anyways I did find out a little
more<00:05:19.050> information<00:05:19.650> on<00:05:19.800> this<00:05:19.950> tractor<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.760> the

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
more information on this tractor and the

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.500 
more information on this tractor and the
it's<00:05:22.860> uh<00:05:22.980> oh<00:05:24.380> crap<00:05:25.380> I<00:05:25.410> forgot<00:05:25.680> tough<00:05:26.160> torque<00:05:26.550> k

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
it's uh oh crap I forgot tough torque k

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.590 
it's uh oh crap I forgot tough torque k
46<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.650> uh<00:05:29.240> I<00:05:31.550> guess<00:05:32.550> these<00:05:32.760> things<00:05:32.820> go<00:05:33.240> after

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
46 and uh I guess these things go after

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.080 
46 and uh I guess these things go after
500<00:05:34.140> hours<00:05:34.440> but<00:05:34.650> this<00:05:34.770> thing<00:05:35.010> happens<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.520> have

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.130 

C<00:05:39.090> here<00:05:39.330> come<00:05:39.540> on<00:05:40.520> 393<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:41.760> it's<00:05:42.510> got<00:05:42.660> about<00:05:42.780> for

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
C here come on 393 so it's got about for

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.530 
C here come on 393 so it's got about for
almost<00:05:43.320> 400<00:05:43.710> hours<00:05:44.310> on<00:05:44.490> it<00:05:44.700> is<00:05:44.970> how<00:05:45.390> it<00:05:45.450> is

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
almost 400 hours on it is how it is

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.830 
almost 400 hours on it is how it is
nearing<00:05:46.200> the<00:05:46.230> end<00:05:46.350> of<00:05:46.500> its<00:05:46.710> life<00:05:46.950> I<00:05:48.110> don't<00:05:49.110> know

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
nearing the end of its life I don't know

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.270 
nearing the end of its life I don't know
the<00:05:51.840> next<00:05:52.050> steps<00:05:52.380> are<00:05:54.110> really<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:55.740> check

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
the next steps are really just to check

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.550 
the next steps are really just to check
the<00:05:56.430> transmission<00:05:56.910> fluid<00:05:57.390> level<00:05:57.420> if<00:05:58.290> that

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
the transmission fluid level if that

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.900 
the transmission fluid level if that
doesn't<00:05:58.860> work<00:05:58.950> it's<00:05:59.220> going<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.640> be<00:05:59.790> an

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
doesn't work it's going to be an

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.360 
doesn't work it's going to be an
internal<00:06:00.300> problem<00:06:00.780> so<00:06:01.500> I'll<00:06:01.620> be<00:06:01.830> posting<00:06:02.070> a

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
internal problem so I'll be posting a

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.240 
internal problem so I'll be posting a
part<00:06:02.640> two<00:06:02.850> to<00:06:03.030> this<00:06:03.090> video<00:06:03.680> tomorrow<00:06:04.680> morning

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
part two to this video tomorrow morning

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.530 
part two to this video tomorrow morning
I've<00:06:05.430> worked<00:06:05.790> in<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.030> afternoon

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
I've worked in the afternoon

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.000 
I've worked in the afternoon
so<00:06:06.630> I'll<00:06:06.720> try<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.050> post<00:06:07.170> it<00:06:07.470> before<00:06:07.770> I<00:06:07.800> go<00:06:07.950> to

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
so I'll try and post it before I go to

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.430 
so I'll try and post it before I go to
work<00:06:08.550> otherwise<00:06:09.480> I<00:06:09.540> probably<00:06:09.930> won't<00:06:10.110> even

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
work otherwise I probably won't even

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.710 
work otherwise I probably won't even
have<00:06:10.560> a<00:06:10.620> chance<00:06:10.920> and<00:06:13.280> that'll<00:06:14.280> do<00:06:14.430> it<00:06:14.600> for<00:06:15.600> this

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
have a chance and that'll do it for this

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.400 
have a chance and that'll do it for this
video<00:06:15.930> so<00:06:16.380> thank<00:06:17.010> you<00:06:17.130> for<00:06:17.310> watching<00:06:17.760> and<00:06:18.410> this

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
video so thank you for watching and this

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.210 
video so thank you for watching and this
is<00:06:19.590> not<00:06:19.800> this<00:06:20.340> is<00:06:20.400> not<00:06:20.670> another<00:06:20.940> phony<00:06:21.390> video

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
is not this is not another phony video

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.840 
is not this is not another phony video
with<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:25.070> transmission<00:06:26.070> going<00:06:26.250> bad<00:06:26.460> this<00:06:26.700> is

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
with the transmission going bad this is

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.900 
with the transmission going bad this is
actually<00:06:27.660> for<00:06:27.870> real<00:06:28.340> it<00:06:29.340> really<00:06:29.670> is

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
actually for real it really is

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.850 
actually for real it really is
something's<00:06:30.720> wrong<00:06:30.960> with<00:06:31.140> it<00:06:31.290> whether<00:06:31.650> it's

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
something's wrong with it whether it's

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.500 
something's wrong with it whether it's
the<00:06:31.920> transmission<00:06:32.550> fluid<00:06:32.880> level<00:06:32.910> which<00:06:33.360> is

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
the transmission fluid level which is

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.940 
the transmission fluid level which is
highly<00:06:34.200> unlikely<00:06:35.720> or<00:06:36.720> not<00:06:36.960> but<00:06:37.410> I<00:06:37.440> thank<00:06:37.830> you

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
highly unlikely or not but I thank you

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.620 
highly unlikely or not but I thank you
