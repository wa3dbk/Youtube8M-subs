00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
a cinder block so you can get a little

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.870 
a cinder block so you can get a little
bit<00:00:15.900> more<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.260> an<00:00:16.350> idea<00:00:16.470> what<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.550> looks<00:00:17.580> like

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
bit more of an idea what it looks like

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.730 
bit more of an idea what it looks like
straight<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.570> measured<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.170> from<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> ground

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
straight I measured it from the ground

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.330 
straight I measured it from the ground
to<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.600> tip<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> fender<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:23.130> about

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
to the tip of the fender and it's about

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.250 
to the tip of the fender and it's about
six<00:00:23.699> inches<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:28.460> right<00:00:29.460> hand<00:00:29.730> side

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
six inches on the right hand side

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.840 
six inches on the right hand side
highest<00:00:31.260> point<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.070> about<00:00:32.279> 10<00:00:32.610> inches

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
highest point there is about 10 inches

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.260 
highest point there is about 10 inches
so<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> there<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> quite<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> quite

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
so you can see it there is quite a quite

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.860 

see<00:01:08.490> there's<00:01:08.760> tons<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.150> room<00:01:09.330> down<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:09.750> on

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
see there's tons of room down there on

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.149 
see there's tons of room down there on
the<00:01:09.960> bottom<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.420> pipes<00:01:12.420> themselves<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.950> down

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the bottom the pipes themselves go down

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.330 
the bottom the pipes themselves go down
way<00:01:14.640> way<00:01:14.940> lower<00:01:15.210> than<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.960> bags<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.190> far

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
way way lower than the bags do so as far

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.109 
way way lower than the bags do so as far
as<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.610> side<00:01:17.880> goes<00:01:19.369> occasionally<00:01:20.369> once<00:01:20.970> or

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
as the side goes occasionally once or

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.670 
as the side goes occasionally once or
twice<00:01:21.330> I've<00:01:21.630> scraped<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.170> tip<00:01:22.440> right<00:01:22.470> there

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
twice I've scraped that tip right there

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.530 
twice I've scraped that tip right there
but<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.550> don't<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.940> bags<00:01:24.150> are<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
but I don't think the bags are going to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.390 
but I don't think the bags are going to
go<00:01:24.660> anywhere<00:01:24.960> near<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.500> point<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> I'm

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
go anywhere near it the point that I'm

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.249 
go anywhere near it the point that I'm
most<00:01:26.759> worried<00:01:27.180> about<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> dips

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
most worried about is because it dips

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.280 
most worried about is because it dips
down<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:28.800> angle<00:01:28.920> back<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:30.690> that<00:01:31.050> on<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
down at an angle back here is that on a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.969 
down at an angle back here is that on a
high<00:01:31.850> steep<00:01:32.850> incline<00:01:33.330> that<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.560> tip<00:01:34.770> there

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
high steep incline that the tip there

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.649 
high steep incline that the tip there

points<00:01:54.720> about<00:01:54.960> eight<00:01:55.200> inches<00:01:55.910> it's<00:01:56.910> probably

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
points about eight inches it's probably

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.560 
points about eight inches it's probably
be<00:01:57.510> a<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.810> bit<00:01:57.900> higher<00:01:58.050> than<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:59.360> if<00:02:00.360> the
