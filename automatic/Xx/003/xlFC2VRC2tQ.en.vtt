00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.640
 hello friends today I have a desire to criticize the playstation 3 begin 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.810
 with the console this huge console looks like an automobile amplifier already 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.160
 that its size is really huge almost the size of a 14-inch TV 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.219
 xd 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.539
 now let's move on to its history 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.789
 is recognized by a wide library of games with original stories but 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.970
 since I discovered that they are stealing ideas I went with everything to this good console 

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:29.230
 almost everyone will know that the sony stole the idea of ​​the game two will play 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.060
 mariko the suns 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.369
 they did not know 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.270
 yes it is true imagine if you had not stolen the idea of ​​this game to 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.930
 microsoft we would be playing or 2 varnished and two in a black xbox but these 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.770
 Sonic spies saw that poking their noses to steal the idea of ​​the game 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.210
 although they changed the idea of ​​the game a bit so that microsoft would not give 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.130
 account but 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.010
 although microsoft 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.510
 he realized and from there began a very strong rivalry between these 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.280
 companies but now the teacher sof highlighted and giving very well their next 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.219
 game releases that's why now we can not see the next ones 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.630
 games of 2013 because all these images and videos of trailers are 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.530
 highly cared for and protected in the microsoft warehouses and in thousands of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.700
 computers this is not all now let's move on to what sony implies and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.509
 playstation 3 after having mocked the control of the wii since 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.150
 it looked like a dildo until it was the dumbest control that existed but oh 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.840
 surprise 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.869
 are already recently took out a control much like the clear wii that you 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.180
 they changed the style of control a little 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.840
 but it is obvious that again they copied from the idea of ​​others this time the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.560
 victim was an attempt that was also criticized by sony according to his 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.410
 games belonged to a very old-fashioned family genre but oh 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.310
 surprise they are reveals that now most of their video games were from a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.909
 genre very similar to that of nintendo that is 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.220
 videogames to play as a family so goodbye to blood and pieces of 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.810
 if you're what we saw on our screens now everything 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.270
 or the one that has a huge lawsuit of being has disappointed since it will have to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.840
 accustom to familiar titles and not so much to the first shots 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.020
 person already blows hahaha are going to fuck for gay hahaha by 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.630
 last let's go to the graphs the graphs of a plenitude is are 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.240
 excellent but are via a fails to exploit these graphics since the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.040
 most of their games are so boring because they do not have so much action in 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880
 their own titles that's why they now seek to copy you microsoft and 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.790
 nintendo but it will not be easy because now everything is protected against these 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.299
 spies that are very good I say goodbye after having revealed these 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.790
 little secrets of the onu and I hope and they are not worth me for saying kiss that xd me for 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.490
 that I'm staying with nintendo since it is a company with unique ideas but there 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.610
 is mario bros the ultimate icon of nintendo till 'see' friends 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.110
 I hope your comments on this little opinion hehehe or what and we 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.700
 we see all this was luis bühler's original idea
