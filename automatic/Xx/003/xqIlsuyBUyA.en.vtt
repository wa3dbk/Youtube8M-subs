00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.140 

when<00:00:25.290> we<00:00:25.440> looked<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.340> RPGs<00:00:26.940> were

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
when we looked at what RPGs were

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.210 
when we looked at what RPGs were
typically<00:00:27.660> classically<00:00:28.440> when<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.770> looked<00:00:29.100> at

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
typically classically when we looked at

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.760 
typically classically when we looked at
terms<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.970> use<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.570> mechanisms<00:00:31.290> they<00:00:31.470> use

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
terms that use the mechanisms they use

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.030 
terms that use the mechanisms they use
the<00:00:32.070> mechanics<00:00:32.700> they<00:00:32.850> use<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.300> felt<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:34.040> we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the mechanics they use it felt like we

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860 
the mechanics they use it felt like we
hadn't<00:00:35.400> grown<00:00:35.700> any<00:00:36.000> since<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> paper<00:00:36.630> days

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
hadn't grown any since the paper days

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.960 
hadn't grown any since the paper days
and<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.170> said<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.580> the<00:00:38.580> computer<00:00:38.940> is

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
and we said you know the computer is

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.370 
and we said you know the computer is
here<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.300> help<00:00:39.420> us<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> computer<00:00:40.080> is<00:00:40.200> here

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
here to help us the computer is here

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.500 
here to help us the computer is here
that<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:41.040> make<00:00:41.250> things<00:00:41.580> easier<00:00:41.879> making<00:00:42.150> more

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
that to make things easier making more

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.150 
that to make things easier making more
streamlined<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.470> kind<00:00:44.100> of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
streamlined and so we just kind of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.770 
streamlined and so we just kind of
systematically<00:00:44.820> started<00:00:45.270> looking<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
systematically started looking at the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.930 
systematically started looking at the
things<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.140> RPGs<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.800> kind<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.040> bothered<00:00:47.850> us

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
things in RPGs that kind of bothered us

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.939 
things in RPGs that kind of bothered us
and<00:00:48.120> annoyed<00:00:48.360> us<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.110> know<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.650> of<00:00:49.680> them

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
and annoyed us and you know one of them

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.740 
and annoyed us and you know one of them
was<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.790> amount<00:00:50.970> of<00:00:51.090> time<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.269> spend<00:00:51.660> in

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
brought to the table we're hoping that

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
brought to the table we're hoping that

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
people will approach it with an open

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
people will approach it with an open
mind<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> they'll<00:01:23.220> say<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:24.299> an<00:01:24.479> RPG

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
mind and they'll say it's not an RPG

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
mind and they'll say it's not an RPG
because<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.500> stats<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.549> an<00:01:26.670> RPG<00:01:26.790> because

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
because I have stats it's an RPG because

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.819 
because I have stats it's an RPG because
I<00:01:27.360> play<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> character<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.350> make<00:01:28.530> roll

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
I play a character and I make roll

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.740 
I play a character and I make roll
choices<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.430> decisions<00:01:29.509> those<00:01:30.509> are<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
choices and decisions those are the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.359 
choices and decisions those are the
things<00:01:30.899> that<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.350> tried<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> distill<00:01:32.070> out<00:01:32.219> of

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
things that we tried to distill out of

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.039 
things that we tried to distill out of
RPG<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.299> think<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:33.719> what's<00:01:33.899> going<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
RPG and I think that's what's going to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.510 
RPG and I think that's what's going to

part<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> reason<00:02:08.220> why<00:02:08.429> we've<00:02:08.640> been<00:02:08.729> able

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
part of the reason why we've been able

part of the reason why we've been able
to<00:02:09.000> achieve<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.410> our<00:02:10.649> goal<00:02:10.830> from

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
to achieve that is because our goal from

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.559 
to achieve that is because our goal from
the<00:02:11.069> outset<00:02:11.430> wasn't<00:02:11.760> necessarily<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.269> make<00:02:12.420> an

the outset wasn't necessarily to make an

components or vice versa rather our main

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.160

goal<00:02:17.489> was<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.970> really<00:02:18.239> wanted<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> immerse<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
goal was we really wanted to immerse the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.600 
goal was we really wanted to immerse the

player within the world of mythological
Greece<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.840> when<00:02:22.290> we're<00:02:22.440> looking<00:02:22.709> at

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
Greece and so when we're looking at

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.990 
Greece and so when we're looking at
features<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.340> things<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.640> probably

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
wanted to put in the game we simply drew

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.960 
wanted to put in the game we simply drew
from<00:02:25.980> those<00:02:26.160> things<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.549> we<00:02:26.640> felt<00:02:26.850> would

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
from those things that we felt would

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.400 
from those things that we felt would
