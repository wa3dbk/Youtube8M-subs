I<00:02:29.980> mean<00:02:30.250> they<00:02:30.400> are<00:02:30.519> bad<00:02:30.849> games<00:02:31.180> by<00:02:31.359> any<00:02:31.569> means

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I mean they are bad games by any means

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.839 
I mean they are bad games by any means
but<00:02:32.140> even<00:02:32.379> by<00:02:32.500> NES<00:02:32.950> standards<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.670> lack<00:02:33.819> of

music<00:02:34.180> gameplay<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.049> skill<00:02:35.290> means<00:02:35.620> they've

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
music gameplay and skill means they've

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.740 
music gameplay and skill means they've

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
big deal and just a thought I think this

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.770 
big deal and just a thought I think this

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.250 
but despite that the game choice is
still<00:03:16.030> pretty<00:03:16.209> bland<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:16.840> if<00:03:16.959> they<00:03:17.049> make<00:03:17.230> a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
still pretty bland and if they make a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
sequel which is very likely seeing the
