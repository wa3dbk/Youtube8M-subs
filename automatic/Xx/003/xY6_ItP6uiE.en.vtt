 since the beginning of 2012 in the factory g bk 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.260
 station base was introduced in 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:18.070
 operation production line is dry 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.800
 pressed paving slabs in 2013 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.980
 year the plant joined the newly created 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.420
 desertion and construction 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.230
 operational management both on 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.820
 the factory and from the dare 655 questions 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.160
 manufacturing process safety 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.430
 tiles paid the most intent 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.559
 attention in the work process involved 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.620
 trained staff led by 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.320
 qualified operator manager 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.180

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.460
 secures the motor grapple to the bridge 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.710
 crane using bridge crane 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.440
 grand screening is loaded into a hopper 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.870
 bulk materials for conveyor 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.120
 ribbon gran sifting moves to skip 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.140
 the new lift is then fed to 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.079
 concrete mixer 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.600
 sand is also poured in 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.119
 receiving hopper by screw 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.889
 conveyor belt is fed to cement dispenser 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.109
 further cement pours into 

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:12.759
 concrete mixer the water is drawn into 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:13.749
 dispenser and then fed to 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.389
 concrete mixer 

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:17.829
 the concrete mixer turns on and starts 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:20.289
 mixing process 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.719
 chemical additive is measured in doses 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.909
 cup filling and in the concrete mixer 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.310
 mixing of raw materials occurs before 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.990
 homogeneous mass after 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.909
 mixing all components 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.399

 vibropress bunker 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.969
 this ends the cooking phase 

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:42.639
 bottom layer for top tile 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.060

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.399
 and fed to the conveyor belt 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.549
 the residue on the sieve is poured into a special 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.840
 the capacity is next followed by all 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.450
 the above operations as for 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.329
 bottom layer for the top layer also 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.700
 used liquid glass add it 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.649
 measuring cups in the concrete mixer after 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.200
 mixing all other ingredients 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.319
 continue mixing until complete

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.379
 add pigment after preparation 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.720
 concrete mix for the top layer 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.849
 it is served on a conveyor belt 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.799
 in the second bunker vibropress 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.739
 then the formation process begins 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.379
