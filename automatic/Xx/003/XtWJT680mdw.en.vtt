00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
actually grilling our steak and what

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.180 
actually grilling our steak and what
you're<00:02:37.959> what<00:02:38.500> you're<00:02:38.620> going<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.799> need<00:02:38.950> for

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
you're what you're going to need for

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.199 
you're what you're going to need for
this<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.340> you're<00:02:39.610> going<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> need<00:02:39.909> a<00:02:39.940> really

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
this is you're going to need a really

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.020 
this is you're going to need a really
hot<00:02:40.480> grill<00:02:40.659> like<00:02:40.900> we<00:02:41.049> have<00:02:41.200> here<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.730> this

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
hot grill like we have here and this

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.270 
hot grill like we have here and this
extra<00:02:43.360> really<00:02:43.599> nice<00:02:43.780> grill<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:45.159> been

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
extra really nice grill and it's been

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.850 
extra really nice grill and it's been
preheating<00:02:45.940> ours<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.720> about<00:02:46.840> at<00:02:47.230> 600<00:02:47.830> degrees

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
preheating ours is about at 600 degrees

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.009 
preheating ours is about at 600 degrees
so<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:48.640> probably<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.390> temperature<00:02:49.870> you

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
so that's probably the temperature you

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.210 
so that's probably the temperature you
want<00:02:50.200> around<00:02:50.470> there<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.830> want<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.069> go<00:02:51.129> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
want around there you want to go to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.920 
want around there you want to go to
higher<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.879> you<00:02:52.299> could<00:02:52.450> go<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.569> little<00:02:52.750> lower

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
higher and you could go a little lower

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.170 
higher and you could go a little lower
or<00:02:53.140> not<00:02:53.319> too<00:02:53.530> much<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.760> what<00:02:54.940> we're<00:02:55.060> going

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
or not too much and so what we're going

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.809 
or not too much and so what we're going
to<00:02:55.209> do<00:02:55.420> now<00:02:55.599> is<00:02:56.200> we<00:02:56.440> have<00:02:56.560> our<00:02:56.709> steak<00:02:56.950> here<00:02:57.280> and

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819

I'm going to use a fork to put it on and
then<00:02:59.409> the<00:02:59.530> thongs<00:03:00.129> to<00:03:00.430> take<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:00.730> off<00:03:00.879> because<00:03:01.090> I

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
then the thongs to take it off because I

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.089 
then the thongs to take it off because I
want<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.569> use<00:03:01.660> two<00:03:01.870> different<00:03:01.900> things<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.739> I

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
was you can check on it maybe once or

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.409 
was you can check on it maybe once or
twice<00:04:08.019> but<00:04:08.410> try<00:04:08.560> not<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.739> keep<00:04:08.980> this<00:04:09.190> open<00:04:09.459> keep

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
minutes but because of the texture of

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.080 
minutes but because of the texture of
the<00:04:25.230> state<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.770> can<00:04:26.460> pretty<00:04:26.640> much<00:04:26.730> tell<00:04:26.850> you

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
the state I can pretty much tell you

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.720 
the state I can pretty much tell you
that<00:04:27.240> it's<00:04:27.390> done<00:04:27.740> it's<00:04:28.740> been<00:04:28.860> about<00:04:29.040> five<00:04:29.460> to

all the juices has seeped back into the
meat<00:04:52.860> so<00:04:53.070> now<00:04:53.190> when<00:04:53.340> we<00:04:53.370> cut<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.670> it<00:04:53.790> won't<00:04:53.880> come

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
meat so now when we cut it it won't come

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.200 
meat so now when we cut it it won't come
running<00:04:54.480> out<00:04:54.660> now<00:04:55.340> we're<00:04:56.340> ready<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.700> cut<00:04:56.910> okay

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
important to remember this steak if you

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.220 
important to remember this steak if you
don't<00:05:02.430> cut<00:05:02.640> it<00:05:02.760> against<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.420> grain<00:05:03.690> which

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
don't cut it against the grain which

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.990 
don't cut it against the grain which
means<00:05:04.500> that<00:05:04.770> you're<00:05:05.130> cutting<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:05.550> against<00:05:05.880> the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
means that you're cutting it against the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.210 
means that you're cutting it against the
the<00:05:06.300> way<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.660> meat<00:05:06.870> grain<00:05:07.410> runs<00:05:07.770> along<00:05:08.100> the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
the way the meat grain runs along the

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.610 
the way the meat grain runs along the
meat<00:05:08.540> your<00:05:09.540> it's<00:05:09.840> going<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.050> be<00:05:10.140> more<00:05:10.320> tough

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
meat your it's going to be more tough

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.000 
meat your it's going to be more tough
because<00:05:11.520> of<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.840> fibers<00:05:13.500> in<00:05:13.620> there<00:05:13.770> so

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
because of the the fibers in there so

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.040 
because of the the fibers in there so
the<00:05:14.520> grain<00:05:14.760> on<00:05:14.880> this<00:05:15.030> state<00:05:15.270> runs<00:05:15.570> this<00:05:15.810> way<00:05:15.990> so

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
the grain on this state runs this way so

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.210 
the grain on this state runs this way so
we're<00:05:16.350> going<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.590> do<00:05:16.710> is<00:05:16.890> we're<00:05:17.070> going<00:05:17.100> to

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.410 
we're going to do is we're going to
start<00:05:17.460> here<00:05:17.640> and<00:05:17.790> we're<00:05:17.940> going<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.150> cut<00:05:18.300> it

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
start here and we're going to cut it

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.950 
start here and we're going to cut it
this<00:05:18.450> way

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
this way

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.890 
this way
diagonally<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:20.460> whole<00:05:20.610> steak<00:05:20.910> so<00:05:21.390> let's<00:05:21.810> get

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
diagonally the whole steak so let's get

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.970 
diagonally the whole steak so let's get
cutting

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.180 

wow<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.490> smells<00:05:25.790> amazing

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.320 

and<00:05:30.190> then<00:05:30.310> in<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.550> middle<00:05:30.699> might<00:05:30.970> be<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.150> little

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
and then in the middle might be a little

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.820 
and then in the middle might be a little
