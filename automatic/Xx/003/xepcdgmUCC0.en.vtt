that uh that went down to 75 degrees in
the<00:03:58.100> night<00:03:58.340> so<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.060> extremely<00:04:02.060> constant

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
the night so this is extremely constant

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:15.490 
the night so this is extremely constant
kinda<00:04:03.350> should<00:04:04.250> be<00:04:04.370> fine<00:04:05.140> he<00:04:06.140> again<00:04:07.000> later

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.180 

it's<00:04:16.500> for<00:04:16.800> 42<00:04:17.580> now<00:04:17.850> it's<00:04:18.780> been<00:04:19.110> on<00:04:19.290> almost

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
it's for 42 now it's been on almost

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
it's for 42 now it's been on almost
eight<00:04:20.489> hours<00:04:20.520> and<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:24.630> thermometer<00:04:29.240> 10<00:04:31.010> 7.6

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
eight hours and the thermometer 10 7.6

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.340 
eight hours and the thermometer 10 7.6
so<00:04:33.210> we're<00:04:33.360> doing<00:04:33.570> pretty<00:04:33.780> low<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.170> had<00:04:34.320> a

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
so we're doing pretty low it had a

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.720 
so we're doing pretty low it had a
pretty<00:04:34.560> constant<00:04:35.100> temperature<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.550> little

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
pretty constant temperature a little

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.160 
pretty constant temperature a little
lower<00:04:35.940> than<00:04:36.060> what<00:04:36.390> we<00:04:36.570> maybe<00:04:36.990> want<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:39.050> see<00:04:40.050> it

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
lower than what we maybe want it see it

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.570 
lower than what we maybe want it see it
takes<00:04:40.470> four<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.830> seven<00:04:41.310> hours<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.610> make<00:04:41.940> yogurt

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
takes four to seven hours to make yogurt

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.700 
takes four to seven hours to make yogurt
leaving<00:04:44.580> it<00:04:44.700> longer<00:04:45.120> makes<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:45.600> more<00:04:45.840> sour

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
leaving it longer makes it more sour

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.620 
leaving it longer makes it more sour
more<00:04:47.190> acid<00:04:47.670> and<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:48.960> like<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.520> so<00:04:50.600> we'll<00:04:51.600> just

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
more acid and I like that so we'll just

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.600 
more acid and I like that so we'll just
leave<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.440> I'm<00:04:52.590> going<00:04:52.920> to<00:04:52.950> go<00:04:53.100> back<00:04:53.370> to

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
leave it and I'm going to go back to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:01.520 
leave it and I'm going to go back to
sleep<00:04:56.420> good<00:04:57.420> morning<00:04:57.930> its<00:04:58.530> tongue<00:04:59.030> it's<00:05:00.530> six

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
sleep good morning its tongue it's six

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.370 
sleep good morning its tongue it's six
o'clock<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.820> i<00:05:03.180> think<00:05:03.420> i'll<00:05:03.600> give<00:05:03.780> my<00:05:03.960> yogurt

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
so it uh dehydrated pretty well and

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.170

see<00:05:33.450> if<00:05:34.200> I<00:05:34.440> had<00:05:34.590> been<00:05:34.620> hurting<00:05:35.220> for<00:05:35.250> heat<00:05:35.700> I

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
see if I had been hurting for heat I

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.200 
see if I had been hurting for heat I
could<00:05:36.690> have<00:05:36.960> put<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.800> microwave<00:05:38.250> over<00:05:38.880> on<00:05:38.970> top

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
could have put the microwave over on top

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.100 
could have put the microwave over on top
of<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.510> burner<00:05:39.780> and<00:05:44.600> kept<00:05:45.600> it<00:05:45.780> a<00:05:45.840> little

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
of the burner and kept it a little

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.540 
of the burner and kept it a little
warmer<00:05:46.560> on<00:05:47.330> super<00:05:48.330> low<00:05:48.480> and<00:05:49.370> that's<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.520> only

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
warmer on super low and that's the only

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.060 
warmer on super low and that's the only
thing<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:50.970> thought<00:05:51.150> of<00:05:51.210> so<00:05:52.020> maybe<00:05:52.380> next<00:05:52.740> time

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
thing I thought of so maybe next time

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.130 
thing I thought of so maybe next time
I'll<00:05:53.340> get<00:05:53.700> a<00:05:53.730> thermometer<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.660> actually

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
I'll get a thermometer to actually

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.680 
I'll get a thermometer to actually
measure<00:05:55.290> the<00:05:55.560> yogurt<00:05:55.830> temperature<00:05:56.690> thanks

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690
