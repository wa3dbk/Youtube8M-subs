rendering whereas the stock one has
software<00:00:46.559> rendering<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.270> makes<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.719> UI<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
software rendering so this makes a UI a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.299 
software rendering so this makes a UI a
little<00:00:49.410> bit<00:00:49.530> faster<00:00:50.309> minutes<00:00:51.270> already<00:00:51.570> fast

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
little bit faster minutes already fast

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.930 
little bit faster minutes already fast

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
there's also ram optimizations extension

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.260 
there's also ram optimizations extension
for<00:00:57.180> performance<00:00:58.699> optimizations<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.940> lot<00:01:00.149> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
for performance optimizations a lot of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.209 
for performance optimizations a lot of
stuff<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> give<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.559> much<00:01:01.980> better
