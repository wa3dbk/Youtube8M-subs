00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
things like that completely new and then

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:19.020 
things like that completely new and then
these<00:03:02.069> thrills

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.850 

very<00:03:20.030> floating<00:03:20.629> music<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:21.200> that's<00:03:21.560> very<00:03:21.739> much

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
very floating music and that's very much

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.740 
very floating music and that's very much
a<00:03:21.980> part<00:03:22.220> of<00:03:22.750> Beethoven's<00:03:23.750> late<00:03:24.079> period<00:03:25.750> that

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
a part of Beethoven's late period that

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.449 
a part of Beethoven's late period that
he<00:03:26.870> was<00:03:27.019> obsessed<00:03:27.230> about<00:03:27.739> these<00:03:27.980> trills<00:03:28.280> I

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
he was obsessed about these trills I

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.089 
he was obsessed about these trills I
sometimes<00:03:28.879> think<00:03:29.110> because<00:03:30.110> he<00:03:30.140> turned<00:03:30.470> deaf

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
sometimes think because he turned deaf

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.949 
sometimes think because he turned deaf
in<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.579> period<00:03:31.790> when<00:03:32.060> he<00:03:32.150> was<00:03:32.180> writing<00:03:32.659> this

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
in this period when he was writing this

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.830 
in this period when he was writing this
piece<00:03:34.420> more<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.540> more<00:03:35.689> gradually<00:03:36.849> and<00:03:37.849> these

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
piece more and more gradually and these

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.349 
piece more and more gradually and these
distros<00:03:39.409> I<00:03:39.620> wonder<00:03:39.920> if<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.189> resonance<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.239> a

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
distros I wonder if the resonance of a

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.809 
distros I wonder if the resonance of a
drill<00:03:41.689> you<00:03:42.439> know<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:42.739> he<00:03:42.859> could<00:03:43.099> feel<00:03:43.640> that

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
drill you know if he could feel that

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.270 
drill you know if he could feel that
more<00:03:44.000> physically<00:03:46.269> but<00:03:47.409> the<00:03:48.409> elevation<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.129> it

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
more physically but the elevation of it

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.710 
more physically but the elevation of it
is<00:03:49.430> fascinating<00:03:51.190> it's<00:03:52.190> it's<00:03:53.180> an<00:03:53.299> incredible

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
is fascinating it's it's an incredible

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.990 
is fascinating it's it's an incredible
piece<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.379> has<00:03:54.590> so<00:03:54.799> many<00:03:54.920> modern<00:03:55.519> sounds

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
piece and it has so many modern sounds

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.990 
piece and it has so many modern sounds
so<00:03:56.329> much<00:03:56.480> pointing<00:03:57.109> to<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.319> future<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.970> I

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
so much pointing to the future that I

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.479 
so much pointing to the future that I
think<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.389> really<00:03:59.420> fits<00:03:59.659> within<00:04:00.230> an<00:04:00.560> oh<00:04:01.310> hi

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
think it really fits within an oh hi

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.879 
think it really fits within an oh hi
