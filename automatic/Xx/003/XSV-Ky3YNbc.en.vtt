the<00:00:42.329> jump<00:00:42.600> height<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.670> also<00:00:44.670> very<00:00:45.180> well

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the jump height here also very well

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that the first two screens just

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.779 
that the first two screens just
introduced<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> gimmick<00:00:52.860> no<00:00:53.250> enemies<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789

see<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.379> Buster<00:00:58.739> now<00:00:58.859> has<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.100> little

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
see that the Buster now has a little

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.479 
see that the Buster now has a little
pushback<00:00:59.760> effect<00:01:00.420> which<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.739> both<00:01:02.129> times

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
pushback effect which is at both times

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.250 
pushback effect which is at both times
more<00:01:02.850> relevant<00:01:03.300> than<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.989> less

relevant than you chink think most of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.149 
relevant than you chink think most of
the<00:01:06.570> time<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.960> actually<00:01:07.110> does<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.710> matter<00:01:07.920> too

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the time it actually does not matter too

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
the time it actually does not matter too
much<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.880> pushed<00:01:09.330> back<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.619> there

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
much just pushed back a little but there

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.609 
much just pushed back a little but there
are<00:01:10.950> pretty<00:01:11.820> tricky<00:01:12.180> jumping<00:01:12.630> passages<00:01:13.229> where

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
are pretty tricky jumping passages where

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.190 
are pretty tricky jumping passages where
you<00:01:14.010> actually<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.090> hold<00:01:15.330> off<00:01:15.509> charging

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you actually want to hold off charging

in order to not with your terms it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
in order to not with your terms it
is<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.619> judgement<00:01:20.040> call<00:01:20.070> which<00:01:20.520> works<00:01:20.880> very

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
is a judgement call which works very

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.210 
is a judgement call which works very

affair it is not like in megaman 5 you
could<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.790> bust<00:01:27.030> everything<00:01:27.630> you've<00:01:27.780> def

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
there is one more later on not so much

there is one more later on not so much
in<00:02:33.560> other<00:02:33.710> stages<00:02:35.860> was<00:02:36.860> making<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.340> wind<00:02:37.550> and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
in other stages was making the wind and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.840 
in other stages was making the wind and
do<00:02:38.390> my<00:02:38.570> work<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:38.840> me<00:02:39.080> now<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:40.340> nasty

do my work for me now this nasty
situation<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.450> easily<00:02:41.750> be<00:02:41.840> avoided<00:02:41.900> by<00:02:42.230> just

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
situation can easily be avoided by just

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.680 
situation can easily be avoided by just
holding<00:02:42.680> right<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.430> were<00:02:43.580> always<00:02:44.090> worse<00:02:44.360> I

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
holding right to were always worse I

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.810 
holding right to were always worse I
don't<00:02:45.680> know<00:02:45.860> if<00:02:45.980> there<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.280> anything<00:02:46.520> hidden

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
don't know if there is anything hidden

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.910 
don't know if there is anything hidden
down<00:02:47.090> humid<00:02:47.540> seems<00:02:47.810> like<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.050> prime<00:02:48.380> spot<00:02:48.590> but

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
down humid seems like a prime spot but

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.410 
down humid seems like a prime spot but
I've<00:02:49.070> never<00:02:49.220> been<00:02:49.430> voting<00:02:49.790> for<00:02:49.940> anything<00:02:50.180> at

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
I've never been voting for anything at

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.440 
I've never been voting for anything at
this<00:02:50.540> point<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:51.170> I'll<00:02:51.980> pour<00:02:52.310> yourself<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:53.330> is

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
this point so I'll pour yourself this is

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.330 
this point so I'll pour yourself this is
an<00:02:53.600> interesting<00:02:53.990> thing<00:02:54.410> here<00:02:54.740> because<00:02:55.130> you

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
an interesting thing here because you

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.150 
an interesting thing here because you
can<00:02:55.640> easily<00:02:55.970> farm<00:02:56.540> these<00:02:56.870> obviously<00:02:57.740> because

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
can easily farm these obviously because

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.840 
can easily farm these obviously because
they<00:02:58.400> really<00:02:58.790> quickly<00:02:59.120> respawn<00:02:59.630> I<00:03:00.490> never<00:03:01.490> farm

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
they really quickly respawn I never farm

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.340 
they really quickly respawn I never farm
in<00:03:02.000> these<00:03:02.150> games<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.720> don't<00:03:03.080> know<00:03:03.320> how

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
in these games so I don't know how

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.030 
in these games so I don't know how
efficient<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.130> really<00:03:04.460> is<00:03:04.730> however<00:03:05.770> next<00:03:06.770> part

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
efficient it really is however next part

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.010 
efficient it really is however next part
is<00:03:07.130> kind<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.460> awkward<00:03:07.670> because<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.450> have<00:03:08.810> to

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
is kind of awkward because you have to

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.020 
is kind of awkward because you have to
let<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.350> mouse<00:03:09.650> jump<00:03:09.980> over<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.490> then<00:03:10.760> back

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
let this mouse jump over and then back

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.670 
let this mouse jump over and then back
again<00:03:11.210> otherwise<00:03:11.630> he<00:03:11.930> will<00:03:12.080> knock<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.500> down

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
again otherwise he will knock you down

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.880 
again otherwise he will knock you down
up<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.130> ladder<00:03:13.670> which<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.090> found<00:03:14.330> upon<00:03:14.630> and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
up the ladder which is found upon and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.500 
up the ladder which is found upon and
also<00:03:15.890> this<00:03:16.070> one<00:03:16.280> here<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.550> easier<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:17.300> do

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
also this one here is easier so I do

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.910 
also this one here is easier so I do
think<00:03:17.720> their<00:03:17.960> positions<00:03:18.440> should<00:03:18.560> have<00:03:18.710> been

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
think their positions should have been

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.330 
think their positions should have been
swapped<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.670> make<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.940> logical<00:03:20.510> progression

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
swapped to make a logical progression

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.740 
swapped to make a logical progression
say<00:03:22.340> hello<00:03:22.520> to<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.760> only<00:03:23.120> rooms<00:03:23.330> in<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.600> game

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
say hello to the only rooms in the game

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.050 
say hello to the only rooms in the game
with<00:03:23.900> water<00:03:24.460> strangely<00:03:25.460> enough<00:03:25.520> also

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
with water strangely enough also

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.030 
with water strangely enough also
unfortunately<00:03:26.750> nuff<00:03:27.020> because<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.650> Buster

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
unfortunately nuff because the Buster

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.420 
unfortunately nuff because the Buster
knockback<00:03:28.430> really<00:03:28.760> shows<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.300> you<00:03:30.020> see<00:03:30.260> if<00:03:31.250> I

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
knockback really shows you you see if I

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.160 
knockback really shows you you see if I
fire<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:31.700> up<00:03:31.940> on<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.330> water<00:03:32.510> then<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:32.960> will

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
fire it up on the water then you will

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.140 
fire it up on the water then you will
actually<00:03:33.380> jump<00:03:33.920> this<00:03:34.430> can<00:03:34.790> trip<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.120> up

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
actually jump this can trip you up

and<00:05:24.190> quantum<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.310> going<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.610> expand<00:05:25.940> on<00:05:26.030> it

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
and quantum is going to expand on it

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.180 
and quantum is going to expand on it
even<00:05:26.479> more<00:05:26.750> but<00:05:27.020> that's<00:05:27.229> for<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.590> next<00:05:27.770> game

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
even more but that's for the next game

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.990 
even more but that's for the next game
of<00:05:28.430> course<00:05:28.900> also<00:05:29.900> we<00:05:30.050> get<00:05:30.310> brush<00:05:31.310> coil<00:05:31.640> here

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
of course also we get brush coil here

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.630 
of course also we get brush coil here
again<00:05:32.840> it<00:05:33.050> shows<00:05:33.229> it<00:05:33.440> off<00:05:33.560> rather<00:05:33.919> nicely<00:05:34.280> with

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
again it shows it off rather nicely with

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.430 
again it shows it off rather nicely with
a<00:05:34.669> very<00:05:34.940> nice<00:05:35.150> steel<00:05:35.450> frame<00:05:35.750> all<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.290> parts

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
a very nice steel frame all the parts

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.800 
a very nice steel frame all the parts
are<00:05:36.740> in<00:05:36.890> place<00:05:37.130> and<00:05:37.400> we're<00:05:38.300> going<00:05:38.479> to<00:05:38.510> put<00:05:38.720> it

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
are in place and we're going to put it

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.920 
are in place and we're going to put it
to<00:05:38.930> good<00:05:38.960> use<00:05:39.169> again<00:05:39.860> as<00:05:40.550> this<00:05:41.000> will<00:05:41.540> lead<00:05:41.750> us

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
to good use again as this will lead us

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.750 
to good use again as this will lead us
to<00:05:42.140> lots<00:05:42.410> of<00:05:42.590> goodies<00:05:42.800> later<00:05:43.100> on<00:05:43.340> this<00:05:43.520> stage

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
to lots of goodies later on this stage

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.380 
to lots of goodies later on this stage
is<00:05:43.910> definitely<00:05:44.540> there<00:05:44.720> to<00:05:44.870> be<00:05:44.990> taken<00:05:45.350> early<00:05:46.390> we

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
is definitely there to be taken early we

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.060 
is definitely there to be taken early we
can<00:05:47.630> after<00:05:47.870> each<00:05:48.110> today's<00:05:48.440> go<00:05:48.650> to<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.919> lab

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
can after each today's go to the lab

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.230 
can after each today's go to the lab
which<00:05:49.310> is<00:05:49.340> kind<00:05:49.640> of<00:05:49.700> pointless<00:05:49.910> because

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
which is kind of pointless because

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.450 
which is kind of pointless because
select<00:05:50.750> does<00:05:50.930> it<00:05:51.080> too<00:05:51.260> for<00:05:51.440> us<00:05:51.590> but<00:05:51.830> anyway

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
select does it too for us but anyway

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.610 
select does it too for us but anyway
this<00:05:53.060> was<00:05:53.240> Simon<00:05:53.660> and<00:05:53.810> thank<00:05:54.140> you<00:05:54.229> very<00:05:54.260> much

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
this was Simon and thank you very much

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.370 
this was Simon and thank you very much
for<00:05:54.830> your<00:05:55.310> attention
