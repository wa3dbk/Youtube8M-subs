moist or soft or delicious basically as

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.380 
moist or soft or delicious basically as

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
when use individual pieces like that's

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.780 
when use individual pieces like that's
just<00:05:13.660> softer<00:05:14.200> and<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.410> breading<00:05:15.160> clear<00:05:15.400> coats

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
just softer and the breading clear coats

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.300 
just softer and the breading clear coats
it<00:05:16.000> whereas<00:05:16.330> here<00:05:16.720> only<00:05:17.290> covers<00:05:17.620> like<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.980> top

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
it whereas here only covers like the top

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.510 
it whereas here only covers like the top
and<00:05:18.670> bottom<00:05:19.360> not<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.780> sides<00:05:20.170> see<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:21.340> let's

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
and bottom not the sides see so let's

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.390 
and bottom not the sides see so let's
braiding<00:05:22.090> less<00:05:22.660> moisture<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.530> would<00:05:24.040> say<00:05:24.220> this

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
braiding less moisture I would say this

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.070 
braiding less moisture I would say this
is<00:05:24.700> a<00:05:24.730> 3.7<00:05:25.660> no<00:05:26.050> 3.5<00:05:26.860> this<00:05:27.310> is<00:05:27.430> kind<00:05:27.610> of<00:05:27.640> generic

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
is a 3.7 no 3.5 this is kind of generic

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.280 
is a 3.7 no 3.5 this is kind of generic
after<00:05:29.080> your<00:05:29.290> great<00:05:29.440> still<00:05:30.190> worth<00:05:30.460> buying<00:05:31.290> but

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
after your great still worth buying but

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.560 
after your great still worth buying but
I<00:05:32.470> do<00:05:32.590> think<00:05:32.980> the<00:05:33.280> popcorn<00:05:34.090> chicken<00:05:34.240> is<00:05:34.420> worth

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
I do think the popcorn chicken is worth

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.320 
I do think the popcorn chicken is worth
it<00:05:34.750> more<00:05:36.330> so<00:05:38.520> both<00:05:39.520> hungry<00:05:39.730> man's<00:05:39.970> are<00:05:40.150> good

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
it more so both hungry man's are good

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.530 
it more so both hungry man's are good
but<00:05:41.230> um<00:05:41.880> just<00:05:42.880> think<00:05:43.120> about<00:05:43.150> what<00:05:43.300> you're

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
but um just think about what you're

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.230 
but um just think about what you're
getting<00:05:43.780> okay<00:05:44.050> inside<00:05:44.890> for<00:05:45.070> yourself<00:05:45.370> okay<00:05:45.910> um

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
getting okay inside for yourself okay um

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.060 
getting okay inside for yourself okay um
so<00:05:47.070> like<00:05:48.070> Zagar<00:05:48.550> said<00:05:49.169> um<00:05:50.169> I<00:05:50.230> would<00:05:50.590> probably

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
so like Zagar said um I would probably

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.430 
so like Zagar said um I would probably
not<00:05:51.430> rate<00:05:51.760> this<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.210> highest<00:05:53.640> 3.5<00:05:54.640> a<00:05:54.760> vest

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
not rate this the highest 3.5 a vest

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.519 
not rate this the highest 3.5 a vest
like<00:05:56.440> he<00:05:57.100> was<00:05:57.250> saying<00:05:57.400> that<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.760> corn<00:05:58.030> was<00:05:58.090> bad

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:58.529

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:01.909 
like he was saying that the corn was bad
a kind<00:05:59.519> of<00:05:59.579> not<00:05:59.969> good<00:06:00.359> not<00:06:00.389> sweet<00:06:01.049> the<00:06:01.649> brownie

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
a kind of not good not sweet the brownie

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.149
