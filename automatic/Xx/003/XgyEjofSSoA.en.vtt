00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.269
 table tennis is missing 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.799
 Hebel I have one today 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.150
 brought new training partner and 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.990
 Although the steffen plays in us 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.820
 the second team is just starting 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.140
 even before, it's best not to 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.930
 why I introduce you here 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.220
 yes my name of the steffen art again yes 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.420
 did not say plays here in the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.289
 second team in the first 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.539
 Circle class in the middle there I have 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.420
 an easy one in the current season 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:40.280
 negative balance and have played 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.989
 currently about 1400 points how is it 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.350
 describe a style of play so what 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.479
 would have to implement a game in the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.429
 game I try relatively offensively too 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.260
 play 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:55.429
 but unfortunately I do not always succeed 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.460
 because I make a lot of mistakes in 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.559
 my game and that's what I'm trying 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.510
 to bring out 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.400
 so i can confirm if you join 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.229
 I also train us when 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.049
 we'll go higher that pace there 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.040
 actually always look very good 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.350
 you might think you can too 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.820
 few classes play higher but me 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 train here on Thursdays sometimes 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.390
 my customers and you always with them 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.520
 an eye if you have the home team 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.799
 and then you notice that you have the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.899
 light balls or slow pictures often 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.189
 that he would have to open then was 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.469
 I would have to open in front of everything 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.039
 would certainly have to open in the first 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.710
 circular class 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.350
 that often takes fast mistakes happen 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.450
 or simple many also just in 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.179
 , the front and opening I find in 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.979
 In any case, you have to be stronger 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.119
 be quiet 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.740
 yes, and we thought about that 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.420
 just a complete unit for 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.829
 to document you for before and are tops 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.079
 but of course I have too 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.259
 read comments and so on 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.670
 bit the feedback summarized 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.740
 you have to say very clearly that the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.810
 game analyzes in the last time completely 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.859
 clearly have missed and that you are 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.869
 you also wanted the development 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.609
 to see because I actually so far 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.679
 always only individual video topics made 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.539
 and that's why we have now 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.330
 really intense unity made 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.460
 especially for the front and top 10 we have 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.660
 we then only times the error sources 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.120
 what he ever looked at then 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.860
 You can improve and you could exercise 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.800
 to overlook that it got better 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.560
 just the last exercises were real 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.550
 often done with big ones 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.080
 definitely be interested if the 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.430
 things arrive well if you like that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.410
 I would be interested too 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.150
 Imagine that we are in the summer break 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.920
 to do some other topics and what 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.570
 that I will continue to do the steffen 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.030
 accompany him also regularly in the 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.810
 videos here may also show 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.810
 few other games 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.340
 and then better again 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.410
 find everything and above all last 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.540
 battle are interesting what he is there 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.130
 still does and whether he is right there 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:10.330
 balls are still in the body 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:10.330
 shift take away
