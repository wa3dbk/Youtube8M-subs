00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.110 

ironic<00:04:48.010> honestly<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.220> thought<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.610> day<00:04:49.760> that

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
ironic honestly the thought the day that

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.840 
ironic honestly the thought the day that
I<00:04:50.270> was<00:04:50.450> gonna<00:04:50.600> be<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.900> in<00:04:51.139> the<00:04:51.169> last<00:04:51.380> place<00:04:51.850> and

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
I was gonna be the in the last place and

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.100 
I was gonna be the in the last place and
like<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.120> said<00:04:53.180> there<00:04:53.480> are<00:04:53.540> feeling<00:04:53.960> bored

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
like I said there are feeling bored

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.780 
like I said there are feeling bored
because<00:04:56.020> if<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.560> when<00:04:58.070> you're<00:04:58.250> creating<00:04:58.550> your

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
because if you when you're creating your

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.150 
because if you when you're creating your
race<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.360> if<00:04:59.870> you<00:04:59.990> have<00:05:00.200> some<00:05:00.500> track<00:05:00.740> points

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
race and if you have some track points

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.110 
race and if you have some track points
that<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.210> haven't<00:05:02.540> used<00:05:02.690> in<00:05:02.950> your<00:05:03.950> race<00:05:04.160> so

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
that you haven't used in your race so

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.860 
that you haven't used in your race so
it's<00:05:05.540> it's<00:05:06.320> way<00:05:06.770> better<00:05:06.950> to<00:05:07.160> use<00:05:07.850> them<00:05:08.150> in<00:05:08.660> a

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
it's it's way better to use them in a

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.620 
it's it's way better to use them in a
straight<00:05:09.140> line<00:05:09.169> or<00:05:10.010> whatever<00:05:10.480> because<00:05:11.480> you

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
straight line or whatever because you

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.070 
straight line or whatever because you
would<00:05:11.750> get<00:05:11.960> way<00:05:12.440> more<00:05:14.350> XP<00:05:15.350> RP<00:05:16.250> in<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:16.580> case

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
would get way more XP RP in this case

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
would get way more XP RP in this case
