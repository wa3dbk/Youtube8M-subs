00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.210
 It is a knife designed in conjunction 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.009
 with sniper plate words a small 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.960
 cutlery company and on the play 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.670
 show the representatives of mouths are 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.950
 They approached the stand and were offered 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.530
 produce a knife based on a design 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.350
 own that they held that it was the s1 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.000
 well poker was born plus that 2 has a 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.980
 sheet 4 inches long in a 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.980
 unfolded set that has little 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.470
 more than 8 inches the steel is 4 46 and the 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.420
 finished is this more bath with stones 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.279
 that you have finished extraordinary that 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.170
 it is best appreciated on such a wide sheet 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.690
 how is the advantage is that being a 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.210
 finished so rustic and industrial avoids 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.460
 that the natural deterioration of the use is noticed 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.379
 the grinding is flat of almost all the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.319
 width of the sheet and the design is world 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.389
 clive modified with a slight edge 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:49.429
 I personally prefer the 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.589
 curved sheets because they behave a lot 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.420
 better on the roof and in conjunction with 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.449
 this wide sheet and the plane frosting 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.979
 threw a knife out of a job 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.139
 extraordinary according to sniper plate works 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.999
 it is a tactical and working knife but 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:03.649
 I honestly do not see any way in the 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.930
 that can be tactical because it does not 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.490
 It has a tip located directly on 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.350
 the pushbutton shaft and has 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.450
 a very large wolf that prevents the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.570
 penetration but in exchange for that it 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.070
 get an exceptional worksheet 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.630
 utilitarian one thing to highlight is the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.790
 distance that this knife has between the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.500
 edge and the mechanism because it allows 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.840
 cut food avoiding the most 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.030
 dirty the mechanism the handle is long 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.220
 and comfortable what allows to do it with 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.960
 ease and safety is very comfortable to 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.179
 despite the edges and straight lines 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.399
 the gun grip and the ramp for the 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.289
 thumb contribute substantially in the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.509
 razor ergonomics opens with a lot 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.979
 authority and it's very easy to open up to 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.690
 principle is a bit tight the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.490
 mechanism but over time it becomes 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.200
 much more agile also has some 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.000
 work details in the launcher that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.100
 support the aesthetic of the knife and that 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.110
 also the launcher as in other knives 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.209
 allows it to bend like a handguard 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.549
 in deployed is a knife of a 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.860
 unparalleled aesthetics with many details 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.229
 very good quality materials and a 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.110
 excellent design that guarantees the one that 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.090
 give you the greatest possible use which is what 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.009
 we all expect from our knife so 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.209
 less than daily land use 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.209
 adventure thank you very much
