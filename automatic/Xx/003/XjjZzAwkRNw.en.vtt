the<00:00:03.380> ice<00:00:03.650> is<00:00:04.009> melting<00:00:05.830> the<00:00:06.830> seas<00:00:07.129> are<00:00:07.459> rising

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.020 
the ice is melting the seas are rising

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.450 
the ice is melting the seas are rising
little<00:00:09.020> by<00:00:09.140> little<00:00:09.410> in<00:00:09.650> most<00:00:09.980> parts<00:00:10.340> of<00:00:10.400> the

little by little in most parts of the

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.169 
little by little in most parts of the
world<00:00:10.519> the<00:00:11.090> ocean<00:00:11.540> is<00:00:11.690> overtaking<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:12.559> land

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:13.179 
world the ocean is overtaking the land

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.759 
world the ocean is overtaking the land
most<00:00:14.179> of<00:00:14.420> us<00:00:14.509> don't<00:00:14.719> think<00:00:14.839> much<00:00:15.259> about<00:00:15.290> sea

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
most of us don't think much about sea

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.740 
most of us don't think much about sea
level<00:00:15.920> rise<00:00:16.100> but<00:00:16.790> it's<00:00:16.970> one<00:00:17.150> of<00:00:17.180> the<00:00:17.330> biggest

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
level rise but it's one of the biggest

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.599 
level rise but it's one of the biggest
signs<00:00:18.050> that<00:00:18.350> humans<00:00:18.830> are<00:00:19.010> affecting<00:00:19.340> the

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
signs that humans are affecting the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.179 
signs that humans are affecting the
Earth's<00:00:19.820> climate<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:20.660> it's<00:00:21.470> something<00:00:21.890> worth

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
Earth's climate and it's something worth

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.990 
Earth's climate and it's something worth
watching<00:00:23.080> so<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.199> big<00:00:24.439> question<00:00:24.680> is<00:00:25.189> are<00:00:25.430> we

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
watching so the big question is are we

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.169 
watching so the big question is are we
facing<00:00:26.269> a<00:00:26.599> doom<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.080> gloom<00:00:27.199> scenario<00:00:28.179> then

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
facing a doom and gloom scenario then

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.839 
facing a doom and gloom scenario then
two<00:00:29.599> things<00:00:29.810> happen<00:00:30.260> to<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:30.590> ocean<00:00:30.949> one<00:00:31.670> is

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
two things happen to the ocean one is

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.010 
two things happen to the ocean one is
that<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.180> temperature<00:00:32.630> of<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.810> water

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
that the temperature of the water

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.680 
that the temperature of the water
increases<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.980> as<00:00:34.190> that<00:00:34.460> happens<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.480> water

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
increases and as that happens the water

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.040 
increases and as that happens the water
actually<00:00:36.100> expands<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.280> takes<00:00:37.520> up<00:00:37.700> more<00:00:37.880> room

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
actually expands and takes up more room

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.510 
actually expands and takes up more room
the<00:00:39.050> other<00:00:39.170> thing<00:00:39.380> that<00:00:39.410> happens<00:00:39.800> is<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.040> ice

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
the other thing that happens is that ice

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.420 
the other thing that happens is that ice
that<00:00:40.580> was<00:00:41.120> on<00:00:41.360> land<00:00:41.660> in<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.290> form<00:00:42.560> of<00:00:42.800> glaciers

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
that was on land in the form of glaciers

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.150 
that was on land in the form of glaciers
and<00:00:43.730> ice<00:00:43.910> sheets<00:00:44.080> begins<00:00:45.080> to<00:00:45.290> melt<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:45.740> as

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
and ice sheets begins to melt and as

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.180 
and ice sheets begins to melt and as
that<00:00:46.430> runs<00:00:46.850> off<00:00:47.090> into<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.450> ocean<00:00:47.870> it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
that runs off into the ocean it

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.620 
that runs off into the ocean it
increases<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.310> water<00:00:49.460> in<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.820> ocean<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.450> it

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
increases the water in the ocean and it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.360 
increases the water in the ocean and it
actually<00:00:50.780> raises<00:00:51.290> sea<00:00:51.470> level<00:00:51.710> as<00:00:51.830> well<00:00:54.370> it's

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
actually raises sea level as well it's

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.250 
actually raises sea level as well it's
important<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:55.970> understand<00:00:56.510> how<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.780> world's

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
important to understand how the world's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.440 
important to understand how the world's
ice<00:00:57.410> sheets<00:00:57.830> form<00:00:58.280> how<00:00:58.790> they<00:00:58.940> change<00:00:59.270> over

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
ice sheets form how they change over

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.900 
ice sheets form how they change over
time<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.110> how<00:01:00.560> fast<00:01:00.950> they<00:01:01.310> are<00:01:01.340> moving<00:01:01.610> into

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
time and how fast they are moving into

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.450 
time and how fast they are moving into
the<00:01:02.180> sea<00:01:02.440> that's<00:01:03.440> where<00:01:03.710> researchers<00:01:04.250> and

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
the sea that's where researchers and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.390 
the sea that's where researchers and
glaciers<00:01:05.089> on<00:01:05.299> land<00:01:05.630> are<00:01:06.170> shrinking<00:01:06.890> overall

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
glaciers on land are shrinking overall

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.600 
rises these get flooded the ecosystems
are<00:02:09.640> forced<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.149> change<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.980> so<00:02:11.980> all<00:02:12.190> this<00:02:12.430> can

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
are forced to change and so all this can

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.940 
are forced to change and so all this can
have<00:02:12.790> big<00:02:13.000> consequences<00:02:13.380> for<00:02:14.380> people<00:02:14.739> and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
have big consequences for people and

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.620 
have big consequences for people and
especially<00:02:15.489> people<00:02:15.940> who<00:02:16.090> live<00:02:16.330> near<00:02:16.510> the

especially people who live near the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.040 
especially people who live near the
coast<00:02:16.660> as<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:19.000> great<00:02:19.180> ice<00:02:19.390> sheets<00:02:19.450> in

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
coast as the great ice sheets in

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.199 
coast as the great ice sheets in
Antarctica<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:20.769> Greenland<00:02:21.010> begin<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.940> melt

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
Antarctica and Greenland begin to melt

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.870 
Antarctica and Greenland begin to melt
and<00:02:22.480> break<00:02:22.900> up<00:02:23.110> due<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.470> global<00:02:23.799> warming<00:02:23.880> we

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
and break up due to global warming we

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.910 
and break up due to global warming we
really<00:02:25.150> might<00:02:25.299> experience<00:02:25.750> very<00:02:26.230> rapid<00:02:26.739> sea

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
really might experience very rapid sea

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.250 
really might experience very rapid sea
level<00:02:27.190> rise<00:02:27.400> three<00:02:28.120> or<00:02:28.239> four<00:02:28.450> times<00:02:28.690> as<00:02:29.019> fast

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
level rise three or four times as fast

00:02:29.260 --> 00:03:01.590 
level rise three or four times as fast
as<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.709> rate<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.459> today

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.480 

so<00:03:02.600> predicting<00:03:03.200> future<00:03:03.590> sea-level<00:03:03.830> rise<00:03:04.220> is

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
so predicting future sea-level rise is

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.640 
so predicting future sea-level rise is
one<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.880> great<00:03:05.180> scientific<00:03:05.660> problems<00:03:06.500> of

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
one of the great scientific problems of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.800 
one of the great scientific problems of
the<00:03:06.770> future
