horsepower<00:02:19.069> so<00:02:20.660> not<00:02:21.660> really<00:02:21.870> much<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.319> can

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
horsepower so not really much you can

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.400 
horsepower so not really much you can
say<00:02:22.980> with<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.540> sort<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.630> messed<00:02:24.900> around<00:02:25.080> a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
say with that I sort of messed around a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.220 
say with that I sort of messed around a
little<00:02:25.739> bit<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.190> didn't<00:02:26.790> go<00:02:26.910> too<00:02:26.970> crazy<00:02:27.450> into<00:02:28.080> it

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
little bit I didn't go too crazy into it

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.890 
little bit I didn't go too crazy into it
just<00:02:28.470> because<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> didn't<00:02:29.280> want<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.780> I'll

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
just because I didn't want to and I'll

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.809 
just because I didn't want to and I'll
spend<00:02:31.170> too<00:02:31.349> much<00:02:31.440> time<00:02:31.560> doing<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:32.459> put

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
spend too much time doing it I have put

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.820 
spend too much time doing it I have put
all<00:02:33.000> them<00:02:33.209> put<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.959> same<00:02:34.140> amount<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.440> time<00:02:34.500> in

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
all them put the same amount of time in

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.759 
all them put the same amount of time in
every<00:02:35.040> car<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.580> do<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:36.090> don't<00:02:37.050> try<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.319> know

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
every car that I do I don't try to know

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.620 
every car that I do I don't try to know
play<00:02:38.099> favorites<00:02:38.610> make<00:02:38.790> one<00:02:39.000> car<00:02:39.239> look<00:02:39.420> better

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
play favorites make one car look better

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.449 
play favorites make one car look better
than<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> other<00:02:39.989> they<00:02:40.200> all<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.280> same

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
than the other they all have the same

00:02:41.459 --> 00:03:03.370 
than the other they all have the same
attitude

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.170 

gonna<00:03:03.800> shift<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.190> little<00:03:04.370> better<00:03:04.700> right<00:03:04.940> there

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
gonna shift a little better right there

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.720 
gonna shift a little better right there
but<00:03:05.420> pretty<00:03:06.050> decent<00:03:06.470> little<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.800> half<00:03:07.130> mile<00:03:07.400> run

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
but pretty decent little a half mile run

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.700 
but pretty decent little a half mile run
there<00:03:07.970> she<00:03:08.210> does<00:03:08.420> pick<00:03:08.720> up<00:03:08.870> momentum<00:03:09.050> when<00:03:09.500> she

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
there she does pick up momentum when she

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.100 
there she does pick up momentum when she
starts<00:03:10.040> going<00:03:10.300> 79<00:03:11.440> still<00:03:12.520> not<00:03:13.520> fast<00:03:13.880> no<00:03:14.750> not<00:03:15.020> as

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.820 

do<00:04:33.430> have<00:04:33.640> you<00:04:33.820> know<00:04:33.870> set<00:04:34.870> up<00:04:35.020> for<00:04:35.230> track<00:04:35.500> I<00:04:35.530> got

the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.100 

I<00:04:39.139> do<00:04:39.650> everything<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.220> can<00:04:40.280> but<00:04:41.090> I<00:04:41.389> just<00:04:41.840> can't

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
I do everything I can but I just can't

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.159 
I do everything I can but I just can't
keep<00:04:42.949> up<00:04:43.129> with<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.370> ghost<00:04:43.580> that<00:04:43.729> I<00:04:43.849> have<00:04:44.169> in

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
keep up with the ghost that I have in

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:53.590 
keep up with the ghost that I have in
front<00:04:45.199> of<00:04:45.470> me

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.900 

because<00:04:54.260> it<00:04:54.440> does<00:04:54.620> sound<00:04:54.890> no<00:04:55.310> just<00:04:55.550> like<00:04:55.640> the

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
because it does sound no just like the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.839 
because it does sound no just like the
Chevelle<00:04:56.570> does

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
Chevelle does

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.740 
Chevelle does
because<00:04:58.300> it's<00:04:58.479> pretty<00:04:58.689> much<00:04:58.839> the<00:04:59.249> same<00:05:00.249> layout

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
because it's pretty much the same layout

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.909 
because it's pretty much the same layout
the<00:05:01.840> thing<00:05:02.470> front<00:05:02.830> end

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.439 

use<00:05:08.919> more<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.520> front<00:05:09.759> in<00:05:09.910> from<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.150> chevelle

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
use more the front in from the chevelle

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.930 
use more the front in from the chevelle
as<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:10.990> can<00:05:11.080> tell<00:05:11.139> it's

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
as you can tell it's

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:24.559 
as you can tell it's
pretty<00:05:12.630> much<00:05:12.780> like<00:05:13.080> it

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.419 

I<00:05:24.689> had<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.229> be<00:05:25.349> real<00:05:25.589> easy<00:05:25.800> on<00:05:26.069> the<00:05:26.189> throttle

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:26.429 
I had to be real easy on the throttle

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:28.010 
I had to be real easy on the throttle
during<00:05:26.909> these<00:05:27.119> a<00:05:27.179> couple<00:05:27.719> of<00:05:27.809> tournaments

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
during these a couple of tournaments

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.779 
during these a couple of tournaments
because<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.619> back<00:05:28.860> game<00:05:29.099> would<00:05:29.279> kick<00:05:29.460> itself

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
because the back game would kick itself

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.940 
because the back game would kick itself
out

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
out

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.370 
out
not<00:05:32.550> much<00:05:32.700> I<00:05:32.820> could<00:05:32.880> do<00:05:33.120> there<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.720> know<00:05:34.050> all<00:05:34.230> the

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
not much I could do there I know all the

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.720 
not much I could do there I know all the

I was going to try to take it a bit more
careful<00:07:33.630> going<00:07:33.870> up<00:07:33.960> this<00:07:34.140> one<00:07:34.350> because<00:07:34.470> I

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650 
careful going up this one because I

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.970 
careful going up this one because I
almost<00:07:34.770> lost<00:07:35.100> it<00:07:35.540> the<00:07:36.540> peak<00:07:36.750> of<00:07:36.870> the<00:07:37.020> turn<00:07:37.650> here

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:37.980 
almost lost it the peak of the turn here

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.120 
almost lost it the peak of the turn here
but<00:07:38.760> i<00:07:39.150> was<00:07:39.330> already<00:07:39.720> slidin<00:07:40.110> in<00:07:40.410> coming<00:07:40.890> into

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.130

but i was already slidin in coming into
the<00:07:41.250> entrance<00:07:41.550> of<00:07:41.700> it<00:07:41.850> so<00:07:42.000> I<00:07:42.030> knew<00:07:42.270> the<00:07:42.780> exit

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.140 
the entrance of it so I knew the exit

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.920 
the entrance of it so I knew the exit
was<00:07:43.290> going<00:07:43.470> to<00:07:43.530> be

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:43.930 
was going to be

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.689 
was going to be
horrible<00:07:44.320> as<00:07:44.500> you<00:07:44.979> can<00:07:45.100> see<00:07:45.250> I<00:07:45.280> actually<00:07:45.520> a

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:45.699 
horrible as you can see I actually a

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:49.050 
horrible as you can see I actually a
clip<00:07:46.180> the<00:07:46.360> dirt<00:07:46.570> there

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.330 

I<00:07:49.090> just<00:07:49.690> figured<00:07:50.020> why<00:07:50.230> not<00:07:50.260> so<00:07:50.710> I<00:07:50.770> just<00:07:50.950> gunned

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:51.340 
I just figured why not so I just gunned

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.120 
I just figured why not so I just gunned
it<00:07:51.520> I<00:07:51.790> was<00:07:52.450> just<00:07:52.540> holding<00:07:53.020> the<00:07:53.290> pedal<00:07:53.620> down<00:07:53.650> I
