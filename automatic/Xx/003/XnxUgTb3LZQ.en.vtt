00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 we start this good morning edition 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.450
 with good news 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.420
 are the first results of a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.969
 pioneering and fully national research 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.889
 ana luiza a new method developed in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.039
 university of fluminense brings 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.720
 hope for the treatment of cancer in the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.390
 brain the news is andrÃ© curvello 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 the magnetic resonance image shows 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.119
 a brain tumor of nine centimeters 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.530
 the examination was done in January this gentleman 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.110
 70 years in June after six months the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.790
 tumor had shrunk to one centimeter 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.149
 and 4 millimeters 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 I feel like my body is fine. 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:51.719
 but it 's tough, right? 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.149
 I'm feeling that I feel better. 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.059
 gentlemen, intensive treatment 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.969
 which combined chemo and radiotherapy 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.469
 but the best results came later 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.059
 that he met this team of 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.670
 researchers at the federal university 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.369
 Rio in River State 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.760
 in these laboratories a substance of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.520
 name has gained prominence is the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 perylene alcohol an oil extracted from 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.299
 citrus fruits 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 treatment is also new at the time of 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.030
 application of the medicine and the patient inhales 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.790
 the perilla alcohol at home for about 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.860
 15 minutes four times a day at 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 option is much less invasive than the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.280
 traditional treatment and according to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.020
 The researchers 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.700
 to date there are no records of effects 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.170
 collateral 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.659
 even in patients who have been 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.150
 treaties for more than six years 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.700
 Inhalation allows the alcohol to reach the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.130
 the central nervous system and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.409
 proliferation of the cancer cells 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.520
 that we are seeing is first that 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.090
 is regressing is tumors according to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.719
 survival improves third quality 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.180
 because it is not a product that does not 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.860
 is toxic then patients already have a 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.479
 better quality of life 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.550
 the study caught the attention of 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.539
 researchers at the University of Southern 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.670
 California 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.590
 American doctor thomas scheidt said 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.260
 that the results presented 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.129
 this method are not much better than 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.000
 than those of some treatments 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.950
 the champion was intense but 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.650
 the researchers clarify that the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.260
 chemotherapy is still required by 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.750
 the next step of the research is 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.540
 join in the nebulizer perillyl alcohol 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.910
 and chemotherapy drugs that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.010
 would also be inhaled 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.560
 we come to the conclusion that we have 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.440
 combining various drugs so that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.420
 we can definitely cancel this 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.579
 cell we will be able to reduce the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.720
 chemotherapy concentration and 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:54.450
 also decrease the money spent is with 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.579
 ever more firm steps 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.160
 aristides who just came back from a 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.530
 trip is full of plans 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.099
 It's the plan to make another trip. 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.099
 Already
