00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
the updates the wrong Goldberg machine

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.080 
the updates the wrong Goldberg machine
kind<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.470> they<00:02:48.980> put<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.700> increase<00:02:49.819> the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
kind of they put it in to increase the

update

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
update

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.720 
update
I<00:03:12.380> had<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.829> price<00:03:13.100> check<00:03:13.340> would<00:03:13.430> actually

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
I had the price check would actually

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.640 
I had the price check would actually
probably<00:03:13.970> be<00:03:14.359> a<00:03:14.389> little<00:03:14.720> more<00:03:14.930> because<00:03:15.200> you

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
probably be a little more because you

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.180 
probably be a little more because you
loot<00:03:15.859> you<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.609> logs<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.359> the<00:03:18.350> iron<00:03:18.590> ore<00:03:18.829> is

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
loot you you logs and the iron ore is

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.550 
loot you you logs and the iron ore is
something<00:03:19.639> that's<00:03:19.760> traditionally

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
something that's traditionally

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.900 
something that's traditionally
traditionally<00:03:21.560> has<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> higher<00:03:22.069> value<00:03:22.609> than<00:03:22.639> uh

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
traditionally has a higher value than uh

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.400 
traditionally has a higher value than uh
you<00:03:23.269> know<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.450> amount<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:23.840> room<00:03:23.989> that<00:03:24.200> they

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
you know the amount of room that they

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.569 
you know the amount of room that they
would<00:03:24.560> drop<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:26.410> because<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.530> rooms<00:03:27.769> are<00:03:28.190> from

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
would drop so because the rooms are from

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.900 
would drop so because the rooms are from
about<00:03:29.290> 275<00:03:30.290> kills<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.040> they<00:03:31.130> add<00:03:31.340> up<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.639> what

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
about 275 kills and they add up to what

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.229 
about 275 kills and they add up to what
is<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.060> about<00:03:32.569> 150<00:03:33.410> K<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.579> you<00:03:34.760> logs<00:03:35.000> in

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
is that about 150 K and the you logs in

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.879 
is that about 150 K and the you logs in
the<00:03:35.299> iron<00:03:35.510> ore<00:03:35.810> from<00:03:35.989> about<00:03:37.000> 225<00:03:38.000> kills<00:03:38.389> so<00:03:38.889> but

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
the iron ore from about 225 kills so but

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.610 
the iron ore from about 225 kills so but
that's<00:03:40.220> with<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.819> new<00:03:41.030> room<00:03:41.329> crisis<00:03:41.989> chaos

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
that's with the new room crisis chaos

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.370 
that's with the new room crisis chaos
rooms<00:03:42.919> did<00:03:43.220> not<00:03:43.459> used<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.730> be<00:03:43.819> that<00:03:44.120> much<00:03:44.389> and<00:03:44.690> I

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
rooms did not used to be that much and I

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.870 
rooms did not used to be that much and I
don't<00:03:45.440> think<00:03:45.769> death<00:03:46.010> rooms<00:03:46.310> were<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:46.669> much

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
don't think death rooms were that much

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.879 
don't think death rooms were that much
either<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.690> mean<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.260> affecting<00:03:48.829> the

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
either so I mean it is affecting the

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.580 
either so I mean it is affecting the
prices<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.370> rooms<00:03:49.549> quite<00:03:49.849> a<00:03:49.880> bit<00:03:50.590> but

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
prices of rooms quite a bit but

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.409 
prices of rooms quite a bit but
everything<00:03:52.190> in<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.370> PC<00:03:52.819> we're<00:03:53.030> looking<00:03:53.269> at<00:03:53.389> a

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
everything in the PC we're looking at a

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.470 
everything in the PC we're looking at a
1.2<00:03:54.319> mil<00:03:54.560> which<00:03:54.769> actually<00:03:55.160> isn't<00:03:55.370> too<00:03:55.790> bad<00:03:56.180> at

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
1.2 mil which actually isn't too bad at

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.080 
1.2 mil which actually isn't too bad at
all<00:03:56.569> man<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:56.870> for<00:03:57.049> 500<00:03:57.560> greater<00:03:57.739> demons<00:03:58.280> so

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090
