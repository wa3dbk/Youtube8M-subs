00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:13.779

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.779
 and listen to this moment the criticism of Oscar Farfán 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.679
 collaborated good night I do not know if you have thought but it's your turn 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.109
 responsibility up a little ungrateful because it turns out that this has been adverse 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.079
 Bishop's night world demonstrated 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.640
 getty breakthrough that was closing the karai it was not possible that it was razed 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.790
 for engines 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.030
 What I can tell you is that I'm a little bit of all kinds of energy and then 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.760
 that this time that both are a little bit tired 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.950
 and that I think it's worth that readers 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.390
 there is now the best 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.570
 Javier in the final straight now the competition is harder than all of you 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.400
 I think you already have the elements 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.550
 I did not want 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.640
 your joy then a little more loyal to play with your name all that 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.970
 it seems to me that you did it well guarded by your life at least say that 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.290
 changing copper 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.670
 it was made that July and July both made their August 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.260
 to TV 5 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.640
 to the fair like this good night 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.290
 be given by the clouds manar dt it went away 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.200
 the one who was schooled 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.370
 the energy was there 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.840
 talpa freezing cumbia but 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.430
 but live and then social said he will be convincing cheerful 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.590
 the evening the music but but the lyrics 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.760
 vick managers 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.170
 It is something very impressionable on each side of the country and the food can be very 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.770
 very heartfelt 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.620
 even to sentry boxes of pain 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.620
 they are very scattered tax 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.940
 then good 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.160
 get more excited 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.760
 the reporter 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.710
 at ages 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 jolie has been many weeks 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.040
 leaving the assets 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.860
 so 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.000
 what I can think of at this moment is that you do not have anything else 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.670
 I know that if he uses more than the academy is doing 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.839
 because there is no advance in you 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:13.639
 and the slightest the absolute carelessness in this song the deconcentration and 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.449
 the lack of energy 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.560
 can not be 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.710
 because it's not a week, it's not two, there are not three, 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.199
 I think the academy is over for you 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.199
 after 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.689
 since we talk about honesty 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.039
 duke money 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.779
 how would you criticize satin 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.689
 after what exists now 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.969
 one feels that 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.099
 the deputy minister of public health 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.099
 the reduction 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.279
 it is not about 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.279
 of age to do so not I just think 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.779
 that this project 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:56.849
 I passed you 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.539
 that is beyond you 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.019
 that is beyond your means 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.359
 that we could see in good times throughout the academy 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.780
 and that those moments were gone the long time was over 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:09.759
 I wish you that 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:11.339
 what they do 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.939
 you do well outside the artistic career because I think he 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.949
 in this in particular 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.549
 it's not for you 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.659
 you have to assume that you have to understand it in the best way 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.169
 It's only one 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.169
 thanks for your house
