00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.419
 many writers of weeds I will bring 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.310
 the first chapter of the DNA face in the 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.469
 one shot mode with the sniper you know 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.129
 that I made a video that if we came to 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.110
 2000 likes I would try to make a roa adn 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.640
 in the way of a shot the truth did not know 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.680
 it was going to be so hard to say that this 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.269
 Live video is not ie 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.890
 game is not recorded live with 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.449
 live vocals so first 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.019
 I want to tell you some things 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.150
 especially the game basically not 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.009
 he has brought us live audio 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.010
 basically because I lost it the 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.170
 audio was not recorded badly the audio was on 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.020
 half lost I say mean because it 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.450
 he recorded half of the game and the other 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.670
 half not so I did not use the audio 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.590
 just as I was what I do want to say 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.360
 is that I'm having a hard time playing with 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.460
 the psni but as I speak it is not a 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.520
 weapon that we say requires as more 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.930
 precision no longer precision but that 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 you have a shot you do not know what really 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.920
 you have a shot and you see I have the 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.330
 Bloodthirsty badges and really I 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.420
 it costs a lot then I do not know if you want 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.940
 what 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.489
 that to help me out a bit 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.890
 things to me well I do 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.200
 commented or above as now 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.520
 I tried to take it out so before because 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.320
 I think it 's so we're going to 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.970
 take out and I will not tell you how much is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.799
 the rat but it's good enough 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.860
 pretty good not for the first chapter 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.289
 and well I told you in the video that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.330
 I wanted about 2000 likes, and not really 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.549
 we arrived I think it 's almost 2500 it was a 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.009
 I can see that it's cool for you to play 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.270
 with lass sneijder and really that I 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.619
 I'm very happy with the strippers and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.200
 you know that I get pretty pretty 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.270
 pretty good and especially thank you 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.030
 to the competitive that good at looking and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.100
 destroy because I play a lot with her and she 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.179
 is giving me frankly well not and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.600
 never better said 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.520
 the graphics I hope you enjoy it 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.080
 this series that I like a lot but 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.000
 If you want, I will bring the voices 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.290
 direct also because not the only thing 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.090
 that may cost me a little more 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.070
 Take it out but I'm sure that we 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.350
 let's get what I'm not sure is 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.970
 because they put me a comment and I think 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.920
 what I answered is because I'm not 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.619
 sure of everything but he gave me a bit of 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.509
 scared they told me that in the mode of a 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.940
 shot yes to take out the streak of 30 do not you 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.800
 they give the DNA but I do not think it's like that 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.260
 everything but good is what I have been told 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.090
 in a comment and good in one not in 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.560
 several and I do not know if good if any of 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.510
 you will be taken out you know of someone 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.370
 that was taken out I would like that I 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.290
 confirm 6 if so or not but good 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.239
 equally, the objective would be a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.640
 streak of 30 with the soul so like 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.459
 here there are no rats because it would not be a fierce 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.370
 but it would be the adn another thing that you 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.650
 I want to comment is that right now I'm going to 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.080
 do in a while with the actresses 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.390
 which will surely mix two games 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.769
 not so in line das hatred of those who 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.540
 I got out of 2017 then o of 30 obviously 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.709
 and I will mix it surely in the same 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.810
 chapter instead of putting a game 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.810
 whole because I see that sometimes because 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.760
 it's boring when I've already taken 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.800
 another thing I want to say from this series 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.319
 is that I will try to put the minimum 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.510
 published when I see that 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.790
 obviously I'm on a high streak and the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.830
 I 'm close I'm not going to play or I 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.239
 I'll think about it but I'll try to make all 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.830
 the losses or at least 90% are with the 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.690
 sniper because if not then well I tell you that 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.569
 I would not have so much merit but good 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.130
 guys this was almost to 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.530
 its the end the way they killed me was 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.620
 a little bit unfair, not because of falsehood 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.860
 true not because of falsehood but because 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.930
 I was nothing a thousandth to sue him and 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.220
 really, well, we're going on a run that I think 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.350
 which is 12 or 13 and we do not get 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.209
 finally the streak of 15 by very very 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.799
 I do not know what streak is what most 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.220
 you have taken out for the moment what 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.709
 maximum that I've pulled out has been 17 and it was in 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.330
 an old video that I made with Ivan 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.060
 forever besides they were playing there 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.430
 in play four or some games and then 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.870
 I got a streak of 1917 I do not remember 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.400
 I do not really remember but it was a 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.080
 authentic barbarity because in addition what 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.820
 I did in a minute and a half 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.080
 incredible and it's also with epic music 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.140
 that video I do not know what 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.880
 is to lose is by the channel but it is already 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.250
 very much time that if you want to spend 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.650
 the truth is that it is super epic and safe 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.910
 that you fancy a one pass follow 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.230
 guys, I hope you liked it if it's 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.120
 well like and favorites for more of this 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.120
 series a greeting and until next time
