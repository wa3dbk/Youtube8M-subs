00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
one thing that stands out about most

one thing that stands out about most
Mazdas<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.269> their<00:00:09.480> performance<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
Mazdas is their performance and the

a 1.5 liter four-cylinder it makes about

about that kind of power output you'd

highway these figures are pretty good

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.420 
highway these figures are pretty good
but<00:00:39.480> given<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> Mazda<00:00:40.200> 2<00:00:40.230> size<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.950> number<00:00:41.340> of

but given the Mazda 2 size a number of

but given the Mazda 2 size a number of
the<00:00:41.520> viewers<00:00:41.820> say<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.270> thought<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> fuel

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the viewers say they thought the fuel

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.319 
the viewers say they thought the fuel
economy<00:00:43.050> could<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.559> better<00:00:43.739> still<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.000> Mazda

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
economy could be better still the Mazda

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.940 
economy could be better still the Mazda
2<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.840> fun<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.140> drive<00:00:46.350> than<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> typical

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
2 is more fun to drive than the typical

2 is more fun to drive than the typical
eco-minded<00:00:47.700> fuel<00:00:48.090> sipper<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.870> giving<00:00:49.170> away<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
eco-minded fuel sipper so giving away a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.000 
eco-minded fuel sipper so giving away a
few<00:00:49.649> MPGs<00:00:50.160> might<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.520> worth<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.800> getting<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
few MPGs might be worth it getting up to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.590 
few MPGs might be worth it getting up to
highway<00:00:53.160> speeds<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> 2<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.329> little

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
highway speeds in the 2 can be a little

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.389 
highway speeds in the 2 can be a little
bit<00:00:54.809> taxing<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.410> you've<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> full<00:00:56.070> load<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
bit taxing if you've got a full load of

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.639 
bit taxing if you've got a full load of
passengers<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.120> cargo<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:58.170> there's<00:00:58.530> just

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
passengers and cargo but there's just

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
passengers and cargo but there's just
one<00:00:58.739> person<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.280> board<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.760> really<00:00:59.820> ok<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
one person on board it's really ok and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.630 
one person on board it's really ok and
anyway<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.410> 2<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.710> meant<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> city<00:01:02.399> car

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
anyway the 2 is meant to be a city car

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.950 
anyway the 2 is meant to be a city car
and<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:02.910> got<00:01:03.000> enough<00:01:03.239> power<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> round

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and it's got enough power for a round

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960 
and it's got enough power for a round
town<00:01:04.170> driving<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> highway<00:01:05.100> stuff<00:01:05.430> really

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
town driving so the highway stuff really

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
town driving so the highway stuff really
isn't<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.299> important<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:06.990> we've<00:01:07.590> got<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
isn't that important now we've got the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
isn't that important now we've got the
standard<00:01:08.369> manual<00:01:08.880> transmission<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.659> it's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
standard manual transmission and it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.570 
standard manual transmission and it's
pretty<00:01:10.320> good<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.860> thing<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.369> don't

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
pretty good if one thing I really don't

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
pretty good if one thing I really don't
like<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> shifters<00:01:12.390> mounted<00:01:12.750> almost

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
like is that the shifters mounted almost

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.690 
like is that the shifters mounted almost
up<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> center<00:01:13.860> stack<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.400> since<00:01:14.549> I've

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
up on the center stack and since I've

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.590 
up on the center stack and since I've
got<00:01:14.880> short<00:01:15.180> arms

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
got short arms

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300 
got short arms
I've<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> reach<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.130> bit

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I've got to reach up for it a little bit

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.710 
I've got to reach up for it a little bit
but<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.490> might<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.939> an<00:01:18.119> issue<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.540> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
but that might not be an issue for you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
but that might not be an issue for you
now<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> clutch<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.759> nice

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
now the clutch on this is really nice

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.490 
now the clutch on this is really nice
and<00:01:21.119> smooth<00:01:21.390> which<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.750> great<00:01:22.080> when<00:01:22.229> you're<00:01:22.350> in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and smooth which is great when you're in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.840 
and smooth which is great when you're in
traffic<00:01:22.890> because<00:01:23.009> your<00:01:23.280> knee<00:01:23.430> doesn't<00:01:23.640> get

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
traffic because your knee doesn't get

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.480 
traffic because your knee doesn't get
tired<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.900> because<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.979> smooth<00:01:26.280> it's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
tired but because it is so smooth it's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.160 
tired but because it is so smooth it's
really<00:01:26.790> hard<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.119> feel<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> friction<00:01:27.780> zone<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
really hard to feel the friction zone of

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
really hard to feel the friction zone of
when<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> engine<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.710> engaged<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
when the engine is engaged and so you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.819 
when the engine is engaged and so you
end<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.509> over<00:01:30.840> everything<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.320> lot<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.710> at

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
end up over everything in a lot for at

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.710 
end up over everything in a lot for at
least<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.970> there's<00:01:33.150> gonna<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.450> probably

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
least I do so there's gonna be probably

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.420 
least I do so there's gonna be probably
