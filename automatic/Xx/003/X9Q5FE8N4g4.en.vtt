this with own flesh tone it's a good
color<00:05:02.480> I<00:05:02.690> tend<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.110> honestly<00:05:03.620> typically<00:05:04.160> do<00:05:04.340> it

color I tend to honestly typically do it

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.880 
color I tend to honestly typically do it
more<00:05:04.670> so<00:05:04.880> for<00:05:05.090> highlights<00:05:05.570> because<00:05:05.890> you

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
more so for highlights because you

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.430 
more so for highlights because you
generally<00:05:07.520> can't<00:05:08.000> really<00:05:08.450> see<00:05:08.840> it<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.200> much

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
generally can't really see it that much

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.590 
generally can't really see it that much
especially<00:05:10.430> with<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.880> being<00:05:11.150> on<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.390> white

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
especially with the being on the white

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.490 
especially with the being on the white
team<00:05:11.930> um<00:05:12.370> I<00:05:13.370> tried<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.360> down<00:05:14.480> on<00:05:14.690> this<00:05:14.840> one<00:05:15.110> I
