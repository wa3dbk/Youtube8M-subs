00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.330 
to do what's called feather marbling so
feather<00:00:05.250> marbling<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.720> very<00:00:07.710> messy

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
feather marbling is a very messy

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.400 
feather marbling is a very messy
technique<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.510> what<00:00:09.719> we're<00:00:09.840> gonna<00:00:09.929> do<00:00:10.260> is

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
technique so what we're gonna do is

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.100 
technique so what we're gonna do is
normally<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.860> would<00:00:10.980> try<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.190> over<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> sink

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
normally you would try this over a sink

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.169 
normally you would try this over a sink
but<00:00:13.110> today<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.349> just<00:00:13.440> sort<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.950> put<00:00:14.880> out<00:00:15.030> some

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
but today I just sort of put out some

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.910 
but today I just sort of put out some
paper<00:00:15.360> towel<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:15.870> myself<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> don't<00:00:16.500> smear

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
paper towel for myself so I don't smear

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.279 
paper towel for myself so I don't smear
my<00:00:17.130> tape<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.520> paint<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.930> whole<00:00:19.080> thing

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
my tape with paint so the whole thing

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.130 
my tape with paint so the whole thing
with<00:00:19.410> feather<00:00:19.949> marbling<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:21.140> basically

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
with feather marbling is basically

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.759 
with feather marbling is basically
taking<00:00:22.650> wet<00:00:22.890> paint<00:00:23.220> taking<00:00:23.760> two<00:00:23.880> colors

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
taking wet paint taking two colors

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.679 
taking wet paint taking two colors
having<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.830> wet<00:00:26.039> sort<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.970> drenching<00:00:27.599> your

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
having it wet sort of drenching your

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.480 
having it wet sort of drenching your
piece<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> actually<00:00:28.650> shaking<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> piece

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
piece and actually shaking the piece

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.030 
piece and actually shaking the piece
into<00:00:29.820> its<00:00:30.420> marbling<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.230> playing<00:00:31.859> with

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
into its marbling so it's playing with

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.600 
into its marbling so it's playing with
the<00:00:32.160> movement<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> paint<00:00:33.210> itself<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.610> what

the drifts and rock it back and forth

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.120 
the drifts and rock it back and forth
and<00:01:56.689> go<00:01:57.689> back<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> add<00:01:58.290> some<00:01:58.320> more<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and go back and add some more if you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.670 
and go back and add some more if you
want<00:01:59.299> to<00:02:00.299> create<00:02:00.600> some<00:02:00.930> new<00:02:01.460> sort<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.579> shapes

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.230 

and<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.720> sort<00:02:07.930> of<00:02:08.340> find<00:02:09.340> little<00:02:09.850> drifts

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
and then you sort of find little drifts

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.050 
and then you sort of find little drifts
and<00:02:10.330> little<00:02:10.570> marbling<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.890> like<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.490> then

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and little marbling you like and then

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.310 
and little marbling you like and then
you<00:02:13.180> can<00:02:13.210> sort<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.660> leave<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.960> whenever<00:02:14.110> you

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
you can sort of leave it whenever you

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.200 
you can sort of leave it whenever you
want<00:02:14.410> another<00:02:15.370> thing<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:15.820> do<00:02:16.000> when

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
want another thing you can do when

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.490 
want another thing you can do when
you're<00:02:16.360> feather<00:02:16.570> marbling<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.170> actually

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
you're feather marbling is actually

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.560 
you're feather marbling is actually
taking<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.920> pin<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.550> sort<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:20.160> drawing<00:02:21.570> into

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
taking a pin and sort of drawing into

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.730 
taking a pin and sort of drawing into
just<00:02:23.320> like<00:02:23.650> food<00:02:24.460> artists<00:02:24.940> do<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.620> all<00:02:26.620> I'm

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
just like food artists do and all I'm

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.500 
just like food artists do and all I'm
gonna<00:02:26.890> do<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.190> I'm<00:02:27.400> going<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.550> work<00:02:28.150> with<00:02:28.360> these

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
gonna do is I'm going to work with these

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.480 
gonna do is I'm going to work with these
swirls<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:29.020> little<00:02:29.260> bit<00:02:29.350> more<00:02:29.560> creating<00:02:30.220> more

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
swirls a little bit more creating more

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.920 
swirls a little bit more creating more
defined<00:02:31.120> shapes<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:33.210> this<00:02:34.210> does<00:02:34.540> create

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
defined shapes and this does create

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.690 
defined shapes and this does create
really<00:02:35.500> neat<00:02:35.680> texture<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.460> will

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
really neat texture and this will

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.430 
really neat texture and this will
actually<00:02:37.060> keep<00:02:37.300> during<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.810> flowering<00:02:37.990> a<00:02:38.320> lot

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
actually keep during the flowering a lot

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.690 
actually keep during the flowering a lot
of<00:02:38.500> people<00:02:38.770> asking<00:02:39.040> when<00:02:39.160> they're<00:02:39.280> doing<00:02:39.490> but

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
of people asking when they're doing but

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.880 
of people asking when they're doing but
their<00:02:39.820> marbling<00:02:40.150> if<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.930> will<00:02:41.050> actually<00:02:41.080> stay

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
their marbling if it will actually stay

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.620 
their marbling if it will actually stay
because<00:02:42.190> some<00:02:42.670> paint<00:02:42.880> do<00:02:43.090> taint<00:02:43.360> while

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
because some paint do taint while

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.380 
because some paint do taint while
they're<00:02:43.750> being<00:02:43.900> fired<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:45.340> these<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:46.360> does

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
they're being fired but these this does

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.420 
they're being fired but these this does
hold<00:02:46.990> up<00:02:47.140> remarkably<00:02:47.890> well

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
hold up remarkably well

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.130 
hold up remarkably well
so<00:02:48.850> all<00:02:48.940> I'm<00:02:49.090> doing<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:49.510> just<00:02:49.540> almost<00:02:49.900> like<00:02:50.110> a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
so all I'm doing is just almost like a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.740 
so all I'm doing is just almost like a
little<00:02:50.380> fireworks<00:02:53.670> sort<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.790> design<00:02:55.180> here<00:02:55.570> and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
little fireworks sort of design here and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.670 
little fireworks sort of design here and
then<00:02:55.870> I'm<00:02:55.959> just<00:02:55.990> going<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.230> pull<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.650> other

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
then I'm just going to pull the other

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.580 
then I'm just going to pull the other
way<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.750> that's<00:02:59.230> how<00:02:59.800> I<00:02:59.830> feather<00:03:00.190> nerville
