 the lord 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.300
 a bit satisfied with the results he Wednesday in an interview with 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
 putting flames of more than forty people to work 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.890
 despite all 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 we stand 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.770
 but the points 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 to appoint the jury to this project 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.550
 excuse me 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.820

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 percent more expensive everything 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.910

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.299
