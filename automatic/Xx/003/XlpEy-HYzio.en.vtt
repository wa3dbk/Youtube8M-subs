00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.279
 what we are going to do is create a folder 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.650
 in our sd card route with the name of 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.390

 Case post games pc 1 inside 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.500
 this folder I got what is the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.829
 emulator the virus file and the game 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.989
 length receives the point vi clear in the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.670
 bit format then once already 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.109
 have these three files what we're going 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.320
 to do is going to be installing what is the 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.690
 emulator we are worth installing the files 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.550
 donated by finding from blogspot a 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.760
 once we have installed it if there is 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.320
 jobs here to open and we 're going to go 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.720
 to the second option that is going to say this 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.120
 start videos and then we will search 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.070
 the route where we have put then the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.159
 video file are the folder that you 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.600
 have created and once you select in 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.820
 the videos file later they give 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.770
 run videos and go back to this 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.360
 menu and so we're going to that 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.490
 preference this may be optional we 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.250
 let it begin to screen and 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.830
 here we are going to put or we will fill the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.960
 screen fill box and we're going to 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.880
 select this option by default in 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.470
 four times three we're going to leave here in 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.930
 fill in screen once we have 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.330
 done this we go back and we're going to 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.010
 who says run game and here's 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.720
 same way we will launch our route 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.850
 of the sdk then what are we going to do 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.000
 it's going to be this one looking for the folder in the 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.430
 that we have put the game 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.650
 and I'm just going to look for the game 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.360
 that we then have the game that 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.970
 we have gotten in this case is the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.700
 looney tunes racing and good only 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.590

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.310
 they started to run what is this 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.900

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.150
 I remember that from the box they go to 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.150

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.560

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.560
 from Spanish 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.210
 for green what is that game the 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.210
 intro 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.190
 we skip that part or faster 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.080
 after 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.020
 which movements for you 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.300
 after 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.830
 Well, see the game and if you like it 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.910
 they will be able to find it from the blogs 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.910
 for sale ' then 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.910
 I like what it is 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.000
 some game modes and other options 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.830
 we all go to a simple career 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.300
 are the ones that we can enter the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.300
 different characters as you can see 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.880
 as quickly a race not then 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.460
 and I hope you liked the video 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.680
 as you can see it is but the truth is that 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.020
 it runs well although in some 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.629
 devices did not assure them that they are 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.210
 so fluid but not as you can see this 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:02.210
 the havana no memory moment 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.370
 and I also remember that simulators of 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.580
 station is not working from 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.840
 devices conversions of 42.3 all 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.910
 in two points pressure forward if that 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.410
 was more compatible with most 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.820
 all the dyes of the devices 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.820
 Android comes out then 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.640
 that's why you liked the video 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.570
 and remember that with the other children 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.340
 you can not use them remember too 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.800
 shop around and he will export it 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.690
 that they find more people and 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.690
 applications for your devices 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.390

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.180
