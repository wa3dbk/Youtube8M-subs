00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.309
 benton to the boys in this new one 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.199
 episode of concluded for canesca passion 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.490
 boys today we will present you a video 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.339
 very interesting concerning in 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.970
 compare from two united professors of 74 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.710
 thousand 770k ayane fx 8300 50 and two suits 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.810
 processors were compared on several 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.249
 test both debate software and me 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.259
 I see falls the texts wines will come 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.140
 made against yours and will be the 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.539
 merlo slide take care that it grows 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.210
 in addition it adds a program to 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.969
 make is a big fan of the 3d market 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.429
 2010 of course we can all estimates 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:49.629
 between fps temperatures in games 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:52.239
 of the north of the brands and also during the 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.589
 rendering of the self video that is fine 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.629
 a cut to this shit is enough and 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.800
 let's start with the video the processors will be 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.469
 then joined by their respective 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.589
 cards but of rock and analytics and 90 with 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.059
 opticians who of ram 2133 makers a run 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.160
 iraq at 100 free perfectly 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.110
 professor is in the running and strength 3 from 120 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.440
 cites the rest details leaves them 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.940
 description let's start immediately with the 3d test 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.010
 mark with both processors 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.590
 intended for factory use we will have to 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.550
 then an excellent 350 left 4t leaders 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.430
 he disturbs 41 28 thousand 770k on the right a 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.780
 trevi 25 cicles conturba 39 during i 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.700
 match but we also notice the slight 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.250
 difference in the amount of fs that 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.660
 I come out of Kafka head like mind 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.580
 deriving from the fact that in the two 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.010
 situations we used two drivers 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.900
 different graphs among try the long inter 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.030
 unqualified for noemi of ondra del 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.950
 metal we also find a net 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.900
 difference in the physical test you do of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.030
 10 fps 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.070
 then the south to the other arrived then 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.320
 to the final table where one if the 90 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.240
 that with m of itself in the graphic score 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.160
 slightly larger perhaps due to the fact 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.720
 which gives of the beta while I mean 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.790
 obviously i score more in the score 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.740
 tax without dwelling on those of the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.910
 past we show you directly the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 images of the two texts with the 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.320
 procession two garments 500 megahertz 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.990
 we will therefore find a factory error 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.350
 8.050 apart from the various and a half 7 of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.540
 a mine field 770 4gb provided both 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.160
 with fixed frequency also this time 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.530
 however they are not noticed large 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.590
 differences 32 compared to before 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.280
 amd therefore lack of physical score 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.050
 finished goods but also passion 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.400
 video games perhaps important that the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.530
 most of you because 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.450
 interested game configurations from 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 affordable price to have tried then 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.990
 says do it yourself video gameplay like that 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.540
 equal to match both cases 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.430
 even the effects of the game came out that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.620
 fight for 50 is doing very well 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.750
 to have a price of around 170 euros 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.550
 in comparing these three games 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.740
 we note that for part on the 4 meter last 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.680
 light the difference between fps 32 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.480
 processors range from 20 to 30 fps 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.850
 different speech for extreme cases in 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.560
 how much this difference is reduced by 10 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.610
 fps 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.200
 we must also remember that in the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.720
 configuration inter present a card 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.640
 mother with sub that supports ps 3.0 a 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.040
 difference of that md and exactly 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.350
 we do not know if this difference of ps 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.420
 can derive only from the processor that is 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.890
 by the processor that the motherboard 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.110
 at this point and we can say that yes 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.900
 can play decently even with 8300 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.290
 20 18 thousand 350 saving around 100 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.900
 EUR 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.400
 then invest this savings in one 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.170
 video card that will surely do the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.970
 unlike the games we're pretty 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.890
 sure that all this difference 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.630
 performance may depend on how much i 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.160
 whose programs or games 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.230
 started for a short compared to a 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.940
 in the end I wouldn't be surprised if 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.380
 most software on the market 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.970
 the tadpole on inter visa e 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.240
 considering that intel is much more 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.250
 placed on the market compared to amd of 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.000
 operating temperatures have turned between 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.860
 the 43 and 47 degrees and for md the 39 43 for 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.410
 intel at a room temperature 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.290
 search 24 degrees in rendering a 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.670
 one minute video at 1080p amd employs 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.830
 a time that is around two 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.250
 minutes and 20 20 seconds more than 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.320
 inter 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.120
 so guys the choice at this point 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.090
 it's up to you if you have a limited budget 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.080
 on what but if these your purchases 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.880
 save on a video card for 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.500
 invest in the processor or save 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.570
 on the latter and investing in one 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.190
 netease le bois video card vi 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.570
 we thank the vision and invite you 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.520
 to leave a comment that let us know 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.260
 your idea is all about this 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.260
 still a greeting and the next
