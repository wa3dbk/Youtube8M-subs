00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
well so outside of that it is a very

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
guess if I were to nitpick it is a very

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
rigid ride and by rigid I mean you feel

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.830 
rigid ride and by rigid I mean you feel
every<00:05:00.610> little<00:05:00.849> bump<00:05:00.970> it's<00:05:01.300> not<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.449> very<00:05:01.599> cushy

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840

every little bump it's not a very cushy
right<00:05:02.050> at<00:05:02.169> all<00:05:02.229> but<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.409> do<00:05:02.500> tell<00:05:02.710> people<00:05:02.800> that

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
right at all but I do tell people that

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.290 
right at all but I do tell people that
would<00:05:03.250> go<00:05:03.400> out<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.669> this<00:05:03.759> kind<00:05:03.970> of<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.120> car

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
would go out to this kind of a car

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.610 
would go out to this kind of a car

which of course ups the price quite a

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.570 
which of course ups the price quite a
bit<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.150> also<00:05:13.419> lowers<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:13.900> fuel<00:05:14.080> economy<00:05:14.580> and

out<00:05:37.810> here<00:05:37.840> on<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.169> open<00:05:38.259> road

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
out here on the open road
I<00:05:38.830> think<00:05:39.280> you'll<00:05:39.430> see<00:05:39.550> what<00:05:39.639> I'm<00:05:39.759> talking

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
I think you'll see what I'm talking

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.450 
I think you'll see what I'm talking
about<00:05:40.150> here<00:05:40.509> so<00:05:44.220> even<00:05:45.220> though<00:05:45.280> it's<00:05:45.400> an

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
about here so even though it's an

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.830 
about here so even though it's an
automatic<00:05:45.729> transmission<00:05:46.000> there<00:05:46.509> it<00:05:46.660> does

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
automatic transmission there it does

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.499 
automatic transmission there it does
have<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.100> sport<00:05:48.100> mode<00:05:48.280> I'm<00:05:48.729> going<00:05:48.910> to<00:05:48.970> go<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.210> the

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
have a sport mode I'm going to go to the

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
left over here let's see it it'll switch

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.969 
left over here let's see it it'll switch
the<00:05:51.400> DS<00:05:51.639> here<00:05:52.030> which<00:05:52.180> is<00:05:52.330> in<00:05:53.229> Drive<00:05:53.590> but<00:05:53.860> it's

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
the DS here which is in Drive but it's

in<00:05:54.070> sport<00:05:54.400> mode<00:05:54.430> which<00:05:54.580> I'll<00:05:54.880> have<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:55.419> hold

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
in sport mode which I'll have it hold

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.779 
in sport mode which I'll have it hold
the<00:05:55.690> shifts<00:05:55.990> longer<00:05:56.860> are<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:57.250> gears<00:05:57.460> longer

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
the shifts longer are the gears longer

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.060 
the shifts longer are the gears longer
rather<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.330> of<00:05:58.930> course<00:05:59.139> there<00:05:59.289> is<00:05:59.320> the<00:05:59.530> manual

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
rather and of course there is the manual

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.040 
rather and of course there is the manual
mode<00:06:00.190> where<00:06:00.580> you<00:06:00.669> can<00:06:00.789> go<00:06:00.910> plus<00:06:01.600> and<00:06:01.780> minus

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
mode where you can go plus and minus

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.689 
mode where you can go plus and minus
like<00:06:02.199> that<00:06:02.410> and<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:03.160> nice<00:06:03.280> thing<00:06:03.310> about<00:06:03.490> this

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
like that and the nice thing about this

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.540 
like that and the nice thing about this
vehicle<00:06:04.060> it<00:06:04.270> will<00:06:04.389> actually<00:06:04.810> hold<00:06:05.020> the<00:06:05.229> gears

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
vehicle it will actually hold the gears

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.740 
vehicle it will actually hold the gears
so<00:06:06.550> it's<00:06:06.699> good<00:06:06.880> going<00:06:07.120> here<00:06:07.300> and<00:06:07.389> I<00:06:07.479> want<00:06:07.660> you

so<00:06:16.320> with<00:06:17.040> the<00:06:17.160> 303<00:06:17.640> horsepower<00:06:18.620> this<00:06:19.620> car

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
so with the 303 horsepower this car

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.520 
so with the 303 horsepower this car
really<00:06:20.070> has<00:06:20.190> no<00:06:20.520> problems<00:06:21.920> passing

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
available horsepower and torque this car

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.120 
available horsepower and torque this car
has<00:06:30.570> it<00:06:30.600> has<00:06:30.870> no<00:06:31.080> problems<00:06:31.530> at<00:06:31.620> all<00:06:31.740> getting<00:06:31.980> up

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
has it has no problems at all getting up

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.550 
has it has no problems at all getting up
and<00:06:32.310> not<00:06:32.430> off<00:06:32.730> the<00:06:32.910> line<00:06:33.090> it's<00:06:34.050> also<00:06:34.200> great<00:06:34.500> for

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
and not off the line it's also great for

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.160 
and not off the line it's also great for
passing<00:06:35.130> slow<00:06:35.910> semi<00:06:36.390> trucks<00:06:36.690> going<00:06:36.930> over<00:06:37.080> to

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
passing slow semi trucks going over to

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.620 
passing slow semi trucks going over to
mountain<00:06:37.410> pass<00:06:37.590> and<00:06:37.920> that<00:06:38.550> I<00:06:38.760> think<00:06:39.090> Infiniti

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
mountain pass and that I think Infiniti

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.200 
mountain pass and that I think Infiniti
did<00:06:40.260> a<00:06:40.290> really<00:06:40.650> really<00:06:41.070> nice<00:06:41.220> job<00:06:41.250> of<00:06:41.790> getting

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
did a really really nice job of getting

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.710 
did a really really nice job of getting
the<00:06:42.540> power<00:06:43.190> ratio<00:06:44.190> going<00:06:44.460> on<00:06:44.670> this<00:06:44.820> vehicle

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
the power ratio going on this vehicle

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.480 
the power ratio going on this vehicle
especially<00:06:45.900> for<00:06:46.320> a<00:06:46.560> rather<00:06:46.740> heavy<00:06:46.980> vehicle

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
especially for a rather heavy vehicle

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.580 
especially for a rather heavy vehicle
and<00:06:47.790> I<00:06:48.480> think<00:06:48.720> once<00:06:48.990> you<00:06:49.110> drive<00:06:49.380> this<00:06:49.530> car

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
and I think once you drive this car

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.530 
and I think once you drive this car
assuming<00:06:50.160> you<00:06:50.220> don't<00:06:50.310> mind<00:06:50.520> the<00:06:50.640> stiff<00:06:50.880> ride<00:06:51.150> I

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
assuming you don't mind the stiff ride I

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.210 
assuming you don't mind the stiff ride I
think<00:06:52.140> it's<00:06:52.290> very<00:06:52.440> competitive<00:06:52.830> in<00:06:53.100> this

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
think it's very competitive in this

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.460 
think it's very competitive in this
price<00:06:53.460> point<00:06:53.700> and<00:06:54.080> I<00:06:55.080> would<00:06:55.350> definitely

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
price point and I would definitely

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.900 
price point and I would definitely
encourage<00:06:55.710> you<00:06:55.980> to<00:06:56.070> give<00:06:56.310> it<00:06:56.340> a<00:06:56.460> whirl<00:06:56.610> so

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
encourage you to give it a whirl so

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.120 
encourage you to give it a whirl so
