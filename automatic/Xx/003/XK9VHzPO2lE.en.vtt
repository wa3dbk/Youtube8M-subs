00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.310
 if a student dotcom journalism in 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 line 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.120
 in what refers to the calendar 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.660
 we adjust it and you have 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.630
 a sheet that says it will start on the 28th 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.670
 January this pre - registration is in 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.160
 line and will conclude on February 15 but 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.100
 also that we have divided it into three 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.560
 large stages 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.650
 first in a first stage on Monday 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.910
 January 28 to February 3 will have to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.670
 pre-register 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.239
 and children who have brothers in turn 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.489
 schools together with those who 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.030
 workers who have children right there 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.390
 we are giving them practically seven 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.309
 days and then we're going to continue with the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.519
 schools near the private home 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.920
 or from the work that we are leaving there is a 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.949
 Monday period from January 4 to 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.600
 Sunday, February 10 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.259
 uninterruptedly from 8 in the morning to 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.530
 8 at night and he and the public in 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.840
 general is to say the last stage that 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.789
 will be from Monday, February 11 to Friday 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.300
 February 15 also so 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:20.000
 uninterrupted you will wonder 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.009
 good what are the changes of the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.039
 compared to last year so that 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:29.330
 effectively this is improved and I would say 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:33.170
 to devote a greater number of days 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.930
 divide the period into stages in keeping 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.180
 Saturdays and Sundays included in how 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.400
 able to 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.490
 activity 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.830
 having a greater number of centers 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.660
 now we will see it in those who 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.260
 parents can go and 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.510
 from there to process their own 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.570
 pre-registrations in the incorporation of 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.420
 greater number of support institutions 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.430
 there it is and we will also have that that is 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.710
 important to mention the period of 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.610
 traditional pre-registration in the same 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.740
 date 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:12.180
 the pre-enrollment options as 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:14.620
 we were pointing right now there are 31 234 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.780
 pages 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.790
 or websites that can be accessed 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.159
 but even more we are going to have a call 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.610
 center that to achieve this 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:30.549
 pre-registration by telephone 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.709
 we are increasing I think 10 ladies 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.230
 more than they will have to support us here in the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.340
 central that will have to meet the demand 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.190
 that by this telephone route is carried out 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.220
 the pre-registrations are 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.190
 say when the teacher or the father of 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.950
 family to carry it out will have to 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.739
 perform in our seven offices 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.560
 regional services that parents of 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.030
 family know them very well 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.050
 we are also going to 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.360
 support us with the facilities of the 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.290
 Western university eventually 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.970
 in some administrative units and 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.410
 certainly in all the offices of 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.010
 regional services of the secretariat 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:20.050
 that is also an advance there was the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.750
 necessary training leading to the 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.770
 responsible for this program in both 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.330
 secretaries toured the entire state 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.820
 doing the training of who 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.739
 they will receive the request or the 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.750
 pre-registration request from 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.380
 parents in the zones 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.380
 regional
