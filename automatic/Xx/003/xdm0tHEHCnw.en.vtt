 phan daylife of the aiff palette this is 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.110
 the palette practically chose this 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.219
 cabbage a few months I wanted can 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.960
 find 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.500
 inside there are four blushes that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.369
 are the big ones there are eight lipsticks 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.359
 glosses that are the little ones on the side and 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:30.840
 6 12 18 24 some eye shadows for art 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.420
 some opaque are all magnetic there 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.630
 they also give a small surgeon set 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.719
 as far as you can take and take away 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.040
 various ni products and can be put 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.260
 inside a small stick that you 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.969
 always comes with an empty core kit where 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.410
 in fact you create the paddle you brought in 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.930
 around then what was in bed here 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.350
 this then I put a gloss I put four 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.120
 eye shadows decide what to put the price 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.500
 of the palette should be about 49 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.420
 dollars when i bought it cost him 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.680
 75 morally, they realized football 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.020
 the other one brings people yes 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.539
 complained and lowered the price 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.360
 they put it 59 we see a little watched 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.580
 and the eyeshadows these are his 8 gods 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.080
 first colors these here as you can 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.950
 see the only two that really are 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.049
 intense this dark is this one 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.920
 large ray type others are 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.170
 enough heels these are the others 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.790
 these are the colors below 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.240
 and here too the two darker colors yes 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.240
 they see but the others are not enough 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.790
 pigmented the other six colors these 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.140
 the low and even here we can see that 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.150
 I am quite light as the only tones 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.920
 dark obviously the opaque black that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.110
 but the most is not super homogeneous 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.579
 I think this is absolutely beautiful 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.970
 which seems to niger but you actually see 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.790
 which is a very beautiful violet wisteria 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.829
 as a color even if polight ed 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.750
 finally the last six colors and these 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.540
 here in the other you also see those 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.340
 that today there are few of you 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.310
 dark on these instead a little better on 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.369
 four blush bars 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.079
 this land i am not sure though 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.250
 so two comfortable ones are I blush in one 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.800
 kind of illuminating a kind of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.110
 earth but very very light too 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.430
 these are the first 4 lipsticks 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.420
 gloss so 1234 you see that there is need 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.890
 2 lipsticks and in the middle the two glosses 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.690
 these events had almost red 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.910
 nothing the lipsticks are beautiful are 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.530
 again a nice color though me 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.319
 obviously the lipsticks must please 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.810
 giardina that I am a little the thing 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.940
 particular because obviously it is more 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.190
 difficult to put than a 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.560
 treats stick or at least one with 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.459
 the applicator and then 2 more lipsticks 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.290
 2 gloss 1234 also lost here see you 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:53.750
 very little and lipsticks have gods 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:55.299
 beautiful colors eye shadows are 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.380
 quite easy to blend 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.060
 we say that surely it is possible 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.560
 create a nice eye makeup because 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.709
 within politics and there are 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.579
 at least 8 really valid eyeshadows the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.640
 my problem is that only the eyeshadow the 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:14.720
 dialogue st scoop there are 26 the 24 are 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.819
 there are 24 eye shadows and therefore 18 are 18 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.900
 that I really like others 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.370
 they are all very similar to each other 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.170
 all these very clear here 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.260
 they all look like they don't see much 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:31.130
 difference there is not a color type a 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:34.760
 donatino bronzino a charlatans not there 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.230
 colors are a little more intermediate than 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.690
 they manage to give a little more dimension 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.250
 to the trick so this problem 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.569
 Mainly the fact that we symbols 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.970
 I can do a nice trick with this 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.400
 palette but only using 78 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.590
 colors and all the others less bad 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.459
 instead they are there doing nothing 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.620
 put the lipstick said this above 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:00.850
 that a little more fishing puts some 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:03.139
 blush mib leaves very light and you 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.090
 only half a day very well 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.090
 so my time for this product 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.440
 is 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.550
 drum roll 5 means 5 and a half 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.620
 because for me it is not 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.510
 reaches sufficiency because they are there 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.510
 too many colors inside that are little 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.979
 pigmented they write it very well there 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.100
 are others that I like very much both 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.510
 lipsticks that eye shadows however is that me 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.889
 left in the past in the past said a 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.240
 but it is not that they are very bad either 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.520
 here two others are hardly seen 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.900
 But even just as far 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.550
 especially eye shadows because with that 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.970
 80 percent made up by priests 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.130
 moretti others are not seen being with 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.410
 that of the palettes was normal or 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.790
 daylight is called daylife it was normal 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.620
 that you spot very light colors 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.020
 but then he could have put a little 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.520
 more than opaque brownish but 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.040
 also the light brown almost there are 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.229
 they don't write so much so let's say 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.790
 which for me is not there 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.979
 I would buy because I don't see that I'm not 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.060
 in short, using it as stakes is not 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.470
 among my stops lett 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.470
 hello beauties
