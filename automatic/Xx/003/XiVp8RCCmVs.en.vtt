00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
sidecar but I felt that one was too

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.490 
sidecar but I felt that one was too
small<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.300> authentic<00:00:24.869> enough<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
small and not authentic enough the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.490 
small and not authentic enough the
German<00:00:25.830> side<00:00:26.010> cause<00:00:26.250> looked<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.840> well

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
German side cause looked like so well

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.900
