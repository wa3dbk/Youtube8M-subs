00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 do not 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.610
 I found something I go by yourself 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.800
 found something interesting the 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.840
 structure is to put an object in one of 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.790
 they several take the place more 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.520
 asymmetric of several backs of the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.730
 zone there are no records less than blocks 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.600
 something important for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.629
 teleporter and eyes 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 I want to know what is that you are 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.760
 needing things we should not 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.610
 in paradise for small base 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.510
 I will take care of the same groom 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.510
 the teleporter 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.900
 wow you saw the results in September 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.520
 prime are very good 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.560
 far exceeds the rest of the others 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 you recruit the lord 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.320
 apparently I have tried to promote 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.270
 but always he refuses to accept 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.260
 entering an assault team it seems that 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.080
 he loves being a recruit 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.520
 how stupid do not know how many recruits 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.880
 they would give anything to be in a 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880
 team 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.450
 yes I know it is something strange but still 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.450
 very good 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.510
 you know I've been thinking what if 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.159
 you promote your sister's squad 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.549
 Maybe that does accept it 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.289
 or you're right I 've never thought about that 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.770
 it will work thank you very much and look for it 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.770
 right now 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.250
 hello sports in the people what happens 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.630

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.610

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.319
 soldier and he wanted you to enter a 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.840
 assault team no thanks 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.510
 I'm still a recruit, I do not think I'm ready 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.550
 for spartan operations listen 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.200
 prime you may think you do not but 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.550
 we have seen something very big in 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.620
 you have the talent and the potential 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.450
 necessary to be a great expert but 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.510
 finally it is a decision if you want to continue 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.000
 here then come out big as you 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.560
 sister finally this is the last time 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.739

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.630
 you want to come in my sister who has to 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.060
 see her with this 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.830
 I did not tell you the team has been promoted 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.940
 firewall assault led by your 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.430
 Sister Renata is kidding 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.660

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.430
 do not 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.950
 when you say that I meet with my new 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.200
 team then 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.020
 I'm glad to hear that 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.780
 but I know that I do it for her, I know 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.849
 that I 'm not ready for this in case something 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.489
