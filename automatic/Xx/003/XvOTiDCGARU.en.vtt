kind of like color blocks coming from a
center<00:04:23.610> point<00:04:23.910> which<00:04:24.330> would<00:04:24.479> be<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.750> top<00:04:24.960> of

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
center point which would be the top of

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.830 
center point which would be the top of
the<00:04:25.289> beach<00:04:25.410> ball<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.919> curve<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.880> lines<00:04:27.120> just

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
the beach ball to curve the lines just

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.279 
the beach ball to curve the lines just
slightly<00:04:28.560> because<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.639> ball<00:04:29.789> is<00:04:29.820> round<00:04:30.570> so

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
slightly because the ball is round so

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.719 
slightly because the ball is round so
you<00:04:31.349> kind<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.740> want<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:32.010> give<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.610> illusion

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
you kind of want to give the illusion

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.360 
you kind of want to give the illusion
that<00:04:33.389> it's<00:04:33.780> kind<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.440> round<00:04:34.710> shape<00:04:34.860> on<00:04:35.190> the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
that it's kind of a round shape on the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.589 
that it's kind of a round shape on the
nail<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.610> then<00:04:35.880> you're<00:04:36.030> just<00:04:36.090> going<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.419> fill

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
nail and then you're just going to fill

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.230 
nail and then you're just going to fill
it<00:04:36.720> in<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:37.410> okay<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:38.039> this<00:04:38.340> top<00:04:38.789> area<00:04:39.210> is

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
it in it's okay if this top area is

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.939 
it in it's okay if this top area is
really<00:04:39.720> messy<00:04:40.050> because<00:04:40.199> once<00:04:40.590> we're<00:04:40.800> done

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
really messy because once we're done

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.770 
really messy because once we're done
with<00:04:41.160> our<00:04:41.190> colors<00:04:41.699> we<00:04:42.180> are<00:04:42.300> going<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.570> pop<00:04:42.750> a
