00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hi there, recently, a friend of mine 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:09.150
 prompted me to walk to zero cups 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.830
 that is how strange it sounds I don't know 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.110
 how to call it well for example when you 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.960
 go master league by the way i'm there recently 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 was and immediately went down here to zero then 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.439
 eat when you go master or you 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.930
 burn food master in league champion 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.960
 into crystal and so on how to call 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.429
 when you go to 0 I don’t know 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.199
 call here 0 cups and here's one my 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.540
 comrade recommended me to go down 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.210
 precisely in zero cups because type there 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.750
 cool farm well I do not know, let's be 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.120
 check how cool the farm is here 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.640
 how long did it take me 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.890
 took about I don't even know 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.539
 three hours probably that's but in total 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.920
 complexity of course did a certain 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.800
 perrier and breaks 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 I was successfully raised up to here and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.910
 in my own way this little one 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.520
 hike during the hike 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.420
 Here I saw a lot of really 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.619
 bass steep but where have I seen both 300 and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.820
 400 thousand and the elixir of gold that is well 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.220
 it was all 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.080
 but honestly, the closer to zero cups 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.030
 the less like bass 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.920
 that is, in fact , for those who want 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.490
 farm farm then I recommend more 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.869
 about 200 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.520
 two hundred three hundred cups over there 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.979
 really farm is quite good 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.420
 see we see these are the bases yes where 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.340
 9 town hall 100 thousand gold 350000 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.329
 Alik, that is, it is generally the usual 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 I do not know the phenomenon here I can not attack 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.180
 but the video still allows me to search 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.600
 then you can find it more tasty here 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.850
 one more thing i was counting here 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.729
 see abandoned whale eat when me 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.430
 comrade said it was very nice here 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.829
 Farm I thought that probably very much here 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.299
 many abandoned rented town 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.320
 hall that is naturally if we 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.000
 take out the town hall 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.310
 sooner or later 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 we will be brought down that is usually 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.130
 can happen a month before that is we 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.620
 we can go to zero cups without any 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.410
 problems yes well, if not to zero but to the area 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.270
 two-three hundred cups without problems but on 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.190
 actually abandoned here is not so 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.700
 many, that is, pay attention 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.040
 while I look at the mines they are all empty 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.510
 There is this living accounts live people yes the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.770
 there is now we see that its course 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.600
 are attacking but he has everything in a bunch 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.850
 and again this is me on zero cups 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.680
 how many cups do these guys have 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.340
 Unfortunately, I do not know, but I think I’m definitely less 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.380
 hundreds that's why if you count 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.910
 find if you still view this 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.780
 video decide to go down when they 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.120
 somewhere there are 300 200 cups then I will give you 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.290
 I recommend all the same not to count on 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.110
 the fact that there will be a lot 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.090
 abandoned abandoned to really little here 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.420
 even if you look at this one of course 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.430
 the base is unique but most likely it is not 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.650
 abandoned to because again he has 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:13.380
 complete more precisely empty mines what else 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.799
 straight to the cups zero true fans 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.830
 I recommend going down because starting 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.830
 somewhere composition with 150 cups at night and for 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.280
 every defeat us minus the street we have 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.260
 one cup is therefore too there 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.530
 count on something well let's 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.019
 probably take him 200 thousand 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.550
 I won’t look for gold anymore 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.970
 plainly for the best 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.230
 I did not see I do not know whether 200 small such 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.990
 greedy I do n't even know that well let's 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.090
 let's take him I think where is he here 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.640
 clan caste I don't understand anything at all 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.060
 this base here is his sasha column then he has 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.220
 let's see cool here 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.380
 stop I think under zero at all without 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.570
 problems and I do not answer anything all 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.940
 cool mean 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:09.340
 it turns out to be flying like this 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.100
 just no problem two groups of balls i don't 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.740
 I know what they think they will do here. 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.150
 without anything 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:23.560
 pretty that was pretty them so 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.090
 times shredded over the entire database ie zero 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.830
 cups is really very interesting then 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.670
 have you see the numbers here 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:35.800
 200 thousand and I believe the word I saw 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:38.740
 here and by 300 thousand by 400 thousand saw 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.730
 gold or bye while walking here actually 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.780
 better farm course better farm 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.240
 two hundred three hundred cups because below already 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.620
 I can see how much more 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.840
 I don't see such a super cool guy 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.830
 let's really think about 200 thousand 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.930
 gold elixir to see on zero cups 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.680
 but I personally did not expect so I just 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.750
 it surprised me a little bit I think you 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.910
 you who do not know this info you too 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.710
 it will be interesting maybe you will go down 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.710
 if you go down write in comments 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.160
 if that is, well, just really for 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.790
 I am surprised yes I mean I attack 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.620
 there are 150.2 thousand in crystal in 1 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.660
 Crystal leagues for me, for example, comfortable 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.780
 be there I don't know in the second 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.040
 crystal there is the same farm as 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.050
 in the zeros of the cups so here in essence 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.750
 strain is not necessary yes that is, if you 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.920
 do you have there 200 cups you are fine 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.900
 farm yourself 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.210
 breen and cool don't have to chase for 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.920
 what cups is not necessary here but 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.940
 only abandoned not so 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.860
 a lot that is, I already answer right away 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.930
 the question that you can ask what 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.880
 these people are doing everything here yes they are more likely 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.430
 just for the same reasons or they 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.840
 are hiding just trying to keep their 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.640
 resources are hiding meet by the way how 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.710
 nice to see when they give me 45 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.770
 Cup honest word this is just 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.200
 cool if they gave me such a champion 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.870
 whether in the master but here there are many many 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.110
 people here hide a lot of people too 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.300
 go to zero then there is this some way 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.300
 saying as an achievement in the game until when you 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.300
 already there have risen to 9 10 tons of halls 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.460
 go back to zero and from there start 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.950
 re climbing up i mean 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.380
 principle, I think it is well, I do not know this 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.440
 I don't know a normal fun idea with one 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.060
 hand it is stupid because what 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.850
 the meaning is not so hard just 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.730
 you need to spend three hours there and 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.130
 anyone can go down to 0 but 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.070
 I was really interested to see 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.050
 what is really going on here yet 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:56.210
 this will do a little promotion under 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:57.050
 the end of my video I'm on this hike 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.240
 cup 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.200
 I have done very well for myself 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.480
 discovery I will check 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:10.160
 check your idea and soon in 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:12.530
 next week I'll post a video about 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.720
 the discovery that I made exactly 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.570
 here he is in zero cups so watch 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.340
 for updating on my channel to all 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.740
 good luck thank you put likes 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.990
 comments will be very happy to talk with 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.990
 Thank you in the comments
