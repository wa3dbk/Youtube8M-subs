00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the steam rising that allows the steam

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.060 
the steam rising that allows the steam
to<00:00:57.090> start<00:00:57.329> evaporating<00:00:57.570> quickly<00:00:58.379> quickly<00:00:58.829> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
to start evaporating quickly quickly so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.200 
to start evaporating quickly quickly so
we<00:00:59.190> don't<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> pan<00:01:00.449> full<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.870> water<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
we don't have a pan full of water so

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.390 
we don't have a pan full of water so
what<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.170> scoot<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> spinach<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.400 
what I like to do is scoot the spinach a
little<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> side<00:01:07.250> tops<00:01:08.250> my

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:21.400 

garlic<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.500> shallots<00:01:13.010> in<00:01:13.190> there

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.920 

when<00:01:22.410> I<00:01:22.500> finish<00:01:22.800> put<00:01:23.010> my<00:01:23.130> spinach<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:26.930> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
when I finish put my spinach in here you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.469 
when I finish put my spinach in here you
see<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.410> this<00:01:28.620> pan<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.760> relatively<00:01:30.300> dry

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
see how this pan is relatively dry

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.390 
see how this pan is relatively dry
that's<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.410> was<00:01:34.590> nice<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.070> hot<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
that's because it was nice and hot and

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.370 
that's because it was nice and hot and
most<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.580> that<00:01:38.610> steam<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.060> evaporating

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.770 

we'll<00:01:44.920> just<00:01:45.070> toss<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.520> around<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.510> just

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
we'll just toss it around and this just

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
we'll just toss it around and this just
takes<00:01:47.400> about<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:48.580> minute<00:01:49.030> or<00:01:49.090> two<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:50.560> wilt

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
takes about a minute or two to to wilt

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.830 
takes about a minute or two to to wilt
and<00:01:51.040> cook<00:01:51.220> down<00:01:51.370> and<00:01:51.610> as<00:01:51.700> soon<00:01:51.909> as<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.150> it<00:01:52.390> wilts

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and cook down and as soon as it it wilts

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.860 
and cook down and as soon as it it wilts
it's<00:01:52.990> done<00:01:53.229> I<00:01:53.470> turn<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.070> heat<00:01:54.220> off
