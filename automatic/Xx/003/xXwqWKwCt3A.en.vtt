00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
cooling hmm so expecting great things in

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
cooling hmm so expecting great things in
this<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> I'll<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:57.870> check<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> cooling

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this so I'll just check the cooling

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.540 
this so I'll just check the cooling
setup<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.489> cool<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.789> go<00:00:59.910> through<00:01:00.180> here

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
setup so cool and go through here

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.429 
setup so cool and go through here
probably<00:01:02.550> sucking<00:01:02.910> stuff<00:01:03.329> from<00:01:04.110> underneath

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
probably sucking stuff from underneath

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.800 
probably sucking stuff from underneath
as<00:01:04.769> well<00:01:04.970> just<00:01:05.970> cleaning<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.390> through<00:01:06.600> here

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
as well just cleaning it through here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.730 
as well just cleaning it through here
but<00:01:07.049> I'm<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.350> checking<00:01:07.500> there's<00:01:07.710> no

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
but I'm just checking there's no

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
but I'm just checking there's no
obstructions<00:01:08.340> there's<00:01:08.520> nothing<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:08.990> can

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
obstructions there's nothing really can

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
obstructions there's nothing really can
I<00:01:10.049> stop<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> air<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.710> frying<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.820> flying

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I stop the air for frying I'm flying

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.440 
I stop the air for frying I'm flying
around<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.110> maybe<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.619> bit<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
around there maybe this little bit is

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.609 
around there maybe this little bit is
causing<00:01:15.450> problem<00:01:15.689> new<00:01:15.780> purists<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.320> probably

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
here we see the fruits of my labor and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
here we see the fruits of my labor and
after<00:01:50.130> installing<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:52.020> looking<00:01:52.439> about<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
after installing it all looking about a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.730 
after installing it all looking about a
average<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.610> about<00:01:53.670> 55<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.630> 60<00:01:54.990> frames<00:01:55.590> per

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
average of about 55 to 60 frames per

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.920 
average of about 55 to 60 frames per
second<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.700> cij<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.630> lesser<00:01:58.640> salamanca

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
second with the cij at lesser salamanca

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.120 
second with the cij at lesser salamanca
so<00:02:00.930> yeah<00:02:01.079> unwrapped<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:01.950> much<00:02:02.070> more

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
so yeah unwrapped it's just so much more

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.960 
so yeah unwrapped it's just so much more
fluid

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.469
