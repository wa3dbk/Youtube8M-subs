I<00:00:22.680> tend<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.130> leave<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.369> off<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> side<00:00:23.850> I

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
I tend to leave it off to the side I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120 
I tend to leave it off to the side I
think<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.240> looks<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> little<00:00:24.539> silly<00:00:25.099> so<00:00:26.099> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
think it looks a little silly so I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.470 
think it looks a little silly so I
haven't<00:00:26.400> been<00:00:26.550> vehicle<00:00:26.910> mode<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.060> tend<00:00:27.330> like

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
haven't been vehicle mode I tend like

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.570 
haven't been vehicle mode I tend like
this<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.930> mean<00:00:28.349> he<00:00:28.680> looks<00:00:28.830> kind<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.070> small<00:00:29.189> for

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
this I mean he looks kind of small for

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.450 
this I mean he looks kind of small for
vehicle<00:00:30.019> and<00:00:31.019> vehicle<00:00:31.470> mode<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.920> any<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.279> he's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
vehicle and vehicle mode and any is he's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.500 
vehicle and vehicle mode and any is he's
a<00:00:32.489> little<00:00:32.700> smaller<00:00:32.910> than<00:00:33.059> some<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> others

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
a little smaller than some of the others

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.970 
a little smaller than some of the others
but<00:00:33.690> not<00:00:34.350> horribly<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:36.170> he<00:00:37.170> rolls<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:37.649> well

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.889 

and<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.100> fairly<00:00:41.430> accurate<00:00:41.910> representation<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
and a fairly accurate representation of

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.770 
and a fairly accurate representation of
his<00:00:43.110> alt<00:00:43.530> form<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> show<00:00:44.629> one<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
his alt form on the show one of the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.660 
his alt form on the show one of the
things<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.050> think<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> neat<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.710> due<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> way

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
things I think is neat is due to the way

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.119 
things I think is neat is due to the way
the<00:00:47.700> transformation<00:00:48.450> joints<00:00:48.780> work<00:00:49.129> without

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the transformation joints work without

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.709 
the transformation joints work without
breaking<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> apart<00:00:50.700> or<00:00:51.030> anything<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.390> in

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
breaking it apart or anything you can in

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.250 
breaking it apart or anything you can in
fact<00:00:51.899> angle<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> plow<00:00:52.820> off<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> side<00:00:54.989> like

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
fact angle the plow off to the side like

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.650 
fact angle the plow off to the side like
you<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.620> real<00:00:55.800> snow<00:00:56.070> plows<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:57.480> works

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
you see with real snow plows it works

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.319 
you see with real snow plows it works
both<00:00:57.840> ways<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.609> pushing<00:00:59.940> snow<00:01:00.090> off

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
both ways so you can be pushing snow off

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.560 
both ways so you can be pushing snow off
that<00:01:00.570> way<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.899> way<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:02.149> know<00:01:03.149> he<00:01:03.270> doesn't<00:01:03.420> do

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that way that way I know he doesn't do

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.670 
that way that way I know he doesn't do
any<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> show<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.530> just

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
any of that on the show but I just

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.090 
any of that on the show but I just
thought<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> nice<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.640> feature<00:01:05.790> on

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
thought it was a nice little feature on

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.160 
thought it was a nice little feature on
the<00:01:08.100> transform<00:01:08.520> into<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.880> robot<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.020> want

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the transform into a robot you just want

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.740 
the transform into a robot you just want
to<00:01:10.200> take<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> cab<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.540> pull<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.600> whole

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
to take the cab here and pull the whole

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.770 
to take the cab here and pull the whole
thing<00:01:12.780> back<00:01:13.170> snap<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:14.780> lift

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
thing back snap it in back here lift

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.160 
thing back snap it in back here lift
this<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.520> that's<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.820> his<00:01:17.970> legs<00:01:18.210> when

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this up that's going to be his legs when

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.230 
this up that's going to be his legs when
I<00:01:19.320> got<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.979> ahead<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.220> pop<00:01:20.460> his<00:01:20.670> arms<00:01:20.909> out

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.609 

and<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.930> arms<00:01:25.290> come<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:27.350> rotate<00:01:28.350> rotate

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and the arms come up here rotate rotate

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.679 
and the arms come up here rotate rotate
him<00:01:28.890> down<00:01:29.040> there's<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:29.970> plugs<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.390> here

him down there's little plugs on here
that<00:01:30.799> tab<00:01:31.799> into<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> wheels<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.520> don't<00:01:32.670> have

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that tab into the wheels they don't have

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.280 
that tab into the wheels they don't have
in<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:33.180> away<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.630> kind<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> rotate<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
in right away just kind of rotate the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.170 
in right away just kind of rotate the
wheel<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.520> slots<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
wheel there are little slots in the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.969 
wheel there are little slots in the
wheel<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.630> match<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> tabs<00:01:37.799> on

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
wheel that match up with the tabs on

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.560 
wheel that match up with the tabs on
here<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.460> need<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.180> rotate

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
here so if you need to just just rotate

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
here so if you need to just just rotate
it<00:01:39.600> until<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.930> tabs<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:41.240> rotate<00:01:42.240> them<00:01:42.420> down<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it until it tabs in rotate them down and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.130 
it until it tabs in rotate them down and
you<00:01:43.950> pull<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> legs<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.149> lower<00:01:45.659> body<00:01:45.899> all

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you pull the legs in the lower body all

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.399 
you pull the legs in the lower body all
the<00:01:46.229> way<00:01:46.259> down<00:01:46.700> split<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> legs<00:01:47.939> apart<00:01:48.409> pull

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the way down split the legs apart pull

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.679 
the way down split the legs apart pull
his<00:01:49.500> head<00:01:49.649> up<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.979> forward<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
his head up and forward and then you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.219 
his head up and forward and then you
separate<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> shoulder<00:01:52.770> pad<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.479> bring<00:01:55.049> them

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
separate the shoulder pad and bring them

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.249 
separate the shoulder pad and bring them
down<00:01:55.380> over<00:01:55.560> his<00:01:55.770> shoulders<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:57.049> then<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.170> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
down over his shoulders and then if you

and<00:02:20.510> short<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.500> lot<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.680> that's<00:02:21.890> just

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
and short and a lot of that's just

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.170 
and short and a lot of that's just
because<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.489> these<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.790> these<00:02:22.910> broad

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
because of these of these broad

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.800 
because of these of these broad
shoulders<00:02:23.630> up<00:02:23.750> here<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.569> know<00:02:26.660> some

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
shoulders up here and you know some

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.360 
shoulders up here and you know some
pictures<00:02:26.930> had<00:02:27.290> him<00:02:27.470> with<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.770> folded<00:02:28.250> down

pictures had him with this folded down

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.190 
pictures had him with this folded down
so<00:02:28.700> he<00:02:28.970> looked<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.270> lot<00:02:29.420> shorter<00:02:29.780> than<00:02:29.930> he<00:02:30.080> was

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
so he looked a lot shorter than he was

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.670 
so he looked a lot shorter than he was
supposed<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.530> be<00:02:34.750> but<00:02:35.750> as<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.050> can<00:02:36.140> see<00:02:36.380> I'm

supposed to be but as you can see I'm

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.199 
supposed to be but as you can see I'm
here<00:02:36.920> he<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.160> with<00:02:37.690> with<00:02:38.690> jazz<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:41.120> you

here he is with with jazz and if you
look<00:02:41.360> at<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.840> head<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.680> not<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.950> whole<00:02:43.220> lot

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
look at the head it's not a whole lot

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.610

but the top of the head Sentinel Prime

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.530 
but the top of the head Sentinel Prime
is<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:45.980> fact<00:02:46.220> just<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.640> smidge<00:02:46.940> taller<00:02:47.269> than

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.259 
is in fact just a smidge taller than
jazz<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.680> he's<00:02:48.860> not<00:02:49.040> small<00:02:49.430> by<00:02:49.640> any<00:02:49.670> means<00:02:50.060> he

just looks kind of squat just due to the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.809 
just looks kind of squat just due to the
broadness<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.900> his<00:02:54.200> upper<00:02:54.470> torso<00:02:54.680> but<00:02:55.670> he's
