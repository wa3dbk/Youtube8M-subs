00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.869
 yes, if I so prehistory 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:13.879
 our game 54 in a good memory 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:17.619
 to report that we as crass 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:21.829
 outsiders in the sink went to the beer 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.029
 and unfortunately feel a relative 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.369
 quickly the 1 0 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.220
 but we did not let it through 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.579
 but irritate Trading Course made 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.989
 just before half-time the 1 1 was us 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.520
 Of course, at half-time 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.520
 gave a different boost 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.060
 and I have to say we have one 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.050
 coalition and we realized that too 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.720
 class lulls slowly tired and so on 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:56.110
 we had success on ours 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:01:01.000
 side that were just says true rush 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.000
 won with 5 2 1 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:12.250
 when I get that together 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.250
 probably still a good one 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.610
 different what he was 100,000 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.600
 yes the people were sitting in the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.960
 Trams and the streets in front of them 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.939
 be the power turned off 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.020
 otherwise the would not have gone had 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:54.700
 overwhelming and that's one thing 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.700
 you simply say any case know
