thing<00:01:12.520> I<00:01:12.939> was<00:01:13.270> wondering<00:01:13.659> is<00:01:13.780> where's<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
thing I was wondering is where's the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.020 
thing I was wondering is where's the
webcam<00:01:15.069> function<00:01:17.249> it<00:01:18.249> doesn't<00:01:18.609> have<00:01:18.759> it<00:01:18.909> in

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
webcam function it doesn't have it in

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.440

browser

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.139 

I<00:01:28.869> think<00:01:29.649> that<00:01:29.799> should<00:01:30.009> be<00:01:30.070> built<00:01:30.430> in<00:01:30.640> for<00:01:30.939> part

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
I think that should be built in for part

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.550 
I think that should be built in for part

my YouTube blackberry playbook tip of
the<00:02:39.250> day<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:41.850> think<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.060> webcam<00:02:43.989> there<00:02:44.650> should

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
the day I think the webcam there should

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.479 
the day I think the webcam there should
be<00:02:44.829> another<00:02:45.100> button<00:02:45.370> right<00:02:45.579> here<00:02:45.840> webcam<00:02:47.489> or

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
be another button right here webcam or

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.539 
be another button right here webcam or
that<00:02:49.359> should<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.410> this<00:02:51.010> button

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
that should have it in this button

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.930 
that should have it in this button
