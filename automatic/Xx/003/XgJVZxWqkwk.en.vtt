pocket pro this came out a couple years
later<00:02:55.750> much<00:02:56.590> smaller<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.190> designers<00:02:57.609> can

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
later much smaller and designers can

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.699 
later much smaller and designers can
compare<00:02:58.209> its<00:02:58.329> size<00:02:58.359> is<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:58.989> screens<00:02:59.530> much

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
compare its size is here screens much

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.349 
compare its size is here screens much
smaller<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.160> takes<00:03:00.310> two<00:03:00.519> double-a<00:03:00.910> batteries

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
smaller it takes two double-a batteries

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.330 
smaller it takes two double-a batteries
and<00:03:01.480> step<00:03:01.660> four<00:03:01.959> yeah<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.680> smaller<00:03:02.950> directional

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and step four yeah a smaller directional

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.430 
and step four yeah a smaller directional
pad<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.489> little<00:03:03.549> bit<00:03:03.730> more<00:03:03.849> responsive<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:05.290> is

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
pad a little bit more responsive this is

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.650 
pad a little bit more responsive this is
your<00:03:05.590> light<00:03:05.739> button<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.220> it's<00:03:06.400> frontlet<00:03:06.910> it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
your light button so it's frontlet it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.390

that but that's that's always
interesting<00:03:44.980> as<00:03:45.069> well<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:45.370> let's<00:03:45.549> power<00:03:45.730> this

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
interesting as well so let's power this

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.659 
interesting as well so let's power this
thing<00:03:45.940> up<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.780> check<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.290> out<00:03:47.380> one<00:03:48.099> issue<00:03:48.280> with

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
thing up and check it out one issue with

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.000 
thing up and check it out one issue with
this<00:03:48.880> thing<00:03:49.120> also<00:03:49.419> is<00:03:49.829> probably<00:03:50.829> called

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
this thing also is probably called

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.849 
this thing also is probably called
ghosting<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.900> frame<00:03:53.290> rates<00:03:53.500> weren't<00:03:53.799> we

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
ghosting so the frame rates weren't we

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.259 
ghosting so the frame rates weren't we
quick<00:03:54.069> enough<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.459> it<00:03:54.609> would<00:03:54.730> cause<00:03:54.910> kind<00:03:55.180> of

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
quick enough and it would cause kind of

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:55.890 
quick enough and it would cause kind of
a<00:03:55.359> blur

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
a blur

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.509 
a blur
you'll<00:03:56.470> see<00:03:56.590> what<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.709> mean<00:03:56.829> they<00:03:57.069> did<00:03:57.220> improve
