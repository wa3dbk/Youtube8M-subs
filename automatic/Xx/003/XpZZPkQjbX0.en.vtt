00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.630
 our first player today kiss omar 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.890

 almost 1,700 euros 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.759
 only two hands pass and it is already the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.060
 time of a new elimination 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.950
 in fact we talk about the love of god 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.729
 super afternoon winner of the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.840
 July 27 remained with little more than 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:10.300
 35,000 chips puts everything in with 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.750
 woman 5 and try everything for everything but 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.040
 find two colleague briano and ours 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.020
 prince own chipleader prince 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.760
 finds a 7 on the flop 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.940
 let's see if there will be the counter-burst of 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:31.510
 gabry year no flowers take off and ho 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.819
 smooth ace therefore makes prince that already 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.170
 however he started in the lead dominating 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.540
 the love of god 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.890
 but then eventually strengthened immediately to 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.739
 flop his hand of man enjoys 2122 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.810
 euro is the satisfaction of having 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.500
 reached the sunday final table 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.739
 special 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.010
 and it is precisely the moment of our beloved 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.190
 well tour mauro papagni very nice 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.480
 we had already seen precisely 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.360
 in an online precedent interview 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.480
 poker show player of bisceglie that 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.840
 unfortunately this time only lasts 12 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.390
 hands in fact he is the short at the moment 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.819
 puts it all in with couple of 10 ma 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.420
 ahi ahi ahi prince who today really is 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:22.120
 in great shape pair of jacks dominates it 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.720
 the great a 80 20 and no help from the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.209
 board 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.069
 therefore it leaves us very hard in the seventh 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:33.610
 position this week a prize of 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:37.530
 almost 3,000 euros and we are the hand one 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.689
 number 44 dark 15,000 dark channel 30,000 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.720
 imponderable opens one for three from the button 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:48.939
 with k 7 but deception decides to send 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.739
 all within imponderables is with k 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.209
 7 the light part 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.120
 advantage deception 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:04:01.810
 everything is flop but be careful 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:04.299
 8 to 7 and k 8 7 k for the outbreak end 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.579
 and rivers just an 8 then scale 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.860
 imponderable deception leaves us in 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:15.579
 sixth position player of Ferrara 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:19.829
 4,668 euros and then the game here 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:24.960
 lengthens even 73 hands are played 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:28.280
 and then the only player is imponderable 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.800
 clearly below the million tokens 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.630
 find a pair of 9 tries send you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.360
 on the opening of easy the tour that 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.350
 however it does then easy with the ace 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.080
 kappa and coin flip would take a 10 or a 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.490
 9 river nothing to do then 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.120
 imponderable leaves us and us for 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:54.410
 consolation we also went to 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:57.980
 interviewing him we hear the cao with 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:01.130
 alessandro michetti with the nickname 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.700
 imponderable and I am the fifth one 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.960
 place of the san giustino and I arrived 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.860
 several times in the first 18 we say the 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.770
 sunday special 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.290
 and then I also made other final tables 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.220
 I made a place at a night on 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:23.090
 stars I made it by profession I am 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.930
 rules like that both sit'n'go 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:30.830
 the mtt of the finalists at the table 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.080
 final I knew about dome venturi 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.169
 who had just had results 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.620
 very important and then others do not 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.380
 I knew well at this point in my opinion 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.000
 but 30 to win the tournament jeffrey 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:49.190
 77 which seemed to me the most concrete 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.539
 a big hello time real pc let's see them 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:58.789
 tables and once in four i 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:02.270
 players opt to share the 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:05.120
 the prize pool opts for a deal is the first 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.190
 eliminated to four players of masi is 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.970
 just the chip leader of the day 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:15.320
 prince 245 in fact to the number hand 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.919
 126 prince 245 goes immediately all in with 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:24.560
 ace 7 but isildur couple of women easy 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:27.979
 with the flop turn and river all smooth and 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.020
 therefore elimination of prince and 245 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:32.060
 who must be satisfied, so to speak 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.880
 14 thousand euros 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.010
 and here is our virtual podium the 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.410
 match three that begins with a Isildur 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.060
 in the position of chip leader even if then 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.890
 in the end it will be he himself 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.530
 abandon the final table 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:49.050
 this is the hand of the false step ace 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:52.650
 ten against ace woman finds 10 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.520
 gabri anno points to 300,000 isildur lo 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.980
 puts all in 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:01.770
 gabry anno isildur eventually opts for a 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.340
 call to an interlocking staircase with a 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.250
 jack 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:09.090
 or a woman or woman is needed 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:12.240
 or jack todd I have nothing to do and so is it 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.700
 the moment of the legs isildur from milan 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:20.610
 leaves us in third place for 15 thousand 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:22.740
 euro and here we are in heads up that opens 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.290
 with capri year in clear advantage over 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.020
 jeffrey de 77 cup that progressively 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.910
 the favors they always have are extended e 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.500
 during the last hand and chip leader 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:36.000
 over 6 times Jeffrey's mail 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:41.400
 here it is the hand of the jack clash 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.660
 female asso 2 trips for gabri arrive 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:49.020
 year and nothing to do for jeffrey a 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.420
 jeffrey who was third at the beginning of 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.490
 day of opening or better at the end 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.690
 of the day coverage and that now there 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.700
 must leave in second position 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.870
 while he who started second 

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.340
 at the beginning of day 2 is just that 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.710
 who took home the tournament that 

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.620
 opened year from villa san giovanni 

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.480
 almost 18 thousand euros for him we resent 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.660
 next week 

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.660
 Hello
