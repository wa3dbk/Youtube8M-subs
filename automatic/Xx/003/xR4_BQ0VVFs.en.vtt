00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello there came another package wrapped 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.809
 With aliexpress in this package we have 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.410
 there should be a 2500 battery 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.990
 milliampere hours for lenovo a660 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.020
 he rode to me with adventures because 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.160
 that the very beginning that is should have 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.099
 to be delivered by ordinary Chinese mail 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.170
 chinapost airmail 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 the seller when I sent gave the track 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.949
 number Singaporean almost no 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.860
 the track number is not a very long time 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.930
 tracked I wrote to the seller that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 why not track number 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.860
 active seller is cold all in 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.660
 okay, don't worry, don't always 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.820
 I will add that everything is fine everything is fine 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.160
 that is, do not worry you have holidays there 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.690
 on were wandering from 1 to 7 number but after 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.570
 it still did not shine well and then 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.670
 opened a dispute because not long 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.500
 tracked more than ten days because 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.359
 as if 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.850
 suspicious situation and the seller to me in 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.840
 answer supposedly we got an error sent 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.390
 you are like something completely different 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.729
 some kind of flax company or how is it 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.890
 there is called with such an interesting one 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.530
 track numbered i mean it's not not 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.909
 quite typical as if absolutely 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.350
 I understand that this is some type 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.600
 Swedish mail here and let's all 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.200
 let's see what do we have in what we 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.200
 ordered 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.600
 here is such 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.180
 metal box with us 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.160
 battery that I can say on it 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 battery saw for 13 million dollars 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.270
 a link to the seller lay below under 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.490
 video 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.920
 I am the person who asked me to order 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.590
 battery recall and shaft so that it does not 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.650
 bought this battery why 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.560
 that i have big doubts here 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.450
 there are two thousand 500 milliamps honest 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.450
 because we are now on the phone or on 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.980
 battery size there by weight well 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.780
 so here is purely intuitive then I am something 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.580
 honestly doubted so here 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:29.050
 box looks box box 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.320
 cool metal cool but in 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.890
 principle how it will affect the very 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.380
 the battery here I do not believe that here 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.760
 maybe two thousand 500 milliamps 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.450
 battery principle is quite like 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.230
 heavy of nothing so special no 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.320
 and I do not know you do not believe go two thousand 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.090
 500 milliamps ie well here rather 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.920
 just the same there well at best 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.100
 1500 I do not know there to to to to to to to 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.480
 Why does one person write like that ? 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.209
 I wanted to and I want to go there 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.780
 standard lenovo a660 1500 battery 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.850
 milliampere 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.700
 not enough there for the day wants more 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.360
 agreed to listen to the pace and scope of that 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.209
 this is not the size of a heavy battery 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.080
 more and more capacity i mean i like 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.060
 dissuaded how could nothing order 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.090
 let's see if there is at least 2 2 200 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.670
 at least I will be honest here, I do 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.010
 Looks cool cool see such 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.120
 holograms shimmer just down 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.020
 beautiful such 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.490
 there is such a hologram, too, pasted 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.990
 very well beautiful and that when cool 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.750
 visually I like very much but how is she 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.960
 I will give almost all to man 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.670
 and ask him not to say there 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.520

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.380

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.750
 time the phone worked longer and 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.920
 Respectively then in the video description 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.250
 Under the video I put there really there 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.100
 the work of the apparatus lasted or so 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:15.210
 as I said, well, here is such a cooler 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:16.700
 thing I donâ€™t know everything is written here 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.200

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.770
 packing metal everything is like a battery 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.690
 beautiful everything is super but let's see how he 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.800

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.930
