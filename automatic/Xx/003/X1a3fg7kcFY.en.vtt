00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
doing this DIY firstly I recommend

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.560 
doing this DIY firstly I recommend
getting<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.890> shirt<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.460> does<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.149> stretch

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
getting a shirt that does not stretch

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.470 
getting a shirt that does not stretch
out<00:00:57.809> while<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> being<00:00:58.770> worn<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.940> really

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
out while it is being worn this really

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.689 
out while it is being worn this really
depends<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.500> material<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> t-shirt

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
depends on the material of the t-shirt

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.509 
depends on the material of the t-shirt
this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.589> ribbons<00:01:04.920> are<00:01:05.129> not

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
this is because the ribbons are not

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.929 
this is because the ribbons are not
elastic<00:01:06.409> unless<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> elastic<00:01:08.460> type

not<00:02:19.270> really<00:02:19.690> need<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.080> ruler<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.560> be<00:02:20.770> that

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
not really need a ruler to be that

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.420 
not really need a ruler to be that
accurate<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:22.000> precise<00:02:22.420> as<00:02:22.950> long<00:02:23.950> as<00:02:24.160> both

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
accurate and precise as long as both

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.340 
accurate and precise as long as both
sleeves<00:02:24.850> are<00:02:25.150> identical<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.350> should<00:02:26.680> be<00:02:26.800> fine

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
sleeves are identical it should be fine

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.160 
sleeves are identical it should be fine
next<00:02:29.550> taking<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.730> ribbon<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.270> measure<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
next taking the ribbon I measure the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.750 
next taking the ribbon I measure the
circumference<00:02:32.710> of<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.280> sleeve<00:02:35.400> once<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.580> get

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
circumference of the sleeve once you get

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.740 
circumference of the sleeve once you get
the<00:02:36.940> desired<00:02:37.270> length<00:02:37.770> cut<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.980> ribbon<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the desired length cut the ribbon I

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.090 
the desired length cut the ribbon I
recommend<00:02:40.750> cutting<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.560> v-shape

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
recommend cutting it in a v-shape

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.940 
recommend cutting it in a v-shape
instead<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:43.000> straight<00:02:43.360> across<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:44.500> prevent

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
instead of straight across to prevent

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.140 
instead of straight across to prevent
the<00:02:45.100> ribbon<00:02:45.430> from<00:02:45.670> fraying

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
the ribbon from fraying

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.840 
the ribbon from fraying
I<00:02:46.270> also<00:02:47.260> recommend<00:02:47.710> to<00:02:48.070> cut<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.520> little<00:02:48.550> bit

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
I also recommend to cut it a little bit

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.630 
I also recommend to cut it a little bit
longer<00:02:49.180> than<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.200> need<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.130> trim<00:02:51.490> up

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
longer than you need so you can trim up

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.590 
longer than you need so you can trim up
the<00:02:51.820> excess<00:02:52.860> remember<00:02:53.860> if<00:02:54.070> it's<00:02:54.580> too<00:02:54.910> long<00:02:55.150> you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
the excess remember if it's too long you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.960 
the excess remember if it's too long you
can<00:02:55.810> cut<00:02:55.990> it<00:02:56.170> shorter<00:02:56.680> but<00:02:57.280> if<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:57.730> too

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
can cut it shorter but if it is too

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.340 
can cut it shorter but if it is too
short<00:02:58.210> you<00:02:58.630> cannot<00:02:59.020> make<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.290> longer<00:03:00.810> yes<00:03:01.810> you

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
short you cannot make it longer yes you

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.040 
short you cannot make it longer yes you
can<00:03:02.590> use<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.980> few<00:03:03.310> ribbons<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.970> form<00:03:04.240> one<00:03:04.630> long

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
can use a few ribbons to form one long

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.040 
can use a few ribbons to form one long
one<00:03:05.080> around<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.040> sleeve<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.640> your<00:03:06.850> shirt<00:03:07.060> but

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
one around the sleeve of your shirt but

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.350 
one around the sleeve of your shirt but
I<00:03:08.260> think<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.830> will<00:03:08.950> be<00:03:09.130> neater<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.820> use<00:03:10.000> one

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
I think it will be neater to use one

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.360 
I think it will be neater to use one
bound<00:03:10.660> piece<00:03:10.900> instead<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.770> few<00:03:12.010> little

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
pieces for an optional step if you are

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.180 
pieces for an optional step if you are
worried<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.300> ribbons<00:03:19.750> may<00:03:19.990> free<00:03:20.290> take<00:03:20.950> some

steps the only difference is that the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.020 
steps the only difference is that the
ribbons<00:04:37.930> are<00:04:38.169> longer<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.400> have<00:04:39.669> to<00:04:39.850> be<00:04:40.000> a

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
ribbons are longer so you have to be a

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.080 
ribbons are longer so you have to be a
little<00:04:40.480> bit<00:04:40.630> more<00:04:40.840> careful<00:04:41.520> since<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.760> ribbon

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
little bit more careful since the ribbon

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.719 
little bit more careful since the ribbon
was<00:04:43.240> long<00:04:43.540> I<00:04:43.900> did<00:04:44.350> one<00:04:44.650> side<00:04:44.919> at<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.160> time<00:04:45.280> I

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
was long I did one side at a time I

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.030 
was long I did one side at a time I
glued<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.690> first<00:04:46.960> bit<00:04:47.140> of<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.320> ribbon<00:04:47.770> and

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
glued the first bit of the ribbon and

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.040 
glued the first bit of the ribbon and
paste<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.640> on<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:48.790> front<00:04:49.150> of<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.570> shirt

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
paste it on the front of the shirt

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.170 
paste it on the front of the shirt
compared<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.710> gluing<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.310> whole<00:04:51.610> ribbon<00:04:52.000> at

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
compared to gluing the whole ribbon at

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.130 
compared to gluing the whole ribbon at
the<00:04:52.240> same<00:04:52.479> time<00:04:53.970> that's<00:04:54.970> it<00:04:55.150> for<00:04:55.330> this<00:04:55.479> video<00:04:55.870> I

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
hope my explanation was at least

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.770 
hope my explanation was at least
somewhat<00:04:58.990> clear<00:04:59.350> enough<00:04:59.680> hopefully<00:05:00.550> with<00:05:01.479> the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
somewhat clear enough hopefully with the

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.750 
somewhat clear enough hopefully with the
