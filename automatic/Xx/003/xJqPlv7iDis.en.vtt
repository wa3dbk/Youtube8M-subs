00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
most fun to drive due to being low

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.450 
most fun to drive due to being low
horsepower<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.290> being<00:02:10.679> able<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.040> match<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
lower horsepower car is actually work on

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.190 
lower horsepower car is actually work on
your<00:02:15.690> technique<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:17.010> checks<00:02:17.250> your<00:02:17.400> game

turbo<00:02:19.200> cars<00:02:19.440> they're<00:02:19.800> great<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.430> high

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
turbo cars they're great you know high

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.240 
turbo cars they're great you know high
or<00:02:20.940> spa<00:02:21.150> any<00:02:21.390> cars<00:02:21.630> are<00:02:21.810> great<00:02:21.989> but<00:02:22.230> they<00:02:22.920> tend

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
or spa any cars are great but they tend

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.699 
or spa any cars are great but they tend
to<00:02:23.400> mask<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:24.000> lot<00:02:24.239> of<00:02:24.390> errors<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.410> when<00:02:25.560> you're

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
to mask a lot of errors and when you're

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.620 
to mask a lot of errors and when you're
put<00:02:25.860> into<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.070> low<00:02:26.220> horsepower<00:02:26.700> car<00:02:26.970> personally

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
put into a low horsepower car personally

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.260 
put into a low horsepower car personally
I<00:02:27.810> think<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.410> really<00:02:28.530> shows<00:02:28.620> your<00:02:29.580> new<00:02:30.000> direct

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
I think it really shows your new direct

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.340 
I think it really shows your new direct
maturity<00:02:30.750> but<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.860> my<00:02:32.900> opinion<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.200> it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
maturity but this is my opinion on it

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.100 
maturity but this is my opinion on it
and<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.180> see<00:02:36.209> also<00:02:36.630> drifting<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
and as you can see also drifting the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.290 
and as you can see also drifting the
lowest<00:02:37.410> powers<00:02:37.770> c18<00:02:38.400> Silvio<00:02:38.880> before<00:02:39.239> I

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
lowest powers c18 Silvio before I

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.620 
lowest powers c18 Silvio before I
scripted<00:02:39.750> for<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.050> my<00:02:40.440> new<00:02:40.590> d<00:02:40.739> one<00:02:40.980> car<00:02:41.220> or

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
scripted for the my new d one car or

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.080 
scripted for the my new d one car or
it's<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.380> relatively<00:02:44.040> funny<00:02:44.340> drive<00:02:44.670> but

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it's a it's relatively funny drive but

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.930 
it's a it's relatively funny drive but
definitely<00:02:45.959> all<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.350> know<00:02:46.440> love<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.430> highest

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
definitely all you know love the highest

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.880 
definitely all you know love the highest
power<00:02:48.150> high<00:02:48.660> turbo<00:02:49.080> cars<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.590> stuff<00:02:49.709> like

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
power high turbo cars and stuff like

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.530 
power high turbo cars and stuff like
that<00:02:49.950> too<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.519> I'm<00:02:50.760> not<00:02:50.970> taking<00:02:51.239> enough<00:02:51.390> away

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
that too so I'm not taking enough away

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.570 
that too so I'm not taking enough away
from<00:02:51.600> him<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.530> horsepower<00:02:52.950> definitely

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
from him but the horsepower definitely

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.840 
from him but the horsepower definitely
has<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.390> lot<00:02:54.630> more<00:02:54.660> funner<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:56.340> drift<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.670> me

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
has a lot more funner to drift to me

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.780 
has a lot more funner to drift to me
personally<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:58.170> past<00:02:58.470> 2013<00:02:59.160> season<00:02:59.340> was<00:02:59.640> my
