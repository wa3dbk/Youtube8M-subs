went ahead and put that one because I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.690 
went ahead and put that one because I
like<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.540> went<00:01:18.689> better<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.860> also<00:01:20.040> got<00:01:20.369> two

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
like I went better and it's also got two

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.120 
like I went better and it's also got two
hood<00:01:21.030> ones<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> ram<00:01:21.869> air<00:01:22.110> hood<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
hood ones so the ram air hood and the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.359 
hood ones so the ram air hood and the
vented<00:01:23.640> hood<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.060> actually<00:01:24.509> liked<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.409> ram<00:01:26.130> air

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
vented hood I actually liked the ram air

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
vented hood I actually liked the ram air
hood<00:01:26.610> better<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.720> think<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.080> looked<00:01:28.259> better

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
hood better I think just looked better

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.859 
hood better I think just looked better
it's<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.250> personal<00:01:29.820> preference<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.420> guess<00:01:30.630> so

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it's all personal preference I guess so

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.620 
it's all personal preference I guess so

primary<00:01:51.240> color<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.140> decided<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310

primary color and I decided to go with a
metallic<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.909> lava<00:01:54.119> red<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.630> had<00:01:54.810> never<00:01:55.140> used<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

metallic a lava red I had never used it
before<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.829> unlocked<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:57.000> maybe<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.719> couple

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
before I unlocked it like maybe a couple

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.859 
before I unlocked it like maybe a couple
of<00:01:58.020> months<00:01:58.170> ago<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> decided<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.750> go

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
of months ago so I decided to just go

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.090 
of months ago so I decided to just go
ahead<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.320> choose<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.649> cuz<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> thought<00:02:01.979> it'd

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
ahead and choose that cuz I thought it'd

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.160 
ahead and choose that cuz I thought it'd
look<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.250> nice<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.540> also<00:02:03.689> went<00:02:04.020> with

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
look really nice and I also went with

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.200 
look really nice and I also went with
the<00:02:04.409> black<00:02:04.710> pearlescent<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:05.939> sort

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the black pearlescent on it I just sort

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.999 
the black pearlescent on it I just sort
of<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.810> looked<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.170> good<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.380> had<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> look

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
of it looked really good I had a look

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.889 
of it looked really good I had a look
through<00:02:08.220> all<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> other<00:02:08.550> colors<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.750> just

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
through all the other colors but I just

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.609 
through all the other colors but I just
liked<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.050> black

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
liked the black

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.920 
liked the black
it<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.310> looked<00:02:11.459> nice<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.540> that's<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
it just looked nice so that's the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.970 
it just looked nice so that's the
reasoning<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.470> went<00:02:13.620> there

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
reasoning I went there

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.890 
reasoning I went there
if<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.340> had<00:02:14.490> more<00:02:14.670> colors<00:02:14.880> would've<00:02:15.810> been

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
if you had more colors would've been

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.390 
if you had more colors would've been
cool<00:02:16.110> if<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.290> had<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> secondary<00:02:17.069> color<00:02:17.310> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
cool if I had like a secondary color to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.640 
cool if I had like a secondary color to
go<00:02:17.520> with<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.819> but<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.690> unfortunately<00:02:19.530> it

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
go with it but it unfortunately it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.410 
go with it but it unfortunately it
doesn't<00:02:19.800> now<00:02:20.130> for<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.520> wheels<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.940> decided<00:02:21.300> to

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
doesn't now for the wheels I decided to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.420 
doesn't now for the wheels I decided to
go<00:02:21.540> with<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.959> s<00:02:22.140> races<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.010> sports

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
go with the s races in the sports

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.250 
go with the s races in the sports
section<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.090> think<00:02:24.239> these<00:02:24.360> wheels<00:02:24.720> really

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
section I just think these wheels really

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.070 
section I just think these wheels really
suited<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> car<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> lot<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:27.270> just<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.020> know

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
tires and for the wheel color I decided

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.690 
tires and for the wheel color I decided
to<00:02:33.600> go<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:33.870> black<00:02:34.170> basically<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.340> cuz<00:02:35.580> it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
to go with black basically just cuz it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.100 
to go with black basically just cuz it
looks<00:02:35.730> sick<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.390> did<00:02:36.569> look<00:02:36.720> at<00:02:36.840> some<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.050> the

other<00:02:37.230> colors<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.620> didn't<00:02:37.890> go<00:02:37.950> too<00:02:38.220> far<00:02:38.400> down

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
other colors I didn't go too far down

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.670 
other colors I didn't go too far down
cuz<00:02:38.910> black<00:02:39.720> was<00:02:39.870> right<00:02:40.019> at<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.170> top<00:02:40.319> me<00:02:40.440> just

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
cuz black was right at the top me just

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
cuz black was right at the top me just
look<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:41.250> think<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> red<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.360> lava<00:02:42.569> red

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
and the black goes really nicely
