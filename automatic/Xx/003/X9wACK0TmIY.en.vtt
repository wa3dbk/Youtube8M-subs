really well I believe it's gonna be a
lot<00:00:23.880> harder<00:00:24.090> I'm<00:00:24.330> not<00:00:24.480> entirely<00:00:24.779> sure<00:00:24.990> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
lot harder I'm not entirely sure I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.339

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
really zoom in on anything but it's

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.789 
really zoom in on anything but it's
almost<00:01:08.939> worth<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:10.170> feel<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.530> I'm

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
almost worth it because I feel like I'm

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.620 
almost worth it because I feel like I'm
aiming<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.310> much<00:01:11.490> better<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.240> said<00:01:12.479> before

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
aiming so much better like I said before

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.270 
aiming so much better like I said before
I<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.260> aiming<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:14.580> both<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:16.500> hand

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
I like aiming with both of my hand

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.010 
I like aiming with both of my hand
when<00:01:17.580> I'm

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
when I'm

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.440

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so yeah we're doing pretty good I think

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.030
