00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
because it would take too long for your

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.450 
because it would take too long for your
mind<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> process<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:20.100> send<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
mind to process it and then send that

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
mind to process it and then send that
information<00:01:20.850> back<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.540> your<00:01:21.659> arm<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.200> would

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
information back to your arm it would

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.730 
information back to your arm it would
just<00:01:22.759> automatically<00:01:24.200> spasm<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.350> arms<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
just automatically spasm your arms so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.910 
just automatically spasm your arms so
you<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:26.130> something<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.939> could<00:01:27.150> quickly

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
you do something so you could quickly

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.850 
you do something so you could quickly
flight<00:01:28.920> run<00:01:29.520> away<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:29.970> fight<00:01:30.810> punch<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.590> dude

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
flight run away or fight punch that dude

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
flight run away or fight punch that dude
in<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> face<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.780> that's<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.020> reason<00:01:34.049> those

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
in the face so that's the reason those

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.830 
in the face so that's the reason those
are<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.189> that's<00:01:36.180> great<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.570> those

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
are there and that's great for those

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.340 
are there and that's great for those
survival<00:01:37.409> situations<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.700> sniping

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
survival situations but in sniping

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
survival situations but in sniping
requires<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.470> little<00:01:40.740> bit<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:40.979> accuracy<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
requires a little bit more accuracy and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.999 
requires a little bit more accuracy and
sometimes<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> lucky<00:01:43.560> headshot

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
sometimes you do get that lucky headshot

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.889 
sometimes you do get that lucky headshot
where<00:01:44.159> you're<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.310> whoa<00:01:45.000> when<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> randomly

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
where you're just whoa when you randomly

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.080 
where you're just whoa when you randomly
whip<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.619> their<00:01:46.740> head<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:46.979> shoot<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.909> that's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
whip to their head and shoot but that's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
whip to their head and shoot but that's
like<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> thousand<00:01:49.619> times<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
like one out of a thousand times and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.420 
like one out of a thousand times and
it's<00:01:50.460> not<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> need<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.159> learn

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
it's not good so what you need to learn

I just don't even focus on my aim I just

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.720 
I just don't even focus on my aim I just
focus<00:03:53.459> only<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.450> my<00:03:54.780> breathing<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:56.430> just

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
focus only on my breathing and I just

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.060 
focus only on my breathing and I just
let<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.180> aiming<00:03:57.690> kind<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.500> take<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.709> backseat

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
let the aiming kind of take a backseat

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.330 
let the aiming kind of take a backseat
and<00:03:59.520> I'm<00:04:00.330> not<00:04:00.660> really<00:04:00.870> focusing<00:04:01.440> on<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.770> just

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
and I'm not really focusing on it just

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.640 
and I'm not really focusing on it just
to<00:04:02.490> allow<00:04:02.940> me<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.240> get<00:04:03.390> into<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.630> rock<00:04:03.930> state<00:04:04.410> it

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
to allow me to get into a rock state it

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.370 
to allow me to get into a rock state it
might<00:04:05.340> suffer<00:04:06.209> my<00:04:06.360> aim<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.570> little<00:04:06.810> bit<00:04:07.080> but

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
might suffer my aim a little bit but

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.250 
might suffer my aim a little bit but
it's<00:04:07.530> better<00:04:07.830> than<00:04:08.010> what<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.430> was<00:04:08.640> doing<00:04:08.970> before

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260

snipe and those were some of my major

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.790 
snipe and those were some of my major
issues<00:05:32.670> while<00:05:33.270> getting<00:05:33.600> better<00:05:33.840> was<00:05:34.140> I<00:05:34.380> would
