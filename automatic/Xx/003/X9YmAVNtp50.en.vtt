changes game town a bit and it was
pretty<00:00:30.449> drastic<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.740> pretty<00:00:32.040> plain<00:00:32.489> how<00:00:32.910> in

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
pretty drastic I was pretty plain how in

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.630 
pretty drastic I was pretty plain how in
the<00:00:33.300> first<00:00:33.540> round<00:00:33.809> he<00:00:34.020> looked<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.010> really

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the first round he looked to just really

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.299 
the first round he looked to just really
take<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> turn<00:00:36.420> around

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
take a turn around

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.130 
take a turn around
Hendrickson<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.480> don't<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:39.809> anyone

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
Hendrickson we I don't think anyone

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.400 
Hendrickson we I don't think anyone
really<00:00:40.170> expected<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:41.309> lawyer<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.079> he<00:00:43.170> was

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
really expected a lawyer that if he was

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.049 
really expected a lawyer that if he was
women<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:43.890> he<00:00:44.070> wasn't<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.579> knock<00:00:44.850> out

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
women when he wasn't going knock out

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.150 
women when he wasn't going knock out
Hendrix<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> first<00:00:46.530> round<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.010> like

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
Hendrix in the first round just like

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.340 
Hendrix in the first round just like
that<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.420> he<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:49.050> wanted

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that then I think that he really wanted

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.610 
that then I think that he really wanted
a<00:00:49.520> you<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.670> how<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.289> really

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
a you know how you just just really

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
a you know how you just just really
damage<00:00:53.280> anywhere<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.879> when<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.420> get

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
damage anywhere so that when they get

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
damage anywhere so that when they get
into<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> championship<00:00:55.320> rounds<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:56.070> got

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
into the championship rounds if they got

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.790 
into the championship rounds if they got
that<00:00:56.489> far<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.050> could<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.320> mess

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that far and there could be a mess

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
that far and there could be a mess
which<00:00:58.920> ironically<00:00:59.550> enough<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.329> showing<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
which ironically enough is showing that

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.009 
which ironically enough is showing that
our<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.430> was<00:01:02.550> thinking<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.690> wanna

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
our first I was thinking like I wanna

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.429 
our first I was thinking like I wanna
sit<00:01:05.150> around<00:01:06.150> thinking<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> I

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
sit around thinking you know that I

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
sit around thinking you know that I
think<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.369> were<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.700> messed<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
think that were just messed up you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.210 
think that were just messed up you
gassed<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:10.130> but<00:01:11.130> he<00:01:11.729> ended<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.210> actually

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
gassed out but he ended up actually

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.810 
gassed out but he ended up actually
conserving<00:01:14.220> his<00:01:14.400> energy

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
conserving his energy

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.300 
conserving his energy
well<00:01:15.350> his<00:01:16.350> cardio<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> better<00:01:17.100> than

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
well his cardio is better than

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.620 
well his cardio is better than
significantly<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.119> time<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.600> last

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
significantly this time than the last

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.899 
significantly this time than the last
fight<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:20.040> he<00:01:20.130> writers<00:01:20.400> less<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
fight I think he writers less than the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.039 
fight I think he writers less than the
special<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.720> think

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
special I think

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.870 
special I think
Henrik's<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.009> would<00:01:23.159> think<00:01:23.310> he<00:01:23.549> knew<00:01:23.670> his

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
Henrik's you would think he knew his

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
Henrik's you would think he knew his
lesson<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.720> Steven<00:01:25.049> cast<00:01:25.259> out<00:01:25.439> in

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
lesson because you Steven cast out in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.910 
lesson because you Steven cast out in
fight<00:01:25.770> against<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.340> GSP<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.900> fight<00:01:28.170> against

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
fight against like GSP the fight against

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.510 
fight against like GSP the fight against
the<00:01:29.729> level<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.750> an<00:01:30.900> extent<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.250> much

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the level to an extent but not as much

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.569 
the level to an extent but not as much
there<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.090> another<00:01:33.390> phytochemical<00:01:34.579> exactly

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
there is another phytochemical exactly

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
there is another phytochemical exactly
who<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:36.000> thought<00:01:36.180> against<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.350> come<00:01:37.560> into

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
who he thought against but you come into

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.210 
who he thought against but you come into
gap<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.150> body<00:01:39.479> he<00:01:39.900> seemed<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.100> doing

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
gap and this body he seemed to be doing

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.560 
gap and this body he seemed to be doing
the<00:01:41.430> same<00:01:41.610> thing<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.060> know<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.450> is

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the same thing I don't know what it is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.510 
the same thing I don't know what it is
about<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.960> sky<00:01:43.170> each<00:01:43.350> doesn't<00:01:43.740> get<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.070> on

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
about the sky each doesn't get it but on

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.389 
about the sky each doesn't get it but on
the<00:01:45.270> end<00:01:45.530> level<00:01:46.530> runs<00:01:46.710> by<00:01:47.180> decision<00:01:48.180> which

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
the end level runs by decision which

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.609 
the end level runs by decision which
when<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> fight<00:01:50.820> ended<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.840> knew<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.380> gonna<00:01:52.530> be

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
when the fight ended I knew is gonna be

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.510 
when the fight ended I knew is gonna be
a<00:01:52.710> split<00:01:52.920> decision

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
a split decision

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.440 
a split decision
