00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.590
 I did not see it 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.800
 and I have an obsession with everything old 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.500
 what retro the modernist cuts this 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.750
 I'm passionate about all this 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.760
 then my collections are changing 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.379
 in every sense the word but always 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.390
 they keep this is like as adn that 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.580
 part of the old molds I like 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.739
 buy old things and disarm the and 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.370
 to do them again is a bit of that 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.370
 there goes my proposal 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.890
 and just the mix between the classic 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.720
 romantic and super feminine with something very 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.119
 pop that is in the chart that are by 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.010
 example convert objects into shoes what 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.990
 I know an ice cream in a shoe or an animal 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.610
 in a shoe a wal in the clothes do not play 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.140
 a lot with the graphic but mixed wave 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.270
 with the elegant and the feminine is what 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.270
 form in the essence of the brand 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.180
 I consider myself a classic 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.879
 contemporary I like my clothes 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.920
 endure and you can use it longer than 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.870
 only one season at design level and 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.790
 at a quality level 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.980
 my reference and my starting point 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.310
 It is always Peru. I think we have 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.280
 so much for rescuing from coast 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.709
 sierra jungle colors fibers textures more 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.140
 materials that I always like 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.450
 incorporate it in a way sometimes more 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.700
 obvious and other times more useful inside 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.190
 of my proposals through my work 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.019
 I want to show that in Peru 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.390
 we have possibilities if there are designers 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.540
 if there is labor if there is work 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.359
 we have such a vast culture 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.620
 so big that we have for all to 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.450
 the Peruvians and for those who want 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.150
 come to Peru so really 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.250
 it means a lot because we are going to demonstrate 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.710
 at what level you are but in these 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.250
 moments 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.250
 or not 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.380
 i 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.209
 ah 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.830
