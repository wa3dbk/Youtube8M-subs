00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
thought maybe I could bring them to a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.899 
thought maybe I could bring them to a
springtime<00:01:04.140> place<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.489> color<00:01:05.700> palette

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
springtime place with my color palette

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.300 
springtime place with my color palette
first<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.659> measured<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.140> 1<00:01:07.619> inch<00:01:07.920> from<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
first I measured down 1 inch from the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.980 
first I measured down 1 inch from the
center<00:01:08.460> point<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> shoe<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.810> made<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
center point of the shoe and I made a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.500 
center point of the shoe and I made a
faint<00:01:10.320> pencil<00:01:10.830> mark<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.000> connected<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
faint pencil mark then I connected that

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.870 
faint pencil mark then I connected that
center<00:01:12.990> point<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.710> side<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> curved

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
center point to one side with a curved

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.320 
center point to one side with a curved
line<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:17.000> repeated<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> same<00:01:18.119> thing

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
line like this I repeated the same thing

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.390 
line like this I repeated the same thing
on<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> other<00:01:18.869> side<00:01:19.110> trying<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.070> mirror<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
on the other side trying to mirror it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.140 
on the other side trying to mirror it
exactly<00:01:22.100> that's<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.340> quite<00:01:23.460> exact<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
exactly that's not quite exact so I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.179 
exactly that's not quite exact so I
fixed<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.720> eraser<00:01:25.040> godbless<00:01:26.040> an

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
fixed it with my eraser godbless an

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.520 
fixed it with my eraser godbless an
eraser<00:01:26.430> once<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> line<00:01:27.810> right<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.290> did

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
eraser once I had the line right I did

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.840 
eraser once I had the line right I did
the<00:01:28.590> same<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> other<00:01:29.130> shoe

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the same to the other shoe

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
the same to the other shoe
I<00:01:29.880> used<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.360> straightedge<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.780> make<00:01:31.140> sure<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
I used a straightedge to make sure the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.859 
I used a straightedge to make sure the
main<00:01:31.680> points<00:01:32.189> were<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> same<00:01:32.820> plane<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.540> I

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
main points were on the same plane and I

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.700 
main points were on the same plane and I
bought<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.320> there

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.070 

using<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.520> pastel<00:01:40.000> palette<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.660> wanted<00:01:41.020> a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
using a pastel palette I wanted a

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.500 
using a pastel palette I wanted a
spring/summer<00:01:41.440> color-block<00:01:42.340> look<00:01:42.580> so<00:01:43.300> use

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
spring/summer color-block look so use

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.000 
spring/summer color-block look so use
the<00:01:43.720> different<00:01:44.020> areas<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.530> shoe<00:01:44.770> to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
the different areas of the shoe to

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.490 
the different areas of the shoe to
determine<00:01:45.460> what<00:01:45.640> goes<00:01:45.820> where<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.510> did<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.230> test

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
determine what goes where I did a test

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.960 
determine what goes where I did a test
to<00:01:47.710> make<00:01:47.830> sure<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.310> color<00:01:48.520> looked<00:01:48.790> right

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
to make sure that the color looked right

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.690 
to make sure that the color looked right
then<00:01:49.390> got<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.750> taping<00:01:50.430> ideally<00:01:51.430> take

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
then got to taping ideally take

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.490 
then got to taping ideally take
everything<00:01:52.300> first<00:01:52.630> but<00:01:53.050> I<00:01:53.110> was<00:01:53.229> kind<00:01:53.410> of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
everything first but I was kind of

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.290 
everything first but I was kind of
figuring<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:53.830> out<00:01:54.070> as<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.430> went<00:01:54.610> so<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.060> didn't

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
figuring this out as I went so I didn't

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.120 
figuring this out as I went so I didn't
do<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:55.510> in<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.660> right<00:01:55.780> order<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.350> taped<00:01:56.860> along

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
do it in the right order I taped along

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.650 
do it in the right order I taped along
