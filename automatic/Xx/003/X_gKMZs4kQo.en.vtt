00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
very simple this is a great solution the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.170 
very simple this is a great solution the
only<00:01:46.530> downside<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.670> little

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
only downside to it is it is a little

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.670 
only downside to it is it is a little
bit<00:01:48.509> heavy<00:01:48.840> compared<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> some<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
bit heavy compared to some of the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.889 
bit heavy compared to some of the
competitors<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:51.329> considering

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
competitors out there but considering

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.420 
competitors out there but considering
the<00:01:51.960> quality<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.829> actually<00:01:53.220> worth

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the quality I think it's actually worth

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.749 
the quality I think it's actually worth
it

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.639
