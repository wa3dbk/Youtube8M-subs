00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
really think they're not now put it on

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.930 
really think they're not now put it on
it<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.350> really<00:00:49.350> sit<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> u.s.<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.340> just

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it and really sit in the u.s. that just

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.970 
it and really sit in the u.s. that just
doesn't<00:00:51.149> seem<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> me<00:00:51.780> at<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
doesn't seem right to me at all but the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.549 
doesn't seem right to me at all but the
fact<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.399> they're<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:53.850> posting<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
fact that they're not posting it in the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.700 
fact that they're not posting it in the
u.s.<00:00:55.860> blog<00:00:56.190> yet<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.059> either<00:00:57.410> either<00:00:58.410> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
u.s. blog yet so either either that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.700 
u.s. blog yet so either either that
means<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.430> ready<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.940> US<00:01:00.239> or

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
means that it's not ready for the US or

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.840 
means that it's not ready for the US or
because<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.859> doesn't<00:01:02.039> make<00:01:02.219> sense<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.699> not

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
because this doesn't make sense it's not

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.969 
because this doesn't make sense it's not
like<00:01:03.000> Japan<00:01:03.539> where<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.470> change<00:01:04.769> any

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
like Japan where they have to change any

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.609 
like Japan where they have to change any
words<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.790> UK<00:01:06.119> uses<00:01:06.479> English<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.439> what

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
words the UK uses English so what

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.500 
words the UK uses English so what
exactly<00:01:07.740> would<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.430> need<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.090> change<00:01:09.119> that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
exactly would they need to change that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.000 
exactly would they need to change that
the<00:01:09.960> reason<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.229> they're<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.560> gonna<00:01:10.680> put<00:01:10.920> on

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the reason that they're not gonna put on

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
the reason that they're not gonna put on
the<00:01:11.100> US<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.180> scared<00:01:12.720> me<00:01:12.869> it's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the US so this really scared me it's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.660 
the US so this really scared me it's
like<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.580> think

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
like I just don't know what to think

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.210 
like I just don't know what to think
because<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.990> said<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
because I said you don't then we got to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.590 
because I said you don't then we got to
translate<00:01:17.820> anything<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.509> was

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
translate anything do they and so it was

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
translate anything do they and so it was
like<00:01:21.780> why<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:22.740> post<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.310> US

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
like why don't they post it on the US

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.240 
like why don't they post it on the US
blog<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.030> well<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.619> really<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.830> know<00:01:25.890> what's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
blog as well I really don't know what's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.999 
blog as well I really don't know what's
going<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:26.909> cuz<00:01:27.869> i<00:01:27.900> did<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.619> say<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
going on but cuz i did want to say that

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.149 
going on but cuz i did want to say that
oh<00:01:29.159> maybe<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.360> good<00:01:30.659> release<00:01:30.960> later<00:01:31.470> for

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
oh maybe it's a good release later for

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.640 
oh maybe it's a good release later for
the<00:01:32.189> US<00:01:32.900> which<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.110> also<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.439> possibility

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the US which is also a possibility

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.429 
the US which is also a possibility
because<00:01:35.430> borderlands<00:01:35.939> 2<00:01:36.180> releasing<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> US

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
because borderlands 2 releasing the US

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.370 
because borderlands 2 releasing the US
first<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.100> UK<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.299> i<00:01:39.659> mean<00:01:40.110> i<00:01:40.259> don't

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
first and then the UK so i mean i don't

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.230 
first and then the UK so i mean i don't
know<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.590> tech<00:01:40.799> why<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.579> happened<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.210> don't

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
know what tech why that happened I don't

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
know what tech why that happened I don't
know<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> problem<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
know the problem with that is but I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.069 
know the problem with that is but I
guess<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.640> could<00:01:44.850> also<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.119> an<00:01:45.299> option<00:01:45.450> even

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
guess that could also be an option even

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.539 
guess that could also be an option even
though<00:01:46.350> there<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.649> isn't<00:01:47.189> anything<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
though there really isn't anything to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.550 
though there really isn't anything to
change<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.360> might<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.049> releasing<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
change that might just be releasing it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.399 
change that might just be releasing it
later<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:51.119> how<00:01:51.299> much<00:01:51.479> later<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:52.229> it's
