 very good so good today we are going 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.480
 to prepare a bread jelly that is 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.009
 something very very simple but then the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.630
 it's really rich I hope that you 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:24.130
 like it and then for that we only go to 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.770
 need 2 liters of normal milk 50 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.779
 grams of grenadine of what is like that without 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.460
 flavor and a can of evaporated milk yo 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.030
 I found among tetra pak also 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.390
 sorry and we're going to need half a kilo of 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.240
 sugar a piece of cinnamon and then as 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.680
 the recipe says this bread that we are going to 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.650
 need a bread that cubed true 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.450
 this can be whole or half this already 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.610
 according to you the amount that you want 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.730
 put ok and let's go to the first thing we're going 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.180
 to do we are going to put to warm liter and 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.989
 milk medium only liter and a half 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:10.450
 with the piece of cinnamon 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.640
 with the law and we 're going to leave it there 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.759
 I'll wait for the other half to warm up 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.470
 of milk we are going to reserve it for what 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.829
 we finished heating our milk 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.270
 we are going to add in a container the 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.950
 half a kilo of sugar the 50 grams of 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 grenetina 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.490
 and we are going to incorporate them 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.000
 and since we have them incorporated 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.840
 we are going to add 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.530
 the half liter of milk that we had 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.530
 reserved 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.450
 and we mix a little bit since we have it 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.150
 well mixed you have to ensure that you do not 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.820
 is disrupting most of the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.350
 fumes that we have left in truth and I forgot 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.660
 to mention them we are going to add it also 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.780
 a trickle of vanilla extract 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.780
 vanilla 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.269
 and we continue mixing already for this 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.060
 our milk that we have on the stove 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.670
 Well, it's going to be hot and then 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.260
 it's going to be time 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.310
 that we emptied sports 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.310
 to the milk that we have the strict that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.310
 incorporating 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:43.810
 and you have to try to be mixing 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.799
 wagging the milk so that it does not 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.110
 we are going to stick it is the bottom 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.520
 and well we're going to leave it here until 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.950
 want to let boil 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.260
 who wants to start boiling this 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.390
 let's turn it off and in our mold where 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.290
 let's make the jello let's 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.430
 start putting the pieces of bread that 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.500
 that we had previously cut 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.480
 true this is why I was telling you is the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.240
 amount that you want can 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.120
 put it whole or you can cut it 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.230
 whole can only put a little 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.580
 It is already the taste of you and since 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:34.090
 we find this position our bread that 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.220
 Well now we are going to put the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.610
 jelly 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.110
 we add our good gelatin what 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.920
 that we prepare and ready we are going to take 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:52.930
 refrigerate until set this 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.420
 gelatin is very well basic this with 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.560
 this can do either this jelly 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.380
 of bread they can make with almonds 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.130
 can put or can you put strawberries 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:10.480
 raspberries is not what you most 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:13.300
 like it, but, well, this is one of 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.370
 the variants that you can do with this 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.070
 gelatin, we're going to let it 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.260
 cool a little bit and we're going to take it to 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.540
 refrigerate and now I show you the 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.180
 final result that and well then because 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.130
 gelatins were ready this 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.280
 it took about three hours in 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.180
 curd and then look this is the bread 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.380
 what 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:40.460
 for is 9 good I put a little bit of 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.190
 is not only and so I left here one like this 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.910
 natural only with the face that 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.460
 really and good in any of the of 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.139
 the way you do this either with 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.099
 punk 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.639
 this natural or with nuts or if you want 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.039
 put some fruit you will love 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.710

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:07.770
