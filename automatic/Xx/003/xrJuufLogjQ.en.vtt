00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.370 
really explained on what that was but we
can<00:04:43.750> only<00:04:43.840> assume<00:04:44.230> me<00:04:45.750> extra<00:04:46.750> channel<00:04:47.080> type<00:04:47.260> of

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
can only assume me extra channel type of

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.880 
can only assume me extra channel type of
deal<00:04:47.530> so<00:04:47.770> maybe<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:49.500> drop<00:04:51.240> drop<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> foam<00:04:52.890> foam

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
deal so maybe a drop drop a foam foam

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.850 
deal so maybe a drop drop a foam foam
ball<00:04:54.190> or<00:04:54.460> something<00:04:54.610> along<00:04:54.790> those<00:04:55.000> lines

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
ball or something along those lines

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.710 
ball or something along those lines
allow<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:57.190> pick<00:04:57.880> something<00:04:58.150> up<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.450> drop

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
it I can't see what else what are the

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.120 
it I can't see what else what are the
accessories<00:05:01.870> could<00:05:02.290> be<00:05:02.440> for<00:05:02.620> this<00:05:02.710> as<00:05:02.919> in<00:05:03.070> the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
accessories could be for this as in the

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.230
