00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.910
 but all of you as you will be watching 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.070
 at this time on their screens we are going to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.550
 do the review of this smart tv of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.619
 perfect choice is actually a surprise 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.439
 what perfections have the smrtv of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.500
 google with wool is a box a box 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.160
 simple is very light with an entrance 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.750
 for sd cards from the back you have the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 power button that is also from here 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.660
 two usb entries is to be able to put a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.600
 additional memory and this case is that of 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.260
 the wireless connection to the control 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 additional you have has an entry of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.930
 audio video has an audio output 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.500
 optical as you will see here is the hdmi 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.870
 has an entry for the ethernet network and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.879
 obviously here the cable put the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.160
 alternating current as they saw has two 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.050
 controls this is the basic control this 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.540
 it is used by means of a port 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.030
 infrared as you will be seeing here 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.140
 control of having seen surely in 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.750
 other smart activist has on the one hand 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.330
 easier control has a button 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.600
 human type and this this control has 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.580
 also an accelerometer cell 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.070
 precisely so that when moving it we can 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.200
 use it as a kind of pointer the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.540
 mouse and the other does not have a keyboard 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.940
 to be able to write if our 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.910
 systems is connected to the monitor that 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.220
 we have in our room with this control 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.710
 and to this one I can control the box that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.930
 are watching here and what we are seeing 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.180
 on the screen is precisely the interface 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.729
 of the system good the problems that I've 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.869
 had with this control is that at least 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.270
 the control that is the model of 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.040
 infrared is that it does not respond very 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.470
 well sometimes sometimes you want to find 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.060
 the signal sometimes is not enough to be very 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.930
 near 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.930
 you look like value 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.690
 and he learned this control if it works 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.610
 much better and in fact as they will be 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.970
 watching on screen 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.100
 I move here and move a course 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.319
 here it says it's information from 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.420
 tablet or is it finally the system 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.400
 operative android would be running as 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.530
 a kind of tablet format though 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.900
 as we say in our screen 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.390
 tablet is actually television and 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.760
 has a total of 500 megabytes of 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.069
 storage is to say that they can not 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.780
 basically put too many things 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.730
 there may be some other video or 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.530
 simple applications and everything 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.080
 others would have to be through a usb 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.680
 or netflix that you already know we can 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.680
 see it from here 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.730
 the processor did not seem to be too 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.250
 fast for like some cell phones 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.980
 surely they have the capabilities of 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.590
 low - cost cell medium cost 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.780
 but fortunately to run 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.780
 movies is good enough 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.260
 we have here we go to the bottom but 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.209
 I say one of the great advantages of 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.489
 be Android of course is that we can 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.099
 enter the playstation store 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.440
 download not only movies not only 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.880
 music but we can also download the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.730
 games unlike many others 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.160
 smart ibis as it could be the appletv or 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.250
 even the google google clone 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.500
 we go down here the angry birds and see if 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.680
 it's really worth having this game 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.680
 here 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.980
 ah 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.550
 and here we use the cursor to apply 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.770
 and else 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.840
 okay 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.760
 and we can play hainer wish from the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.190
 television without needing another device 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.750
 more that is nothing else that is simply 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.100
 an android client for television 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.990
 it's basically what you have to understand 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.520
 to see if it's okay and works well 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.500
 why are you going to commit our selection 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.120
 with the new devices with only one 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.130
 touch signature not the problem is with the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.170
 applications that are multi touch there is no 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.680
 way to be multi touch in this 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.270
 device which then makes having 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.989
 a platform like android is no longer 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.110
 so be taken advantage of in this system with 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.940
 the tv-smartbox of perfect choice I think 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.870
 it's a very good idea to bring the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.460
 Android platform to 'let's say it to the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.370
 television through a simple box 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.820
 however although it is such an idea 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.980
 realization of a background is not 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.590
 so good integration because there 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.440
 different components to start a 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.360
 device like in madrid to have already 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.620
 be a phone or a tablet is 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.540
 taking into account that people are 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.820
 between all directly on the screen 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.030
 and you can take it anywhere 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.840
 android to a television generate another 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.120
 type of interaction that is resorted to 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.580
 controls like these of course 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.260
 work well but are limited by 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.270
 example in a crowd is not possible 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.550
 do it from here and the truth handle 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.010
 this as a kind of wii control 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.650
 for nintendo is not as accurate as 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:16.670
 interact directly with touches in 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.620
 the screen so this control 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.840
 control the main control control 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.670
 simple it is very difficult to recognize it 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.830
 this particular device has to be 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.230
 to understand him very well in which part he is 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.060
 where does the signal recognize 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.070
 infrared i have had a lot of difficulty 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.110
 so far I do not know exactly in 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.270
 where I have to now I have to 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.000
 direct him to listen to me and 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.180
 finally the third point is that yes it is 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.610
 true that we can basically lower the 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.470
 hundreds of thousands of applications but not 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.600
 all help to run well not where already 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.190
 they will be able to fit perfectly to 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.710
 a 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.390
 a platform for television 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.390
 multi-touch efforts in part of the 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.580
 performance of the box's performance 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.310
 it is martÃ­n and because it is not so powerful 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.410
 as a being of last generation 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.690
 very simple things practices can 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.950
 work well is not done and is by ninja 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.940
 maybe that's to play well is 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.970
 the most basic things 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.220
 watch videos on youtube from netflix of ass 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.400
 seems to work in the price of this 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.020
 box from 2 thousand 200 pesos in my opinion 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.790
 it's a little more expensive than they could 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.500
 get with other boxes like the 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:30.350
 culture that is not as versatile as 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.300
 it would be this but it takes 100% advantage 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.420
 television format unlike 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.520
 this one that finally only translates a 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.350
 operating system from android to another 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.570
 screen that is not necessarily part 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.360
 that was designed and well basically that 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.860
 it's all from our review of 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.110
 perfection smartphones I hope that you 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.910
 have liked and see you next 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.910
 week with more light
