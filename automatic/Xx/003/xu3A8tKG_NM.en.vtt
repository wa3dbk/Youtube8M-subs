00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
kind of like that and then curves in

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:36.280 
kind of like that and then curves in
like<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:28.540> so<00:01:29.540> I<00:01:29.600> erase<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:32.680> then<00:01:35.290> same

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290

thing<00:01:36.500> over<00:01:36.619> here<00:01:36.740> wait<00:01:37.550> till<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:37.850> curves<00:01:38.119> in<00:01:38.300> a

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
thing over here wait till it curves in a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.870 
thing over here wait till it curves in a
little<00:01:38.570> bit<00:01:38.750> before<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.170> start<00:01:39.380> drawing<00:01:39.590> it

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
little bit before you start drawing it

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.120 
little bit before you start drawing it
curve<00:01:40.880> your<00:01:41.420> up<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.110> ears<00:01:42.380> don't<00:01:42.770> go<00:01:42.950> too

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
curve your up and the ears don't go too

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.520 
curve your up and the ears don't go too
far<00:01:43.369> overhead<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:45.580> we're<00:01:46.750> gonna<00:01:47.750> do<00:01:48.619> a<00:01:50.530> little

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
far overhead so we're gonna do a little

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.500 
far overhead so we're gonna do a little
bit<00:01:51.710> wider<00:01:52.030> there<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.180> go<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:55.310> now<00:01:55.850> I'll<00:01:56.090> delete

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
bit wider there we go so now I'll delete
