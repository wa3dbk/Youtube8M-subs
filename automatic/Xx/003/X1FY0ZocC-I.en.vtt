00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.639
 nine people I start again to one 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.709
 he can receptions new video for today 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.090
 an arms though held to the star 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.950
 I have to say've been meaning 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.320
 Weapons Act every Monday to bring it 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.880
 is currently really hard these dates 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.110
 to comply with friday then video 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.849
 Monday then they actually already 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.739
 to have to address this need to have system 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.029
 at noon in things always by the way like 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.439
 otherwise i made myself special 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.509
 happy montis looked the whole day 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399
 by the way also school is always right 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.350
 difficult must abide by it to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.600
 best is forgive me anyway 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.630
 if a video a two days later 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 now comes to sky hd start up 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.930
 in the comments in it so thought so 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.890
 needs that as a weapon guide 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.630
 with one 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.320
 Let's start with the harm because of that 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.640
 see a little bit 233 to 24 in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.500
 normal storm rifles catch it 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.940
 it's even minimal here 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.070
 the power is a little bit more harmful 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.120
 Both damage even more for each hit 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.560
 things just the headshot like that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.260
 was interesting again need the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.610
 chest about four hits when I get up 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.840
 I would only draw two 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.579
 need that has just come with 2 times 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.670
 less that two really fast 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.740
 hit - top top so there this nothing 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.990
 to moan it's a pity it's better and the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 hardly super exploit related 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.009
 often with the job from eight to 60 meters 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.649
 So we make the eight meters 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.840
 damage of 33 then the damage begins 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.700
 to fall so far at 60 meters still the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.829
 Doing damage of 24 is still another 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.719
 a bit later than, for example , storm-rifles 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.069
 some have already at 55 meters 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.899
 rather minimal damage achieved 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.429
 stockpiling at the expense of 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.240
 damaged only a little bit 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.829
 26 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.329
 minute is of course more like that 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.590
 Quickly maybe you know that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.450
 Exchange that weapons feeling a bit 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.439
 easier but we have to hold higher 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.819
 harm the balance 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.679
 otherwise he would have to know who is shooting 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.229
 not quite as fast as for example 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.880
 or a farce as well must the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.789
 magazine capacity leyen this too 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.319
 ten shot less 20 instead of 30 too 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.700
 Logically again does more harm than 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.380
 the magazine, of course, a bit 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.509
 less for you after a long time 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.159
 completely okay with 1.9 they come 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.259
 still a good run are 24 seconds 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.329
 the weapon completely empty is absolutely okay 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.130
 there is nothing to complain about is actually 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.200
 still quite fast now the recoil 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.849
 Of course, that beats a bit 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.170
 and to the top full can after 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.430
 some follow on the left and on the right 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.900
 Above, she hurts you again and again 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.610
 Doll away that you really say that 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.439
 you definitely notice but we have 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.300
 luck the multiplier first shot 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:22.090
 pretty low at 16 so that is 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.590
 problem can sometimes bother like here where you 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.780
 It's all in the mini stock market until it's very busy 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.460
 pleasant that the slip from the first 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.340
 shot too low is good in any case 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.960
 cooperate in the precision well 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.610
 will be quite inaccurate quite quickly 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.620
 if you just stop the single steps 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.510
 put very small things then you meet 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.460
 but of course this longer this burst 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.930
 Do not be surprised if you are ten 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.090
 shots settles and the exchanges 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.410
 no wonder if the last one stops 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.110
 Do not hit five google because that will 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.700
 very quickly quite inaccurate now 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.050
 also sets and visors completely 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.700
 classic for a storm gun 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.880
 melee we see, of course, kurjo the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.100
 cobra reflex what you want there you know 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.840
 you know me colony is mostly man 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.220
 I can also say favorites the point 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.260
 shoot until the small exact 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.670
 quite pleasant that periodika not 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.510
 here again in any case 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.310
 recommend the accessory slot well needs 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.500
 you also do not have the storm rifles 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.580
 have no great things laser is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 always such a thing, however, was the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.930
 You need a laser to get away from the laser 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.130
 not quite different stuff york one can 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.600
 Finally, you need that 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.340
 similar 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.660
 So if s s on it also packs amplifier 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.850
 in two the visor 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.020
 nice and good alsdorf will use 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.190
 now probably with this weapon 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.220
 probably not 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.959
 now the run and the handle there I have to 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.190
 I say'm pretty recoilless lowers 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.260
 and I have to say so far 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.180
 I drove very well so I can say that 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.660
 is fun fun with it 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.150
 what's going on 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.500
 Of course it can criticize but says 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.940
 personal is doing very well 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.770
 at the first I would still 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.390
 compromises respond that it is running as 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.910
 I already have the muzzle brake on it 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.650
 But I have tested extra without it and yes 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.270
 both go very well but I can 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.709
 really do not say what better it is 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.060
 both have its always its advantages as its 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.730
 no running over the estuary 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.350
 I like braking but both have me 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.480
 actually rather brake on this mouth 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.790
 above all, they really played very well 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.940
 you just do not notice that anyway 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.810
 she does not care about it at all 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.750
 you already use that 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.459
 for a more detailed explanation of the negative 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.570
 Effect does not fall on the positive 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.580
 come back, of course, you realize 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.230
 already under attack there I have 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.419
 actually in attack 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.640
 the recoil lowers though not so 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.680
 is high because you are really like that 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.090
 Often with the weapon these little bars 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.650
 makes it start over again and again 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.419
 kickback yes 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.550
 it is ultimately to good use 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.870
 the short handle is not that important 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.180
 maybe the ergonomic one, I say 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.259
 even everyone can play but the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.699
 you do not need a short trip team 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.169
 the angled is absolutely good 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.030
 I'm really good so far 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.460
 I can only recommend it is 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.990
 just out and overall to the 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.370
 weapon say she is really pretty 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.470
 well, you just have to import it 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.970
 The magazine can do that differently 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.570
 we have to do more harm 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.460
 to adjust 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.740
 but it just did it the 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.900
 slave it's cool you can handle it though 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.250
 pick has equally high so hurt in 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.320
 melee is still nothing lost or 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.280
 is in front of you , of course 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.229
 whatever those drivers need 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.580
 harder you never know but the thing 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.050
 is just strong 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.030
 It's not awesome 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.789
 only recommend is really with one 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.110
 assault rifle on all macs you can 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.090
 somehow use course 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.850
 can you say ey on distance is yes 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.900
 rather more accurate the livestock farmers 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.180
 still a bit faster in close combat 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.740
 first a good clear just in 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.130
 sniper &amp; co and any other 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.460
 opponent this is even that was really with 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.960
 one of the best voice would be that was 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.250
 it then with these weapons god has you 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.789
 please, here comes a little something 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.800
 take 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:36.599
 thumbs up you want of course 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.599
 pretty cool , I'm sitting in it
