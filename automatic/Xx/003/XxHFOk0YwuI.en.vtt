00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
now I don't see these being officially

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.400 
now I don't see these being officially
called<00:02:07.890> v2<00:02:08.399> anywhere<00:02:08.880> but<00:02:09.479> someone<00:02:09.990> said<00:02:10.380> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
called v2 anywhere but someone said that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.650 
called v2 anywhere but someone said that
to<00:02:10.740> me<00:02:10.860> at<00:02:11.039> PAX<00:02:11.460> or<00:02:11.700> something<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.210> I'm<00:02:12.330> rolling

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
to me at PAX or something so I'm rolling

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.630 
to me at PAX or something so I'm rolling
with<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.350> they<00:02:13.710> definitely<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.460> been

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
with it and they definitely have been

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.400 
with it and they definitely have been
updated<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.270> enough<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.810> way<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.230> would

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
updated in enough of a way that I would

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.700 
updated in enough of a way that I would
say<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.680> justifies<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.550> v2<00:02:18.330> moniker<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.440> they

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
say it justifies a v2 moniker so they

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.140 
say it justifies a v2 moniker so they
come<00:02:19.890> with<00:02:20.040> Dolby<00:02:20.250> headphone<00:02:20.700> right<00:02:20.970> out<00:02:21.120> of

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
something like that you know virtual

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.559

to support that functionality have a USB
soundcard<00:02:30.959> built<00:02:31.439> into<00:02:31.950> them<00:02:32.099> just<00:02:32.609> like

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
soundcard built into them just like

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.080 
soundcard built into them just like
Corsairs<00:02:33.359> previous<00:02:33.959> 1500<00:02:34.739> however<00:02:35.219> unlike

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
Corsairs previous 1500 however unlike

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.420 
Corsairs previous 1500 however unlike
the<00:02:36.239> previous<00:02:36.420> 1500<00:02:37.260> they<00:02:37.379> have<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> newer<00:02:37.950> 50

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the previous 1500 they have the newer 50

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.890 
the previous 1500 they have the newer 50
millimeter<00:02:38.790> drivers<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.599> like<00:02:39.749> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
millimeter drivers just like the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.619 
millimeter drivers just like the
Vengeance<00:02:40.260> 2000<00:02:41.010> they<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.549> newer<00:02:41.819> ID<00:02:42.150> that

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
Vengeance 2000 they have a newer ID that

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.300 
Vengeance 2000 they have a newer ID that
again<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:42.959> think<00:02:43.109> looks<00:02:43.560> quite<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.889> bit<00:02:44.129> better

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
again I think looks quite a bit better

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.849 
again I think looks quite a bit better
although<00:02:44.579> it's<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.389> similar<00:02:45.689> to<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.079> 2100<00:02:46.439> s

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
although it's so similar to the 2100 s

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.949 
although it's so similar to the 2100 s
it<00:02:46.920> actually<00:02:47.280> sort<00:02:47.579> of<00:02:47.639> raises<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.540> question

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
it actually sort of raises the question

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.089 
it actually sort of raises the question
why<00:02:49.109> they<00:02:49.230> bothered<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.650> change<00:02:49.859> it's<00:02:50.010> like

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
why they bothered to change it's like

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.280 
why they bothered to change it's like
well<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.459> put<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.639> Corsair<00:02:51.329> logo<00:02:51.629> here<00:02:51.930> instead

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
well we put a Corsair logo here instead

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.979 
well we put a Corsair logo here instead
of<00:02:52.349> here<00:02:52.849> either<00:02:53.849> way<00:02:54.120> they<00:02:54.269> both<00:02:54.299> look<00:02:54.780> really

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
of here either way they both look really

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.270 
of here either way they both look really
good<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.349> when<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> say<00:02:55.859> that<00:02:56.010> they<00:02:56.099> look<00:02:56.189> very

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
good so when I say that they look very

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.259 
good so when I say that they look very
similar<00:02:56.459> I'm<00:02:56.849> not<00:02:56.969> saying<00:02:57.209> that's

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
similar I'm not saying that's

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.360 
similar I'm not saying that's
necessarily<00:02:57.749> a<00:02:57.900> bad<00:02:58.079> thing<00:02:58.139> just<00:02:59.069> like<00:02:59.219> the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
necessarily a bad thing just like the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.250 
necessarily a bad thing just like the
previous<00:02:59.549> Vengeance<00:03:00.269> 1500s<00:03:00.959> they<00:03:01.109> have

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
previous Vengeance 1500s they have

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.259 
previous Vengeance 1500s they have
inline<00:03:01.650> volume<00:03:01.829> control<00:03:02.400> as<00:03:02.579> well<00:03:02.819> as<00:03:02.939> a<00:03:02.969> mute

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
inline volume control as well as a mute

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.190 
inline volume control as well as a mute
button<00:03:03.299> which<00:03:03.659> has<00:03:03.689> actually<00:03:03.959> been

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
button which has actually been

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.780 
button which has actually been
streamlined<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:05.040> little<00:03:05.219> bit<00:03:05.340> made<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.549> little

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
streamlined a little bit made a little

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.939 
streamlined a little bit made a little
bit<00:03:05.909> more<00:03:06.199> low-profile<00:03:07.199> and<00:03:07.439> just<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.829> the

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:07.949 
bit more low-profile and just like the

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:09.979 
bit more low-profile and just like the
Vengeance<00:03:08.280> 2100<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.329> they<00:03:09.389> have<00:03:09.540> microfiber

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.629 
Vengeance 2100 so they have microfiber
covered<00:03:10.469> memory<00:03:10.739> foam<00:03:10.949> on<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.219> ear<00:03:11.370> cups

different I guess at this point we might
as<00:03:35.909> well<00:03:35.939> just<00:03:36.739> stop<00:03:37.739> pretending<00:03:38.159> that<00:03:38.340> we're

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
as well just stop pretending that we're

unboxing<00:03:38.819> things<00:03:39.269> at<00:03:39.389> all<00:03:39.509> here<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:39.989> we're

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
unboxing things at all here and we're

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.039 
unboxing things at all here and we're
going<00:03:40.439> to<00:03:40.650> kick<00:03:40.949> off<00:03:41.129> with<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.489> vengeance

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
little turn on the catwalk I don't think

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.789 
little turn on the catwalk I don't think
that's<00:03:57.870> how<00:03:57.989> they<00:03:58.109> normally<00:03:58.409> turn<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.709> the

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
that's how they normally turn on the

00:03:58.799 --> 00:03:59.960 
that's how they normally turn on the
catwalk<00:03:58.949> but<00:03:59.220> we're<00:03:59.340> not<00:03:59.459> too<00:03:59.639> worried<00:03:59.909> about

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
catwalk but we're not too worried about

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.270 
catwalk but we're not too worried about
that<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.720> inline<00:04:01.019> volume<00:04:01.199> control<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:01.859> also

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
that the inline volume control is also

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.839 
that the inline volume control is also
also<00:04:02.579> less<00:04:03.209> bulky<00:04:03.720> now<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.109> unlike<00:04:05.099> the<00:04:05.280> 1500

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
also less bulky now and unlike the 1500

also less bulky now and unlike the 1500
v2<00:04:06.150> s<00:04:06.209> we<00:04:06.389> have<00:04:06.629> analog<00:04:07.259> connectors<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:07.919> if

v2 s we have analog connectors so if

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.619 
v2 s we have analog connectors so if

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.290 
really have the option of analog at all
because<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.699> whole<00:04:35.820> thing<00:04:36.000> has<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.180> be

just<00:05:15.100> the<00:05:15.250> HS<00:05:15.640> 40<00:05:16.060> because<00:05:16.390> it's<00:05:16.570> pretty<00:05:16.720> much

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
just the HS 40 because it's pretty much

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.930 
just the HS 40 because it's pretty much
the<00:05:16.960> same<00:05:17.230> as<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.500> HS<00:05:17.800> 30<00:05:18.100> thinking<00:05:18.760> that<00:05:18.910> I

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
the same as the HS 30 thinking that I

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.400 
the same as the HS 30 thinking that I
could<00:05:19.270> just<00:05:19.420> you<00:05:19.690> know<00:05:19.720> sort<00:05:19.960> of<00:05:20.050> make<00:05:20.230> do

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
could just you know sort of make do

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.110 
could just you know sort of make do
without<00:05:20.590> that<00:05:20.950> one<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.430> then<00:05:21.790> the<00:05:21.910> funny

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
without that one and then the funny

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.760 
without that one and then the funny
thing<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.360> they<00:05:22.600> sent<00:05:22.870> me<00:05:22.990> two<00:05:23.170> headsets<00:05:23.680> but

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
thing is they sent me two headsets but

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.260 
thing is they sent me two headsets but
then<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.040> ended<00:05:24.250> up<00:05:24.340> with<00:05:24.490> doing<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.820> same<00:05:25.030> one

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
then I ended up with doing the same one

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.420 
then I ended up with doing the same one
instead<00:05:25.600> of<00:05:25.660> two<00:05:25.750> different<00:05:26.140> ones<00:05:26.260> anyway<00:05:26.620> so

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
instead of two different ones anyway so

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.280 
instead of two different ones anyway so
the<00:05:27.580> wraptor<00:05:28.090> line<00:05:28.300> is<00:05:28.570> course<00:05:28.840> there's<00:05:29.080> more

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
the wraptor line is course there's more

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.380 
the wraptor line is course there's more
value<00:05:29.890> oriented<00:05:30.400> gaming<00:05:30.730> peripherals<00:05:31.300> they

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
value oriented gaming peripherals they

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.180 
value oriented gaming peripherals they
call<00:05:31.600> them<00:05:31.750> gaming<00:05:32.110> essentials<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:32.920> think

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
call them gaming essentials and I think

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.100 
call them gaming essentials and I think
they've<00:05:33.700> really<00:05:33.730> achieved<00:05:34.420> that<00:05:34.720> because

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
they've really achieved that because

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.160 
they've really achieved that because
they're<00:05:35.620> still<00:05:35.920> comfortable<00:05:36.520> they're<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.900> HS

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
they're still comfortable they're the HS

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.770 
they're still comfortable they're the HS
40<00:05:38.530> is<00:05:38.680> surround<00:05:39.340> but<00:05:39.670> not<00:05:39.850> not<00:05:40.300> Dolby

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
40 is surround but not not Dolby

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.060 
40 is surround but not not Dolby
Surround<00:05:41.200> so<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.590> still<00:05:41.770> has<00:05:41.890> the<00:05:42.040> same

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
Surround so it still has the same

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.920 
Surround so it still has the same
implementation<00:05:42.850> that<00:05:42.970> vengence<00:05:43.270> 2000<00:05:43.810> had

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
implementation that vengence 2000 had

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.930 
implementation that vengence 2000 had
back<00:05:44.140> when<00:05:44.170> it<00:05:44.530> was<00:05:44.560> released<00:05:44.740> their<00:05:45.640> lower

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
back when it was released their lower

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.790 
back when it was released their lower
cost<00:05:46.360> so<00:05:46.660> they<00:05:46.780> can<00:05:46.900> with<00:05:47.050> 40<00:05:47.380> millimeter

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
cost so they can with 40 millimeter

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.100 
cost so they can with 40 millimeter
neodymium<00:05:48.460> drivers<00:05:48.520> versus<00:05:49.210> 50<00:05:49.690> millimeter

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
neodymium drivers versus 50 millimeter

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.410 
neodymium drivers versus 50 millimeter
drivers<00:05:50.560> there's<00:05:51.130> no<00:05:51.310> memory<00:05:51.760> foam<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.330> they

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
drivers there's no memory foam and they

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.240 
drivers there's no memory foam and they
use<00:05:52.570> LED<00:05:52.870> thread<00:05:53.140> instead<00:05:53.470> of<00:05:53.680> microfiber

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
use LED thread instead of microfiber

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.460 
use LED thread instead of microfiber
cloth<00:05:54.700> but<00:05:55.390> overall<00:05:55.780> they're<00:05:56.170> still

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
cloth but overall they're still

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.750 
cloth but overall they're still
comfortable<00:05:57.040> they're<00:05:57.220> still<00:05:57.520> lightweight

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
comfortable they're still lightweight

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.360 
comfortable they're still lightweight
they<00:05:58.210> still<00:05:58.480> have<00:05:58.750> you<00:05:59.320> know<00:05:59.350> a<00:05:59.590> boom<00:05:59.920> mic<00:06:00.190> they

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
they still have you know a boom mic they

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.130 
they still have you know a boom mic they
still<00:06:00.610> have<00:06:00.730> inline<00:06:01.090> volume<00:06:01.300> control<00:06:01.960> but

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
still have inline volume control but

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.800 
still have inline volume control but
it's<00:06:02.290> a<00:06:02.500> little<00:06:02.680> bit<00:06:02.830> bulkier<00:06:03.610> so<00:06:04.180> it<00:06:04.540> just

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
it's a little bit bulkier so it just

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.390 
it's a little bit bulkier so it just
comes<00:06:05.020> down<00:06:05.110> to<00:06:05.260> how<00:06:05.710> much<00:06:05.800> of<00:06:05.950> a<00:06:06.010> budget<00:06:06.190> do

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
comes down to how much of a budget do

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.770 
comes down to how much of a budget do
you<00:06:06.490> have<00:06:06.640> do<00:06:06.790> you<00:06:06.850> want<00:06:07.030> to<00:06:07.090> spring<00:06:07.360> for<00:06:07.390> the

you have do you want to spring for the

you have do you want to spring for the

higher-end vengence that you know has a

are you okay with the raptors and their

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.390 
are you okay with the raptors and their
lower<00:06:16.000> cost<00:06:16.330> and<00:06:16.600> you<00:06:17.140> know<00:06:17.400> proportionally
