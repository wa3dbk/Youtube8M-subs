can understand this story because it's a
universal<00:03:58.800> thing<00:04:00.440> III<00:04:01.440> think<00:04:01.680> subtitling<00:04:02.489> is

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
universal thing III think subtitling is

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.539

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
subtitles in there and I understand a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.490 
subtitles in there and I understand a
bit<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.790> English<00:04:08.970> yet<00:04:09.299> everything<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.870> did

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
mechanism is going to be that we need to

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.009 
mechanism is going to be that we need to
get<00:04:16.620> people<00:04:17.010> who<00:04:17.220> would<00:04:17.870> tell<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.989> world

even exists and very interesting films
but<00:04:33.390> then<00:04:33.539> I'm<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> fill<00:04:33.900> person<00:04:34.229> so<00:04:34.350> I'd<00:04:34.440> like

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
but then I'm a fill person so I'd like

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.900 
but then I'm a fill person so I'd like
to<00:04:34.620> go<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:34.979> see<00:04:35.070> different<00:04:35.280> kind<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.640> films

to go and see different kind of films
but<00:04:36.510> yes<00:04:36.720> if<00:04:36.870> there<00:04:37.020> is<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.169> mechanism<00:04:37.470> put<00:04:37.800> in

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
but yes if there is a mechanism put in

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.159 
but yes if there is a mechanism put in
place<00:04:38.130> which<00:04:38.850> is<00:04:39.000> from<00:04:39.210> our<00:04:39.419> marketing<00:04:39.840> end<00:04:40.020> or

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
place which is from our marketing end or

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.620 
place which is from our marketing end or
perhaps<00:04:40.640> understanding<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:41.789> think<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.360> first

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
perhaps understanding I think the first

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.690 
perhaps understanding I think the first
thing<00:04:42.810> we<00:04:42.930> should<00:04:42.960> understand<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:44.520> West

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
thing we should understand is the West

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.270 
thing we should understand is the West
has<00:04:44.850> understood<00:04:45.240> how<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.450> market<00:04:45.930> goods<00:04:46.280> we

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
has understood how to market goods we

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.529 
has understood how to market goods we
still<00:04:47.520> are<00:04:47.669> in<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:48.000> nation<00:04:48.300> state<00:04:48.510> the

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
still are in the nation state the

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.000 
still are in the nation state the
beginning<00:04:48.930> stage<00:04:49.169> I<00:04:49.350> think<00:04:49.590> we<00:04:49.740> need<00:04:49.890> to

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
beginning stage I think we need to

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.520 
beginning stage I think we need to
understand<00:04:50.490> how<00:04:50.729> they<00:04:50.970> are<00:04:51.090> able<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.530> impress

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
understand how they are able to impress

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.010 
understand how they are able to impress
upon<00:04:52.560> me<00:04:53.039> that<00:04:53.640> my<00:04:53.850> cinema<00:04:54.300> about<00:04:54.600> my<00:04:54.810> history

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
upon me that my cinema about my history

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.480 
upon me that my cinema about my history
which<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.560> know<00:04:55.620> nothing<00:04:56.039> about

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
which I know nothing about

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.490 
which I know nothing about
I<00:04:56.520> still<00:04:57.030> go<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.270> enjoy<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.570> as<00:04:57.750> much<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.470> I

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
I still go and enjoy it as much so I

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.469 
I still go and enjoy it as much so I
think<00:04:58.590> somewhere<00:04:59.160> of<00:04:59.370> that<00:04:59.700> marketing<00:05:00.120> aspect

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
think somewhere of that marketing aspect

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.969 
think somewhere of that marketing aspect
needs<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.780> be<00:05:00.870> put<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.110> place<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.620> think<00:05:01.710> we

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
needs to be put in place and I think we

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.980 
needs to be put in place and I think we
should<00:05:02.160> take<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:02.789> help<00:05:03.090> from<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.720> rest

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
should take you and help from the rest

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.320 
should take you and help from the rest
to<00:05:04.140> do<00:05:04.260> that<00:05:04.440> besides<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.820> like<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.120> said<00:05:06.300> I

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
to do that besides that like you said I

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.640 
to do that besides that like you said I
think<00:05:06.600> cinema<00:05:06.870> has<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.050> universal<00:05:07.590> language

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
think cinema has a universal language

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.409 
think cinema has a universal language
like<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.190> said<00:05:08.370> chapter<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:09.090> lot<00:05:09.210> of<00:05:09.300> other

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
like you said chapter a lot of other

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:10.520 
like you said chapter a lot of other
films<00:05:09.720> one<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:09.960> the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
films one of the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.050 
films one of the
we<00:05:10.650> don't<00:05:10.920> really<00:05:11.190> you<00:05:11.460> don't<00:05:11.580> really<00:05:11.700> need<00:05:11.910> to

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
we don't really you don't really need to

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.880 
we don't really you don't really need to
understand<00:05:12.450> as<00:05:12.660> a<00:05:13.080> matter<00:05:13.320> of<00:05:13.440> fact<00:05:13.620> most<00:05:13.830> of

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
understand as a matter of fact most of

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.290 
understand as a matter of fact most of
the<00:05:13.980> 50<00:05:14.250> films<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.760> then<00:05:14.940> you<00:05:15.030> don't<00:05:15.210> really

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
the 50 films and then you don't really

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.860 
the 50 films and then you don't really
need<00:05:15.510> to<00:05:15.570> understand<00:05:16.050> what<00:05:16.200> I'm<00:05:16.320> seeing<00:05:16.590> in

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
need to understand what I'm seeing in

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.100 
need to understand what I'm seeing in
quite<00:05:18.870> senseless<00:05:19.170> but<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:21.240> idea<00:05:21.510> is<00:05:21.570> that<00:05:21.690> if

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
quite senseless but the idea is that if

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.400 
quite senseless but the idea is that if
you<00:05:22.230> are<00:05:22.350> able<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.920> yes<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:24.810> first<00:05:25.080> beginning

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
you are able to yes the first beginning

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.140 
you are able to yes the first beginning
would<00:05:25.680> be<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:26.310> make<00:05:26.490> sure<00:05:26.700> our<00:05:26.760> films<00:05:27.030> are

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
would be to make sure our films are

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.900 
would be to make sure our films are
shorter<00:05:27.420> I'm<00:05:27.630> a<00:05:27.660> big<00:05:28.130> advocate<00:05:29.130> of<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.700> I

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
shorter I'm a big advocate of that I

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.670 
shorter I'm a big advocate of that I
think<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.300> films<00:05:30.540> need<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.930> be<00:05:31.050> shorter<00:05:31.380> they

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
think the films need to be shorter they

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.470 
think the films need to be shorter they
need<00:05:31.860> to<00:05:32.010> be<00:05:32.160> in<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.490> format<00:05:32.850> of<00:05:32.880> an<00:05:33.120> hour<00:05:33.300> and

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
need to be in the format of an hour and

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.170 
need to be in the format of an hour and
a<00:05:33.540> half<00:05:33.720> we<00:05:34.230> cannot<00:05:34.740> impose<00:05:35.280> upon<00:05:35.670> an<00:05:35.850> audience

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
a half we cannot impose upon an audience

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.720 
a half we cannot impose upon an audience
around<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.660> world<00:05:36.900> our<00:05:37.710> timings<00:05:38.220> Indian

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
around the world our timings Indian

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.700 
around the world our timings Indian
timings<00:05:39.120> are<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.450> worst<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:39.930> we<00:05:40.470> cannot

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
timings are the worst and we cannot

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.830 
timings are the worst and we cannot
impose<00:05:41.040> that<00:05:41.490> upon<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:42.240> rest<00:05:42.420> of<00:05:42.540> the<00:05:42.630> world

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
impose that upon the rest of the world

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.600 
impose that upon the rest of the world
we<00:05:42.960> need<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.200> tell<00:05:43.380> them<00:05:43.560> it's<00:05:43.770> not<00:05:43.950> an<00:05:44.160> awful

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
we need to tell them it's not an awful

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.220 
we need to tell them it's not an awful
it's<00:05:44.850> got<00:05:45.060> song<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:45.480> dance<00:05:45.630> like<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.020> is<00:05:46.140> in

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
it's got song and dance like it is in

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.960 
it's got song and dance like it is in
Chadwick<00:05:46.560> it's<00:05:46.800> in<00:05:46.980> the<00:05:47.040> background<00:05:47.460> we<00:05:47.940> have

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
Chadwick it's in the background we have

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.090 
Chadwick it's in the background we have
four<00:05:48.240> or<00:05:48.330> five<00:05:48.480> songs<00:05:48.750> in<00:05:48.900> that<00:05:48.990> film<00:05:49.260> I<00:05:49.680> think

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
four or five songs in that film I think

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.460 
four or five songs in that film I think
we<00:05:50.880> just<00:05:51.030> need<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.300> educate<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.080> people<00:05:52.230> about

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
we just need to educate the people about
