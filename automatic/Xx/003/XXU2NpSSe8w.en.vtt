I'm<00:00:52.289> gonna<00:00:52.440> try<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.829> system<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.460> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
I'm gonna try to get a system going I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.970 
I'm gonna try to get a system going I
haven't<00:00:53.969> thought<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.780> yet<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.320> I'm

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
gonna try to maybe do a door style

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.979 
gonna try to maybe do a door style
system<00:00:58.829> where<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.120> from<00:01:00.359> one

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
system where you know they go from one

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.330 
system where you know they go from one
pin<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.379> another<00:01:01.620> no<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.890> try<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> set

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
pin to another no I'm gonna try to set

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
pin to another no I'm gonna try to set
up<00:01:02.460> seven<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.000> them<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:04.229> plant<00:01:04.530> seeds

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890

of stuff for now I have this grazing

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.749 
of stuff for now I have this grazing
frame<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:14.189> chickens<00:01:14.640> seem<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> love<00:01:15.150> it

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
frame and the chickens seem to love it

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.660 
frame and the chickens seem to love it
well<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.450> love<00:01:18.689> anything<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.670> but

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
basically all I do is I just kind of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.350 
basically all I do is I just kind of
rake<00:01:23.220> out<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> dirt<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.880> make<00:01:24.000> sure<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
rake out the dirt to make sure it's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
much of the seed as you can't of course

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.310 
much of the seed as you can't of course
my<00:01:44.820> girls<00:01:45.000> are<00:01:45.240> escaping<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> Pens

let him out anyway that as you could see

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.170 
let him out anyway that as you could see
I<00:01:52.530> put<00:01:52.770> down<00:01:52.920> quite<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> few<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.790> ones<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
I put down quite a few the ones that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.460 
I put down quite a few the ones that
don't<00:01:54.330> worry<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.690> ones<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> fall<00:01:55.260> out<00:01:55.440> of

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
don't worry the ones that fall out of

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.210 
don't worry the ones that fall out of
the<00:01:55.650> frames<00:01:56.180> your<00:01:57.180> chickens<00:01:57.540> will<00:01:57.690> get<00:01:57.810> them

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
the frames your chickens will get them

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.260 
the frames your chickens will get them
so<00:01:59.220> sure<00:02:01.640> but<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.760> don't<00:02:02.790> want<00:02:03.030> too<00:02:03.150> many

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so sure but you don't want too many

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.400 
so sure but you don't want too many
falling<00:02:03.720> out<00:02:05.120> but<00:02:06.120> anyway<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> great

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
falling out but anyway this is a great

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.710 
falling out but anyway this is a great
way<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.710> give<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.040> chickens<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.210> know<00:02:09.300> fresh

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
way to give your chickens you know fresh

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.120 
way to give your chickens you know fresh
greens<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.670> they're<00:02:12.180> only<00:02:12.360> able<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.710> eat<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
greens and they're only able to eat the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.800 
greens and they're only able to eat the
tops<00:02:14.930> hence<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.140> name<00:02:16.260> grazing<00:02:16.800> frames

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
tops hence the name grazing frames

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.730 
tops hence the name grazing frames
because<00:02:18.810> they<00:02:18.960> can't<00:02:19.170> get<00:02:19.320> down<00:02:19.470> with<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
because they can't get down with the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.110 
because they can't get down with the
roots<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.370> guys<00:02:20.520> know<00:02:20.850> our

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
roots and this you guys know our

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.400 
roots and this you guys know our
chickens<00:02:21.810> are<00:02:22.190> little<00:02:23.190> pigs<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.820> they<00:02:23.880> will

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
chickens are little pigs and they will

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.820 
chickens are little pigs and they will
eat<00:02:25.410> all<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.700> way<00:02:26.820> down<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.380> root<00:02:28.620> and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
eat all the way down to the root and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.620 
eat all the way down to the root and
they<00:02:29.280> will<00:02:29.430> tear<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.910> root<00:02:30.150> up<00:02:30.330> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
they will tear the root up and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.170 
they will tear the root up and
everything<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.440> all<00:02:31.560> plants<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.340> they<00:02:32.520> come

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
everything of all plants that they come

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.390 
everything of all plants that they come
in<00:02:33.300> contact<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:36.710> so<00:02:37.710> I'm<00:02:37.830> gonna<00:02:37.920> go<00:02:38.070> get<00:02:38.190> some
