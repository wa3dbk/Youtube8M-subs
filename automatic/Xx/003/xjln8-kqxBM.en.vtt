 with these sentences the rejection finds 2 20 Germany is in this sentence with 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.990
 6 to 3

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.400
 they whiz 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.749
 for the german team 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.119
 has long consulted Boll 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.539
 it was decided to Timo Boll for the second single 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.529
 give up 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.579
 the cells produce 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.760
 Players are allowed to play a maximum of two times 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.310
 In some places, it is the second time after his sensational victory 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.270
 but confirmed 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.980
 spectacular rally 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.050
 7 under control and were 2 7 to 4 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.550
 they are again 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.130
 no chances 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.770
 June to do before hits Kishi Korber 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.930
 this ball 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.890
 to reach 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.890
 very nice action is missing Christian sweet 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.290
 Chef Antonio Tedesco Cologne 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.290
 maybe he realized it was a pity 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.299
 once played up to this goal Timo Boll double 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.720
 that'll be the classic

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.660
 It is recommended a bit in the way and promptly used it is not ideal 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.490
 play in doubles 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.300
 allows

 Knesebeck transmitter 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.260
 excellent double 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
 second and third places in big tournaments 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.169
 are certainly slightly favored here 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.859
 for hundreds of crew leads as I said a total of 4 2-leadership still 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.609
 Point is still missing 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.079
 to collect the final 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.789
 the first many probably decided against China 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.409
 the day after tomorrow German time you have 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.319

 the newlyweds center 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.230
 then they can with this set showed three winning sets I stayed 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.659
 lie 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.449
 they have designed 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:54.619
 second man additional boost 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.369
 we have 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:59.629
 seen to this passage 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.239
 not after the attack 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.239
 shortened in second place of the overall ranking 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.569
 find this point 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.789
 18 boys 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.669

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.819

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.549
 DÃ¼sseldorf RPO may become 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:43.679
 have been asked 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.339
 which rotation played the decisive part, there are cards 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.209
 many thought 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.659
 Winter can pull 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.059
 RAA 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.059
 Drive class counter more 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.319
 after that, both the leadership are the German team 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:15.879
 Richard Prause right 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.879
 tus-trainer and Timo Boll 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.129
 now decide this sentence for yourself 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.960
 but there before 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.960
 often this is known 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.710
 Next 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.689
 one of his skills 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.689
 in a raffle 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.999
 Rank ten to score 2 set effect 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.130
 Harp now in turn 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.590
 in the lead 11 17 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.960
 first match ball 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.250
 the duo from Japan very beautiful Weibler leads large squares worth of these 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.159
 Haberer, I want her, too, that was the same 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.629
 the essential is 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:23.990
 by Jens Trommer 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.990
 March the Augur newly created 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.969
 two hours ahead but not everyone dares 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.699
 unfortunately again the lead for the Japanese 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.449
 Match ball against the German duo 8 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.080
 Prof 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.029
 that's ridiculous 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.240
 especially if it gets on the table and then the counter 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.979
 after the city is valid 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.560
 spontaneously textiles for Christian sweet in the center very difficult the situation 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.150
 it will only 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.900
 Double came in the course Timo Boll Paul 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:33.499
 lifepr army 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:36.499
 Played class 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:44.580
 Rabbit insurer to come from this ball 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.749
 It is of course a disadvantage of these nothing right conventions 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.309
 Mattern did not immediately see Emmendingen 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.309
 Lopar curiosity complained 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.649
 the Germans 

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:11.649
 Samples and drives in their favor 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.050
 Harald Rast 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.330
 in this game 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.979
 15 to the 12th 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.710
 for the Japanese 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.710
 shorten this sentence and play with 3 2 and so on 

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:30.619
 the overall ranking 

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:34.609
 Heinze two things from the Japanese point of view, so Germany will have two goals 1 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:39.819
 Christian sweet 

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:42.819
 against the number one is for Japanese against can yoga 

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:46.960
 should lose further 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.039
 with Timo Boll 

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:49.479
 the final year a silver
