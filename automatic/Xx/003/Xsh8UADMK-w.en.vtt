00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
thing about it is if you do not have a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.569 
thing about it is if you do not have a
refueling<00:00:58.260> station<00:00:58.620> around<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.309> and

refueling station around it up and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.189 
refueling station around it up and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
running that is the main power source

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.900 
running that is the main power source
behind<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.649> machine<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:02.879> work

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
behind the machine then it will not work

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.140 
behind the machine then it will not work
and<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:04.019> does<00:01:04.350> move<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.280> does<00:01:05.430> relocate

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
and it does move and it does relocate

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.810 
and it does move and it does relocate
itself<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.560> other<00:01:07.590> refueling<00:01:08.189> stations<00:01:08.610> and
