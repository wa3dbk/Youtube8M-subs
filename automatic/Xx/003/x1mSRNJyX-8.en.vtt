into a debe while I use it as a dev up

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.000 
into a debe while I use it as a dev up
and<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:23.160> sharpen<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.019> 24<00:00:25.019> degrees<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
and the sharpen to 24 degrees with the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.669 
and the sharpen to 24 degrees with the
angle<00:00:26.340> cube<00:00:26.580> setting<00:00:27.590> 24<00:00:28.590> degrees<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:30.679> I've

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
angle cube setting 24 degrees and I've

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.380 
angle cube setting 24 degrees and I've
taken<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.160> through<00:00:32.309> three<00:00:32.610> stones<00:00:33.559> 800<00:00:35.390> 1000

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
taken it through three stones 800 1000

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.440 
taken it through three stones 800 1000
and<00:00:36.600> now<00:00:37.590> my<00:00:37.920> final<00:00:38.250> stone<00:00:38.730> will<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and now my final stone will be the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.690 
and now my final stone will be the
trasero

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
trasero

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.630 
trasero
2k<00:00:41.700> stone<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.780> thought<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.770> will<00:00:44.309> just

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
2k stone and I thought I will just

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.160 
2k stone and I thought I will just
quickly<00:00:44.930> like<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> short<00:00:46.289> video<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.950> my<00:00:47.430> final

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
quickly like a short video of my final

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.319 
quickly like a short video of my final
stone<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.410> Duke<00:00:49.680> H<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.129> Siena<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.789> stopped

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
stone the Duke H of Siena I stopped

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.040 
stone the Duke H of Siena I stopped
there<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.710> works<00:00:52.980> wonders<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.899> let's<00:00:54.899> go

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
there and it works wonders so let's go

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.260 
there and it works wonders so let's go
ahead<00:00:57.350> here<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> stone<00:00:59.270> angle

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
ahead here we have the stone angle

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.070 
ahead here we have the stone angle
always<00:01:00.600> been<00:01:00.809> set<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:02.090> with<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.480> angle<00:01:03.930> cube

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
always been set up with the angle cube

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:16.460 
always been set up with the angle cube
to<00:01:07.080> 24<00:01:07.560> degrees<00:01:07.710> per<00:01:08.310> side

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.319 

right

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.830 

very<00:01:22.930> very<00:01:23.170> light<00:01:23.469> pressure

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:39.180 

so<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.439> use<00:01:27.680> it<00:01:27.710> finally<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.880> stone

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:58.590 

one<00:01:40.190> boss

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
to bosses that I changed sides you'll

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.120 
to bosses that I changed sides you'll
notice<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:05.049> move<00:02:05.320> my<00:02:05.530> body<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:06.509> move<00:02:07.509> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
EP at approximately 45 degree angle make

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.360 
EP at approximately 45 degree angle make
it<00:02:13.690> nice<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:13.840> comfortable<00:02:14.200> for<00:02:14.709> me<00:02:14.890> alright

light<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:22.480> very<00:02:22.510> light<00:02:23.080> passes

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:46.900 

one

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:56.770 

let's<00:02:47.540> do

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.350 

but<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.470> looks<00:02:57.650> good<00:02:58.220> Hebert<00:03:00.730> I've<00:03:01.730> used<00:03:02.060> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
but it looks good Hebert I've used a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.940 
but it looks good Hebert I've used a
cell<00:03:02.960> block<00:03:03.940> or<00:03:04.940> felt<00:03:05.330> block<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:06.500> what<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:06.800> do

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
cell block or felt block and what I do

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.300 
cell block or felt block and what I do
is<00:03:08.110> when<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.170> make<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.710> cut

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
is when I make the cut

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.170 
is when I make the cut
I<00:03:10.340> actually<00:03:10.760> twist<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:12.800> blade<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.640> cut<00:03:13.970> I

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
I actually twist the blade in the cut I

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.070 
I actually twist the blade in the cut I
twist<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.420> there<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.510> more<00:03:17.540> lateral

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
twist it so that there is more lateral

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.710 
twist it so that there is more lateral
pressure<00:03:18.410> less<00:03:19.160> little<00:03:19.430> pressure<00:03:19.760> on<00:03:20.350> the

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
pressure less little pressure on the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.410 
pressure less little pressure on the
size<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.230> bird<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:26.150> take<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.510> off<00:03:26.660> nicely

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
size of the bird to take it off nicely

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.660 
size of the bird to take it off nicely
piece<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.570> cork<00:03:29.830> same<00:03:30.830> thing<00:03:31.130> they<00:03:31.310> with<00:03:31.580> a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
piece of cork same thing they with a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.050 
piece of cork same thing they with a
call

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:50.090 

and<00:03:39.410> now<00:03:40.410> my<00:03:42.770> final<00:03:46.220> couple<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.400> bosses<00:03:49.100> this

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
and now my final couple of bosses this

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.460 
and now my final couple of bosses this
is<00:03:50.310> really<00:03:53.150> roundabout<00:03:54.150> starts<00:03:54.630> with<00:03:54.960> me<00:03:55.170> and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
is really roundabout starts with me and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.510 
is really roundabout starts with me and
the<00:03:55.590> EP<00:03:56.150> linear<00:03:57.150> vibration<00:03:57.270> and<00:03:58.020> note<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:59.190> work

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
the EP linear vibration and note I work

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.050 
the EP linear vibration and note I work
only<00:03:59.790> into<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.600> blade<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:01.110> my<00:04:02.100> final<00:04:02.550> process

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
only into the blade on my final process

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.330 
only into the blade on my final process
as<00:04:03.270> he<00:04:03.300> moves<00:04:03.750> they<00:04:04.050> burn<00:04:04.290> instead<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:05.100> bending

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
as he moves they burn instead of bending

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.080 
as he moves they burn instead of bending
it<00:04:05.580> back<00:04:05.820> down<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:07.110> actually<00:04:07.640> cuts<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.790> bird

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
it back down it actually cuts the bird

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.440 
it back down it actually cuts the bird
off<00:04:09.300> nicely<00:04:09.570> very<00:04:10.080> very<00:04:10.710> like<00:04:11.070> extremely<00:04:11.760> like

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
off nicely very very like extremely like

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:22.730 
off nicely very very like extremely like
this<00:04:12.980> as<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.220> can<00:04:14.250> see<00:04:19.700> that's<00:04:20.700> one<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.740> change

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
this as you can see that's one I change

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:40.629 
this as you can see that's one I change
sides<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:24.390> each<00:04:24.630> single<00:04:25.440> pass

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.059 

I<00:04:40.669> do<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.449> same<00:04:41.479> with<00:04:41.719> this<00:04:42.849> not<00:04:43.849> the<00:04:44.000> bosses

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069
