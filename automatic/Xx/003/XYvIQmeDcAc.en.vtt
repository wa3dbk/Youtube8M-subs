00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.170
 General McArthur wants you ahead. 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.170
 I was told there would be 2,000 imperial troops on the street. 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.500
 Performers can get us off at any time. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.599
 Tell Washington that I have advised my experts and there is nothing to worry about. 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.019
 Let's show them some old classic American arrogance. 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.000
 The president gave me 10 days to conduct research on the emperor's role in the war. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.330
 - Ten days? - Correctly. - It is not possible, sir. 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.070
 This job is yours. 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.080
 You know this country. I trust you. 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.390
 If I was going through a trial, I would blow up the spark in the powder store just at the wrong time. 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.040

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.910
 If I arrest the Emperor ... I will face mass suicide and possibly an open revolution. 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.380
 I want you to capture all suspects within an hour. 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.790
 - How long since you were here? - Five years ago, sir. 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.140
 My uncle is a general. It can help. 

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.029
 This country is hungry. 

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:17.229
 It is at the edge of total collapse. 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.290
 This dissatisfaction will not get them to turn into a revolution. 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.039
 The Americans want the emperor's head on a stake. 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.439
 If you want to save the Emperor. 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.430
 I need proof. 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.530
 Has the Emperor ordered the attack on Pearl Harbor? 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.070
 It is not black and white. 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.140
 Your skies are full of kamikaze. 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.700
 Millions died in his name. 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.429
 You chewed up two of our cities. 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.889
 - Justice must be attributed. - Revenge is not the same thing as justice. 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.390
 I'm about to make the biggest decision about the occupation. 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.230
 Which may end the future of Japan. 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.000
 All I have is speculation. I see no evidence. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.670
 I do not care what you do .. 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.270
 A miracle if needed. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.390
 Bring me the Emperor. 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.380
 - I have not met emperor again. - Much less God. 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.080
 What the hell do you say to a god?
