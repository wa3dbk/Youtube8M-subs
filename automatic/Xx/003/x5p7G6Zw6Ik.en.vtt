00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.760 

I<00:01:27.480> think<00:01:28.480> very<00:01:28.720> satisfying<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.560> think

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
I think very satisfying I think

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.350 
I think very satisfying I think
satisfying<00:01:30.310> on<00:01:30.460> both<00:01:30.640> counts<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.120> think

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
satisfying on both counts I think

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.110 
satisfying on both counts I think
sometimes<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:32.020> bit<00:01:32.170> scary<00:01:32.760> often<00:01:33.760> because

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
sometimes it's a bit scary often because

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.910 
sometimes it's a bit scary often because
the<00:01:34.360> students<00:01:34.720> who<00:01:34.840> started<00:01:35.230> a<00:01:35.290> long<00:01:35.440> time<00:01:35.680> ago

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
and left may have not done so well you

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.880 
and left may have not done so well you
know<00:01:37.810> they<00:01:37.930> may<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.110> encountered<00:01:38.500> struggles

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
know they may have encountered struggles

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.290
