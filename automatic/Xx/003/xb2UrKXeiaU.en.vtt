Henle<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.739> eyeliner<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.910> make<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
Henle with this eyeliner to just make a

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.680 
Henle with this eyeliner to just make a
little<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.500> know<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> guide<00:00:53.460> line<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.570> I'm

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
little you know like a guide line so I'm

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
little you know like a guide line so I'm
doing<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:56.250> actually

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
doing that and then I'm actually

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.569 
doing that and then I'm actually
stretching<00:00:57.180> my<00:00:57.329> eye<00:00:58.170> while<00:00:58.980> doing<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
stretching my eye while doing this I

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.189 
stretching my eye while doing this I
think<00:00:59.760> that's<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> best<00:01:00.300> way<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.840> it

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
think that's the best way to do it

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.009 
think that's the best way to do it
and<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.250> stretching<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.059> outwards<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and I'm just stretching it outwards in a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.509 
and I'm just stretching it outwards in a
straight<00:01:04.379> line<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:04.979> trying<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> make<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
