he<00:01:27.630> certainly<00:01:27.990> knows<00:01:28.410> romance<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.400> think

he certainly knows romance and I think

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.580 
he certainly knows romance and I think
this<00:01:29.760> is<00:01:29.910> a<00:01:29.940> great<00:01:30.210> idea<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.690> explore<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> idea

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
this is a great idea to explore the idea

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.430 
this is a great idea to explore the idea
of<00:01:31.770> lost<00:01:32.040> love<00:01:32.540> revisited<00:01:33.540> who<00:01:33.990> doesn't<00:01:34.380> have

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
of lost love revisited who doesn't have

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.590 
of lost love revisited who doesn't have
someone<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:34.890> feel<00:01:34.920> gone<00:01:35.700> away<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.270> maybe

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
someone they feel gone away and maybe

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300 
someone they feel gone away and maybe

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.470 
things had worked out life today would
be<00:01:38.340> different<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.360> movie

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
be different and I think this movie

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.820 
be different and I think this movie
seems<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.050> a<00:01:40.080> good<00:01:40.380> job<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.740> addressing

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
seems to do a good job of addressing

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.910 
seems to do a good job of addressing
that<00:01:41.370> wish<00:01:42.440> however<00:01:43.440> there's<00:01:43.680> an<00:01:43.770> unfortunate

that wish however there's an unfortunate

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
that wish however there's an unfortunate
behind<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.940> scenes<00:01:45.180> situation<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> I

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
behind the scenes situation here that I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.080 
behind the scenes situation here that I
don't<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.500> has<00:01:46.590> been<00:01:46.770> resolved<00:01:47.400> on<00:01:47.550> screen

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090

Paul<00:01:49.020> Walker<00:01:49.260> was<00:01:49.500> originally<00:01:49.950> supposed<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
Paul Walker was originally supposed to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
Paul Walker was originally supposed to
star<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.760> this<00:01:50.880> film<00:01:51.090> apparently<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.840> James

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
star in this film apparently and James

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
star in this film apparently and James
Marston<00:01:52.680> took<00:01:52.830> over<00:01:53.010> for<00:01:53.340> him<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.790> while<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
Marston took over for him and while I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.390 
Marston took over for him and while I
think<00:01:54.360> James<00:01:54.750> Marsden<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> somewhat<00:01:56.160> good

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
think James Marsden is a somewhat good

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.850 
think James Marsden is a somewhat good

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
course nothing can take Paul Walker's

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.720 
course nothing can take Paul Walker's
place<00:02:00.710> but<00:02:01.710> while<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.310> him<00:02:02.460> being<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
place but while I can see him being a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.700 
place but while I can see him being a
good<00:02:02.880> fit<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.300> take<00:02:03.510> his<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.990> take<00:02:04.170> over<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.440> role

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
good fit to take his to take over a role

from it from him you know just you know
on<00:02:07.860> paper<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.790> straight<00:02:09.510> forward<00:02:09.960> with

on paper and just straight forward with

on paper and just straight forward with

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
this anchor in the past here I don't

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.180 
this anchor in the past here I don't
think<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.200> working<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.740> that's<00:02:13.890> largely

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
think it's working and that's largely

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.890 
think it's working and that's largely
because<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.850> actor<00:02:15.150> they've<00:02:15.300> cast<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
because of the actor they've cast is the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.560 
because of the actor they've cast is the
younger<00:02:16.200> version<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:17.280> male<00:02:18.000> character

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
younger version of that male character

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.020 
younger version of that male character
and<00:02:18.780> that's<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.080> actor<00:02:19.410> Luke<00:02:19.950> Bracy<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.700> I

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and that's this actor Luke Bracy and I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.310 
and that's this actor Luke Bracy and I
took<00:02:21.270> truth<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.630> told<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.930> don't<00:02:21.990> think<00:02:22.200> Luke

took truth be told I don't think Luke

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.420 
took truth be told I don't think Luke
embraced<00:02:22.590> he<00:02:22.710> looks<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.040> young<00:02:23.190> version

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
embraced he looks like a young version

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.729 
embraced he looks like a young version
of<00:02:23.640> Paul<00:02:23.850> Walker<00:02:24.030> either<00:02:24.450> both<00:02:25.230> Paul<00:02:25.530> Walker

and<00:02:25.980> James<00:02:26.190> Marsden<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.820> mean<00:02:27.090> all<00:02:27.239> three<00:02:27.390> men

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
and James Marsden I mean all three men

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.090 
and James Marsden I mean all three men
are<00:02:27.660> obviously<00:02:28.110> attractive<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:28.950> guess

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
are obviously attractive and I guess

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.590 
are obviously attractive and I guess
maybe<00:02:29.280> that's<00:02:29.459> how<00:02:29.820> Hollywood<00:02:30.060> felt<00:02:30.450> they

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
maybe that's how Hollywood felt they

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.520 
maybe that's how Hollywood felt they
were<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.840> oh<00:02:30.959> they're<00:02:31.110> all<00:02:31.230> kind<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
were like oh they're all kind of

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.440 
were like oh they're all kind of
attractive<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.190> same<00:02:32.400> way<00:02:32.610> but<00:02:33.180> I'd<00:02:33.330> be

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
attractive in the same way but I'd be

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.479 
attractive in the same way but I'd be
like<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.720> know<00:02:33.840> there's<00:02:34.320> there's<00:02:34.620> frames<00:02:35.100> and

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
like you know there's there's frames and

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.729 
like you know there's there's frames and
bells<00:02:35.730> there's<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.180> physicality<00:02:36.630> about<00:02:37.110> people

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
bells there's a physicality about people

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.340 
bells there's a physicality about people
and<00:02:37.980> Luke<00:02:38.250> Bracy<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.820> just<00:02:39.120> bigger<00:02:39.720> than<00:02:40.050> both

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
and Luke Bracy is just bigger than both

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.979 
and Luke Bracy is just bigger than both
Paul<00:02:40.980> Walker<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.580> James<00:02:42.090> Marsden<00:02:42.480> maybe<00:02:42.840> you

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
Paul Walker and James Marsden maybe you

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.300 
Paul Walker and James Marsden maybe you
could<00:02:43.140> argue<00:02:43.380> he<00:02:43.410> doesn't<00:02:43.770> work<00:02:43.890> out<00:02:44.040> as<00:02:44.190> much

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
could argue he doesn't work out as much

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.280 
could argue he doesn't work out as much
anymore<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:44.910> he<00:02:45.030> shrank<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.390> little<00:02:45.420> bit<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.230> he

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
anymore so he shrank a little bit but he

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.880 
anymore so he shrank a little bit but he
just<00:02:46.470> has<00:02:46.620> both<00:02:47.070> Poe<00:02:47.370> Paul<00:02:48.000> Walker<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:49.260> James

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
just has both Poe Paul Walker and James

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.530 
just has both Poe Paul Walker and James
Morrison<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.370> think<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.640> particular<00:02:51.120> have

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
Morrison I think in particular have

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.930 
Morrison I think in particular have
small<00:02:51.989> frames<00:02:52.410> they're<00:02:53.220> lean<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.820> know

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
small frames they're lean you know

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.000 
small frames they're lean you know
they're<00:02:54.270> that's<00:02:55.080> why<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.590> Paul<00:02:55.800> Walker

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
they're that's why I think Paul Walker

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.490 
they're that's why I think Paul Walker
had<00:02:56.250> such<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.489> great<00:02:56.700> career<00:02:56.850> in<00:02:57.110> sports<00:02:58.110> movies

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
had such a great career in sports movies

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.979 
had such a great career in sports movies
with<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:59.640> surfing<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.330> being<00:03:00.480> extreme

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
with like surfing and being extreme

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.750 
with like surfing and being extreme
sports<00:03:01.380> because<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.830> body<00:03:02.070> type<00:03:02.280> tends<00:03:02.580> to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
sports because that body type tends to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.780 
sports because that body type tends to
go<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.170> field<00:03:04.620> where<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.610> Luke

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
go to that to that field where is Luke

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.920 
go to that to that field where is Luke
brace<00:03:06.000> he<00:03:06.150> looks<00:03:06.330> more<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.660> football

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
out of it

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.530 
out of it
I<00:03:17.010> was<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.550> love<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:18.090> idea<00:03:18.269> of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
I was like I love this idea of

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.110 
I was like I love this idea of
revisiting<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.170> lost<00:03:19.380> love<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.700> know<00:03:20.820> what

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
revisiting a lost love you know what

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.300 
revisiting a lost love you know what
could<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:21.450> been<00:03:21.660> maybe<00:03:21.930> will<00:03:22.200> still<00:03:22.470> be<00:03:22.680> but

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
could have been maybe will still be but

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.040 
could have been maybe will still be but
yet<00:03:23.519> that's<00:03:24.030> not<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.420> guy<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.630> fell<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:25.019> love

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
yet that's not the guy you fell in love

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.479 
yet that's not the guy you fell in love
with<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.709> some<00:03:25.860> new<00:03:26.010> guy<00:03:26.190> who's<00:03:26.459> just

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
with this is some new guy who's just

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.430 
with this is some new guy who's just
stolen<00:03:26.970> his<00:03:27.090> identity<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.080> wanted

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
stolen his identity and you just wanted

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.690 
stolen his identity and you just wanted
to<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.650> him<00:03:28.770> so<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:28.980> guess<00:03:29.130> you're<00:03:29.310> going<00:03:29.400> along

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
to be him so I guess you're going along

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.550 
to be him so I guess you're going along
with<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:30.090> would<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.300> hilarious<00:03:30.660> twist

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
with it that would be a hilarious twist

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.500 
with it that would be a hilarious twist
I<00:03:31.590> think<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.160> casting<00:03:32.550> with<00:03:32.670> liana<00:03:33.000> liberato

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
I think the casting with liana liberato

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.420 
I think the casting with liana liberato
Joe<00:03:33.629> and<00:03:33.780> Michelle<00:03:34.080> monoghan<00:03:34.739> are<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.400> a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
Joe and Michelle monoghan are is a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.850 
Joe and Michelle monoghan are is a
little<00:03:35.790> better<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.750> even<00:03:36.810> still<00:03:37.319> I<00:03:37.349> think<00:03:37.530> I

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
little better but even still I think I

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.289 
little better but even still I think I
would<00:03:38.220> have<00:03:38.310> gone<00:03:38.430> with<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.640> different<00:03:39.090> Oh

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
would have gone with a different Oh

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.990 
would have gone with a different Oh
different<00:03:40.200> much<00:03:41.069> different<00:03:41.099> casting<00:03:41.819> on<00:03:41.909> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
different much different casting on the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.220 
different much different casting on the
younger<00:03:42.239> actors<00:03:42.569> because<00:03:42.840> they<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.080> simply

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
younger actors because they just simply

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.660 
younger actors because they just simply
don't<00:03:43.560> look<00:03:43.680> like<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.890> older<00:03:44.129> versions<00:03:44.519> and

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
don't look like the older versions and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.490 
don't look like the older versions and
they're<00:03:44.760> not<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:45.030> named<00:03:45.239> talent<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.870> know<00:03:46.379> I
