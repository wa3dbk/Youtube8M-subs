okie-dokie so this is gonna be my next
speedrun<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.210> edge<00:00:06.540> craft<00:00:07.020> any<00:00:07.290> person

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
speedrun of the edge craft any person

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.680 
speedrun of the edge craft any person
category<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.280> time<00:00:08.550> rather<00:00:09.120> than<00:00:09.269> any

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
category this time rather than any

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.620 
category this time rather than any
percent<00:00:10.139> no<00:00:10.320> s<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.740> Q<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:10.980> out<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.280> bounds<00:00:11.630> so

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
percent no s and Q are out of bounds so

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.600 
percent no s and Q are out of bounds so
yeah<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.410> decided<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.920> give<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.400> shot

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
yeah I decided to give this in a shot

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.980 
yeah I decided to give this in a shot
now<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:14.969> because<00:00:15.269> I'm<00:00:15.509> pretty<00:00:15.780> satisfied

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
now just because I'm pretty satisfied

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.210 
now just because I'm pretty satisfied
with<00:00:16.320> my<00:00:16.590> time<00:00:16.890> within<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.910> other<00:00:18.890> edge<00:00:19.890> craft

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
with my time within the other edge craft

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.150 
with my time within the other edge craft
category<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.420> yeah<00:00:21.869> decided<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.830> thought<00:00:23.039> I'd

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
category so yeah decided I thought I'd

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.359 
category so yeah decided I thought I'd
give<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.760> try<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.720> bam<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.980> got<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> pretty

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
give this a try and bam we got a pretty

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.140 
give this a try and bam we got a pretty
good<00:00:26.460> time

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
good time

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.269 
good time
of<00:00:27.630> course<00:00:27.930> compared<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.740> world<00:00:28.920> record

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
of course compared to the world record

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.769 
of course compared to the world record
time<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.849> don't<00:00:30.090> know<00:00:30.330> if<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.570> would<00:00:30.720> have

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
time it I don't know if I would have

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.269 
time it I don't know if I would have
necessarily<00:00:31.050> had<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.500> world<00:00:31.740> record<00:00:32.009> if<00:00:32.160> I

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
necessarily had the world record if I

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.819 
necessarily had the world record if I
were<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> use<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.790> same<00:00:32.969> route<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.829> because

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
were to use the same route but because

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.110 
were to use the same route but because
