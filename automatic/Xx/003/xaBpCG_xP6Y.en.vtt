00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.789 
if you saw me there we go take that
can't<00:03:48.569> believe<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.780> got<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.049> shot<00:03:49.379> does<00:03:49.769> a

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
can't believe I got that shot does a

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.559 
can't believe I got that shot does a
long<00:03:50.190> shot<00:03:50.519> with<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.760> silencer<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.329> I

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
long shot with the silencer on it I

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.270 
long shot with the silencer on it I
guess<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.379> only<00:03:52.470> reason<00:03:52.859> I<00:03:52.919> got<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.190> is

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
guess the only reason I got that is

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.349 
guess the only reason I got that is
because<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.519> hit<00:03:53.639> that<00:03:53.669> guy<00:03:53.909> in<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.090> head<00:03:54.120> or

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
because the hit that guy in the head or

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.420 
because the hit that guy in the head or
something<00:03:54.540> but<00:03:55.260> I'll<00:03:55.769> take<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:55.980> dude<00:03:56.190> I'll<00:03:56.280> take

something but I'll take a dude I'll take

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.530 
something but I'll take a dude I'll take
it<00:03:56.579> there<00:03:56.760> another<00:03:56.940> sniper<00:03:57.150> back<00:03:57.389> here

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540
