he<00:01:59.640> does<00:02:00.049> when<00:02:01.049> i<00:02:01.079> purchased<00:02:01.469> him<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
he does when i purchased him because the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.850 
he does when i purchased him because the
all<00:02:02.610> i<00:02:02.640> had<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.119> picture<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.829> when<00:02:04.829> i

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
all i had was a picture and when i

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.920 
all i had was a picture and when i
finally<00:02:04.979> got<00:02:05.759> him<00:02:05.939> i<00:02:06.180> actually<00:02:06.689> thought<00:02:06.869> he

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
finally got him i actually thought he

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.460 
finally got him i actually thought he
was<00:02:07.140> actually<00:02:07.320> quite<00:02:07.560> handsome

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
was actually quite handsome

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.380 
was actually quite handsome
and<00:02:08.590> if<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.979> can<00:02:09.130> imagine<00:02:09.220> like<00:02:09.940> if<00:02:10.090> he<00:02:10.180> had

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
and if you can imagine like if he had

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.210 
and if you can imagine like if he had
the<00:02:10.509> skin<00:02:10.780> over<00:02:10.930> his<00:02:11.140> face<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.590> think<00:02:11.860> he'd<00:02:12.010> be<00:02:12.190> a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
the skin over his face I think he'd be a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.910 
the skin over his face I think he'd be a
really<00:02:12.700> handsome<00:02:12.940> boy<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:14.140> anyway<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.770> is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
really handsome boy but anyway this is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.670 
really handsome boy but anyway this is
who<00:02:15.100> he<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.700> Jonna<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:17.110> tried<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.380> come

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
who he is and Jonna I have tried to come

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.400 
who he is and Jonna I have tried to come
up<00:02:17.710> for<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:18.010> name<00:02:18.190> with<00:02:18.430> him<00:02:18.550> but<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.810> just

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
up for a name with him but I just

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.110 
up for a name with him but I just
thought<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.800> would<00:02:20.890> be<00:02:20.950> much<00:02:21.250> better<00:02:21.310> if<00:02:21.730> I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
thought it would be much better if I

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.240 
thought it would be much better if I
could<00:02:22.180> get<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.630> guys<00:02:22.870> involved<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.650> you
