operations<00:00:25.289> i'll<00:00:25.650> load<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.070> now<00:00:27.470> i'll<00:00:28.470> go

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
operations i'll load that now i'll go

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.810 
operations i'll load that now i'll go
ahead<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.740> start<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> time<00:00:29.250> lapse<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820

one camera that's connected the interval

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.080 
one camera that's connected the interval
is<00:00:31.710> five<00:00:31.740> seconds<00:00:32.460> i'll<00:00:32.880> press<00:00:33.210> manual<00:00:33.660> start
