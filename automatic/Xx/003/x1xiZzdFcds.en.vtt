00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
so we type in and cut their objective c

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.420 
so we type in and cut their objective c
so<00:02:38.340> he<00:02:38.549> created<00:02:38.939> LS<00:02:39.659> there<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.319> go<00:02:40.500> ductive

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
tutorial going to go through each line

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.170 
tutorial going to go through each line
explaining<00:04:00.479> what's<00:04:00.720> going<00:04:01.049> on<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:02.519> this<00:04:02.759> video

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
explaining what's going on so this video

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.879 
explaining what's going on so this video
is<00:04:03.329> just<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.599> show<00:04:03.870> how<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.139> compile<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.829> run

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
is just to show how to compile and run

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.030 
is just to show how to compile and run
it<00:04:05.189> so<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:05.879> have<00:04:06.269> everything<00:04:06.780> here<00:04:07.139> saved<00:04:07.829> it

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
it so you have everything here saved it

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.649 
it so you have everything here saved it
so<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.400> can<00:04:08.669> type<00:04:08.879> them<00:04:09.680> hello<00:04:10.680> world<00:04:11.659> there

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
so you can type them hello world there

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.259 
so you can type them hello world there
you<00:04:12.750> go<00:04:12.930> that's<00:04:13.799> what<00:04:14.009> you<00:04:14.189> just<00:04:14.430> typed<00:04:14.759> in<00:04:15.060> all

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
you go that's what you just typed in all

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.259 
you go that's what you just typed in all
right<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:15.780> two<00:04:16.079> dots<00:04:16.349> quit<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.699> that<00:04:17.909> you<00:04:18.120> can

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
right so two dots quit so that you can

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.540 
right so two dots quit so that you can
just<00:04:18.419> quit<00:04:18.810> without<00:04:19.019> saving<00:04:19.789> now<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:23.190> in<00:04:23.400> order

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
just quit without saving now to in order

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.240 
just quit without saving now to in order
to<00:04:23.700> compile<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.389> you<00:04:24.570> have<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.110> type<00:04:25.349> in

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
to compile it you have to type in

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.720 
to compile it you have to type in
this<00:04:26.910> command<00:04:27.360> GCC<00:04:28.320> negative<00:04:28.770> all<00:04:28.980> following

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
this command GCC negative all following

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.630 
this command GCC negative all following
these<00:04:29.940> parameters<00:04:30.710> this<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.860> very<00:04:32.010> important

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
these parameters this is very important

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.710 
these parameters this is very important
it<00:04:32.940> should<00:04:33.270> be<00:04:33.450> in<00:04:33.690> this<00:04:34.020> order<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:35.600> if<00:04:36.600> you

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
it should be in this order and if you

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.380 
it should be in this order and if you
don't<00:04:36.960> do<00:04:37.170> this<00:04:37.350> your<00:04:38.190> compilation<00:04:38.910> will<00:04:39.120> fail

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
don't do this your compilation will fail

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.960 
don't do this your compilation will fail
and<00:04:40.850> it's<00:04:41.850> not<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.090> good<00:04:42.300> thing<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:43.700> follow<00:04:44.700> this

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
and it's not a good thing so follow this

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.170 
and it's not a good thing so follow this
and<00:04:45.470> you'll<00:04:46.470> be<00:04:46.740> just<00:04:47.070> fine<00:04:47.160> compiling<00:04:48.000> your

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
and you'll be just fine compiling your

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.220 
and you'll be just fine compiling your
program<00:04:48.800> so<00:04:49.800> let's<00:04:50.070> type<00:04:50.400> in<00:04:50.630> GCC<00:04:51.630> negative

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
program so let's type in GCC negative

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.790 
program so let's type in GCC negative
all<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.440> name<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.520> program<00:04:53.960> so<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.620> will

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
all the name of the program so it will

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.730 
all the name of the program so it will
