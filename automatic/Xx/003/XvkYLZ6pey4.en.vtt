products<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.290> not<00:01:46.470> been<00:01:46.500> tested<00:01:47.040> on

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
products that have not been tested on

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.859 
products that have not been tested on
animals<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:47.820> specifically<00:01:48.540> look<00:01:48.840> for

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
animals I don't specifically look for

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.429 
animals I don't specifically look for
vegan<00:01:49.829> products<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.939> products<00:01:51.479> may<00:01:52.049> still

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
vegan products so products may still

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.920 
vegan products so products may still
contain<00:01:52.799> animal<00:01:53.369> by-products<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> buy

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
contain animal by-products that I buy

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.499 
contain animal by-products that I buy
it's<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.799> bonus<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.670> vegan<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.329> it's

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it's just a bonus if it's vegan but it's

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.179 
it's just a bonus if it's vegan but it's
not<00:01:57.659> something<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.020> look<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.530> specifically

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
now that's considered the fairly

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.469 
now that's considered the fairly
softcore<00:02:01.560> version<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.340> cruelty<00:02:02.670> free<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.180> I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
that's for you I first did a massive

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.580 
that's for you I first did a massive
purge<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.579> all<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.269> my<00:02:45.510> non<00:02:46.139> cruelty-free

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
purge of all of my non cruelty-free

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.470 
purge of all of my non cruelty-free
products<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.340> then<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.519> just<00:02:47.819> pretty<00:02:48.359> much

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
products and then I just pretty much

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.030 
products and then I just pretty much
replaced<00:02:48.840> them<00:02:48.989> all<00:02:49.139> straight<00:02:49.379> away<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.769> could

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
replaced them all straight away I could

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.080 
replaced them all straight away I could
only<00:02:50.159> do<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.459> because<00:02:50.609> I<00:02:50.730> was<00:02:50.909> in<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
only do that because I was in the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.030 
only do that because I was in the
financial<00:02:51.299> position<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:51.989> do<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.680> do<00:02:52.950> it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
financial position to do it so you do it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.949 
financial position to do it so you do it
as<00:02:53.129> slowly<00:02:53.400> as<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.730> need<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.239> do<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.629> you<00:02:54.720> can

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
as slowly as you need to do what you can

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.379 
as slowly as you need to do what you can
like<00:02:55.379> maybe<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:56.040> use<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.000> products<00:02:57.329> that

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
like maybe just use up the products that

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.750 
like maybe just use up the products that
you<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.870> replace<00:02:58.170> them<00:02:58.439> as<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.950> go<00:02:58.980> so

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760
