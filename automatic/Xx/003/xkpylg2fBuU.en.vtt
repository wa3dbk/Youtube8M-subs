playing this is just one way to to beat

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.340 
playing this is just one way to to beat
a<00:01:51.689> level<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> trick<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.450> rat<00:01:54.840> race<00:01:55.049> is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
a level so the trick with rat race is

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.740 
a level so the trick with rat race is
that<00:01:55.969> now<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.509> our<00:01:57.570> first

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
that now here we go with our first

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.800 
that now here we go with our first
timing<00:01:58.290> your<00:01:58.380> timing<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> dropping<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
timing your timing the dropping of that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.420 
timing your timing the dropping of that
right<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.930> top<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.649> nearly<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:01.979> when<00:02:02.369> it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
right on top of it or nearly so when it

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.310 
right on top of it or nearly so when it
goes<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.820> exactly<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.719> since<00:02:04.170> they're

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
goes on exactly and since they're

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.410 
goes on exactly and since they're
separated<00:02:05.070> by<00:02:05.100> these<00:02:05.250> two<00:02:05.549> columns<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:06.180> you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
separated by these two columns here you

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.779 
separated by these two columns here you
can't<00:02:06.719> place<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> bomb<00:02:07.439> anywhere<00:02:08.429> else<00:02:08.610> with

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
can't place a bomb anywhere else with

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.839 
can't place a bomb anywhere else with
that<00:02:08.910> Center<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.479> hit<00:02:09.629> bottle<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.140> hit<00:02:10.229> both

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
that Center and hit bottle and hit both

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.180
