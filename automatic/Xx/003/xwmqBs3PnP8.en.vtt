enough<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:37.010> let's<00:04:38.010> see<00:04:38.190> how<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.430> car<00:04:38.760> quanta

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
enough and let's see how the car quanta

quad-core it's mighty threaded so that

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.060 
quad-core it's mighty threaded so that
means<00:04:45.000> there<00:04:45.540> are<00:04:45.660> four<00:04:45.900> cores<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.500> each<00:04:46.710> one

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
means there are four cores and each one
