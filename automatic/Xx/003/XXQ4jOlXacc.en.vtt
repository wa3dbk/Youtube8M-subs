style except for this one in the corner
here<00:00:40.379> which<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.820> representing<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> ghost

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
here which is representing the ghost

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.970 
here which is representing the ghost
when<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.230> you're<00:00:43.350> facing<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.860> in

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
when actually when you're facing it in

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
when actually when you're facing it in
Super<00:00:44.399> Mario<00:00:44.670> World<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.210> running<00:00:45.420> away

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
Super Mario World and it's running away

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.240 
Super Mario World and it's running away
from<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.260> most<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.770> guys<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:47.070> know

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
from you as most of you guys would know

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.709 
from you as most of you guys would know
and<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> ghosts<00:00:48.660> from

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and as I know these are the ghosts from

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.830 
and as I know these are the ghosts from
Super<00:00:49.530> Mario<00:00:49.559> World<00:00:50.090> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.270> also<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.660> this

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
Super Mario World you can also see this

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.500 
Super Mario World you can also see this
is<00:00:52.430> plate<00:00:53.430> number<00:00:53.730> 50<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.329> hasn't

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
is plate number 50 so this hasn't

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.760 
is plate number 50 so this hasn't
actually<00:00:54.780> come<00:00:54.870> out<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.110> Australia<00:00:55.530> we've

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
only got plates 1 to 20 looking at the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.810 
only got plates 1 to 20 looking at the
back<00:00:58.710> quickly<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.430> standard

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.590 
hello that's interesting just a very
minor<00:01:05.339> difference<00:01:05.729> don't<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.420> see

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
minor difference don't if you can see

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.060 
minor difference don't if you can see
that<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> Japanese<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.619> face<00:01:07.830> plates

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.859 
that but the Japanese but face plates
have<00:01:08.280> these<00:01:08.540> little<00:01:09.540> sticky<00:01:10.020> tabs<00:01:10.260> over<00:01:10.590> those

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
have these little sticky tabs over those

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:19.990 
have these little sticky tabs over those
over<00:01:12.869> these<00:01:12.990> perforations<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:18.439> all<00:01:19.439> right

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
over these perforations here all right

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
over these perforations here all right
so<00:01:21.000> we're<00:01:21.119> interested<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.840> one

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
so we're interested to see if this one

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.820 
so we're interested to see if this one
is<00:01:22.140> matte<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> frits<00:01:22.979> gloss<00:01:24.560> hmm<00:01:25.560> that's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
is matte or a frits gloss hmm that's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.830 
is matte or a frits gloss hmm that's
kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> interesting<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.549> actually<00:01:26.840> it's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
kind of interesting it's actually it's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.420 
kind of interesting it's actually it's
actually<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.110> cross<00:01:28.350> between<00:01:28.530> gloss<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> matte

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
actually a cross between gloss and matte

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.399 
actually a cross between gloss and matte
so<00:01:29.640> that's<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.479> almost<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> satin

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
so that's it's almost like a satin

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.350 
so that's it's almost like a satin
finish<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.070> quite<00:01:32.280> nice<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:33.240> not

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
finish so that's quite nice and I'm not

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880 
finish so that's quite nice and I'm not
sure<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> through<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
sure if you can see this through the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.980 
sure if you can see this through the
camera<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.479> black<00:01:36.720> pattern

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
camera here but on this black pattern

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.289 
camera here but on this black pattern
there's<00:01:37.229> always<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:38.220> tiny<00:01:38.670> dark<00:01:39.060> little

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
there's always really tiny dark little

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
there's always really tiny dark little
dots<00:01:39.600> which<00:01:39.869> justice<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.439> suppose<00:01:40.890> mix<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
dots which justice I suppose mix up that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.889 
dots which justice I suppose mix up that
black<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> plain

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
black so it's just not just a plain

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.760 
black so it's just not just a plain
black<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> no<00:01:44.579> case<00:01:44.820> let's<00:01:45.030> throw<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.570> my

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
black so no case let's throw this on my

00:01:45.770 --> 00:02:07.810 
black so no case let's throw this on my
standard<00:01:46.770> three<00:01:46.979> new<00:01:47.280> 3ds

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.859 

so<00:02:08.820> there<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.210> that's<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.720> ghost

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
so there you go that's what the ghost

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.680 
so there you go that's what the ghost
face<00:02:10.200> plate<00:02:10.440> looks<00:02:10.650> like<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:12.150> actually<00:02:12.330> looks
