what I think I messed up yeah I think I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.900 
what I think I messed up yeah I think I
mess<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.410> that's<00:02:22.560> fine<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.340> doesn't<00:02:23.640> exactly

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
mess up that's fine it doesn't exactly

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.070

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.500 
matter because I do plan to this is like
mostly<00:02:28.380> going<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:28.710> bedrock<00:02:29.160> alright<00:02:30.060> so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
mostly going to be bedrock alright so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.930 
mostly going to be bedrock alright so
the<00:02:30.840> main<00:02:31.050> goal<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:34.010> make<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.340> like

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the main goal here is to make this like

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.420 
the main goal here is to make this like
the<00:02:36.180> hardest<00:02:36.600> like<00:02:36.960> possible<00:02:37.710> challenge

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the hardest like possible challenge

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.110 
the hardest like possible challenge
imaginable<00:02:40.280> factions<00:02:41.280> players<00:02:41.640> are

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
imaginable factions players are

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.830 
imaginable factions players are
typically<00:02:42.750> known<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:44.120> godly<00:02:45.120> amounts<00:02:45.690> of

is<00:03:07.050> we're<00:03:07.200> going<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.350> make<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:07.680> sort<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.950> a

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
is we're going to make this sort of a

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.400 
is we're going to make this sort of a
wraparound<00:03:08.430> dungeon<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.600> where<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.140> chest

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
wraparound dungeon to where the chest

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.630 
wraparound dungeon to where the chest
will<00:03:10.530> sit<00:03:10.710> in<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.860> middle<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.220> then<00:03:11.490> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
will sit in the middle and then the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.090 
will sit in the middle and then the
walls<00:03:11.940> will<00:03:12.690> wrap<00:03:12.930> around<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.440> outside<00:03:13.830> and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
walls will wrap around the outside and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.910 
walls will wrap around the outside and
then<00:03:14.460> in<00:03:14.730> those<00:03:15.090> walls<00:03:15.480> are<00:03:16.020> it's<00:03:16.590> gonna<00:03:16.770> be

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
then in those walls are it's gonna be

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.600 
then in those walls are it's gonna be
hard<00:03:17.480> I'm<00:03:18.590> assuming<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.680> floor<00:03:19.920> will<00:03:20.130> be<00:03:20.160> lava

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
hard I'm assuming the floor will be lava

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.720 
hard I'm assuming the floor will be lava
and<00:03:21.560> then<00:03:22.560> we'll<00:03:22.680> go<00:03:22.830> from<00:03:22.860> there<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.220> what<00:03:23.670> I

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
and then we'll go from there so what I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.130 
and then we'll go from there so what I
want<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.000> do<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.270> I<00:03:24.360> want<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.630> get<00:03:24.720> these<00:03:24.870> walls

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
putting a whole bunch in here so I was

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.420 
putting a whole bunch in here so I was
thinking<00:03:58.170> about<00:03:58.380> maybe<00:03:58.560> using<00:03:58.830> command

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
thinking about maybe using command

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.830 
thinking about maybe using command
blocks<00:03:59.760> but<00:04:00.000> i'm<00:04:00.120> not<00:04:00.209> sure<00:04:00.420> if<00:04:00.480> there's<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.720> way

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
blocks but i'm not sure if there's a way

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.620 
blocks but i'm not sure if there's a way
to<00:04:00.870> only<00:04:01.140> give<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.650> one<00:04:01.890> person<00:04:02.180> one<00:04:03.180> side

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
to only give it to one person one side

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.260 
to only give it to one person one side
to<00:04:03.780> look<00:04:03.959> into<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.380> before<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:04.770> leave<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:06.150> if

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
to look into it before we leave and if

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.380 
to look into it before we leave and if
that's<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.570> case<00:04:06.660> then<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.920> never<00:04:07.980> know<00:04:08.390> but

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
that's the case then you never know but

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.180 
that's the case then you never know but
this<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.720> what<00:04:09.870> i've<00:04:09.959> got<00:04:10.110> so<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.440> floor<00:04:10.769> it's

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
this is what i've got so the floor it's

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.030 
this is what i've got so the floor it's
going<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.820> be<00:04:12.180> lava<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:13.110> will<00:04:13.290> be<00:04:13.410> raised<00:04:13.680> up

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
going to be lava this will be raised up

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.620 
going to be lava this will be raised up
one<00:04:14.310> right<00:04:14.550> here<00:04:14.820> just<00:04:15.239> like<00:04:15.330> so<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.980> then<00:04:17.630> the

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
one right here just like so and then the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.690 
one right here just like so and then the
rest<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:19.019> this<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.620> walls<00:04:19.890> will<00:04:20.070> probably<00:04:20.400> be

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
rest of this the walls will probably be

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.969 
rest of this the walls will probably be
three<00:04:21.030> or<00:04:21.150> four<00:04:21.419> high<00:04:21.600> i<00:04:21.630> think<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.830> rest

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
three or four high i think and the rest

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.430 
three or four high i think and the rest
of<00:04:23.100> this<00:04:23.220> will<00:04:23.400> be<00:04:23.490> lava<00:04:23.930> it<00:04:24.930> should<00:04:25.169> be<00:04:25.200> pretty

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
of this will be lava it should be pretty

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.260 
of this will be lava it should be pretty
fun<00:04:25.680> i<00:04:25.740> have<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.280> say

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
fun i have to say

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.580 
fun i have to say
I<00:04:27.300> don't<00:04:27.509> think<00:04:27.569> I'm<00:04:27.750> gonna<00:04:27.840> do<00:04:28.080> all<00:04:28.319> of<00:04:28.349> it

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
I don't think I'm gonna do all of it

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.740 
I don't think I'm gonna do all of it
lava<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.069> think<00:04:29.280> I'm<00:04:29.370> gonna<00:04:29.520> do<00:04:29.669> portions<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.569> it

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
lava I think I'm gonna do portions of it

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.559 
lava I think I'm gonna do portions of it
lava<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.830> maybe<00:04:31.979> every<00:04:32.490> like<00:04:32.669> five<00:04:32.910> blocks<00:04:33.150> or

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
lava so maybe every like five blocks or

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.029 
lava so maybe every like five blocks or
something<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:34.139> think<00:04:34.530> that'd<00:04:34.710> be<00:04:34.770> pretty<00:04:34.919> cool

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
something I think that'd be pretty cool

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.490 
something I think that'd be pretty cool
so<00:04:35.879> I'm<00:04:36.090> gonna<00:04:36.210> get<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.509> lava<00:04:36.750> done<00:04:37.050> I'll<00:04:37.289> be

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
so I'm gonna get the lava done I'll be

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.559 
so I'm gonna get the lava done I'll be
right<00:04:37.680> back<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.310> then<00:04:38.970> we're<00:04:39.120> gonna<00:04:39.240> put<00:04:39.330> in

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
right back and then we're gonna put in
