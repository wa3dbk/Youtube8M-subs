00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.980
 hello everyone dear friends with you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.840
 necrosis and today we will learn com beat on 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.719
 raid not 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:19.500
 so let's define management 1 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:25.519
 2 3 and 4 and so the main combo which 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.519
 There are in all styles raids on this 214 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.679
 the third hit is on the bottom this is basically 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.590
 profitable 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.250
 if the opponent is wrong and do not bet 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.969
 bottom block 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.170
 then you can make what kind of kombu 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.730
 can do either normal down before 2 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.329
 electric shock or reinforced reinforced 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 electric shock brings us to the sequel 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.840
 combo 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.899
 what can be done can do combos 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:05.700
 back 11 capture back 11 capture like this 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.900
 here it looks and this is the final part 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.939
 combo all together as it should 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.439
 look we jump on the enemy 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.610
 strike the top hand then 214 ex 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:30.420
 electric shock back 11 seizure 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:36.810
 and it blows down 34 percent while we 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.479
 spend 1 meter what other combos are there 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.500
 hurricane there is a combo that starts 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.900
 immediately from the bottom kick back 33 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.000
 the fact is that back 33 is not connected with 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.600
 electric shock but back 3 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 connect back 33 can be connected to 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.070
 flight if the enemy is at the wall 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.270
 then back 33 it comes with electric shock 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:10.110
 Naturally, you can make an electric shock 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.489
 sing sex and then again it was 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.489
 will lead you to combo 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:25.439
 Reagan also has a compass 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:31.959
 overheads this is back 22 more precisely back two 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:35.859
 back two is two blows both overheads is 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.859
 combo is connected with teleport but the thing is 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:42.790
 that teleport needs to be pressed 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:45.430
 timings if you hit back in advance 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 two then teleport anywhere reagan your not 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.739
 will fly back 22 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.290
 works very well in the corner what are we 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.609
 can we can we 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.889
 let's attack the enemy from above 1 to 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:07.689
 back 22 back two can do two 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:10.359
 times back two back two then later 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:15.699
 we need to catch the opponent by timing 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:20.049
 on 2 14 and electric shock Sax field and then 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:26.919
 back 11 and capture what we get we get 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:31.150
 we are even before smearing combo here is 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:35.889
 44 percent is very good if the opponent 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:40.109
 learned to block your warhead then we 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:46.720
 can back 33 and do the same 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:54.400
 teach your opponent to miss your low 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:57.489
 blows can be by the way here's back 33 and 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:03.699
 x electric shock siz sex sing connect 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:06.310
 through the top one up but one not 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:11.560
 always working why because up 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:14.560
 one needs to be done on timing if you have 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.030
 it doesn't work that up one I'm not 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.030
 I advise you even to use 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.930
 I will not always allow these 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:30.520
 it turns out therefore up alone I'm not 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:37.330
 I use it easier after the electric shock 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:39.870
 with the ex i do back 11 and capture so 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.870
 easiest 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:50.580
 but do not forget that Raiden 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:54.219
 thunder god is interesting 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.950
 a combo that doesn't seem to damage it 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:05:03.170
 separate galley they 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:06.350
 safe on block means what salt 112 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.440
 in this steing we clamp deuce and 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.100
 raiden strikes the enemy that is 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.880
 if 112 is like this 11 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.780
 pinch it 2 like this if we click 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.000
 112 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:25.790
 and then two more times and we â€™ll hold 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:30.250
 the next is safe on blocks and this 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.250
 Connects with teleport without timing 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:41.870
 damage a little course but safe 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.450
 safe what else is interesting in this style 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.580
 you can make interesting combos if 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:52.790
 hit the enemy reinforced wave 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:55.760
 see what happens there are similar 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:00.550
 combo it starts from the bottom 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:04.820
 back 32 see what's the situation if you 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:07.130
 hit the block back 32 nothing terrible 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.650
 but if you notice that the opponent 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.840
 missed this combo boldly press 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.610
 teleport he you have no timing 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:21.160
 for the enemy and connects at least a little 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:24.110
 but get friends on the head on it all 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:28.730
 you need to know these combinations 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:32.780
 to show any but quite 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:36.020
 adequate cargo raids thanks for that 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:40.840
 watched train and win with 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.840
 you were necrosis to all successful battles
