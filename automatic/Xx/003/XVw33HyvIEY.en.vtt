00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
know for the matter I didn't play a poor

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.070 
know for the matter I didn't play a poor
standard<00:01:52.590> match<00:01:53.420> he<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.569> played<00:01:54.750> too<00:01:54.929> well

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
standard match he just played too well

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:03.039 
standard match he just played too well
on<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.619> big<00:01:55.770> points

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.569 

I<00:02:03.079> think<00:02:03.920> Lleyton<00:02:04.610> Hewitt<00:02:04.939> is<00:02:05.829> as<00:02:06.829> tough<00:02:07.280> as<00:02:07.520> it

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
I think Lleyton Hewitt is as tough as it

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.320 
I think Lleyton Hewitt is as tough as it
gets<00:02:07.790> for<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.780> first<00:02:09.170> round<00:02:09.940> Australian<00:02:10.940> Open

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330

gets for a first round Australian Open
first<00:02:12.050> Grand<00:02:12.380> Slam<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.800> year<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.190> don't

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
first Grand Slam of the year I don't

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.390 
first Grand Slam of the year I don't
think<00:02:13.880> honestly<00:02:14.360> with<00:02:14.810> all<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.800> respect<00:02:16.220> to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
think honestly with all the respect to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.370 
think honestly with all the respect to
all<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.819> other<00:02:16.970> guys<00:02:17.270> who<00:02:17.660> are<00:02:17.690> potential

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
all the other guys who are potential

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.120 
all the other guys who are potential
threats<00:02:18.709> like<00:02:19.599> davidenko<00:02:20.599> or<00:02:21.110> Monfils<00:02:21.800> or

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
threats like davidenko or Monfils or

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.960 
threats like davidenko or Monfils or
dmitrov<00:02:22.760> or<00:02:22.970> whatever<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.800> think<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:25.700> as

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
dmitrov or whatever I think this is as

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.630 
dmitrov or whatever I think this is as
tough<00:02:26.209> as<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.450> gets<00:02:26.569> knowing<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:27.680> he<00:02:28.340> plays

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
tough as it gets knowing that he plays
