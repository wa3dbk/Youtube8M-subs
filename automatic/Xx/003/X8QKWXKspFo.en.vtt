00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.519
 after traveling through the woods we decided to do 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.219
 him forced cooling heads 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.160
 as at low speed overheats 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:26.130
 the engine oil pressure falls and bought 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:30.019
 Here are these fans with a diameter of 120 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:35.360
 millimeters and let's be tinkering 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:41.270
 top of the heads forced cooling 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:46.829
 here is the usual zinc will now cut 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:50.840
 body tinkering here are not more than fours 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:55.379
 sketched we will try to do 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.430
 made a blank for the fan now

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.110
 what is interesting on the inside looks 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.250
 will blow 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.390
 rain protection 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.990
 there will be air intake from here and there will be 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.979
 u don't create see how it will be 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.760
 work day reality finished her 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:18.310
 practically do bracket for 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.510
 forced air anchorage 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.630
 motor them equipment here is my 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.510
 turned out 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.659
 interesting form it turned out before 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.329
 what heads 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:42.159
 arranged asymmetrically and thatâ€™s how we 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:47.709
 here we install it fastens it 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:52.420
 together top engine mount 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.420
 here we fix 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:15.670
