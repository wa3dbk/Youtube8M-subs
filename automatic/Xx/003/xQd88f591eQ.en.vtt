00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.860
 Hi, I'm Javier Gaviria , Product Manager 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.080
 of garden and we will teach you how to ride 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.059
 a resin garden shed 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.610
 the assembly is simple since the 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.740
 walls come asked is important 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.000
 follow the manufacturer's instructions 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.050
 since the assembly varies in 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.050
 function of the chosen model 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.230
 these are the materials that we are going to 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.700
 use 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:42.990
 silicone boat garden shed with 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:45.320
 hardware and these tools 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.020
 stairs 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:54.620
 electric screwdriver 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:58.030
 level gloves rubber mace pistol 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:03.270
 silicone meter 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.270
 pencils and wood drill 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.630
 The first thing we should do is 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.759
 plan very well the location of the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.200
 booth the surface should be 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.050
 totally leveled and with a good 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.090
 sewer system 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.800
 if it is decided to install on land or 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.240
 lawn will have to do first a 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.990
 concrete slab of about 10 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.990
 centimeters thick 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.970
 we will avoid placing it facing the wind and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.710
 we will make sure to leave space 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.240
 enough for the entry and exit of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.640
 people 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.680
 we will also leave 50 centimeters of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.360
 distance from any solid hedge wall 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.360
 floral or plants to avoid moisture 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.899
 before beginning the assembly we read the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.630
 manufacturer's instructions and we place 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.009
 the pieces around the foundations 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.450
 leaving a few meters of separation for 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.450
 have enough space to work 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.080
 we check that the number of pieces is 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.380
 corresponds to the one that appears in the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.380
 list 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.730
 we start the assembly by the floor 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.989
 we place the two panels on the floor and 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.970
 we join them with the ironworks 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.329
 corresponding with the help of a mallet 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.329
 rubber 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.250
 i 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.569
 yes 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.689
 i 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.720
 and 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.150
 we start by placing an angle in one of 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.270
 the corners and then a panel 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.270
 side 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.990
 and we verify that the position is the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.460
 correct by the stamped label 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.460
 placed on top 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.489
 we put another profile on the side of the 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.489
 panel 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.590
 and in the center the piece indicated that 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.590
 will support the transversal guide 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.170
 at 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.970
 i 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.970
 Y 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.470
 i 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.739
 Y 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.050
 we fix it with fixings 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.400
 corresponding to the lateral angles 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.400
 and the transversal guide 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.750
 now we place the two panels of the other 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.700
 lateral in the same way and so panel to 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.500
 panel fixing the angles and guides 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.840
 cross sections corresponding to 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.560
 complete the walls 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.690
 it's time to install the roof 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.850
 we put the pieces that 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.020
 will serve as a fastener and we fix them with 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.020
 the corresponding screws 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.449
 Y 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.040
 then assemble the pieces that 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.389
 will make up the structure of the roof 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.930
 following the instructions of 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.930
 maker 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.479
 With the structure already assembled we place 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.479
 the front summits 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.590
 then we put the four 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.289
 panels that will form the roof with their 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.869
 corresponding plugs 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.969
 before inserting the pins we can 

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:32.589
 Apply silicone in the holes over 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.809
 everything if the booth is going to be installed in 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:36.580
 areas with heavy rainfall we can 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:38.199
 also apply silicone on the plugs 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.639
 of the roof and on the perimeter of the 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.419
 window to guarantee a good 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.419
 impermeability 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.760
 it's time to put the front wall 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.750
 with the door we screw the handles 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.750
 before placing them 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.660
 we hook the four hinges 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.660
 lateral 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.700
 to finish the assembly we make a 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.380
 mark on the ground and drill moss for 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.380
 that the latch enters the ground 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.500
 Y 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.639
 yes 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.930
 and 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.100
 Y 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.100
 Y 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.780
 and 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.790
 And here our demonstration will 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.740
 We invite you to visit our stores 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.150
 leroy merlin where you can learn a lot 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.150
 more in the demonstrations classroom
