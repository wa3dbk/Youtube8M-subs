00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
along until it snaps in and then once

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.260 
along until it snaps in and then once
it's<00:01:37.980> in<00:01:38.130> you'll<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.400> again<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.090> very

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
it's in you'll see again it's a very

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's in you'll see again it's a very
tight<00:01:39.540> fit<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.230> have<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.590> clear<00:01:40.800> coat<00:01:41.040> still

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
tight fit I do have the clear coat still

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.370 
tight fit I do have the clear coat still
on<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:41.790> iPad<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.480> that's<00:01:42.660> going<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:42.930> make<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.260> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
on my iPad so that's going to make it a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
on my iPad so that's going to make it a
little<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.830> tighter<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.760> case<00:01:45.090> does

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
little bit tighter this case does

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.090 
little bit tighter this case does
stretch<00:01:45.870> out<00:01:46.110> though<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:46.740> has

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
stretch out though and it actually has

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.970 
stretch out though and it actually has
kind<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.460> memory<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.870> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.680> stretch

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
kind of memory to it so you can stretch

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.770 
kind of memory to it so you can stretch
it<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.400> it'll<00:01:50.610> kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.910> conform<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.660> whatever

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it and it'll kind of conform to whatever

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.320 
it and it'll kind of conform to whatever
size<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.230> need<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.830> be<00:01:52.950> having<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.640> conformed

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
size you need to be having it conformed

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.060 
size you need to be having it conformed
to<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.080> you<00:01:55.170> got<00:01:55.350> clear<00:01:55.620> coat<00:01:55.830> or

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
to so if you got clear coat or

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
to so if you got clear coat or
bodyguards<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:56.910> something<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.570> iPad

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
bodyguards or something on your iPad
