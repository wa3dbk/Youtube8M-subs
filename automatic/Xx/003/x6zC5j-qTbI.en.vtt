00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.450
 center 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.620

 it did not have to be used a lot and 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.099
 by the way I spoke with a youtuber 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.680
 who told me that the pikachu pouches 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.690
 were rare so I do not know if it's 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.510
 what he was talking about or then there is 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.430
