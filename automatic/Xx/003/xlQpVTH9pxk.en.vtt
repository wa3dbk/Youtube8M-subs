and<00:00:25.740> chills<00:00:26.670> hang<00:00:26.880> gliding<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.900> only<00:00:28.109> because

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
and chills hang gliding not only because

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
and chills hang gliding not only because
it<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> cheap<00:00:29.160> way<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.369> getting<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> air

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

it is a cheap way of getting in the air
but<00:00:30.869> also<00:00:31.199> because<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.949> gets<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.399> very<00:00:32.700> close

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030

by denic inspection the daily inspection

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.910 
by denic inspection the daily inspection
is<00:01:18.030> similar<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.229> an<00:01:19.350> airline<00:01:19.710> pilot

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
ground just to get a quick feeling of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.330 
ground just to get a quick feeling of
how<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.299> handles

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
how it handles

how it handles
I'm<00:02:05.340> almost<00:02:05.610> ready<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.000> fly<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.320> just

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
I'm almost ready to fly now so I just

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.859 
I'm almost ready to fly now so I just
put<00:02:07.620> my<00:02:07.890> harness<00:02:08.100> on<00:02:08.429> which<00:02:08.970> attaches<00:02:09.600> me

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
put my harness on which attaches me

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.140 
put my harness on which attaches me
securely<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.560> glider<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.760> while<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> do
