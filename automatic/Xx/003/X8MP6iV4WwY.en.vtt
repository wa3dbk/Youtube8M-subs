00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:18.060
 so welcome last play your 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:22.350
 mixed choir but trios and yes as 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.150
 one short info s.so fn 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 I somehow feel as if 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.199
 this mission of you also has a story 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.990
 is and I already had it before 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.690
 Video explains that I prefer complete 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.570
 stories would have to be as individual 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.640
 understand what I mean that's when you 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 even thinks a bit too 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.079
 stupid if you always 11 mission 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.200
 checks and everyone with only one 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.640
 two mission comes mostly alone 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.039
 only your mission comes that way then 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.110
 stupid you understand others was too 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.020
 that their mission is coming and that's why 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.579
 must be, however 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.350
 I'll skip this mission 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 and wait for the complete story 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.030
 I have just like the other one 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.559
 have done before this video and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.530
 yes then just keep jumping 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:18.119
 another spot of grill stripes face 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:21.770
 I think I wanted to look between 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.770
 this concept city in the face 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.610
 no here it is so boring i look 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.090
 something to do oh so makes even a short 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.280
 info to you there is a floor below 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.710
 a short info to you i have 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.000
 Here's a cutscene with you 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.340
 cut away 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.110
 I recommend now to everyone at 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.210
 for example, homer sit the mission 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.960
 instead of that is then completely starts 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.460
 can not change anything like at 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.050
 this accounted for a bison I wanted 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.520
 Something their gold change that but 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.690
 somehow it was not because the mission 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.200
 started again 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.580
 that was stupid and yes something like this 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.630
 Mission here the mission could still be 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.369
 to edit 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.899
 because a specific place is 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.130
 always packaged here on this mission 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:09.820
 So when is not the sentence now 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:13.269
 work more and so I show I 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.480
 also say exactly where it was at 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.760
 Mike, what are you doing here? 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.680
 I'm looking for come out you seen that and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.250
 after these cats is the packaged 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.390
 especially always follow the type 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.519
 Again and again, it is included here from content 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.310
 This is as to these castings 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.019
 therefore ab abannt I thought that 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.680
 quickest out now because it has 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:41.910
 no sense crashes again and again 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.910
 first aid hello my you get here 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.130
 I wanted to know if the prototype of 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.320
 this game console works i am 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.489
 but you can you can still times 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.140
 test if you want 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:59.970
 I am now a bit random here 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.970
 reason we take the lift of good type 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.069
 then are we finally arrived 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.970
 That's the console , too 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.560
 playstation 5 okay you have to 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.930
 insert video game and through this door 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.480
 Go in if you're in the tracklist 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.900

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.459

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.310
 four grand theft auto 7 and need for 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.310
 speed which games to play 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:09.150

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.000
 the kind i hope so because that was a 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.790
 bit Perlinger's it now now 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.190
 I would also like to have a story 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.910
 do not look forward to a single mission 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.760
 again and again 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:53.290
 if not successful at all, well 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.270
 have had was okay animation very 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.410
 okay except for both cats go here 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.760
 once supported otherwise I am glad 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.950

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.530

 homersimpson you also that I have it 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.960
 unfortunately already too late said so with 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.780
 end of the line because he did not know 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.340
 that there are three girls but after 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.110
 the first look checks this is one 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.400
 continuation indicates the second I 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.169
 thought that is one more 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.930
 but no matter 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.169
