00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
today we're gonna show you how to draw

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.410 
today we're gonna show you how to draw
the<00:00:04.740> letter<00:00:05.069> A<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.879> 3d<00:00:07.519> start<00:00:08.519> with<00:00:08.790> drawing

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
the letter A in 3d start with drawing

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.450 
the letter A in 3d start with drawing
the<00:00:09.900> letter<00:00:10.349> A<00:00:10.620> as<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.490> would<00:00:11.700> normally<00:00:13.460> like

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the letter A as you would normally like

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.490 
the letter A as you would normally like
this

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.950 

and<00:00:18.590> then<00:00:20.200> draw<00:00:21.200> the<00:00:21.710> outline

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.980 

of<00:00:26.050> every<00:00:27.010> part<00:00:27.340> of<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:28.000> letter<00:00:28.210> a<00:00:28.420> that<00:00:28.780> you

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
of every part of the letter a that you

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.620 
of every part of the letter a that you
just<00:00:29.230> drew

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.500 

and<00:00:35.720> inside<00:00:36.590> as<00:00:36.829> well

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.950 

okay<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.950> gonna<00:00:44.130> color<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.690> have

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
okay I'm gonna color it in so we have

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.450 
okay I'm gonna color it in so we have
just<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:47.100> solid<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:48.360> not<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.110> not<00:00:49.950> three

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
just one solid a and not just not three

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.569 
just one solid a and not just not three
lines<00:00:50.700> all<00:00:51.270> over<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> place<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.309> color<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
lines all over the place so color that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.439 
lines all over the place so color that
in<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.940> now<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.809> flat<00:00:59.449> two-dimensional

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
in so we have now a flat two-dimensional

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.450 
in so we have now a flat two-dimensional
a<00:01:02.059> we're<00:01:03.059> gonna<00:01:03.150> make<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.540> three-dimensional

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
a we're gonna make it three-dimensional

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.300 
a we're gonna make it three-dimensional
and<00:01:05.509> we're<00:01:06.509> gonna<00:01:06.630> use<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.440> different<00:01:07.770> color<00:01:08.040> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and we're gonna use a different color so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.080 
and we're gonna use a different color so
it's<00:01:08.520> easier<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.119> you're<00:01:09.840> gonna<00:01:09.960> draw<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
it's easier to see you're gonna draw a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.710 
it's easier to see you're gonna draw a
line<00:01:12.090> parallel<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.110> top<00:01:13.320> line<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.720> two

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
line parallel to the top line and two

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.060 
line parallel to the top line and two
lines<00:01:16.020> parallel<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.770> each<00:01:17.009> other<00:01:18.590> then<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> long

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
lines parallel to each other then a long

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.040 
lines parallel to each other then a long
that<00:01:20.340> slanted<00:01:20.970> side<00:01:21.240> we're<00:01:21.630> gonna<00:01:21.720> draw

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
that slanted side we're gonna draw

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.480 
that slanted side we're gonna draw
another<00:01:22.740> parallel<00:01:23.220> line<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.950> slanted

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
another parallel line to that slanted

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.050 
another parallel line to that slanted
side<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:28.050> end<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.649> parallel<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.880> top

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
side and the end is parallel to the top

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.830 
side and the end is parallel to the top
line<00:01:31.070> now<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.490> gonna<00:01:32.729> draw<00:01:32.940> a<00:01:33.180> line<00:01:33.450> parallel

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
line now I'm gonna draw a line parallel

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.999 
line now I'm gonna draw a line parallel
to<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:35.960> slanted<00:01:36.960> side<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.160> left<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:40.009> a

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
to the slanted side to the left and a

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:49.530 
to the slanted side to the left and a
line<00:01:41.460> parallel<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.630> bar<00:01:42.869> across<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:59.560 

color<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.470> in

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:09.010 

all<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.409> way

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.960 

so<00:02:09.770> now<00:02:10.580> we<00:02:10.640> have<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:12.500> letter<00:02:12.860> A<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:14.390> 3d<00:02:15.170> that

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
so now we have the letter A in 3d that

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.990 
so now we have the letter A in 3d that
was<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.210> in<00:02:17.660> black<00:02:18.080> 3d<00:02:18.650> for<00:02:19.220> more<00:02:19.370> information

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
was a in black 3d for more information

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.680
