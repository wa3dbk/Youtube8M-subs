00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello my name is jim panzer and today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.400
 These comments are about cell phones 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.620
 yes, who would have thought that? 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.110
 because I strangely get many 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.429
 ask to have the cell phone dark that 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.650
 well or i want to get my cellphone up 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.700
 Buy 200 euro as which would you 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.410
 I recommend and I want to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.520
 this job say yes I 'm there 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.680
 ever looked around a bit and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.910
 but I'm not a tecchannel 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.199
 that means I have to firstly one 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.939
 I'll get some help 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.529
 but do not worry today and on the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.760
 I can still do that on the other side 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.960
 do not recommend anything so i will 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.699
 of course , somehow that sort of thing 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.320
 toplist or something I do 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.210
 Yes, he knows how to partially depart 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 to watch so top listen to evaluate 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.360
 or own mustard and give up 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.890
 On the other side, I'll introduce you now 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.180
 again very shortly before what I ever 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 on cell phones and what do you think 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 this is as first information for you 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.539
 I'm not a cell phone nerd that was me 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.190
 Used to be a short time long nor 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.239
 before there were the smartphones and on the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.399
 Of course, I have a smartphone myself 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.379
 then tried the devices too 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.940
 So routed to speak in their own company 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.570
 to play and then with custom roms too 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.910
 play etc 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.469
 blablabla who does not say that now 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.000
 does not do anything in principle 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.190
 By that only meant that you can not do that 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.019
 original operating system what the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.610
 manufacturer has provided or the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.979
 appropriate provider with which you turn 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.689
 is there a branding on it has popped 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.979
 that that is basically down and 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.479
 Of course you have extra 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.369
 functions on the phone may be free 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.659
 has switched the backup functions so 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.729
 do not exist or similar where you stop 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.220
 full access to the system needs 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.439
 But back to the beginning so on the one hand 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.729
 I have one more here 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.710
 watermark lg p970 phone very old 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.329
 I can not sell cucumbers anymore 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.280
 because once you have a power cable 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.380
 then you can see that here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 many tippers somehow happen on it 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.740
 So soon you do it afterwards 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.000
 for example, that the display is on 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.200
 the keyboard on the display 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.600
 then you see that here always like that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.970
 Randomly typed any letters 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.229
 be super annoying and that should be 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 actually another kind of second 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.409
 Emergency phone for me will be like 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.700
 I can not say that anyway 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.210
 sell that probably brings in 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.469
 the condition 18 euro and without joke the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.420
 would not make sense 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.649
 but that was my second third 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.600
 fourth smartphone no idea no 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.030
 I know what that is but the thing 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 really good for me so it was like that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.300
 an android cucumber i still have 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.039
 never really an iphone the food falls 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.030
 Just then I still have 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.590
 I want a second mobile phone then 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.720
 very briefly what to tell because there 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.610
 it about that is much confusion here 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.510
 a windows cell phone yes now could all 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.950
 a little bit in the comments to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.550
 puking why that is, and so on 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.450
 and so on 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.000
 that's the nokia 10 20 with a super 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.550
 Camera no joke this camera in it 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.290
 makes great pictures and horny videos 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.569
 I have the part originally 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.650
 times bought as a substitute for one 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.350
 high quality camera 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.970
 But I limit around merkel 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.410
 with me that's about one 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.209
 really good camera over time 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.069
 if that gets bigger with youtube 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.360
 should not get around and therefore have 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.890
 I the device in principle already more 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.630
 but it can replace less 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.280
 Not selling at the moment either 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.900
 there is still a little something hanging 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.519
 other things with it but fuck it 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.680
 One is also the whatsapp 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.970
 history on it so everyone of me 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.170
 on the phone number ever tried 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.850
 to reach that is probably on 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.170
 This mailbox landed here and to 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.239
 I also have a funny project 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.640
 for after the gamescom so for all of 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.350
 you for they love something we at 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.910
 want to send voice messages 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.310
 there might be there in the next one 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.690
 even a small project as a 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.190
 fun project so not all up 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.570
 Call this number that has no 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.530
 So that's why I'll do it all 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.440
 delete resp 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.150
 not continue to use but my bread and 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.269
 butter handy so to speak, so the thing 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.700
 my choice is still if you 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.250
 sometimes nexus 5 that's for me 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.959
 Mobile phone with the largest possible 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.579
 Compatibility for everything I'm in 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.299
 principle with cell phones and with smartphones 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.130
 our tour 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.290
 and as I said here is nothing now 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.579
 nothing saved rebuilt or nothing 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.109
 somehow different 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.420
 the device has for me in principle only 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.220
 two disadvantages, first, it has none 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.230
 changeable battery yes so the thing can 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.150
 not now take out anyway and 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.709
 the second huge drawback for me 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.600
 is that for example the memory 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.070
 can not expand this is the 32nd 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.900
 gigabyte version so the biggest thing it 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.250
 I think as far as it is here in 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.600
 I've got black and white like in 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.519
 but there is on the side so 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.290
 ugly piano lacquer and that looks 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.850
 probably after three weeks in the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.400
 I totally wanted that 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.470
 just do not have and give for me 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.000
 It is not a big disadvantage, for example 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.560
 that the memory is not expandable 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.560
 but that's the second biggest one 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.660
 disadvantage and therefore 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.730
 to list again here I come with 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.139
 the 32 gb super I know of course 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.760
 people have their half 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.440
 film collection somehow packed 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.210
 or your complete music collection 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.590
 ribbed and somehow pushed on it 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.720
 I do not do it all because of that 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.910
 I really do not need that 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.830
 me could be better as well is the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.900
 camera but quite honest when in the 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.850
 direct comparisons so nokia 10 20 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.370
 then you have to lie around 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.740
 Of course, do not be surprised that the pictures 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.510
 partly from that of the nexus 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.669
 cellphone cellphone from the ex us5 maybe 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.990
 not quite as good why have 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.190
 I made this video for this myself 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.580
 I just wanted to say that 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.050
 personally, I am not a mobile phone and mobile 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.780
 North is interested in it 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.340
 but I do not know which which new ones 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.350
 company now which functions 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.330
 but still supports something 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.340
 Personally, I attach importance to that 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.900
 always stop as soon as possible 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.400
 the latest android versions on it 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.750
 I can pull it without me 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.460
 So you have to take care of that, so to speak 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.710
 alone comes and that I then certain 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.270
 functions maybe only yes 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.979
 other users only after a few months 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.690
 are then available immediately 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.040
 for example, you can use the whole 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.770
 Google services was very clear I am 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.250
 both android and star wars as 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.050
 also of course a google services fanboy 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.820
 have become in the last few years 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.380
 i have not been to me at all before 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.330
 had a huge problem with it too 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.850
 big companies but right now 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.050
 I only say without the google services 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.940
 sailor everyday already somehow 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.590
 more stressful than it is right now 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.060
 So I ride on the wave of the 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.400
 People just have the benefits for you 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.020
 make use of it and like the disadvantages 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.789
 push a bit to the side 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.530
 otherwise I can only say that part 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.300
 is for me as I said that 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.039
 Perfect Mobile It has all the features 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.530
 I do not need the quality I 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.539
 wait and it is even now 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.530
 once swapped because of that 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.180
 other mobile phone 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.860
 I'll say something like that courage 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.510
 hangs tight and yes there 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.430
 There are 1000 instructions for on the net 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.229
 but no joke what is please hornier 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.200
 as a cell phone once again to send 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.570
 can and get new accessories for 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.850
 you do not make a mistake yourself 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.900
 can get done as the old cell phone forever 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.850
 continue to use 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.530
 I think that somehow speaks for 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.790
 So from my side very clear 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.890
 thumbs up to 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.900
 google for this first great service 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.880
 and of course for me too, let me tell you 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.650
 quite bold is the development of this 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.990
 horny device I think it anyway 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.190
 very nice there is no link to that 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.670
 google phone that makes it synonymous 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.230
 no sense 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.670
 or maybe we'll come today 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.960
 a link below in the video 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.210
 description but I think he is 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.530
 I believe myself where to get it 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.060
 would want if you have it 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.320
 Want to write me comments with them 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.470
 what you like to buy for a mobile phone 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.940
 want and what you want at all 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.320
 makes a cell phone is so basic 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.420
 it's just that it's just that 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.040
 It is all social media websites 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.450
 maybe a little more I have 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.440
 lately in the livestreams 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.090
 get it as I did before 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.500
 I have sat by Zynga 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.880
 just in the bus home and I need 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.340
 another two hours but I'm watching in the 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.870
 bus still your stream over mobile he 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.550
 So I'm allowed to really me 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.900
 looked around because I thought in my hands 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.790
 livestream look that burns 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.350
 a lot of those are in traffic 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.540
 somehow it can not be 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.430
 but obviously it is used like that 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.000
 that 's it for this weird senseless one 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.440
 Video 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.970
 my name is eyelashes i am saying 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.410
 Thanks for watching, we'll see you in 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.410
