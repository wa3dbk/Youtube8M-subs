decided I'm gonna do round two of the
tulips<00:00:04.290> these<00:00:04.410> are<00:00:04.529> really<00:00:04.859> easy<00:00:05.009> tulips<00:00:05.490> to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
tulips these are really easy tulips to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.740 
tulips these are really easy tulips to
job<00:00:05.850> but<00:00:05.879> if<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.150> want<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.359> take<00:00:06.480> them<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.660> a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
job but if you want to take them to a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.060 
job but if you want to take them to a
whole<00:00:07.049> other<00:00:07.290> level<00:00:08.360> well<00:00:09.590> we<00:00:10.590> can<00:00:10.740> just<00:00:10.769> shade

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
whole other level well we can just shade

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.270 
whole other level well we can just shade
it<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.370> little<00:00:11.580> bit<00:00:12.620> and<00:00:13.620> I'm<00:00:13.950> gonna<00:00:14.070> use

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
it a little bit and I'm gonna use

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.920 
it a little bit and I'm gonna use
coloring<00:00:14.910> pencils<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.630> shade<00:00:15.900> today<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:17.930> don't

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
coloring pencils to shade today I don't

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.689 
coloring pencils to shade today I don't
think<00:00:19.170> I'll<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.350> using<00:00:19.470> red<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> tulips

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
think I'll be using red for the tulips

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.009 
think I'll be using red for the tulips
because<00:00:21.119> I'd<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.930> use<00:00:23.480> kind<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> pink

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
because I'd like to use kind of a pink

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.890 
because I'd like to use kind of a pink

more realistic do yeah no problem we're

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.459 
more realistic do yeah no problem we're
gonna<00:00:38.309> take<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.870> we're<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.020> gonna<00:00:40.110> color

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.280 
gonna take this we're just gonna color
the<00:00:40.710> whole<00:00:40.829> thing<00:00:41.100> lightly<00:00:41.430> color<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.690> nice

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.459 
the whole thing lightly color it nice
and<00:00:43.530> light

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
and light

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:57.529 
and light
nice<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.800> light<00:00:50.750> there<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.870> go<00:00:56.210> do<00:00:57.210> them<00:00:57.420> all

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
nice and light there we go do them all

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.440 
nice and light there we go do them all
they're<00:00:58.530> all<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> same<00:00:58.800> color<00:01:03.110> there<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.199> go

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
they're all the same color there we go

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.630 
they're all the same color there we go
so<00:01:06.450> now<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.140> still<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.530> our<00:01:07.640> magenta

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so now that we still have our magenta

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.510 
so now that we still have our magenta
out<00:01:08.790> we're<00:01:09.119> gonna<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.450> draw<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:10.080> darker<00:01:10.890> we're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
out we're gonna just draw a darker we're

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.380 
out we're gonna just draw a darker we're
gonna<00:01:11.610> push<00:01:11.820> harder<00:01:12.180> along<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> bottom<00:01:12.720> here

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
gonna push harder along the bottom here

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.280 
gonna push harder along the bottom here
and<00:01:16.070> maybe<00:01:17.070> we're<00:01:17.729> gonna<00:01:17.790> push<00:01:18.090> less<00:01:18.420> hard<00:01:18.780> but

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
and maybe we're gonna push less hard but

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.469 
and maybe we're gonna push less hard but
still<00:01:19.470> harder<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.220> kind<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.549> give<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
still harder and kind of give that a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.969 
still harder and kind of give that a
shade<00:01:21.869> right<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:24.439> perfect<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
shade right there we go perfect and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
shade right there we go perfect and
maybe<00:01:26.189> we'll<00:01:26.490> take<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.880> edge<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.210> we'll

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
maybe we'll take this edge and we'll

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.609 
maybe we'll take this edge and we'll
make<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.439> little<00:01:28.650> bit<00:01:28.920> darker<00:01:29.310> too

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
make that one a little bit darker too

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.190 
make that one a little bit darker too
there<00:01:31.619> that's<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.970> whole<00:01:33.600> lot<00:01:33.780> nights<00:01:33.990> all

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
there that's a whole lot nights all

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
there that's a whole lot nights all
right<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.250> darken<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.850> edge<00:01:38.210> will

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
right now I will darken this edge will

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.569 
right now I will darken this edge will
do<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> same<00:01:39.689> basically<00:01:40.079> thing<00:01:40.430> we're<00:01:41.430> just

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
do the same basically thing we're just

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
do the same basically thing we're just
dark<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> bottoms<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.710> basic

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
dark on the bottoms this is really basic

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.800 
dark on the bottoms this is really basic
shading<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.520> don't<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.180> worry<00:01:45.630> about

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
shading you don't have to worry about

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.190 
shading you don't have to worry about
where<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.380> light<00:01:46.530> source<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.070> coming<00:01:47.100> from

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
where the light source is coming from

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
where the light source is coming from
necessarily<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:49.530> make<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:49.920> drawing

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
necessarily it will make your drawing

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.730 
necessarily it will make your drawing
look<00:01:50.369> better<00:01:50.610> no<00:01:51.540> matter<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.470> bit<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
look better no matter what just a bit of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.399 
look better no matter what just a bit of
shading<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:54.750> there<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.229> go

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
shading so there we go

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.620 
shading so there we go
shaded<00:01:56.250> around<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> edge<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.450> I

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
shaded around the edge here and here I

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.179 
shaded around the edge here and here I
guess<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.290> you're<00:01:58.469> thinking<00:01:58.829> about<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
guess if you're thinking about the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.399 
guess if you're thinking about the
lights<00:01:59.399> coming<00:01:59.640> from<00:01:59.850> here<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:01.049> don't<00:02:01.259> need

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
lights coming from here you don't need

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.780 
lights coming from here you don't need
to<00:02:01.500> worry<00:02:01.680> about<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.250> much<00:02:02.399> if<00:02:02.640> you're

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
to worry about that so much if you're

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.179 
to worry about that so much if you're
just<00:02:03.030> lighting<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.350> everything<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.979> going

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
just lighting as if everything is going

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.419 
just lighting as if everything is going
to<00:02:05.250> be<00:02:05.340> darker<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> bottom<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:07.429> darker

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
to be darker on the bottom so darker

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.040 
to be darker on the bottom so darker
darker<00:02:08.849> darker<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.450> bottom

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
darker darker on the bottom

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.780 
darker darker on the bottom
and<00:02:12.050> I'm<00:02:12.409> gonna<00:02:12.560> again<00:02:12.980> make<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.519> side

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
and I'm gonna again make this side

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.729 
and I'm gonna again make this side
little<00:02:14.120> Decker<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.080> give<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.560> some

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
little Decker just to give it some

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.490 
little Decker just to give it some
texture<00:02:16.069> really<00:02:17.470> there<00:02:18.470> we<00:02:18.590> go

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
texture really there we go

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.240 
texture really there we go
just<00:02:21.500> like<00:02:21.680> that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
just like that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.589 
just like that
that<00:02:22.760> looks<00:02:22.970> nice<00:02:23.150> eh<00:02:23.450> um<00:02:25.239> next<00:02:26.239> up<00:02:26.390> we<00:02:26.569> need

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
think I'll use that I use green

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.280 
think I'll use that I use green
straight-up<00:02:35.810> green

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
straight-up green

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.569 
straight-up green

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
why I said magic I guess it feels like

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.699 
why I said magic I guess it feels like

first start learning to shade things
it's<00:04:38.260> really<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.500> easiest<00:04:39.830> thing<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.040> do<00:04:40.250> is

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
it's really the easiest thing to do is

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.219 
it's really the easiest thing to do is
to<00:04:40.580> shade<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.030> bottoms<00:04:41.419> of<00:04:41.540> things<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.139> it

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
to shade the bottoms of things and it

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.010 
to shade the bottoms of things and it
always<00:04:42.470> helps<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:44.330> pretty<00:04:44.540> much<00:04:44.660> can't<00:04:44.900> go

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
always helps you pretty much can't go

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.620 
always helps you pretty much can't go
wrong<00:04:45.260> there's<00:04:45.620> much<00:04:45.770> more<00:04:46.240> complicated<00:04:47.240> ways

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
wrong there's much more complicated ways

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.460 
wrong there's much more complicated ways
to<00:04:47.960> shade<00:04:48.169> things<00:04:48.440> but<00:04:49.090> if<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.240> don't<00:04:51.229> want<00:04:51.380> to

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
to shade things but if you don't want to

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.500 
to shade things but if you don't want to
think<00:04:51.710> too<00:04:51.860> much<00:04:51.889> about<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.370> you<00:04:52.940> just<00:04:53.120> shade

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
think too much about it you just shade

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.790 
think too much about it you just shade
