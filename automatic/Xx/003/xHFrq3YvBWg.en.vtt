00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:37.410
 hello everyone okay with you and they 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.740
 the more I see a video today is about and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.930
 it was directly this challenge was him 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.140
 was released a few days ago from India 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.720
 March 19 and share with you 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.290
 that is to change that game is available 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.380
 on xbox live for those who do not know already 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.510
 is an exclusive xbox game that 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.240
 to defeat, cool and things me 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.820
 question is to know how I have around 150 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.090
 megabytes is so not so great so 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.990
 will not stop as much space jb and is 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 grace 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.330
 this delay makes available a new 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.810
 The multiplayer ford wheel module is called 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.590
 the verl am on the skyline map this module 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.920
 overland 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.720
 it is an attacking and defending game 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.630
 When you have to attack you have to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.120
 destroy some bases that are 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.400
 scattered on the map, it 's just that these 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.500
 bases are being released as 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.409
 passing the time your goal are 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.229
 destroy the barriers you have until 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.180
 get there to this base and you will 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 building these barriers and fighting 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.460
 the enemies also until you reach this 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.010
 point on this base there to destroy you 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.590
 this place is more or less for who 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.930
 You're used to playing call of duty there. 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.920
 It's kind of like it's a dream. 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.159
 destroys 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.280
 It's really cool, it's a super way. 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.990
 cool for those who like laughing a lot 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.930
 I think you'll like it a lot 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.720
 so it's not my favorite game ever 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.090
 It was but I really liked it this way and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.459
 a cool thing is that you all 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.760
 suspects you win on that street 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.130
 playing the demo you'll be able to pass it 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.170
 in the normal game when you buy 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.870
 normal then you will not lose x 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.050
 that this defeat released until the 28th 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.030
 March and found it very interesting 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.910
 share this case with you 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.200
 not knowing that you are released in the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.240
 live low there that is very cool and a 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 something else also different for the son 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.720
 use is now not even know the msd is are 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.020
 graphics of the game are very 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.270
 cute so visual without very cool me 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.230
 I liked it a lot and I walked 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.780
 reading there was one that this attention of the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.420
 graphic of the whole visual of the game was a 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.160
 good assault on them one thing they 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.020
 invested heavily that the producer 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.920
 invested enough time to stay a game 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.260
 cool 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.930
 I really liked it, I even played it. 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.810
 A few hours I did not play much more 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.920
 I played less than an hour or two and I 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.080
 I really liked it 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.630
 I could not play very well yet 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.450
 I got very few kills 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.270
 but it's fun, it's cool, you stay 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.670
 defending there you make the goal of the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.030
 Game is really cool 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.060
 Good, is not much more to talk about. 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.730
 about the demo is just advice even you 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.320
 already since it is free and only 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.140
 remembering and then that this is my opinion 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.210
 about and we gave only the demo I did not 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.760
 I played the game I did not buy the game yet 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.680
 so my opinion is only about the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.230
 demo and I hope you guys have 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.720
 liked the video and tell me is this 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.690
 You have dropped your already played if not 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.000

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.700
 Please, as you always do for the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.459
 your comments can talk about the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.959
 our greatest mutual taste 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.370
 so this is what I hope you liked 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.590
 really 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.420
 Please, I worked the video and if you 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.880
 It's not on the boy's life canal if 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.490
 also enter defensive as always 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.180
 are in the description and I'm staying for 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.190
 here until the loss 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.190
 A kiss on the bad lacquer.
