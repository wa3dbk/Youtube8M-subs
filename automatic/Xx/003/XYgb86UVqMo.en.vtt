00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.350 
obviously total specification another
very<00:02:42.290> highly<00:02:42.560> SPECT<00:02:42.830> standard<00:02:43.670> but<00:02:43.819> so<00:02:44.239> this

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
very highly SPECT standard but so this

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.899 
very highly SPECT standard but so this
one<00:02:44.510> has<00:02:44.569> got<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.780> lot<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:45.370> other<00:02:46.370> bits<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.700> bobs

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
one has got a lot of other bits and bobs

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.490 
one has got a lot of other bits and bobs
on<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.180> everything<00:02:47.629> works<00:02:47.840> everything<00:02:48.200> does

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
on it everything works everything does

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.869 
on it everything works everything does
it<00:02:48.709> should<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:51.379> TV<00:02:51.950> correct<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.489> can't<00:02:52.760> view

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
it should the TV correct you can't view

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.339 
it should the TV correct you can't view
it<00:02:52.939> when<00:02:53.090> you're<00:02:53.269> in<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.810> front<00:02:53.989> when<00:02:54.200> you're

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
it when you're in the front when you're

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.660 
it when you're in the front when you're
driving

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.020 

so<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.690> hasn't<00:03:00.840> had<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:02.069> bypass<00:03:02.550> chip<00:03:02.849> put

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
so it hasn't had the the bypass chip put

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:15.710 
so it hasn't had the the bypass chip put
in<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.599> not<00:03:03.870> up

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.540 

tracks<00:03:16.380> beautifully<00:03:16.740> straight<00:03:16.980> no<00:03:17.190> problems

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
tracks beautifully straight no problems

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:27.720 
tracks beautifully straight no problems
there

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.430 

and<00:03:28.300> clearly<00:03:28.569> as<00:03:28.690> you'd<00:03:28.780> expect<00:03:28.900> given<00:03:29.290> this

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
and clearly as you'd expect given this

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.320 
and clearly as you'd expect given this
mileage<00:03:29.830> in<00:03:29.950> its<00:03:30.040> age<00:03:30.190> there's<00:03:31.060> not<00:03:31.239> really

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
mileage in its age there's not really

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:47.850 
mileage in its age there's not really
anything<00:03:31.599> that<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.900> can<00:03:31.959> like<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:32.920> fault<00:03:33.129> it<00:03:33.250> on
