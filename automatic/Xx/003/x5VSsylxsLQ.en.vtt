00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
complete this part of the mission with

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.310 
complete this part of the mission with
Ziggy<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.969> under<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> minute<00:00:12.690> now<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.230> you

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
Ziggy in under a minute now what you

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.749 
Ziggy in under a minute now what you
want<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.559> do<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.950> want<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.130> jump<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.670> want

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
want to do is you want to jump you want

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.939 
want to do is you want to jump you want
to<00:00:14.880> tap<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:15.570> much<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:15.990> possible<00:00:16.199> when<00:00:16.830> you're

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
to tap a as much as possible when you're

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.590 
to tap a as much as possible when you're
on<00:00:17.070> flat<00:00:17.100> surfaces<00:00:17.789> because<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.090> makes<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.359> go

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
on flat surfaces because it makes you go

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120 
on flat surfaces because it makes you go
away<00:00:18.810> faster<00:00:19.260> as<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.410> see<00:00:19.619> here<00:00:19.830> I'm<00:00:19.980> just

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
away faster as you see here I'm just

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.340 
away faster as you see here I'm just
mashing<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> button<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.449> trying<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> make

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
mashing the a button and trying to make

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.890 
mashing the a button and trying to make
it<00:00:22.380> through<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.680> as<00:00:22.830> quick<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.189> possible<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
it through this as quick as possible and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.089 
it through this as quick as possible and
if<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.140> fall<00:00:25.380> off<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.740> actually<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
if you fall off you actually have to

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.650 
if you fall off you actually have to
restart<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> mission<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.939> try<00:00:27.180> all<00:00:27.359> over

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
restart the mission and try all over

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.960 
restart the mission and try all over
again<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.590> totally<00:00:29.130> totally<00:00:29.160> annoying<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
again it is totally totally annoying to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.840 
again it is totally totally annoying to
do<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.080> tap<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.470> enough<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.160> go

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
do but if you tap a enough and go

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
do but if you tap a enough and go
through<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.149> couple<00:00:33.329> times<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.809> should

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
through it a couple times you should

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.840 
through it a couple times you should
have<00:00:34.200> no<00:00:34.320> problem<00:00:34.800> as<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.670> I'm<00:00:35.760> just

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
have no problem as you see here I'm just

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.119 
have no problem as you see here I'm just
mashing<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:37.200> trying<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.559> jump<00:00:37.800> as<00:00:37.920> fast

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
mashing a and I'm trying to jump as fast

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.709 
mashing a and I'm trying to jump as fast
as<00:00:38.250> possible<00:00:38.579> don't<00:00:39.000> hit<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.390> when<00:00:39.600> you're

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
as possible don't hit a when you're

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
Ziggy is actually right here right there

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.270
