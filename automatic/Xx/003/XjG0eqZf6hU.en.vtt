00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 And what friends how they are back 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.140
 here now to walk 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.040
 what fascinates me the most 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:16.330
 and I do not know how it comes to mind 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.210
 something you heard a good time ago 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.790
 a story that precisely comes from 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.740
 jove or hosting that I love 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.840
 listen to us good then 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.990
 he arrives and gives a message and the message is 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.550
 so there were four gorillas or four 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.330
 micros or four monkeys as you want 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.309
 call and put a tube in a room and 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.220
 in that tube they put a basket with 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.680
 pure bananas or bananas not then the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.690
 experiment was that the each time the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.640
 monkeys monkeys or gorillas 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:53.600
 they were going to go then to grab them the bananas 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.300
 people threw water at him then he passed a 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.059
 day two days and they were trying to try 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.500
 grab the bananas but they were not able 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.980
 because they immediately throw water 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.410
 after a week and two thousand 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.979
 as the monkeys no longer dared and they 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.210
 they approached the good tube after that 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.940
 week 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.130
 they got a new one from outside and they took out 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.939
 one of those who was already in 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.549
 and immediately the one who saw the one I just 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.700
 of entering he saw the basket and said go 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.880
 and that so did the others 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.350
 they immediately grabbed him and the monkey did not 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.729
 know why but what they what 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.700
 it's happening here that they do not let me 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.789
 grab my bananas good then to 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.429
 through the days they were taking out one 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.460
 take another one between the other 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.490
 in the end and four monkeys were not 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.060
 the first but new and none of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.520
 they dared to go for the bananas not 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.170
 they knew why they did not know what was going to 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.300
 happen I did not know about the water because 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.940
 they never tried 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.390
 then the example is that there are times the 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.510
 life in us is that way it is so 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.510
 simply because your grandfather was not 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.270
 able to do something because your dad and you 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.140
 mom tell you that you are not capable of that 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.510
 or you are going to fail there 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.569
 that is not reality that is not your 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.330
 destination monkeys who were there ever 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.600
 they dared to grab the bananas 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.710
 Destiny is not destiny 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.540
 his is to have faith have faith in my god 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.620
 have faith in yourself that what sounds in 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.629
 your heart is real 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.260
 and I'm going to him and if I 'm a thing 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.120

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.080
 to get that soul out of that 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.470

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.349
 white many of you are wondering to 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.450
 but where does the sodium come from but 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.220
 Where sodium and sodium come from 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.379
 start if you want you can consume salt 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.560

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.680
 this moment then helps keep 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.750
 one well in the system or in the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.570
