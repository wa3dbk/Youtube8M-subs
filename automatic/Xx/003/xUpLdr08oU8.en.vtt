00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.010
 very large telescope again 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.020
 distinguished himself 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.569
 with its help, astronomers have been able 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.150
 discover the most massive of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.230
 currently known 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.199
 the stars 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.109
 one of which is the beginning of her life 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.419
 attracted 300 solar masses twice 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:18.859
 accepted limit of stellar mass 150 on 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:19.480
 the sun 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.580
 the existence of these monsters possessing 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.699
 millions of times more luminosity than ours 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.460
 star but losing a huge amount 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.939
 substances apparently aching winds can 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.590
 give an answer to the question and how much 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.680
 massive can be stars 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.530
 team of astronomers under the guidance of the floor 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.560
 stole a brick 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.050
 Mufti Russia will enter 6 2 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.950
 the team found several stars 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.870
 skin surface temperatures 42 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.760
 thousands of degrees shouts to everyone 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 sun surface 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.899
 Sizo 103 6 1 cluster found 6 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.479
 the strongest ever found 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.909
 265 sun mass at birth is fun in 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.909
 three hundred twenty times more than the sun 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 to honor the predecessors 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.790
 astronomers have also been able to directly 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.400
 linked to the stars 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.650
 which belong to the dual system I already 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.390
 tired 1 because we have a mass of more than 150 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.310
 km h 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.200
 very massive stars produces 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.430
 very powerful flows of matter 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.210
 unlike people these stars are born 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.850
 Severe fracture soho rooms too early to say 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.040
 with the biggest star 26 1 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.860
 is already in middle age 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.120
 hockey program support 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.370
 to the question what is the past tense 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.560
 however, according to 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.670
 we bought about fifty solar 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.580
 the masses 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.070
 such heavyweights 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.170
 very redkin they are formed in the most 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.570
 dense clusters of stars 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.400
 to highlight there individual stars 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.610
 had to draw all the power of infrared 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.620
 tooling attempt 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.870
 but how such giants are formed and how 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.960
 they live produce so much energy 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.479
 still a big mystery to 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.150
 theorists 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.700
 or they were born so big right away 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.170
 or less the stars gradually merged 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.239
 to form their explain stole 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.319
 stars weight from eight to 150 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.499
 aliens end of life explode form 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.930
 supernova leaving behind 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.700
 all objects are neutron stars 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.149
 black hole 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.769
 finding stars from 150 to three hundred sunny 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.369
 masses astronomers predict 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.539
 creatures unstable 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:30.330
 supernovae 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.960
 which explode completely not 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.929
 leaves traces 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:34.249
 and scorching into the surrounding 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:34.990
 space 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.990
 up to ten solar iron masses 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.799
 and in recent years several have already been proposed 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.489
 candidates for this role 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.849
 so 3 6 1 not only the most massive 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.959
 bright star us star to ten 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.429
 million times brighter than the sun 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.069
 paying tribute to uniqueness 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.239
 similar garbage I think this new 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.639
 mass record will not be beaten soon 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.869
 concludes a contract
