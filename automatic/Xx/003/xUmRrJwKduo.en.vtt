00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello how welcome are you to the web theater 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.990
 88 and this time we're going to make a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 boxing on the behringer microphone c1 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.969
 it's a counter and good microphone 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.940
 professional who brings a 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.270
 interesting feature and that is that it brings 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.490
 then usb connection in such a way that what 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.550
 we can connect to any computer 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.699
 ok is something interesting let's say in the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.480
 previous version that is the c1 and it brings us 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.780
 well this feature of the usb cable and 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.110
 is on the c-17 this feature is worth 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.420
 so let's start then with the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.220
 unboxing let's detail then a little 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.960
 more this microphone 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:52.360
 and I 'm going to comment on this while 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:55.240
 you can find it from 70 to 80 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.050
 dollars then depending on your country I am 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:05.040
 in colombia and well this is the microphone 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.040
 that really weighs a lot, weighs a lot 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.110
 we are not going to take 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.030
 and here's the microphone rangers 1 good 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.550
 let's see what else comes and we're going 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.270
 to leave here and let's see what 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.100
 more comes 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.560
 in the box and good brings a civil of 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.049
 installation of the driver and here also 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.829
 comes and some audio software like 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.679
 audacity and I do not remember the name of the 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:40.450
 others but in here it's also worth going to 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.450
 see what else the box brings 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.350
 cable around here is telling them the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.420
 usb cable to be able to connect to our 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.490
 computer and good example something 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.430
 interesting is that it is a very long cable 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.650
 how do they realize that I think it measures 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.390
 between two or three meters then it is 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.670
 not great because today they 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.370
 which ones are very small and it's a bit 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 uncomfortable ok 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.550
 basically this is the one boxing of the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.960
 microphone 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.110
 behringer we are going to connect it to 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.240
 you hear the audio because of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.420
 barillet insurance is worth or that just 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.040
 connect the microphone to the computer in 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.840
 this moment you are hearing the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.660
 audio from the camera that I'm with 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.180
 recording and now I 'm going to approach 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.959
 the microphone so you can hear the audio 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.709
 ok now you are hearing the audio 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.830
 of the behringer microphone if one really 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.530
 You notice because the change is greatly reduced 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.340
 all external noises and obviously 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.230
 only the voice is heard and very clear 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.620
 and good is an excel 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.760
 microphone I recommend it and it's good 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.549
 make a microphone boxing 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.720
 behringer capacitor if you what 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.390

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.739

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.780
 I would be responding with pleasure 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.640
