you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.520> those<00:01:50.640> funneling<00:01:51.090> areas<00:01:51.450> but

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you can see those funneling areas but

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.020 
you can see those funneling areas but
also<00:01:52.110> jtwc<00:01:52.979> also<00:01:53.369> holds<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.640> center<00:01:53.970> of

northern<00:02:13.660> periphery<00:02:13.930> that's<00:02:14.380> another<00:02:14.680> reason

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
northern periphery that's another reason

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.530 
northern periphery that's another reason
why<00:02:15.070> we're<00:02:15.310> seeing<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.610> lot<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.910> imitating

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540

rains<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:17.020> here<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.470> north<00:02:17.710> as<00:02:17.980> well<00:02:18.220> but

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
rains up here to the north as well but

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.690 
rains up here to the north as well but
this<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.300> helping<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> storm<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.350> gain<00:02:20.650> that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
this is helping the storm to gain that

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.680 
this is helping the storm to gain that
momentum<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.880> likely<00:02:22.300> going<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.570> making

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
momentum and likely going to be making

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.330

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.000 
landfall here used to the key peninsula
just<00:02:25.090> actually<00:02:25.330> east<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.900> nagoya<00:02:26.290> city<00:02:26.770> and

the Japanese Alps there it should

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.070 
the Japanese Alps there it should
decrease<00:04:05.980> intensity<00:04:06.550> fairly<00:04:07.360> significantly

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
decrease intensity fairly significantly

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.990 
decrease intensity fairly significantly
as<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.470> duns<00:04:08.680> does<00:04:09.130> run<00:04:09.370> over<00:04:09.610> those<00:04:09.760> mountains

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
as it duns does run over those mountains

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.390 
as it duns does run over those mountains
as<00:04:10.390> far<00:04:10.900> as<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.170> winds<00:04:11.560> but<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.860> rainfall

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
as far as the winds but the rainfall

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.949 
as far as the winds but the rainfall
actually<00:04:12.910> will<00:04:13.090> increase<00:04:13.630> over<00:04:13.930> the

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
actually will increase over the

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.050 
actually will increase over the
mountains<00:04:14.320> because<00:04:14.650> 80<00:04:15.100> about<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.430> cooling<00:04:15.940> is

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
mountains because 80 about a cooling is

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.370 
mountains because 80 about a cooling is
going<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.269> cause<00:04:16.540> those<00:04:16.870> clouds<00:04:17.169> that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
going to cause those clouds that

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.750 
going to cause those clouds that
basically<00:04:17.709> kind<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.040> get<00:04:18.160> squeezed<00:04:18.489> like<00:04:18.730> a

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
basically kind of get squeezed like a

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.150 
basically kind of get squeezed like a
sponge<00:04:19.180> it's<00:04:19.750> going<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.900> drop<00:04:20.109> precip<00:04:20.620> up<00:04:20.830> and

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
sponge it's going to drop precip up and

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.640 
sponge it's going to drop precip up and
down<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.580> region<00:04:22.030> so<00:04:22.210> this<00:04:22.450> is<00:04:22.630> jmh<00:04:23.110> track<00:04:23.440> on

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
down this region so this is jmh track on

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.350 
down this region so this is jmh track on
