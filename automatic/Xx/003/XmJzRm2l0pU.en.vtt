00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
I'm supposed to explain the Dutch school

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.889 
I'm supposed to explain the Dutch school
system<00:00:32.009> which<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.850> kind<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
system which I will it's kind of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.930 
system which I will it's kind of
different<00:00:34.290> from<00:00:34.469> everywhere<00:00:35.100> else<00:00:35.309> basically

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
different from everywhere else basically

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
different from everywhere else basically
the<00:00:36.090> way<00:00:36.210> our<00:00:36.329> school<00:00:36.570> system<00:00:36.899> works<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.559> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the way our school system works is you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.340 
the way our school system works is you
go<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.280> primary<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.149> you're<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.570> three<00:00:40.200> or

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
go to primary when you're like three or

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010 
go to primary when you're like three or
four<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.280> that's<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.670> early<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.180> then

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
four so that's really early and then

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.680 
four so that's really early and then
primary<00:00:43.680> consists<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.399> eight<00:00:44.760> years<00:00:45.210> eight

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
primary consists of eight years eight

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.590 
primary consists of eight years eight
grades<00:00:46.050> eight<00:00:46.620> classes<00:00:47.579> whatever<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.450> want

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
grades eight classes whatever you want

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.660 
grades eight classes whatever you want
to<00:00:48.660> call<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:51.590> you<00:00:52.590> learn<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.280> read<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
to call it and you learn to read and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
to call it and you learn to read and
write<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.360> third<00:00:54.809> year<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> guess

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
write in your third year so I guess

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.560 
write in your third year so I guess
that's<00:00:55.890> when<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.760> starts<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
that's when it really all starts and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.750 
that's when it really all starts and
then<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:57.989> progressively<00:00:58.980> works<00:00:59.370> its<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.730> up

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
then it progressively works its way up

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.009 
then it progressively works its way up
to<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> eighth<00:01:00.649> near<00:01:01.649> 8th<00:01:01.980> grade<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:03.690> your<00:01:03.750> 8th

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
to the eighth near 8th grade in your 8th

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
to the eighth near 8th grade in your 8th
grade<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> take<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> test<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.580> couple

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
grade you get to take a test of a couple

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
grade you get to take a test of a couple
hundred<00:01:06.030> multiple-choice<00:01:06.600> questions<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
hundred multiple-choice questions and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
hundred multiple-choice questions and
you<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.939> outcome<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.750> test<00:01:10.049> can

the level I'm at the first level the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.370 
the level I'm at the first level the
highest<00:02:16.330> there's<00:02:17.330> some<00:02:17.600> subdivisions<00:02:18.319> for

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
highest there's some subdivisions for

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.230 
highest there's some subdivisions for
instance<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.040> can<00:02:19.160> either<00:02:19.400> choose<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:19.910> do

Latin and Greek or not do them and you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.690 
Latin and Greek or not do them and you
can<00:02:24.530> choose<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.540> do<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:27.130> boiling<00:02:28.130> cooler<00:02:28.370> course

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
can choose to do a boiling cooler course

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.440 
can choose to do a boiling cooler course
or<00:02:28.910> some<00:02:29.150> extra<00:02:29.780> stuff<00:02:30.020> in<00:02:30.200> some<00:02:30.410> schools<00:02:30.709> and

or some extra stuff in some schools and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.900 
or some extra stuff in some schools and
then<00:02:32.450> there's<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.870> second<00:02:33.350> level<00:02:33.500> oh<00:02:33.910> I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
then there's the second level oh I

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.150 
then there's the second level oh I
should<00:02:35.569> add<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.020> first<00:02:36.260> level<00:02:36.590> takes<00:02:36.860> six

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
should add the first level takes six

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.250 
should add the first level takes six
years<00:02:37.459> second<00:02:38.209> level<00:02:38.390> takes<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.690> five<00:02:38.959> years

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
years second level takes you five years

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.229 
years second level takes you five years
and<00:02:39.470> there's<00:02:39.620> no<00:02:39.800> real<00:02:40.130> distinctions<00:02:40.850> between

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
and there's no real distinctions between

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.570 
and there's no real distinctions between
that<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.020> know<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.620> then<00:02:43.220> there's<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
that that I know of and then there's the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.310 
that that I know of and then there's the
third<00:02:43.850> level<00:02:44.060> which<00:02:44.330> takes<00:02:44.600> four<00:02:44.870> years<00:02:44.900> and

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
third level which takes four years and

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.600 
third level which takes four years and
there's<00:02:45.440> some<00:02:45.650> distinctions<00:02:46.190> for<00:02:46.340> instance

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
there's some distinctions for instance

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.670 
there's some distinctions for instance
you<00:02:46.700> can<00:02:46.850> go<00:02:46.970> do<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.870> school<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.620> really

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
you can go do a school that really

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.190 
you can go do a school that really
teaches<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.600> agricultural<00:02:50.600> things<00:02:50.900> or

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
teaches you agricultural things or

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.710 
teaches you agricultural things or
teaches<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.680> cooking<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.760> stuff<00:02:53.540> like

teaches you cooking and and stuff like

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.220 
teaches you cooking and and stuff like
that<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.019> my<00:02:54.080> first<00:02:54.410> three<00:02:54.680> years<00:02:54.769> I<00:02:55.250> got<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:56.230> set

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
that in my first three years I got a set

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.710 
that in my first three years I got a set
of<00:02:57.470> subjects<00:02:58.130> where<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.760> didn't<00:02:59.209> get<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.480> choose

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
of subjects where I didn't get to choose

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.199 
of subjects where I didn't get to choose
what<00:03:00.050> they<00:03:00.080> were<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.680> then<00:03:01.280> in<00:03:01.730> my<00:03:01.910> third<00:03:02.180> year

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
what they were and then in my third year

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.949 
what they were and then in my third year
I<00:03:02.510> had<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.019> choose<00:03:03.260> between<00:03:03.319> four<00:03:04.220> sets<00:03:04.580> of

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
I had to choose between four sets of

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.300 
I had to choose between four sets of
subjects<00:03:07.330> one<00:03:08.330> was<00:03:08.630> based<00:03:09.290> around<00:03:09.500> economics

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
subjects one was based around economics

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.380 
subjects one was based around economics
and<00:03:10.580> other<00:03:10.700> was<00:03:10.910> based<00:03:11.150> around<00:03:13.390> cultural

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and other was based around cultural

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.350 
and other was based around cultural
education<00:03:15.370> then<00:03:16.370> there's<00:03:16.579> another<00:03:16.670> one<00:03:16.880> beast

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
education then there's another one beast

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.990 
education then there's another one beast
around<00:03:17.739> biology<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:18.980> one<00:03:19.340> based<00:03:19.670> around

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
around biology and one based around

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.150 
around biology and one based around
physics<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:21.260> chose<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.650> one<00:03:21.769> based<00:03:21.950> on

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
physics and I chose the one based on

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.069 
physics and I chose the one based on
physics<00:03:22.610> combined<00:03:23.329> with<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.690> one<00:03:23.840> based

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
physics combined with the one based

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.920 
physics combined with the one based
around<00:03:24.260> biology<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.489> way<00:03:25.640> our<00:03:25.850> school<00:03:26.690> days

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
around biology the way our school days

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.920 
around biology the way our school days
are<00:03:27.340> divided<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.459> really<00:03:28.880> awkward<00:03:29.269> because

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
are divided is really awkward because

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.680 
are divided is really awkward because
basically<00:03:30.769> every<00:03:31.370> school<00:03:31.910> day<00:03:32.060> has<00:03:32.360> nine

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
basically every school day has nine

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.039 
basically every school day has nine
periods<00:03:33.260> or<00:03:33.560> nine<00:03:34.010> classes<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.700> don't<00:03:35.150> know<00:03:35.269> so

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
periods or nine classes I don't know so

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.840 
periods or nine classes I don't know so
every<00:03:36.530> school<00:03:36.769> day<00:03:36.920> has<00:03:37.040> nine<00:03:37.310> periods<00:03:37.790> and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
every school day has nine periods and

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.150 
every school day has nine periods and
you<00:03:40.850> can<00:03:41.000> have<00:03:41.299> assigned<00:03:41.690> any<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.799> periods

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
you can have assigned any of the periods

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.890 
you can have assigned any of the periods
on<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.340> school<00:03:43.640> day<00:03:43.790> though<00:03:44.030> though<00:03:44.359> they<00:03:44.540> try

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
on a school day though though they try

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.599 
on a school day though though they try
to<00:03:44.959> keep<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.440> as<00:03:45.560> clean<00:03:45.829> for<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.190> as<00:03:46.310> parts

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
to keep it as clean for you as parts

about<00:03:46.700> this<00:03:46.820> videos<00:03:47.180> turning<00:03:47.600> out<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.900> be

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
about this videos turning out to be

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.830 
about this videos turning out to be
pretty<00:03:48.140> long<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:49.010> still<00:03:49.880> have<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.150> pack<00:03:50.420> my<00:03:50.450> bag

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
pretty long I still have to pack my bag

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.349 
pretty long I still have to pack my bag
and<00:03:51.049> edit<00:03:51.350> this<00:03:51.500> video<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.340> I'm<00:03:53.030> gonna<00:03:53.150> be

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
and edit this video so I'm gonna be

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.410 
and edit this video so I'm gonna be
rounding<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.780> up<00:03:54.910> before<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:55.940> forget<00:03:56.239> I

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
rounding it up before I forget I

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.259 
rounding it up before I forget I
promised<00:03:57.079> a<00:03:57.200> tutorial<00:03:57.769> for<00:03:58.010> my<00:03:58.130> name<00:03:58.310> cuz<00:03:58.730> it's

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
promised a tutorial for my name cuz it's

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.759 
promised a tutorial for my name cuz it's
it's<00:03:59.660> really<00:03:59.930> cool<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.380> you've<00:04:00.500> all<00:04:00.650> been

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
it's really cool that you've all been

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.110 
it's really cool that you've all been
trying<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.280> there's<00:04:01.430> been<00:04:01.790> some<00:04:01.970> good

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
trying it and there's been some good

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.520 
trying it and there's been some good
tries<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.720> some<00:04:02.959> not-so-good<00:04:03.890> tries<00:04:05.260> but<00:04:06.260> I

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
tries and some not-so-good tries but I

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.199 
tries and some not-so-good tries but I
guess<00:04:08.829> explaining<00:04:09.829> how<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.070> say<00:04:10.640> it<00:04:10.820> in<00:04:11.060> the

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
guess explaining how to say it in the

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.970 
guess explaining how to say it in the
Dutch<00:04:11.480> kind<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.989> way<00:04:12.200> it's<00:04:12.470> pretty<00:04:12.739> difficult

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
Dutch kind of way it's pretty difficult

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.060
