00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.600
 rama 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.760
 sat 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.910
 and as soon as this song sounds white 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.939
 everyone is what it is about 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.289
 love story of baby and Johnny 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.539
 Alone the movie saw in Germany 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.880
 then eight million people 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.669
 Now the success story returns 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 namely as a stage show television is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.220
 not the same as we have to stage 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.589
 of course, a lot more 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.360
 insert history or text 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.220
 the man with pictures on tv much 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.510
 It can be shown faster 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.309
 works on the stage only unfortunately 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.989
 not and by that there is probably 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.600
 see how it simply does not exist in the film 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.070
 because we are just another 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.079
 have to tell a little history 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.629
 Of course, that's not enough 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.090
 the well-known hits such as do you love 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.090
 me or the famous watermelon scene 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.880
 hamburg merengue and cuban 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.190
 rhythms let dance teachers waiter and 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.260
 animators in the show night after night 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.200
 grab their hips sexy 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.090
 first and foremost swede johnny castle 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.869
 So that was always a dream of mine 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:30.820
 that this role can play and that 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:32.890
 It's very hard to print because of me 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.750
 I think you have to experience that on the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.180
 to provide sea this role-playing 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.950
 So really great to see is the show 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.440
 dirty dancing until the 17th 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.540
 may in admiralspalast and promises 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.950
 their audience at least for one 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.950
 evening the time of your life 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.960
 OK
