to find each other that's that's the big
question<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.510> think<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.930> this<00:03:35.049> story<00:03:35.519> actually

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
question I think in this story actually

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.670 
question I think in this story actually
it<00:03:37.930> should<00:03:37.989> it's<00:03:38.409> a<00:03:38.530> fish-out-of-water<00:03:38.950> story

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
it should it's a fish-out-of-water story

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.420 
it should it's a fish-out-of-water story
she<00:03:41.680> thought<00:03:41.859> of<00:03:41.890> water<00:03:42.659> fish<00:03:43.659> no<00:03:44.049> she<00:03:44.680> it's

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
she thought of water fish no she it's

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
it essays can be very chaotic I tried to

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.740 
it essays can be very chaotic I tried to
structure<00:05:19.759> it

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.810 

it's<00:05:23.530> really<00:05:23.740> complicated<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.490> judge<00:05:24.700> the

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
it's really complicated to judge the

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.150 
it's really complicated to judge the
script<00:05:25.120> also<00:05:25.420> because<00:05:26.170> you<00:05:26.350> have<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.920> script

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
script also because you have to a script

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.100 
script also because you have to a script
is<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:27.970> know<00:05:28.090> this<00:05:28.240> better<00:05:28.420> than<00:05:28.570> me<00:05:28.840> I<00:05:28.870> guess

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
is you know this better than me I guess

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.920 
is you know this better than me I guess
but<00:05:29.230> it's<00:05:29.410> something<00:05:29.760> quite<00:05:30.760> neutral<00:05:31.450> you

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
but it's something quite neutral you

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.140 
but it's something quite neutral you
don't<00:05:32.140> have<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.500> put<00:05:32.680> everything<00:05:33.070> in<00:05:33.400> it<00:05:33.520> also

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
don't have to put everything in it also

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.520 
don't have to put everything in it also
there's<00:05:34.390> a<00:05:34.450> lot<00:05:34.570> of<00:05:34.600> things<00:05:34.870> you<00:05:34.990> don't<00:05:35.020> say<00:05:35.410> in

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
there's a lot of things you don't say in

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.580 
there's a lot of things you don't say in
a<00:05:35.590> script<00:05:35.890> that<00:05:36.040> is<00:05:36.250> related<00:05:36.550> to<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.930> how

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
a script that is related to to the how

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.450 
a script that is related to to the how
you<00:05:38.650> will<00:05:39.010> tell<00:05:39.550> this<00:05:40.480> story<00:05:40.690> on<00:05:41.200> screen<00:05:41.620> so<00:05:42.160> no

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460

along<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:02.950> way<00:06:03.090> until<00:06:04.090> it<00:06:04.420> becomes<00:06:04.780> this<00:06:04.990> big

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
along the way until it becomes this big

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.160 
along the way until it becomes this big
bouquet<00:06:05.620> of<00:06:05.890> flowers<00:06:06.850> that<00:06:07.540> holds<00:06:07.990> together

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
hopefully it's a very long process where

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.380 
hopefully it's a very long process where
you<00:06:12.160> just<00:06:12.370> turn<00:06:12.550> to<00:06:13.590> find<00:06:14.590> good<00:06:14.740> ideas<00:06:15.160> and
