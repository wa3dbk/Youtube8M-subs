00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.700
 b 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.170
 welcome people to one 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.570
 new video 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.430
 the shader per 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.689
 dv these shaders are for very 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.939
 underperforming or very 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:35.239
 powerful pc but more you know 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:38.000
 after the intro until then as well as 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.610
 said for very powerful or 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.530
 very low-power pcs are these 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.870
 shader so I really think that 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.250
 shader are properly cool it must 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.920
 but you convince yourself 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.670
 from the look and I show you because 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.620
 now the shaders go so now 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.210
 we first in the asiaten all app of 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.430
 In the lot you are the window everywhere 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.760
 I show that with the late night 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.760
 show 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.229
 it would have been with you on the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.320
 Most apps I have with it now 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:13.399
 For example, less than with the car 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.800
 looks pretty good too the lists 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:19.850
 Reflect the water has been moving since 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.040
 halt the trees move indeed be 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.229
 actually find everything very nice easily 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.670
 shader then lausanner hereby have 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.570
 I sps more and he sees it too 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.220
 better from the water 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.100
 slight reflection and it moves 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.570
 I have already seen the reflection 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.210
 need to 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.610
 So it's very small, I think 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.790
 is a game in there then the read 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.490
 reflexes are also very nice then shaders 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.659
 the video looks really as well 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.850
 everyone is very cool right now 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.610
 The water is a bit murky here 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.770
 I think that's a pity 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.080
 who's so likes can indeed times 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.910
 Try and read the reflexes 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.540
 are also similar or almost the same as 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.170
 always say yes and the shaders you can 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.170
 see for yourself 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.010
 then we continue with the hai shader 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.920
 I think that's the best shader 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.750
 pack this packs of this so that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.590
 I like water now a reflection 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.810
 in there and there he likes me all 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.550
 best also the whole lighting effects it 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.940
 not too bright not too dark for that 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.830
 optimally so so then I'll show you as 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.750
 Last but not least the ultra shader looks 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.010
 also very nice but I think like 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.090
 said not as good as the niederheide 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.660
 you can do the water again 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.180
 see is so I think that's one 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.380
 bit bluish than the shader 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.900
 and the respect is not quite so 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.239
 Strong how can you make the lenses effects 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.190
 also see it here again 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.040
 Generally the shaders can still be found now 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.549
 time I'm going to talk down here must 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.549
 see again 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.370
 yes , everything looks very nice 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.980
 from the high so the ultra 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.840
 high shaders have a ratio wise too 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.790
 a low requirements so you can 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.930
 you have them all and I try 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.160
 Show yourself now like you 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.709
 shader packs with shader packs order 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.940
 So how you add that but yes, up 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.930
 Now on the comparison from the desktop to 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.599
 right here we would be back on the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.220
 desktop to install the 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.540
 installation not directly I'll show you 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.099
 not like the shader 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.030
 installed for this is a link in the 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.620
 video description how he got that 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.049
 installed i just show you it first 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.930
 where you can download here and 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.700
 like her shaders in the shader packs 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.799
 or contracts if some are not people 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.000
 know good goes first on the link 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.250
 which is a description and you go 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.040
 just on media celebration and it ends up 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.019
 here under perpetrator by a few kw goes 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.250
 real quick 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.799
 then we just go once a newly here 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.950
 web shader and then there is one here 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.709
 textfile yes and here then stop 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.900
 little something to the shader packs can 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.160
 read through your format and yes you go 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.060
 on his youtube channel is too 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.500
 good again 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.669
 then show you now again now 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.289
 adds as first opened with 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.270
 sleep and he the window execution 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.830
 and enter 1 percent from tata percent 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.690
 then we go to the point minecraft 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.310
 folder if the shader already installed 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.750
 you have the folder with shader here 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:37.639
 packs goes in there and pulls this 455 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.830
 shaders here have a pattern with me 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.240
 most have already been so but have 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.340
 you the shaders and then you go the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.520
 Just chose it in minecraft 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.200
 Everybody should know 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.460
 and sometimes say that 's it 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.070
 Now with this video you just leave 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.320
 times reviews as synonymous to the shaders 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.200
 and goes on his youtube channel so from 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.669
 shdm i say thank you for watching 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.669
 skin in and ciao
