 routine or monotonous is tolerant avoids 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.289
 be jealous and possessive if you like the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.660
 formality if you love a man who 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.469
 works in a bank with a fixed schedule 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.829
 if you love formal suit men 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.510

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.699
 and very faithful 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.190

 your life this is undoubtedly your man he is 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.620
 changing all the time changes from 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:57.499
 look and his personality is 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.379
 completely dual as the image 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:03.409
 of the twins will be like being with two 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.470
 men at the same time one you say and another 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.200
 which says that its element is not the air 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.080
 so they are very difficult people to 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.660
 predict and control are men that a 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.990
 day they love you the next day they are not 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.190
 insurance are infidel and fickle the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.350
 Gemini are undoubtedly fascinating men 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.650
 intelligent charming and you know 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.740
 sell beautifully however they 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.530
 it frightens the monotony and they are unable to 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.780
 stay in one place but quiet 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.229
 this depends a lot on your date of 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.840
 birth and the ascendant you have 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.970
 here we talk about gemini in the sense 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.350
 general 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.540
 you have not definitely put a 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.540
 easy goal and you'll have to be very 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.270
 original to get the attention of this 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.910
 fascinating man and since you achieve your 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.910
 goal will have to be aware that 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.580
 this man gets bored frequently of 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.520
 the stability of a formal relationship or 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.950
 a marriage to gemini scares him 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.950
 commitment so you'll have to 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.890
 start playing your cards in a way 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.590
 intelligent inform yourself of everything 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.350
 and he likes and starts asking you to 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.290
 accompany sites that you previously 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.560
 you know that you are interested ask him things 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.900
 of him that talks to you about what he likes and 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.850
 what he does not like in games like that 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.550
 you love and hate and so on, this will help you 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.430
 know him and be prepared for his 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.900
 constant changes 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.650
 remember that you will have to know and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.500
 understand the two twins and this can 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.640
 be a difficult task to gemini him 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.650
 love to smile so make him smile 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.380
 buy a puppet of those that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.540
 put in the hand and between games let him 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.510
 know you do not want it for friend and 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.090
 eternal confidant making the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.000
 puppet say but go this guy not 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.390
 is not bad for him will be less 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.030
 complicated that you say it with games is 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.600
 different to say I like you and I want everything 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.140
 with you because if you do it will enter 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.069
 twin panic one that is romantic will say 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.730
 It's cute 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.280
 twin girl 2 that is anti romanticism 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.249
 look let's get out of here this girl we 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.879
 he wants to catch gemini he does not like 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:35.120
 jealous and possessive women if what 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.090
 you want to see run and hide tell 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.450
 of how you followed your last boyfriend and what 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.689
 you caught in all his lies because to 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.689
 you nobody sees you the silly face nobody goes 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.700
 to mess with your man this is the way 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.849
 simpler than you gemini 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.480
 disappear this man loves to chat and 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:59.599
 meeting people sometimes is not so much 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.269
 that is unfaithful is rather that he likes 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.790
 diversity and fun so 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.930
 that if you do not give it to him he will go out to look for it 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.650
 if you are not sure of yourself liberal 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.909
 and flexible you will suffer a lot in this 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.579
 relationship 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.729
 Gemini is impatient does not like the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.150
 slow people are very nice men 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.130
 with very interesting conversations are 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.120
 funny men 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.740

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.010
 able to sell almost anything 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.400
 that they have on hand, that's why they sell 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.890
 themselves also mercury us 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.620
 they can do two things at once and well 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.080
 made are unpunctual for more than 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.110
 they want to get punctual they can not 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.480
 something always comes out or is entertained in 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.360
 somewhere so that you take your 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.580
 time and get used to not getting to 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.460
 time unless you have the virgo in your 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.740
 ascending but here we talk about gemini 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.930
 in general with this man do not you 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.030
 bother to always upset you 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.610
 you will end up forgiving what I do 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.980
 after talking to him and if someone 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.860
 ask why are you still with him despite 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.950

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.880

 premieres or places that for him are a 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:00.019
 novelty you have to be very original to 

00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:02.629

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:05.809

 make them angry but also anger 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.930

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:43.070
 Hates silence , confinement and feeling 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.590
 tied
