00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
between time management and and making

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.450 
between time management and and making
sure<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.850> took<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:31.979> goal

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
like right now we're looking at the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
like right now we're looking at the
clock<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.000> let<00:01:51.390> me<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:52.080> run<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.290> play<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.770> more

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
clock so let me just run a play one more

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.790 
clock so let me just run a play one more
time<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.150> have<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:54.420> use<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.990> using<00:01:55.710> my

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
time and so I have to use the using my

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.340 
time and so I have to use the using my
timeouts<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.430> my<00:01:56.580> advantage<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.460> can

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
timeouts to my advantage and I can

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.320 
timeouts to my advantage and I can
so<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.890> think<00:02:01.040> is<00:02:01.220> gonna<00:02:01.369> call<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.640> timeout<00:02:01.970> now

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330

at the time you see how it's going down
but<00:02:21.410> if<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.770> call<00:02:22.040> timeout<00:02:22.700> either<00:02:23.510> go<00:02:23.840> back

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
but if you call timeout either go back

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.160 
but if you call timeout either go back
to<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.980> time<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.209> know<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:26.959> first

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
to the time but you know that you first

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.530 
to the time but you know that you first
started<00:02:27.650> when<00:02:28.220> when<00:02:28.760> you're<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.330> huddle

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
started when when you're in the huddle

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.900 
started when when you're in the huddle
and<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:30.920> that's<00:02:31.130> how<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.400> timeout

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
and so that's that's how the timeout

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.530 
and so that's that's how the timeout
goes<00:02:32.390> up

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.420 

and<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.439> here<00:02:37.739> we're<00:02:37.950> trying<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.219> get<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
and so here we're trying to get the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.940 
and so here we're trying to get the
first<00:02:38.640> down<00:02:38.879> but<00:02:39.360> nope<00:02:40.079> i'm<00:02:40.319> not<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:40.890> to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
first down but nope i'm not going to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.080 
first down but nope i'm not going to
fair<00:02:41.159> i'm<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:41.459> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> score<00:02:41.969> this

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
fair i'm not going to score this

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420 
fair i'm not going to score this
touchdown<00:02:42.590> because<00:02:43.590> i<00:02:43.829> don't<00:02:44.069> i<00:02:44.189> want<00:02:44.340> to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
touchdown because i don't i want to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.160 
touchdown because i don't i want to
leave<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:44.700> little<00:02:45.060> time<00:02:45.480> on<00:02:45.689> the<00:02:45.780> clock<00:02:45.900> as

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
leave this little time on the clock as

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.130 
leave this little time on the clock as
possible<00:02:46.969> because<00:02:47.969> that<00:02:48.390> way<00:02:48.569> if<00:02:48.780> they<00:02:48.959> get

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
possible because that way if they get

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.530 
possible because that way if they get
the<00:02:49.290> ball<00:02:49.500> back<00:02:49.739> or<00:02:50.010> when<00:02:50.969> they<00:02:51.060> do<00:02:51.120> get<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the ball back or when they do get the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.289 
the ball back or when they do get the
ball<00:02:51.719> back<00:02:52.310> it's<00:02:53.310> going<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.670> force<00:02:53.909> them<00:02:54.120> into

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
ball back it's going to force them into

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.289 
ball back it's going to force them into
a<00:02:54.450> past<00:02:54.890> situation<00:02:55.890> which<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.099> much<00:02:56.640> easier<00:02:56.670> to

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
a past situation which is much easier to

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.740 
a past situation which is much easier to
defend<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:57.930> so<00:03:02.000> i'm<00:03:03.000> gonna<00:03:03.329> go<00:03:03.420> ahead<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.629> do

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
defend and so i'm gonna go ahead and do

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.929 
defend and so i'm gonna go ahead and do
the<00:03:03.840> QB<00:03:04.170> sneak<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:05.159> is<00:03:05.370> my<00:03:05.519> bread<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.790> butter

many duplicates and they're not worth

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.510

like<00:05:54.630> squat<00:05:55.230> you<00:05:55.860> know<00:05:56.010> because<00:05:56.220> you<00:05:56.250> can't

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
like squat you know because you can't

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.980
