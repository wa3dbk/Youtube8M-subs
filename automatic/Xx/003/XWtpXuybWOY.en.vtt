00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello to all Caciotti it came to this 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.940
 brand new mini series of four episodes 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.000
 in which I will show you the ways to fuck 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.590
 on watch boxes in particular I will show i 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.400
 four mini games we have 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:23.279
 available then we start from dal sono 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.769
 undecided I am undecided we start from 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 this here will be very short videos 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.550
 because I will only explain you in what 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.480
 consist of the games because the only one in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.190
 I am really good at that there 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.940
 spider but I think they are good at that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.530
 all 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.530
 obviously we have these ultrasounds 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.690
 that make us special effects 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 so beautiful that they really exist for the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.480
 I don't know if you know it and wow we are 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.960
 here we are subject to the effects 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.960
 psychedelic 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 and we have to hit the worked flowers 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:13.140
 cool spin turns the voice actor who has 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.800
 done a great job you will be canada 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.800
 like he's doing stuff 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.020
 this is where I talked about the controls 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.910
 they are definitely too low though 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 at least we have certain checkpoints more 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.479
 too low lows what I was 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.040
 saying 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:44.220
 indeed the controls certainly prove this 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.530
 is perhaps the least fun of the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.690
 no mode maybe at the wave top in 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.690
 how much fun 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:11.570
 it is certainly the most casual this one from 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:11.570
 I had taken that bad turns the Madonna 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.200
 it's possible 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.200
 the nice thing is that there are so many maps 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.960
 I name it but the course comes 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.910
 we take off and once you are 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.720
 buy of protections also unblock others 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.230
 however it 's not really my kind of 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.880
 of map ie wicker game no wait 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.920
 this is not what I have 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.400
 just started 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.230
 wait wait let's do a shoot 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.940
 then that watches over things in the city 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.860
 because this is a fucking city I say 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.230
 but I never understood you, you think 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.230
 have understood which as real cool 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:04.170
 pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:09.050

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.440
 here we say that for real i 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.930
 checks do they bend I know maybe 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.210
 with controller it's better bad after I try 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.480
 a controller 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:30.960
 turn not too far here there is santino here 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.720
 there's sortino it works check and if 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:39.930
 own controller works 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:48.810
 controller ok right controller and runs 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:52.640
 turns to that check a little too much that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:04:07.350
 fucking in books or god looks like it vibrates 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:10.400
 minutes guys I'll make it turn turns ok 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.400
 super holy man 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.360

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.730
 city ​​i got it ok ok super i 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:24.480
 circles for the slow and bounces entire 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:29.340
 Mom cement taken in full that beautiful 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.340
 from the beginning but that sucks 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.050
 renon controls controls give gifts 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.410
 Share gifts pray then do that 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.410

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.830
 of reflexes are a bit low but does 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:05:00.280
 Italians, but Cassano did feel bad 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:02.080
 But just one new ok was enough 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.660
 I wanted to see if I could do that 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.970
 blow even if I see it difficult 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.750
 this is the very first mode 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.750
 psichedelic 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.330
