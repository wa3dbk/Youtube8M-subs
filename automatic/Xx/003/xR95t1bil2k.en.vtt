00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 what if he has come back to the area 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.089
 I bring the scj a skin of jacques is 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.890
 jacques band the good as you can see 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.590
 we are going to analyze the pools in 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
 of the psuv brass lantern of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.759
 always carries a rod with a skewer that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.580
 with nail there is power the nails driven 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.870
 now it does not put us to dance wearing a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.810
 pretty special outfit as well as 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.430
 the truth is that I like the truth that 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.500
 I'm here it's very good I had not seen 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.070
 so far and well we go there with the 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.070
 cries of war 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.190
 well this is starting to be a weapon of 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.180
 true 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.180
 champion toranzo 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.060
 the dance 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.160
 and laughter 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.570
 and let's start with the attacks up 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.570
 I have this activated 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.790
 before let's put it here we're going to 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.310
 zoom in a bit 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.310
 perfect and let's start with the cv 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.910
 and it 's the jump 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.060
 let's also look at the attacks have 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.830
 like good wood is because we do not know 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.680
 for the wooden stick because it's made 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.010
 of wood we are going to pull another Cuba and 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.010
 you see 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.150
 I'm going to bring it closer so you can see 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.890
 turn on this 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.890
 and hit the strongest hit 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.470
 once 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.810
 does not fly with this one that puts with the one of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.180
 bluff I think he got up off the ground 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.619
 while he's doing that good we're going to 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.610
 go pulling while the cult is renewed 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.610
 let's pulling another q 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.420
 one w 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.890
 here we are going to throw it away walking 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:59.170
 well I imagined that it was going up we were going to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.840
 Finally pull the r 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.469
 no see 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.509
 and well I think we're going to make a 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.100
 remittance of attacks you know I like 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.690
 so he had it fast for the last time 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.940
 taca 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.740
 let's throw it in combination with the q 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.310
 I do not think it changes anything but it's one thing 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.550
 that is done a lot with jacques 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.170
 and beige and nothing until here we estimate it 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.710
 the recall strip to see if it changes 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.700
 something 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.739
 rich 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.150
 we do not see being absolutely still like that 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.720
 that does not change and we will see the animation 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.720
 of death 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.630
 to go running is here in the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.490
 jacques vandals the truth that is a 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.069
 spare the character and there are not any 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.769
 better than there are also worse 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.400
 let's jump let's jump back 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:52.370
 china and for a moment let's look 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.430
 his death is there we see 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.379
 how he tried to make his move but not 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.120
 and he dies and I do not know if to wait 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.700
 on his return because I do not think he has 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.690
 this corner I think it's pretty old 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.180
 what happens is that there is a compilation 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.650
 of ancient vandals that there depends here 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.019
 the vandals I will do all the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.209
 vandals now I'm going to bring all the 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.599
 vandal skin has touched now since 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.849
 band the next was I think good not 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.620
 it has no reappearance you will see vandal 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.659
 and well let's leave it here good 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.280
 for nothing I hope you liked it is 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.690
 who as much as I do not see anything 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.920
 next chapter the area to the east has been 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.920
 already activating the goodbye
