00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.899
 and in this 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.360
 good with wet hair we go to 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.129
 begin to shape our hair 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.500
 with a round brush and with the dryer 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.200
 the round brush would have to be 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.330
 medium small depends how long 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.550
 so short you have the hair will depend 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.560
 the size of the brush mine is this is 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.450
 small and this would be the length of my 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.669
 hair because they asked him if 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.619
 you have it shorter because it is more 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.930
 easy to style and much faster 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.850
 I have to give it more shape and more 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.850
 volume because I have the longest fringe 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.449
 we have to give volume to the area of 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.160
 fringe so we have to be combing 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.890
 what with the dryer and with the brush 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:57.460
 for a while so that we have 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:59.469
 volume and the hairstyle does not fall out and 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.809
 in the back area we have to also 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.579
 give some form nothing more dry 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.770
 it is not necessary that we have to give 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.050
 so much volume to the back area of ​​the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.180
 head we have to concentrate more on 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.550
 the fringe as I told you that by the way is 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.890
 important that they have wet hair 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.080
 wet because a damp hair is more 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.520
 easy to handle good I'm 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.130
 taken a little longer because I have the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.630
 long fringe and I have to give it more 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.790
 way so that the hairstyle is not me 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.990
 undo and from the sides also pass the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.780
 dryer so they do not have any 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.060
 hair hostel and now let's take a 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.160
 little wax on our palms and the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.100
 let's warm up a bit so that 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.990
 It is easier to mold our hair 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.240
 it only remains to shape our 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.190
 be careful with our fingers for me is 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.310
 easier to comb it with your fingers than with 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.590
 a brush because it looks more natural 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.689
 and with what remains of our 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.610
 hands do not forget to pass it on the sides and 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.189
 back also so that we do not have 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.670
 no hair stopped and it is also 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.189
 optional, apply a little fixative spray and 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.170
 Well, it would be very easy to do so 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.090
 this hairstyle only have to give 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.490
 shape the hair with the dryer is not 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.259
 despair do not necessarily have to 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.119
 have the same hair length as me 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.130
 I have if they have it shorter it's more 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.690
 easy if you liked this video please 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.370

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.050
