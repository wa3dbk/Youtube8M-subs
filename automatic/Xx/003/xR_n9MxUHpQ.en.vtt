00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
this one all that much mostly because I

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.170 
this one all that much mostly because I
just<00:02:28.830> didn't<00:02:29.040> haven't<00:02:29.310> had<00:02:29.430> too<00:02:29.849> much<00:02:29.970> at<00:02:30.120> a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
time and even though it's really good I

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.970 
time and even though it's really good I
was<00:02:33.450> focusing<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.200> lot<00:02:34.349> on<00:02:34.410> playing<00:02:34.769> more

sister got a net um this was a gift and
I<00:02:56.130> actually<00:02:56.310> thought<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.580> was<00:02:56.700> going<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.849> be

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
I actually thought it was going to be

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.030 
I actually thought it was going to be
really<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.690> fun<00:02:57.989> because<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.860> football

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
really like fun because I like football

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.850 
really like fun because I like football
and<00:02:59.599> even<00:03:00.599> though<00:03:00.660> i<00:03:00.690> miss<00:03:00.930> sega<00:03:01.200> sports<00:03:01.620> and

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
and even though i miss sega sports and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
and even though i miss sega sports and
their<00:03:01.980> football<00:03:02.310> games<00:03:02.489> i<00:03:02.640> thought<00:03:02.760> there

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
their football games i thought there

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.949 
their football games i thought there
were<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> lot<00:03:03.120> better<00:03:03.239> than<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.569> madden<00:03:03.870> games

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
were a lot better than the madden games

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.030 
were a lot better than the madden games
you<00:03:06.959> know<00:03:07.049> i<00:03:07.080> thought<00:03:07.349> this<00:03:07.500> might<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.860> good<00:03:07.980> to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
you know i thought this might be good to

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.509 
you know i thought this might be good to
have<00:03:08.510> but<00:03:09.510> i<00:03:09.690> don't<00:03:10.170> really<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.310> all<00:03:11.489> that

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
have but i don't really like it all that

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.660 
have but i don't really like it all that
much<00:03:11.880> because<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.420> uh<00:03:13.130> it's<00:03:14.130> very<00:03:14.340> hard<00:03:14.610> to

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
much because it uh it's very hard to

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.750 
much because it uh it's very hard to
successfully<00:03:15.359> pass<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.570> ball<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:17.040> i

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
successfully pass the ball in it so i

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.240 
successfully pass the ball in it so i
play<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.660> almost<00:03:18.930> all<00:03:19.140> running<00:03:19.620> plays<00:03:19.859> just

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
play like almost all running plays just

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.720 
play like almost all running plays just
get<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> little<00:03:20.489> boring<00:03:20.790> after<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> while<00:03:22.730> this

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
inside that and the reason is because

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.699 
inside that and the reason is because
that<00:03:32.280> there's<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.970> CD<00:03:33.359> of<00:03:33.600> Music<00:03:34.260> City<00:03:34.440> it's<00:03:34.650> the

Quest<00:03:58.200> heroes<00:03:58.350> rockin<00:03:58.739> slang<00:03:58.889> did<00:03:59.069> not<00:03:59.250> work

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
Quest heroes rockin slang did not work

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.370 
Quest heroes rockin slang did not work
and<00:04:00.810> when<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.200> took<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.620> back<00:04:01.829> they<00:04:03.200> they<00:04:04.200> didn't

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
and when I took it back they they didn't

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.990 
and when I took it back they they didn't
have<00:04:04.470> another<00:04:04.680> copy<00:04:04.950> which<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.489> typical<00:04:05.970> with

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
have another copy which is typical with

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.720 
have another copy which is typical with
games<00:04:06.389> gamestop<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.069> could<00:04:08.310> only<00:04:08.459> take

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
games gamestop so I could only take

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.720 
games gamestop so I could only take
another<00:04:09.150> DS<00:04:09.389> game<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.160> was<00:04:11.160> exactly<00:04:11.489> the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
another DS game that was exactly the

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.050 
another DS game that was exactly the
same<00:04:12.769> price<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.190> they<00:04:14.489> didn't<00:04:14.700> have<00:04:14.819> a<00:04:14.850> whole

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
same price and they didn't have a whole

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.120 
same price and they didn't have a whole
lot<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.299> selection<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.380> wound<00:04:16.650> up<00:04:16.769> with<00:04:16.950> this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
lot of selection so I wound up with this

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.129 
lot of selection so I wound up with this
which<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.820> really<00:04:18.120> isn't<00:04:18.389> a<00:04:18.450> great<00:04:18.570> game<00:04:18.870> it's

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
which it really isn't a great game it's

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.719 
which it really isn't a great game it's
probably<00:04:19.409> the<00:04:19.530> worst<00:04:19.709> game<00:04:19.919> on<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.220> DS<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.669> I

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
probably the worst game on the DS that I

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.510 
probably the worst game on the DS that I
have<00:04:20.970> it's<00:04:21.930> not<00:04:22.019> terrible<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:22.680> it's<00:04:23.280> really

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
have it's not terrible but it's really

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.400 
have it's not terrible but it's really
like

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
like

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.360 
like
it's<00:04:25.310> not<00:04:25.460> that<00:04:25.640> great<00:04:26.920> if<00:04:27.920> I<00:04:28.040> can<00:04:28.190> play

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
it's not that great if I can play

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.780 
it's not that great if I can play
through<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:29.170> here's<00:04:30.170> mario<00:04:30.890> kart<00:04:31.160> DS<00:04:31.340> and

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
through it here's mario kart DS and

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.640 
through it here's mario kart DS and
despite<00:04:32.120> having<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.480> really<00:04:32.690> uninspired<00:04:33.050> cover

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
despite having a really uninspired cover

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.370 
despite having a really uninspired cover
this<00:04:34.310> is<00:04:34.550> probably<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.330> best<00:04:35.600> mario<00:04:36.050> kart

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
this is probably the best mario kart

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.730 
this is probably the best mario kart
game<00:04:37.310> out<00:04:37.580> there<00:04:38.020> so<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.050> says<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.710> lot

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
game I was a big fan of the first

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.520 
game I was a big fan of the first
Yoshi's<00:04:50.180> Island<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.630> only<00:04:51.230> played<00:04:51.500> about

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
Yoshi's Island I only played about

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.900 
Yoshi's Island I only played about
halfway<00:04:51.860> through<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:52.460> then<00:04:52.580> I<00:04:52.610> stopped

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
halfway through it and then I stopped

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.400 
halfway through it and then I stopped
because<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.300> was<00:04:53.420> playing<00:04:53.690> other<00:04:53.840> things<00:04:54.170> but<00:04:54.350> I

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
because I was playing other things but I

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.090 
because I was playing other things but I
really<00:04:54.880> want<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:55.910> go<00:04:56.000> back<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.420> I<00:04:57.100> think

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.550 
really want to go back to that I think

this is the only one that i have in one

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.350 
this is the only one that i have in one
of<00:05:00.590> those<00:05:00.710> horrible<00:05:01.100> generic<00:05:01.730> game<00:05:02.030> stock

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360

disguise they didn't have it in a
regular<00:05:06.170> case<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:06.650> really<00:05:06.890> did<00:05:07.040> want<00:05:07.220> the

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
regular case and I really did want the

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.030 
regular case and I really did want the
game<00:05:08.090> because<00:05:08.300> I'm<00:05:08.390> a<00:05:08.450> big<00:05:08.630> fan<00:05:08.840> of<00:05:08.870> Wario<00:05:09.350> this

game because I'm a big fan of Wario this
game<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.520> not<00:05:10.760> really<00:05:11.150> a<00:05:11.180> typical<00:05:11.630> Wario<00:05:11.930> game

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
game is not really a typical Wario game

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.210 
game is not really a typical Wario game
it's<00:05:13.870> well<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:14.960> is<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.080> focus<00:05:15.470> on<00:05:15.620> platforming

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220

somewhat and puzzles a lot there's a lot
more<00:05:18.740> puzzles<00:05:19.280> than<00:05:19.400> platforming<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.210> the

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
more puzzles than platforming and the

more puzzles than platforming and the
puzzles<00:05:20.630> are<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.900> very<00:05:20.930> different<00:05:21.620> nature

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
puzzles are of a very different nature

puzzles are of a very different nature
but<00:05:23.300> it's<00:05:23.540> still<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.750> fun<00:05:23.840> game<00:05:25.180> this<00:05:26.180> is

one of the one of the first three games

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
which I'll get to in a bit this is

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.909 
which I'll get to in a bit this is
populace<00:05:49.400> this<00:05:49.760> is<00:05:49.940> a<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.930> only<00:05:51.230> game<00:05:51.620> for<00:05:51.860> the

DS that I picked up blind meaning that I

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.850 
DS that I picked up blind meaning that I
hadn't<00:05:55.270> read<00:05:56.270> any<00:05:56.330> reviews<00:05:56.510> or<00:05:56.810> even<00:05:57.350> seen<00:05:57.680> the

hadn't read any reviews or even seen the

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.880 
hadn't read any reviews or even seen the

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
game but I had populous on the Super NES

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.560 
game but I had populous on the Super NES
and<00:06:01.070> I<00:06:01.310> absolutely<00:06:01.460> love<00:06:02.090> that<00:06:02.120> it's<00:06:02.390> one<00:06:02.510> of

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
and I absolutely love that it's one of

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.810 
and I absolutely love that it's one of
the<00:06:02.630> most<00:06:02.690> underrated<00:06:03.110> games<00:06:03.620> of<00:06:03.830> all<00:06:03.919> time<00:06:04.160> if

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
the most underrated games of all time if

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.870 
the most underrated games of all time if
you<00:06:05.000> like<00:06:05.150> Sims<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.860> I<00:06:07.130> mean<00:06:07.280> the<00:06:07.370> game<00:06:07.520> sims

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
you like Sims and I mean the game sims

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.870 
you like Sims and I mean the game sims
but<00:06:08.120> simulation<00:06:08.780> games<00:06:09.110> this<00:06:10.100> is<00:06:10.340> probably

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
but simulation games this is probably

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.090 
but simulation games this is probably
one<00:06:11.300> of<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:11.450> most<00:06:11.570> fun<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:12.169> engaging<00:06:12.380> one<00:06:12.890> out

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
one of the most fun and engaging one out

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.940 
one of the most fun and engaging one out
there<00:06:13.600> and<00:06:14.600> this<00:06:14.900> is<00:06:15.110> probably<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:15.650> best

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
there and this is probably the best

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.860 
there and this is probably the best
version<00:06:16.340> of<00:06:16.730> populist<00:06:17.330> that<00:06:17.510> I've<00:06:17.630> played

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
version of populist that I've played

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.170 
version of populist that I've played
even<00:06:18.470> though<00:06:18.860> i<00:06:19.070> tend<00:06:19.430> to<00:06:19.490> actually<00:06:20.000> like

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
even though i tend to actually like

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.630 
even though i tend to actually like
playing<00:06:20.510> with<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:21.020> classic<00:06:21.800> style<00:06:22.190> controls

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
playing with the classic style controls

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.790 
playing with the classic style controls
more<00:06:23.600> than<00:06:23.870> the<00:06:23.960> touch<00:06:24.140> screen<00:06:24.320> I<00:06:24.500> very<00:06:24.770> rarely

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
more than the touch screen I very rarely

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.590 
more than the touch screen I very rarely
use<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.550> touchscreen<00:06:25.760> only<00:06:26.150> for<00:06:26.330> certain

use the touchscreen only for certain

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.980 
use the touchscreen only for certain
things<00:06:26.860> like<00:06:27.860> clicking<00:06:28.100> the<00:06:28.310> icons<00:06:28.760> but<00:06:29.660> that

things like clicking the icons but that

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.650 
things like clicking the icons but that

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
being said this is a great one I can't

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.959
