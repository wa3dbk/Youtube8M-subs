database<00:00:23.029> 3<00:00:26.000> let's<00:00:27.000> create<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.300> new<00:00:27.330> table<00:00:28.910> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
database 3 let's create a new table and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.450 
database 3 let's create a new table and
an<00:00:30.119> ID<00:00:30.300> field<00:00:30.740> that<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> auto<00:00:32.309> number

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
an ID field that is of the auto number

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.790 
an ID field that is of the auto number
type<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.780> way<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.200> will<00:00:34.290> automatically

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
type this way it will automatically

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190 
type this way it will automatically
increase<00:00:35.070> its<00:00:35.280> number<00:00:35.660> right<00:00:36.660> click<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.989> ID

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
increase its number right click on ID

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.459 
increase its number right click on ID
and<00:00:37.680> make<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> primary<00:00:38.340> key<00:00:39.079> now<00:00:40.079> let's<00:00:40.320> add
