00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
because normally if I had four lands and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.050 
because normally if I had four lands and
I<00:01:55.259> hadn't<00:01:55.560> drawn<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.040> yet<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.759> would<00:01:56.880> say

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I hadn't drawn one yet then I would say

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.310 
I hadn't drawn one yet then I would say
all<00:01:57.240> right<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.509> I'm<00:01:57.630> gonna<00:01:57.780> draw<00:01:57.960> two<00:01:58.020> cards

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and there's a good chance that I can

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.830 
and there's a good chance that I can
draw<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> land<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.090> there<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:00.509> I'll<00:02:00.630> play

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
draw a land in there and then I'll play

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.270 
draw a land in there and then I'll play
the<00:02:00.990> land<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> play<00:02:01.860> crowby<00:02:02.159> and

being<00:03:05.720> at<00:03:05.900> 16<00:03:06.349> plus<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.950> know<00:03:07.340> he<00:03:07.549> has<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> lot<00:03:07.790> of

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
being at 16 plus I know he has a lot of

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.879 
being at 16 plus I know he has a lot of
creatures<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.389> deck<00:03:08.659> so<00:03:09.049> he<00:03:09.349> could<00:03:09.680> easily

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
creatures in the deck so he could easily

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.890 
creatures in the deck so he could easily
blocked<00:03:10.310> though<00:03:10.609> four<00:03:11.120> or<00:03:11.209> five<00:03:11.359> just

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
blocked though four or five just

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.210 
blocked though four or five just
blocking<00:03:12.170> would<00:03:12.590> probably<00:03:12.950> kill<00:03:13.129> his

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
blocking would probably kill his

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.979 
blocking would probably kill his
creature<00:03:13.459> until<00:03:14.269> it<00:03:14.389> gets<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.569> lot<00:03:14.690> stronger

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
creature until it gets a lot stronger

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.479 
creature until it gets a lot stronger
with<00:03:15.260> steel<00:03:15.440> overseer<00:03:15.919> which<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:16.310> gonna

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
with steel overseer which is gonna

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.069 
with steel overseer which is gonna
happen<00:03:16.639> eventually<00:03:16.849> alright<00:03:17.569> dispensers

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
happen eventually alright dispensers

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.569
