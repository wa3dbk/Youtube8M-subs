00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 wow welcome to annie dani's guide 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.170
 it's a partridge that has a lot of damage and if 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.420
 a stud is played well and a lot of damage 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.460
 area is also going to be very tank and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.740
 annie is a leg cutter so have 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.929
 Be very careful with no dra oriana be old 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.060
 and brand also morgan to measure a 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.949
 hell of line because for your shield 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.230
 no we'll never knock down and neither 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.029
 we will be able to study first 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 let's know a little better this 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.260
 small the passive after using four 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.960
 skills the next skill 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.790
 study what is a ball of fire and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.800
 if it kills the enemy it will not consume mana and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 the cool down is cut in half this 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.870
 we will be very very useful to train in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.090
 line and to load the study not the w is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.399
 a damage in area like that resistance 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.559
 magic and armor and the enemies that you 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.410
 attack with basic attacks will receive 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.629
 damage mana cost is very very low so 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.149
 that will allow us to load the passive and the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.829
 ultimate we invoke you bears is a 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.070
 screenshot and it will do a lot of damage 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.289
 where it has been invoked to handle well when 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.329
 use this skill and when it's not the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.400
 key to getting good at cni and winning 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 or lose a team fight the order in the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 that maximizes the skills 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.189
 on the screen uploading lagun will help us 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.380
 lot especially to support online 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.659
 level 3 is not necessary yet the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.880
 shield in runes I wear marks of 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.759
 magic penetration stamps of life or 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.740
 armor glyphs of magic resistance and 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.360
 fifths of ability power I've seen 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.979
 people who carry power types of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.720
 skill and speed fifths 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.670
 and that annie movements is very slow 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.179
 but it does not convince me much since I 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.399
 like 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.110
 anita here of masters I take the one of man 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.689
 more back than for 90 percent the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.100
 ap karim and also configurations though 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.619
 which I like the best and the best 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.959
 results gives me is this now let's go 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.819
 with the wheel we will start with doran more 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.380
 two positions of life and we will have to 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.780
 then choose between the bar of the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.030
 ages or the pincer of death ignia to me 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.470
 I like the stranded ages more but if 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.689
 you want to do more damage the pincer 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.459
 death and genius is your item we 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.590
 we will finish the boots and go to 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.500
 zone since it will give us pe and armor 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.599
 in addition to its active bright after 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.909
 we will go to put the ball and the cane of 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.649
 empty to get really hurt and the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.239
 last object depends on how the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.000
 You can catch us the cane 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.470
 abyssal without magical resistance the king if 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.270
 you need to really live 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.850
 and andré if you want to have more 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.560
 magic penetration even an angel 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.630
 guardian is not a bad idea if your 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.370
 team endures a lot even though I do not 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.830
 ends up liking since with the rod the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.990
 ages and another defensive attempt more in 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.150
 sonia ya is enough to hold 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.070
 everything you have to put up with and more and 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.170
 you have to remember that this build is 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.120
 a mere guide everything depends on how you go 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.980
 the game for example if you are against 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.350
 a beijing online and you want to start 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.670
 in the area is not a bad idea or if you are 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.740
 against a grain and you want to start with 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.420
 boots and two positions are also very 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.970
 well since they have a lot of area and you can 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.590
 escape from sw you have to catch them and 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.180
 you have what you need according to the game 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.220
 but these are usually the most 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.740
 most of the cases work now 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.570
 let's see how they will play and in the phase lines 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.880
 we will focus on farmar this is going to 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.440
 be very easy thanks to upload use that 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.780
 powerful to get it for free 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.160
 try not to fail the two that you will see 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.870
 week in zero coma 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.520
 another very important factor of annie is 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.770
 what will our enemy do if we have the 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.420
 stunam we will use the cv to study it and 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.490
 this will also allow us to put 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.580
 the wy well we can make a great 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.260
 damage but it's very very very important that 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.340
 Sometimes you give him only the one you have 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.810
 the study no no 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.030
 and remember that we are not maximizing 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.340
 so if we only do it like 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.410
 q w the the the w going to spend lots 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.840
 manna and will not do as much damage as 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.340
 So, do not forget to put him sometimes 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.830
 q only will you sit without 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.840
 try not to put the line under your tower 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.489
 because you have a great range both with 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.650
 hacu as with the basics and you can 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.599
 deny him a lot farm to the contrary to 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.000
 I can not get this cup once 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.650
 the combo of the q w because always 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.269
 is to take by sack and can not form 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.190
 nothing the only thing that pharma is with the 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.349
 puddle of invisibility and the cv 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.450
 that is in the complete shit in the 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.040
 line conan and there are two problems the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.140
 First, there are a lot of people who 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.299
 one that gets this does not go back to using 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.970
 the ocu to inform the Qur'an and the 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.260
 less to me it seems very very difficult and 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.269
 other times that for example you are 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.829
 putting the line under tower as you have 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.480
 what to put in which the minions and 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.400
 you lose the stud of the same as the stud 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.680
 get back in nothing do not be 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.599
 rats when losing stun use the guilt of 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.970
 carry you have this one not clearly 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.010
 if you can give the opposite to give but 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.320
 if you have this celestun please do not 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.600
 keep it to infinity use it 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.130
 even for the 7th and finally the 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.090
 Annie's second problem is her little 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.650
 mobility one 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.630
 stay burned the flash is very easy 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.770
 that you rangel so put a ratchet 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.750
 the shrubs from the left to the 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.220
 right and tend to be on that side of 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.070
 the street that you have to do it with 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.360
 any mic in the guaraní state what 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.479
 ideal is that you should have given is that 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.040
 do the combo of the r1 ywy when 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.570
 begin to hit you use it efe 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.160
 we will start with tibet since 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.780
 we will get a stand in area and although 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.490
 let's go for a single goal is better 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.199
 do it with the last one what if 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.490
 we do with the puc can flash use 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.990
 any mechanics to get out of the 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.490
 ink and this will not allow us 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.320
 put all the combo or that our 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.030
 allies kill him in addition to any 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.800
 goal that we put the combo plus the 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.600
 it was limited battle we are going to 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.919
 ensure that he will die or at least he will 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.930
 to get fucked up and will not be able to 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.370
 fight in that time you have to have a lot 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.960
 beware of the tonics since they can 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.690
 dodge the last and I spent many 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.400
 Sometimes I find them very special so it's 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.290
 good publicity and it is a serious mistake 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.600
 because we are going to be able to use everything 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.430
 the combo yes or yes and when we start to 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.200
 paste what we will do is use it to 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.760
 hurt them and we're going to 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.560
 get us resistance armors 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.090
 magical and when you are halfway through life 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.410
 are going to put a shield or is that 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.600
 many people conglomerate to your 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.960
 around and california this will make it 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.300
 I'm waiting for you to go to the area 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.770
 and this team is going to be able to kill them and 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.930
 equally once you leave the zone 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.970
 and we will have the cv and w of 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.310
 new so it will allow us to do 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.220
 another great damage and if they kill us after having 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.900
 done all this was worth it and for 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.250
 finalize the guide I leave a link in case 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.900
 you want to see the whole live which is 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.639
 removed the annie guide is a game 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.380
 boot I hope you liked the 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.120
 I encourage you to try my advice 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.220
 and tell me how it has gone in the 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.449
 comments if you want to leave your there 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.099
