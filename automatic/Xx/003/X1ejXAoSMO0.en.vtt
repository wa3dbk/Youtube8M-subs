 simpara short you will not see 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.239
 a test we will do an unpacking 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.790
 since finally came the Rumanians a 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.230
 so we have a good double cd version 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.090
 then me where it's a bit complicated 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.340
 what the luron will do to me will be declined 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.430
 in three versions a scdma td version 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.160
 for china mobile a cdma version a 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.720
 w cdma version and apparently seen this 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.250
 we saw on the internet it will not be all 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.690
 the same and it may be a small 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.670
 uncomplicated then for us what is it 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.310
 which tells us then there are 1 4 cores 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.200
 in 4 x 1 giga 6 while we have seen by 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.060
 example on their site that we had 1 4 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.449
 cores a five- year-old media library and the 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.360
 no actually it's a msm pouring ewc 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.060
 me so it's a giga plus am giga of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.250
 rome near pretty phone we will do 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.750
 opening the box all together 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.149
 as if you come from flat cowardice 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.100
 like that with that little smell should 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:23.170
 the made in china made it speak small 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:27.960
 eight-year-old daughter not nine years old at the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.960
 trash here we unpack the phone 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.380
 here is the animal here with the box 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.030
 there then well it's the same it's even 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.299
 that the other inevitably you expected to 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.460
 what 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.270
 and yes it's still a romy then 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.799
 here we will take a point to take the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.960
 homeland I make you a little bit 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.460
 also the battery so we have a 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.770
 usb cable a mains charger with plug 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.420
 we talk to each other in the shop 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.369
 after auchan charm adapter france and 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 us but then in fact in the box 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.659
 who has nothing to do with it 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.039
 dac 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:12.620
 we'll take out the drums here we open the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.939
 have put a s here to realize 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.260
 that ben is still it's still 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.040
 just a little bit the same thing we 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.709
 always had a version that is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.299
 double cdma here our location map 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.430
 sim 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:27.769
 we will put our sim card here or 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.720
 black heart sims and the sim card the 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.500
 micro sd she's jelly tease so much 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:38.269
 that the girl that print on it and 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.409
 she disappeared but that with distance 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:51.019
 like that it's not easy here 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:52.819
 dac and that's so low that wants 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.310
 to say it's just an evolution of the 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.750
 hard put one when we had already seen a 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.599
 little previously case it is an evolution 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.650
 version 1 s where we're supposed to have 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.419
 things that are a little bit better so 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.419
 finally the start we will see a small 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:07.010
 little what that gives hoping maybe 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.859
 that rare there he will start on the rom 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.049
 Original English to Chinese dress 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.340
 hoping that the rom we do not know if 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.900
 stirred France will work on this 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.040
 model there unfortunately I have not 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.659
 to move on it because after 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.199
 maybe something that are 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.400
 different 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:24.319
 it might not be the same 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:29.090
 thing then with the google keyboard here 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:37.510
 the fifi so here we are then we have the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:41.299
 keyboard so then the password 186 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.829
 166.8 up 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.319
 if I'm not mistaken it's not bad 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.750
 next 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:52.370
 they ask me then to access 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.510
 fout and sim card is not there qatar 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.340
 congratulation 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.680
 so here we can start so we 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.079
 is on a low version of the year at 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.340
 Rome to show and that right now 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.560
 here it is marked that it is safe from 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.810
 4.3 so we find exactly what we 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.419
 could see us before on others 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.200
 others are looking here so if we take 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.640
 miclo half credit 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.739
 in general it's in what for 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.480
 find that about the phone here 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.190

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.970
 here then we will stop the device here 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.570

 8 million and 1.3 yesterday 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:07.510
 so here with a 2.2 focus the battery 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.910
 loes the gps and the accessories you 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.450
 to make a little doggie and then that will be enough 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.740
 for today 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.480
 we will put it all in accelerated 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.670
 will be enough for this small unpacking 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.780
 in my opinion I will not hold up 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.580
 Sunday I planned to put Sunday 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.210
 unpacking but I will not hold I 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.280
 would not be strong enough then I would you 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.590
 put most certainly and it's up to me to 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.970
 Friday afternoon for unpacking on 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.920
 you would have nothing Sunday and you 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.360
 will do the test for Monday it looked like a 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.680
 little bit this frame there are pictures of 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.290
 videos but you will find 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.300
 much the same as theirs 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.460
 have put their basic trouble if not 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.780
 apparently a processor that is a bit 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.350
 different and everything after I do not know 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.240
 perfectly 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.710
 the old model but they do not have 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.180
 changed big thing go we put it all 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.180
 in accelerated with regard to fire the score 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:00.670
 so here we are for the score then a 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.430
 score from 21 to 1440 it's not deueueu I 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.170
 do not look for me that it is not deueueu 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.020
 morning 1440 so it's above a 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.160
 host from below a htc one who are 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.600
 still a lot more phones 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.390
 swift and certainly a lot more 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.130
 dear so here is a score that equated who 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.270
 is not ugly naughty but here it is 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.020
 these Chinese rules paul paul the blood 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.790
 wright blue is that you have to test 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.670
