thought<00:03:09.579> this<00:03:09.669> would<00:03:09.790> be<00:03:09.879> kind<00:03:10.060> of

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
thought this would be kind of

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.489 
thought this would be kind of
complicated<00:03:10.510> when<00:03:10.689> I<00:03:10.750> first<00:03:10.989> got<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.260> chair

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:11.499 
complicated when I first got the chair

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.080 
complicated when I first got the chair
but<00:03:11.799> it's<00:03:12.040> been<00:03:12.219> pretty<00:03:12.430> easy<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.969> you<00:03:13.060> just

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
but it's been pretty easy and you just

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.849 
but it's been pretty easy and you just
click<00:03:13.389> them<00:03:13.540> right<00:03:13.749> away<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:14.169> mean<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.709> think

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
click them right away I mean to think

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:15.869 
click them right away I mean to think
about<00:03:15.099> it<00:03:15.189> and<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.310> don't<00:03:15.370> even<00:03:15.549> need<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.760> look

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
about it and I don't even need to look
