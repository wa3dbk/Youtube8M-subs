00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:33.320
 Isidro in Madrid is festive and comes 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.750

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.890
 I eat it as I prepare it 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.350
 table and all those little details is worth and 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.269
 I hope you like it so we're not going to 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.920
 start with all the little things that I have 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.149
 what to do bird bunch good I'm going to 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.339
 teach first what I have put on 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.269
 It's super simple and comfortable to be 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.739
 at home 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.140
 good as you see I have picked this blouse 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.760
 pink that if you follow me a long time ago the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.710
 I've put in a thousand times because I'm from 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.569
 which I repeat the model logically to 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.539
 I do not have the budget to carry 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.159
 every day one thing I'm honest and nothing 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.900
 I have put on this bag of thirst and is 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.970
 that I love I love the color and I 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.430
 love the fabric then some cowherd boys 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.409
 whites and some heels that 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.290
 You will also have seen me more times than 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.750
 They are super comfortable 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.610
 to these fashions but if the first thing that 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.050
 I always do is set the table because a 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.880
 Once I set the table I'm staying 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.010
 I'm already calm with food and 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.900
 then the rush does not come because to me 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.420
 the table I like to put it there in plan with 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.130
 nice detail and plan and good as 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.930
 We are looking at the table as I have it 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.560
 usually because I already show you a 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.990
 gossip that you see there is me with my 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.970
 wedding dress was so dressed that is 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.790
 my husband logically if it's my day 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.440
 wedding and nothing blogs total blog and one 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.509
 of the most important days of my life 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.690
 no doubt and this is the result of the 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.690
 I put it very simple table with two 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.580
 candles and good as you see like that with 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.560
 little details and such and then I'll move on to 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.840
 put the things that we are going to eat that 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.910
 then he showed them to you I always put a 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.500
 Orchid is in this case it is artificial 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.690
 many times I make it natural if the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.490
 I have and I love hairpins 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.360
 and I think they dress the table a lot 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:15.500
 so there you see that way of napkins like that 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.060
 that are super cute as flowers 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.290
 the candles 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.050
 the orchid 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.450
 and good 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.070
 a simple table to receive the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.170
 family that also deserves hey what 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.000
 I'm not going to do it, I'm going to start 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.190
 prepare some snacks like 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.530
 You see here, I have empanada, I have very 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.600
 duck potato chips salads 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.150
 Brass tomatoes and good variety of 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.070
 little things that I usually put as first 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.780
 salad I usually buy soil 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.640
 buy a bag of this type that 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.120
 comes in variety today I have chosen this 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.020
 that come several outbreaks of different 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.330
 types of lettuce and I've made some 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.750
 cherry tomatoes a little bit of 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.750
 there 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.330
 It always seems to me that there is a lot 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.330
 best 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.870
 and that we leave it like this and then dress 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.000
 in the seasoning what I'm going to use is going to 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.210
 be a little bit of virgin olive oil 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.950
 extra a little bit of Modena oil and 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.410
 later to pardon of modena vinegar 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.960
 I always use the modena vinegar because 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.020
 is the one I like the most, we take a 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.250
 trickle 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.050
 and a little salt 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.070
 except a lot because then we can 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:40.800
 rectify a little bit of cum i have 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.630
 made in powder and some flax seeds 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.820
 everything you see how it looks like that and 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.530
 what I do the dressing I only put it 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.510
 when I'm going to serve the salad 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.880
 because if we put it before the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.130
 Then he left her ready for 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.410
 He left like that when we're going to eat overturned 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.890
 the line the new ones and it's already perfect 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.890
 to eat 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.879
 and now what I'm going to do is 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.879
 salt the chicken 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.540
 also potatoes and carrots 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.260
 we will leave I have pepper appointment yo 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.729
 I use this grinder that comes a 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.370
 potpourri come in all colors 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.889
 comes white red green black and the 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.400
 We spent a lot of time I do not know if you know a 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.650
 trick that if pepper the carriages and 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.810
 that at the moment they do not sting so much is not 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.169
 as spicy as if you do it 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.380
 if it is already pixie is already ground then 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.200
 as they are 6 we are going to place them in such 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.530
 way that everyone enters so that 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.330
 do perfectly well and now what 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.300
 I 'm going to do I 'm going to put a little bit of 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.600
 chicken broth I'll water them with the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.040
 caldito 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.040
 and then I'm going to line them up 

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:05.479
 and I always put them on the skin 

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:07.369
 over so that it stays toast and 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.799
 Crunchy is always worth it or as well 

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:12.529
 bet though then the skin almost 

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:14.389
 no new we really eat but yes 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.859
 the Rosadita and crisp as it does 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.019
 maybe a bit, then you can 

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:19.080
 eat and then the rest is left for 

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:22.430
 nothing 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.430
 we put it all up 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.890
 and it's good to add a little garlic in 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.930
 powdered cheese powder powder what can you 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.030
 do also if you want natural garlic 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.920
 but I like this one more because it stays 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.780
 very crispy and does not burn as much as 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.160
 the other but with the normal also 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.620
 it would be good 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.650
 and a little parsley if you have fresh 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.290
 better what happens that I did not have fresh 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.690
 I'm going to add a little bit of herbs 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.480
 Provencal are these preparations that 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.890
 come to put in bags and I in this 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.780
 case instead of in a bag I will put 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.160
 nothing a little above so that you 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.350
 give a little bit of flavor 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.000
 I put it very little because they tend to 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.920
 apply a tad and as I have already put 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.590
 I do not want to pepper 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.450
 too much but it gives ball over it 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.710
 I'm going to put a little bit of virgin oil 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:15.230
 extra olive of course and you're 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.210
 prepared ready for the truth 215 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.010
 my oven is good air is several 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.470
 you can put several modalities yo 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.200
 I always use air convention 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:27.260
 because I think it prepares the food 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.630
 much better I'll put it in and nothing and what 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.610
 I leave like half an hour to 24 hours I 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.210
 I'm seeing and when I see that the skin 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.250
 it's toasty because I already got it out more 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.750
 or less then it is a half hour is fourth 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.240
 of when you see that it is already going 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.610
 roasting the good because already on the plate and 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.880
 it's finished now I'm going to take it out and 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.680
 let's serve it look what cool and is 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.750
 terrific is a super simple dish and 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.320
 great and now what I told you 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.810
 salad dressing now right now 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.560
 let's serve 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.560
 one teaspoon 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.440
 I put a little better not to spend 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.320
 because it is a child that when carrying 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.330
 food and take balsamic vinegar is 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.700
 strong and then we move it and as 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.280
 I tried people if they like we let them 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.200
 nothing if you liked a like like a 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.350
 house please and nothing that we see in 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.350
 the next
