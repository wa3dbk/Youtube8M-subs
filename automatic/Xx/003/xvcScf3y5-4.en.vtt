00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Today's performance is about 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 the fashion inventor tricks with that 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:17.220
 sort boxes and your inventory 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:19.260
 much easier so we do that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.960
 functionally the murder is like that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.269
 whole works exactly we open only 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.029
 times empty gate and lakes first up here 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 we push four buttons if we do not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.900
 Just know what to spend with me 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.000
 times teenagers so indiscriminate 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.950
 but that will not bring us there 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.649
 These buttons are meant to be sent to the transmitter 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.570
 andi was with us once when we were up 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.520
 center the standard sorting by 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.899
 are sorted by staad casual 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.309
 and if we do it here on the columns 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.079
 then yes, during your series sorted or 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.120
 then be sorted into lines 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.239
 the here in the sign from above to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 below can always demonstrate 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:04.110
 and this button is a run in which he 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.110
 also to many options and although can 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.790
 For example , let's say that we have the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.780
 Tighten armor automatically 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.360
 and that is what I have activated 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.770
 When we say the armor 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.240
 and here we come to one 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.670
 next point if we use space 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.830
 hold down and then one 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.549
 left click on one of the items from the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.490
 No matter what we get 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.869
 all items in the inventory 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.240
 so now you see I have the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.159
 armor laid out here and if now 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.159
 if you ship back 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.280
 There the troop is the line again 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:49.680
 with peace and that was a small mistake 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.090
 I thought so say's 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.979
 a little bit buggy so that's one 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.500
 not packed so why not 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.210
 retirement pension are definitely can 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.180
 the I did not just 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.310
 demonstrate the armor heart with shift 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.380
 off on and off so if I am the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.520
 ship again same way on the side 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.989
 Do you look so the armor so 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.090
 is it easier gathers often enough 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.830
 made in turn happy and if you 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.390
 crushed 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.520
 and this automatic armor 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.800
 he has activated 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.720
 automatically everything automatically now 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.310
 the whole armor 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.770
 and if you have several pieces of armor 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.830
 Implant automatically the best 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.960
 So you take the motive land yes me 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.830
 wants to go yes building material 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.520
 if I somehow something in life 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.730
 have the crushed and scattered 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.370
 crushed to sort the like this 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.500
 So there is also inventory here 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.880
 possible 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.920
 and that's the way it is 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.120
 basic of mod which i also as well 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.690
 because you can still use a few 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.510
 still small things with adjust 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.400
 he always wants to take things 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.140
 Watching yourself, but they are 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.290
 important things the skip mirjam ott 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.860
 and we come to installation-wise 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.250
 in not the mode and the files 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.170
 the motto that is according to the model or 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.570
 and someone down and looks in 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.940
 case of the tenne in minecraft clear and 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.130
 if the minecraft did not report it 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.690
 he would have the media impression because of 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.519
 driver modeling from minecraft yes 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.340
