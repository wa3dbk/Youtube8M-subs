00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
of thinking i'll probably be for the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.330 
of thinking i'll probably be for the
opening<00:00:36.270> cutscene<00:00:36.510> they'll<00:00:37.469> Content<00:00:38.160> ID

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
opening cutscene they'll Content ID

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.639 
opening cutscene they'll Content ID
match<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.120> i<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:39.899> willing<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.230> take<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
match it and i was willing to take the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.410 
match it and i was willing to take the
head<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:41.579> too<00:00:41.730> important<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.300> me

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
head it's not too important to me

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.360 
head it's not too important to me
content<00:00:42.809> ID<00:00:42.930> match<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.890> kind<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.219> fine

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
content ID match and I'm kind of fine

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.000 
content ID match and I'm kind of fine
with<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.200> what<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.230> means<00:00:46.530> based<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
with that and what that means based it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.290 
with that and what that means based it
would<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.399> Warner<00:00:47.700> Brothers<00:00:47.969> would<00:00:48.149> then

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
would be that Warner Brothers would then

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
probably be for the first video for the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
probably be for the first video for the
first<00:00:58.829> opening<00:00:59.190> cutscene<00:00:59.809> purportedly<00:01:00.859> with

first opening cutscene purportedly with

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.590 
first opening cutscene purportedly with
people<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.430> Jim<00:01:02.670> sterling<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.180> Mathis

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
people like see Jim sterling in Mathis

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780 
people like see Jim sterling in Mathis
and<00:01:03.809> they've<00:01:04.619> said<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.129> future<00:01:05.460> videos

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and they've said that that future videos

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
and they've said that that future videos
the<00:01:06.030> episodes<00:01:06.600> two<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.960> three<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.409> on

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the episodes two and three and so on

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
the episodes two and three and so on
what<00:01:08.040> also<00:01:08.189> content<00:01:08.760> match<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.240> seems<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
what also content match then it seems to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.969 
what also content match then it seems to
be<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> case<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.080> throughout<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> game<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
be the case that throughout the game the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530 
be the case that throughout the game the
cutscenes<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.030> been<00:01:12.180> put<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
cutscenes have all been put in the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
cutscenes have all been put in the
content<00:01:12.869> ID<00:01:13.020> system<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.650> means<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.860> men

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
content ID system so it means that men

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.609 
content ID system so it means that men
would<00:01:14.250> get<00:01:14.400> matched<00:01:14.610> also<00:01:15.259> usually<00:01:16.259> that's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
would get matched also usually that's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
would get matched also usually that's
not<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:16.920> much<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> big<00:01:17.340> deal<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.640> I'll<00:01:17.970> bubble

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
not so much of a big deal or I'll bubble

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.719 
not so much of a big deal or I'll bubble
