teammate actually killed me by blowing
up<00:00:24.150> some<00:00:24.269> explosives<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.820> had<00:00:27.359> some<00:00:27.599> kind

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
up some explosives so I had some kind

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.779 
up some explosives so I had some kind
words<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.650> share<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:28.980> him<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.550> sure

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
words to share with him that's for sure

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
words to share with him that's for sure
but<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.000> won't<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.300> putting<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.080> net<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.560> this

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
but I won't be putting that net in this

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.040 
but I won't be putting that net in this
video<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.430> because<00:00:32.489> they<00:00:32.880> were<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.630> little

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
video just because they were a little

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.910 
video just because they were a little
harsh<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.910> feel<00:00:36.149> warranted<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:37.110> anyway

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
harsh but I feel warranted but anyway

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.150 
harsh but I feel warranted but anyway
this<00:00:38.879> second<00:00:39.570> base<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.230> know<00:00:40.350> what<00:00:40.530> every

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
this second base you know what every

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.100 
this second base you know what every
single<00:00:41.460> base<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.850> map<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.090> tough<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
single base on this map is tough the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.440 
single base on this map is tough the
second<00:00:43.500> base<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.890> find<00:00:44.219> especially<00:00:44.940> difficult

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
second base I find especially difficult

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.810 
second base I find especially difficult
just<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.020> there's<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.100> mcom<00:00:47.520> on

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
just because there's that one mcom on

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.000 
just because there's that one mcom on
the<00:00:47.969> boat<00:00:48.270> which<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.410> super<00:00:49.800> awkward

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the boat which is just super awkward

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.750 
the boat which is just super awkward
because<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.550> boat<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.320> half<00:00:52.320> sunken<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
because the boat is half sunken and as a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.560 
because the boat is half sunken and as a
result<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:56.329> crooked<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
result it's kind of you know crooked and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
result it's kind of you know crooked and
off-kilter<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.800> makes<00:00:58.949> her<00:00:59.100> very

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
off-kilter and it just makes her very

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.170 
off-kilter and it just makes her very
awkward<00:00:59.879> battleground<00:01:01.489> thankfully<00:01:02.489> somebody

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
awkward battleground thankfully somebody

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.149 
awkward battleground thankfully somebody
else<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.660> team<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:04.140> able<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.619> pick<00:01:04.979> up<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
else on my team was able to pick up that

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.420 
else on my team was able to pick up that
great<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> never<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.470> had<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:08.040> after

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
great so I never really had to go after

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.270 
great so I never really had to go after
it<00:01:08.580> during<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.270> match<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.869> even<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.890> alpha

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it during this match but even this alpha

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
it during this match but even this alpha
crate<00:01:11.520> right<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:13.110> difficult<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
crate right here is very difficult to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
crate right here is very difficult to
take<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.909> because<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.479> become<00:01:15.720> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
take just because they can become so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.780 
take just because they can become so
entrenched<00:01:16.439> behind<00:01:17.130> these<00:01:17.340> concrete

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
entrenched behind these concrete

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
entrenched behind these concrete
barriers<00:01:18.270> behind<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.659> sand<00:01:18.930> bags<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
barriers behind the sand bags up in the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.190 
barriers behind the sand bags up in the
sniper<00:01:20.070> nests<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> shipping

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
sniper nests and then in the shipping

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.010 
sniper nests and then in the shipping
containers<00:01:22.770> right<00:01:23.009> behind<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> crane<00:01:24.020> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
containers right behind the crane so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.410 
containers right behind the crane so
it's<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.009> tough<00:01:26.220> crate<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.640> take<00:01:26.850> but

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it's a tough crate to take but

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
it's a tough crate to take but
thankfully<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.680> did<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.040> some

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
thankfully you know we did have some

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.880 
thankfully you know we did have some
good<00:01:29.670> players<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.420> some<00:01:31.020> aggressive<00:01:31.560> players

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
good players and some aggressive players

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.870 
good players and some aggressive players
on<00:01:32.220> my<00:01:32.250> team<00:01:32.689> to<00:01:33.689> push<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.729> really<00:01:35.729> that's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
on my team to push up and really that's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.499 
on my team to push up and really that's
the<00:01:36.119> key<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.460> teammates<00:01:38.460> who<00:01:38.970> like

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the key if you have teammates who like

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.870 
the key if you have teammates who like
to<00:01:39.540> sit<00:01:39.930> back<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.530> an<00:01:40.979> attacker<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.759> gonna

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
to sit back as an attacker you're gonna

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.149 
to sit back as an attacker you're gonna
have<00:01:42.299> trouble<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.110> about<00:01:43.200> every<00:01:43.649> map<00:01:43.860> in

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
have trouble on just about every map in

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.850 
have trouble on just about every map in
this<00:01:45.060> game<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.140> guess<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.680> how<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
this game and I guess that's how it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.490 
this game and I guess that's how it
should<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> same<00:01:48.210> time<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:49.200> so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
should be but at the same time it's so

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.200 
should be but at the same time it's so
difficult<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.100> find<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.579> team<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.820> actually

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
difficult to find a team that actually

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.560 
difficult to find a team that actually
is<00:01:51.720> aggressive<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:53.220> game<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.479> can

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
is aggressive in this game that it can

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.749

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
disadvantage when compared to people who

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.190 
disadvantage when compared to people who
just<00:03:41.010> sit<00:03:41.220> back<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.430> camp<00:03:41.850> in<00:03:42.600> dark<00:03:42.989> corners

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.460 
all over the map but yeah the down 12 is
probably<00:03:47.850> one<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.090> my<00:03:48.180> favorite<00:03:48.780> shotguns<00:03:49.290> in

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
probably one of my favorite shotguns in

probably one of my favorite shotguns in
the<00:03:49.769> game<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.190> liked<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.640> lot<00:03:50.790> during<00:03:51.000> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
beta I like it just as much in the final

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.710 
beta I like it just as much in the final
version<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.459> game<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.910> don't<00:03:57.209> think<00:03:57.480> they

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
version of the game I don't think they

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.880 
version of the game I don't think they
changed<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.850> from<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.030> beta<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:01.049> guess

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
changed it from the beta so I guess

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.039 
changed it from the beta so I guess
that's<00:04:02.070> good<00:04:02.280> news<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.760> don't<00:04:03.510> know<00:04:03.600> what<00:04:03.810> your

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
that's good news I don't know what your

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.340 
that's good news I don't know what your
guys's<00:04:04.380> experience<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.630> when<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.750> comes<00:04:06.959> to

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
guys's experience is when it comes to

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.740 
guys's experience is when it comes to
buck<00:04:07.920> shoppers<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.519> flechette<00:04:09.090> but<00:04:09.540> I

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
buck shoppers is flechette but I

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.300 
buck shoppers is flechette but I
honestly<00:04:10.200> don't<00:04:10.470> see

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
honestly don't see

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.089 
honestly don't see
any<00:04:11.940> benefit<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.630> using<00:04:12.870> buckshot<00:04:13.470> versus

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
any benefit to using buckshot versus

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.860 
any benefit to using buckshot versus
flechette<00:04:14.520> flechette<00:04:15.030> seems<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.599> be<00:04:15.690> better

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
flechette flechette seems to be better

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.159 
flechette flechette seems to be better
in<00:04:16.109> just<00:04:16.290> about<00:04:16.440> every<00:04:16.799> way<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.100> has<00:04:17.250> more

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
in just about every way it has more

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.750 
in just about every way it has more
penetration<00:04:19.169> in<00:04:19.590> terms<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.430> number<00:04:20.669> of

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
penetration in terms of the number of

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.270 
penetration in terms of the number of
bodies<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.570> materials<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.710> can<00:04:22.830> shoot

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
bodies and materials it can shoot

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.210 
bodies and materials it can shoot
through<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:24.389> I<00:04:24.930> don't<00:04:25.139> see<00:04:25.320> any<00:04:25.500> reduction<00:04:26.100> in

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
through and I don't see any reduction in

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.150 
through and I don't see any reduction in
range<00:04:26.490> or<00:04:26.880> or<00:04:27.450> damage<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.380> let<00:04:28.710> me<00:04:28.740> know<00:04:28.950> if

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
range or or damage but let me know if

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.710 
range or or damage but let me know if
you<00:04:29.280> have<00:04:29.430> any<00:04:29.610> hard<00:04:29.880> statistics<00:04:30.060> on<00:04:30.690> that

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
you have any hard statistics on that

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.420 
you have any hard statistics on that
stuff<00:04:31.639> but<00:04:32.639> yeah<00:04:33.450> this<00:04:34.020> final<00:04:34.320> crate<00:04:34.919> right

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
stuff but yeah this final crate right

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.970 
stuff but yeah this final crate right
here<00:04:35.790> is<00:04:36.000> just<00:04:36.600> ridiculous<00:04:38.930> if<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.470> remember

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
here is just ridiculous if you remember

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.850 
here is just ridiculous if you remember
this<00:04:41.010> kind<00:04:41.550> of<00:04:41.669> set<00:04:41.940> piece<00:04:42.210> it's<00:04:43.110> in<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.500> the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
this kind of set piece it's in the the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.800 
this kind of set piece it's in the the
co-op<00:04:44.160> campaign<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:44.700> know<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.210> for<00:04:45.360> sure<00:04:45.419> I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
co-op campaign I know that for sure I

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.570 
co-op campaign I know that for sure I
don't<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:46.110> haven't<00:04:46.470> reached<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.950> in<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.280> single

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
don't I haven't reached it in the single

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.920 
don't I haven't reached it in the single
player<00:04:47.669> but<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.000> think<00:04:48.300> it's<00:04:48.450> in<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.630> single

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
player but I think it's in a single

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.490 
player but I think it's in a single
player<00:04:49.080> as<00:04:49.260> well<00:04:49.490> but<00:04:50.490> it's<00:04:50.610> difficult<00:04:50.850> to

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
player as well but it's difficult to

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.860 
player as well but it's difficult to
assault<00:04:52.500> that's<00:04:52.889> for<00:04:53.100> sure<00:04:53.479> but<00:04:54.479> I<00:04:54.510> find<00:04:54.780> that

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
assault that's for sure but I find that

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.360 
assault that's for sure but I find that
going<00:04:55.200> through<00:04:55.350> these<00:04:55.500> windows<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:56.160> going

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
going through these windows and going

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.219 
going through these windows and going
through<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.550> back<00:04:56.760> entrance<00:04:57.229> definitely

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
through the back entrance definitely

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.710 
through the back entrance definitely
helps<00:04:58.530> because<00:04:59.490> they're<00:04:59.970> just<00:05:00.120> expecting<00:05:00.630> you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
helps because they're just expecting you

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.180 
helps because they're just expecting you
to<00:05:00.840> go<00:05:00.960> up<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.200> main<00:05:01.380> staircase<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:02.070> it

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
to go up that main staircase and it

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.719 
to go up that main staircase and it
becomes<00:05:02.400> an<00:05:02.880> absolute<00:05:03.479> bullet<00:05:04.200> hell<00:05:04.729> but

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
becomes an absolute bullet hell but

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.450 
becomes an absolute bullet hell but
behind<00:05:05.940> those<00:05:06.270> counters<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:07.050> always<00:05:07.979> a<00:05:08.010> tough

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
behind those counters is always a tough

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.330 
behind those counters is always a tough
spot<00:05:09.290> because<00:05:10.290> you<00:05:10.410> can't<00:05:10.770> see<00:05:10.950> them<00:05:11.100> at<00:05:11.190> all

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
spot because you can't see them at all

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.840 
spot because you can't see them at all
and<00:05:11.990> then<00:05:12.990> they<00:05:13.139> equip<00:05:13.520> flashlights<00:05:14.520> and<00:05:14.790> it

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
and then they equip flashlights and it

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.270 
and then they equip flashlights and it
becomes<00:05:15.060> even<00:05:15.330> more<00:05:15.360> impossible<00:05:15.919> but<00:05:16.919> this

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
becomes even more impossible but this

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.159 
becomes even more impossible but this
back<00:05:17.490> entrance<00:05:17.880> right<00:05:18.000> here<00:05:18.060> is<00:05:18.510> definitely

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
back entrance right here is definitely

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.040 
back entrance right here is definitely
handy<00:05:19.560> as<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:20.460> can<00:05:20.550> see<00:05:20.729> there<00:05:20.940> i<00:05:20.970> am<00:05:21.360> using<00:05:21.630> my

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
handy as you can see there i am using my

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.040 
handy as you can see there i am using my
radio<00:05:22.919> beacon<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.490> motion<00:05:23.789> sensor<00:05:24.150> extremely

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
radio beacon and motion sensor extremely

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.909 
radio beacon and motion sensor extremely
liberally<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:26.090> with<00:05:27.090> good<00:05:27.270> reason<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:28.620> radio

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
liberally and with good reason the radio

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.300 
liberally and with good reason the radio
beacon<00:05:29.570> especially<00:05:30.570> is<00:05:30.750> is<00:05:31.410> very<00:05:31.800> good<00:05:32.039> for

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
beacon especially is is very good for

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.190 
beacon especially is is very good for
rush<00:05:32.490> attack<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.740> if<00:05:34.760> you<00:05:35.760> find<00:05:36.150> a<00:05:36.600> weapon<00:05:36.900> in

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
rush attack and if you find a weapon in

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.350 
rush attack and if you find a weapon in
the<00:05:37.289> recons<00:05:37.650> arsenal<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:38.760> enjoy<00:05:39.030> using

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
the recons arsenal that you enjoy using

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.900 
the recons arsenal that you enjoy using
i<00:05:39.750> definitely<00:05:40.740> recommend<00:05:40.889> the<00:05:41.250> class<00:05:41.490> for

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
i definitely recommend the class for

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.719 
i definitely recommend the class for
rush<00:05:42.150> attack<00:05:43.100> but<00:05:44.100> if<00:05:44.190> you're<00:05:44.280> like<00:05:44.490> me<00:05:44.700> and

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
rush attack but if you're like me and

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.150 
rush attack but if you're like me and
you<00:05:44.910> find<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.300> difficult<00:05:45.450> to<00:05:45.840> settle<00:05:46.710> into<00:05:47.010> any

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
you find it difficult to settle into any

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.800 
you find it difficult to settle into any
of<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.370> weapons<00:05:47.669> at<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:47.880> Recon<00:05:48.180> class<00:05:48.450> then

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
of the weapons at the Recon class then

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.050 
of the weapons at the Recon class then
then<00:05:49.320> it<00:05:49.410> can<00:05:49.560> be<00:05:49.650> tough<00:05:49.860> but<00:05:50.250> yeah<00:05:50.700> that's<00:05:50.910> it

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
then it can be tough but yeah that's it

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.520 
then it can be tough but yeah that's it

did<00:05:52.710> cut<00:05:52.919> it<00:05:52.950> down<00:05:53.900> extensively<00:05:54.900> just<00:05:55.229> because

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
did cut it down extensively just because

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.200
