 love 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.169
 O 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.910
 some say that the current generation of 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.190
 gamers are ill accustomed to 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.260
 comforts of modern games not only 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.570
 by the difficulty but by the convenience 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.220
 Maybe they're the dirty words of 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.769
 people who are trapped by the illusion of 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.600
 glories of the past but may not have 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.129
 a little bit of truth in this 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.620
 the executive in case you do not know 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.910
 is a classic that has redefined the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.620
 horror genre the games 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.629
 the gameplay of the original game was difficult 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.430
 because of the poor mechanical 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.900
 limitation of resources but this does not 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.470
 prevented him from falling into the 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.970
 public 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.619
 success was so great that the movement 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.400
 appeared only six years after its 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.530
 launch 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:15.070
 improving visual and correcting some 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:18.360
 awkward moments klaus and the lunch 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.360
 generated cell 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.110
 Roxanne but only users 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.549
 game cube later than ipi had 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530
 access to this beautiful 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.240
 at least until now president has evolved and 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.759
 the PC finally arrived and the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.840
 consoles xbox and our playstation 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.729
 impressions about this version 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.710
 retreaded you now 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.659
 encourage the neighborhood reason if you 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.549
 prefer to happen whole within a 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.600
 gigantic abandoned mansion 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 a group of officers from the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.860
 special stars will rescue the team 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.399
 angry and recently disappeared in the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.259
 local 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.390
 the rest you already know the house is full 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.399
 zombies of mysterious origin and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.990
 monstrous creations of genetics 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.909
 you take control of agents chris 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.429
 head yarn or jill valentine for 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.429
 discover the mysteries of the solving notion 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.830
 spent surviving and getting out of there 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.410
 beyond the democratization of platforms 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.230
 reason for resident evil hd master exists 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.549
 is in the graphic and mechanical update 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.290
 thinking in this case it's better 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.750
 offering the option of 60 frames per 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.209
 resolution of 1920 up to 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.280
 1.200 it is also possible to use before and after 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.930
 relaxation and detailed shadows in your 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.440
 powerful enough machine 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.239
 already the xbox 360 and ps3 receive the most 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.340
 720p basic 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.109
 but still looking much better 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.440
 of the nintendo versions of years 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.440
 behind 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.140
 the restoration work of 3d models 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.150
 of the characters was fantastic with 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.700
 their expressive and convincing 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.380
 considered the polishing redesign of 2002 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.170
 on the other hand the scenarios that are 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.120
 static images 2d could not be 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.739
 and they turned out well 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.480
 treated in some settings and the 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.730
 low-resolution textures are 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.930
 employed in your face without 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.420
 pity 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.269
 however the great aesthetic annoyance 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.920
 it is for the pre rendered cgi 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.109
 while most of the animations of the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.299
 scenes appear in real time cinematics 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.859
 classic as the arrival of the monsoon 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.959
 encounter with the first bis 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.700
 presented in quality and dismal 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.980
 work my mouth is very similar to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.700
 the possession of resident evil 4 for pcs 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.700
 in 2006 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.440
 ae 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.950
 and speaking of the need to 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.720
 update we have the controls happen 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.730
 the happy idea of ​​reformulating the 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.920
 direct resident evil time 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.440
 dynamics that forced the user to 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.810
 set the direction and then act now 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.520
 the movement responds better to the pair 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.100
 of analog controls 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.290
 can say that mechanics is 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.330
 more friendly but could be even more 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.190
 my course here suffers from 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.960
 iconic static camera is not enough 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.520
 controlled by the left 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.400
 in current games, which still maintains 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.230
 part of the challenge but okay even without 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.160
 update is already a help and 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.810
 both for those who are not 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.110
 accustomed to the model of movement 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.430
 old and bizarre of old games 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.290
 it is clear that the more purists will 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.380
 prefer traditional controls and 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.300
 good news is that they can control 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.940
 the old modern looking controls 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.740
 milk or 43 respectively the father tim 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.630
 developers polish a rustic to 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.340
 attract the newbies but kept the 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.890
 old options for graduates of the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.990
 It is also important to say that 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.760
 with this new move became more 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.320
 easy to bypass a bishop 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.450
 especially when the controls of the 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.250
 remastering does not require you to lose the 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.880
 second button to compete is only 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.860
 press the directional and ready 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.930
 it comes among the novelties the new version 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.930
 of the game also brought two achievements 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.030
 for the characters it is possible to play with 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.430
 a more believable view of the crisis 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.910
 money must be from resident evil 5 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.910
 loch ness 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:17.190
 the event and cab is alien to the 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.290
 rival president 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.880
 It's good to have the old friend back yet. 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.740
 that remastering has shown 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.110
 some streets that will go unnoticed 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.150
 the plastic that did more good than bad is 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.760
 Obviously a game from 2002 and you expensive 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.010
 player will feel this when he comes across 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.470
 with the dubbing canastrona the innovations 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.190
 which have already become cliche and level design 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.110
 adequate but update in modeling 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.220
 of the characters and controls was very 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.510
 well done especially when 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.050
 compared to other restored versions 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.570
 from the series as a tale and ex chronic 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.830
 resident evil hd master welcome 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.350
 only by newly arrived players 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.970
 but also for those who dreamed years 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.650
 and play it because they had no consoles 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.990
 nintendo is true that the work of 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.660
 renewal was not 5%, especially in 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.070
 regions in part of the scenarios is true 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.930
 that it is a kettle that is already 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.720
 requested for the second time in the 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.720
 However it is without doubt a beautiful meal 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.099
 the complete person of that analysis you 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.470
