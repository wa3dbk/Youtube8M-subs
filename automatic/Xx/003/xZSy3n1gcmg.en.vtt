four-door Austin Martin that I heard
didn't<00:02:39.660> sell<00:02:39.810> really<00:02:39.989> well<00:02:40.080> but<00:02:40.380> I'm<00:02:40.470> not<00:02:40.500> too

nothing<00:03:00.120> really<00:03:00.209> fancy<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:00.989> a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
nothing really fancy but it is a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.830 
nothing really fancy but it is a
four-door<00:03:01.530> supercar<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.540> put<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.720> the

four-door supercar so put it in the
first<00:03:04.019> person<00:03:04.200> take<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.709> for<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.860> test<00:03:05.070> spin<00:03:05.160> you

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
first person take it for a test spin you

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.430 
first person take it for a test spin you
know<00:03:06.180> how<00:03:06.299> we<00:03:06.360> do<00:03:06.600> it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.070 

I<00:03:09.940> mean<00:03:10.940> this<00:03:11.060> thing<00:03:11.240> goes<00:03:11.450> did<00:03:11.780> they<00:03:11.840> buff

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
I mean this thing goes did they buff

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.800 
I mean this thing goes did they buff
this<00:03:12.290> thing<00:03:12.470> or<00:03:12.590> what<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:13.660> remember<00:03:14.660> this<00:03:14.750> thing

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
this thing or what I remember this thing

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.560 
this thing or what I remember this thing
being<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.410> lot<00:03:15.650> slower<00:03:15.890> on<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.130> 360<00:03:16.730> which<00:03:17.540> is

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
being a lot slower on the 360 which is

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.660 
being a lot slower on the 360 which is
why<00:03:17.810> everybody<00:03:18.140> sold<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:19.010> they<00:03:19.310> bought<00:03:19.520> it

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
why everybody sold it they bought it

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.830 
why everybody sold it they bought it
because<00:03:19.910> they<00:03:20.090> thought<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.300> was<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.480> fastest

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
because they thought it was the fastest

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.900 
because they thought it was the fastest
car<00:03:21.050> everybody<00:03:21.950> found<00:03:22.100> out<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.430> salton<00:03:22.790> was

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
car everybody found out the salton was

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.610 
car everybody found out the salton was
faster<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.360> then<00:03:23.780> they<00:03:23.960> sold<00:03:24.170> these<00:03:24.320> things

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
faster and then they sold these things

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.540 
faster and then they sold these things
and<00:03:25.100> went<00:03:25.580> with<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.760> solid<00:03:30.160> still<00:03:31.160> not<00:03:31.340> that

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
and went with the solid still not that

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.800 
and went with the solid still not that
fast<00:03:31.850> about<00:03:32.780> 110<00:03:33.320> miles<00:03:33.500> an<00:03:33.650> hour<00:03:34.690> not<00:03:35.690> the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
fast about 110 miles an hour not the

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.190 
fast about 110 miles an hour not the
fastest<00:03:36.290> not<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:36.980> best<00:03:37.190> not<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.370> worst<00:03:38.200> maybe

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
fastest not the best not the worst maybe

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.240 
fastest not the best not the worst maybe
it<00:03:39.320> handles<00:03:39.650> good<00:03:39.800> now

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
it handles good now

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.980 
it handles good now
maybe<00:03:40.880> they<00:03:41.000> fix<00:03:41.210> the<00:03:41.330> handling<00:03:41.690> issues

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
maybe they fix the handling issues

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.930 
maybe they fix the handling issues
because<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:42.590> car<00:03:42.740> used<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:43.010> slide<00:03:43.340> all<00:03:43.610> over

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
because this car used to slide all over

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.680 
because this car used to slide all over
the<00:03:44.030> place<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:46.670> used<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.060> have<00:03:47.210> that<00:03:47.360> one<00:03:47.570> of

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
the place it used to have that one of

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.800 
the place it used to have that one of
the<00:03:47.750> ten<00:03:47.930> handling<00:03:49.420> popping<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.630> third

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
the ten handling popping it a third

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.430 
the ten handling popping it a third
person

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
person

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:00.100 
person
I<00:03:55.210> took<00:03:56.210> the<00:03:56.480> sweeper<00:03:56.870> good

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.010 

the<00:04:01.110> brakes<00:04:01.350> work<00:04:01.560> good<00:04:01.590> now<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.960> think<00:04:03.960> they

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
the brakes work good now I think they

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.920 
the brakes work good now I think they
just<00:04:04.050> add<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.320> handling<00:04:04.710> update<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.100> this<00:04:05.220> car

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
just add a handling update to this car

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.510 
just add a handling update to this car
does<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.080> still<00:04:07.320> slide<00:04:07.560> like<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:07.920> used<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.250> if<00:04:08.460> I

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
does it still slide like it used to if I

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.370 
does it still slide like it used to if I
hit<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.760> ebrake<00:04:10.580> and<00:04:11.580> not<00:04:11.850> really<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.570> sort<00:04:13.350> of

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
hit the ebrake and not really it sort of

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.340 
hit the ebrake and not really it sort of
keeps<00:04:13.620> its<00:04:13.860> grip<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.340> goes<00:04:14.990> huh

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
keeps its grip and it goes huh

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.710 
keeps its grip and it goes huh
out<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.459> all<00:04:17.549> cars<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.910> be<00:04:18.000> updated<00:04:18.360> I<00:04:18.480> didn't

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
out of all cars to be updated I didn't

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.820 
out of all cars to be updated I didn't
think<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:18.959> one<00:04:19.110> would<00:04:19.260> get<00:04:19.380> an<00:04:19.470> update

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
think this one would get an update

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.240 
think this one would get an update
