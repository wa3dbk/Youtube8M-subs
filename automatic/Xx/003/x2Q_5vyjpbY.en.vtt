00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
fruits and vegetables pollinated is to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
fruits and vegetables pollinated is to
give<00:00:56.579> them<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> habitat<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.809> use<00:00:58.199> now

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
give them the habitat that they use now

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
give them the habitat that they use now
one<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.460> things<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.030> need<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
one of the things that they need the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.349 
one of the things that they need the
most<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.899> some<00:01:01.260> place<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.680> nest<00:01:02.120> some<00:01:03.120> bees

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
most is some place to nest some bees

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.210 
most is some place to nest some bees
will<00:01:03.570> find<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:04.080> nooks<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> crannies<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
will find little nooks and crannies and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.179 
will find little nooks and crannies and
crevices<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.030> which<00:01:06.560> solitary<00:01:07.560> bees<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.040> do

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
crevices and which solitary bees will do

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.390 
crevices and which solitary bees will do
too<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.299> some<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> these<00:01:10.260> little<00:01:10.770> simple

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
too but some of these little simple

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.910 
too but some of these little simple
nests<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.420> an<00:01:12.600> absolute<00:01:13.110> ideal<00:01:13.650> way<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
nests are just an absolute ideal way to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460 
nests are just an absolute ideal way to
go<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.750> small<00:01:16.110> tubes

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
go because they have these small tubes

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.929 
go because they have these small tubes
that<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.400> solitary<00:01:17.970> bees<00:01:18.330> need<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.049> order<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
that the solitary bees need in order to

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.149 
that the solitary bees need in order to
go<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.180> there<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.960> build<00:01:22.530> their<00:01:22.740> cocoons

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
go in there and to build their cocoons

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.550 
go in there and to build their cocoons
for<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> next<00:01:24.330> generation<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.229> next

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
for the next generation for the next

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.090 
for the next generation for the next
season<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.360> these<00:01:27.689> little<00:01:27.990> nesting<00:01:28.560> boxes<00:01:28.950> are

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
season so these little nesting boxes are

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.730 
season so these little nesting boxes are
really<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.700> great<00:01:29.939> some<00:01:30.390> people<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.990> drill

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
really really great some people do drill

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
really really great some people do drill
holes<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.430> example<00:01:32.850> into<00:01:33.210> blocks<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.689> wood

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
holes for example into blocks of wood

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.789 
holes for example into blocks of wood
and<00:01:34.140> those<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.680> work<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.579> only<00:01:35.880> thing<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.329> is

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
and those do work the only thing is is

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.620 
and those do work the only thing is is
predators<00:01:37.829> after<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> cocoons<00:01:39.060> after<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
predators after the cocoons after the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
predators after the cocoons after the
bees<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.350> also<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.430> after<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
bees can also get in there so after a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.090 
bees can also get in there so after a
few<00:01:41.939> years<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.899> issues<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.860> other

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
few years you can have issues with other

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760 
few years you can have issues with other
insects<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> sometimes<00:01:45.390> diseases<00:01:46.049> being<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
insects and sometimes diseases being a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.160 
insects and sometimes diseases being a
problem<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.189> those<00:01:47.340> types<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.850> boxes<00:01:48.170> whereas

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
problem in those types of boxes whereas

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
problem in those types of boxes whereas
these<00:01:49.500> which<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:49.950> candies<00:01:50.850> temporary

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
these which have candies temporary

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.840 
these which have candies temporary
almost<00:01:51.990> disposable<00:01:52.380> they're<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.310> cardboard

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
almost disposable they're just cardboard

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.660 
almost disposable they're just cardboard
they<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.540> last<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.439> years<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.549> they

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
they can last for years but if they

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.130 
they can last for years but if they
become<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> problem<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.600> always<00:01:57.810> toss

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
become a problem you can always toss

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.260 
become a problem you can always toss
them<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.619> bring<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.310> something

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
them and bring in something

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.139 
them and bring in something
so<00:02:00.840> solitary<00:02:01.740> bees<00:02:01.950> aren't<00:02:02.399> terribly<00:02:02.850> picky

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
so solitary bees aren't terribly picky

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.260 
so solitary bees aren't terribly picky
you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.289> is<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.280> nesting

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you can see this is this is a nesting

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.210 
you can see this is this is a nesting
box<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.810> leaf-cutter<00:02:07.289> bees<00:02:07.500> which<00:02:07.950> are<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
box for leaf-cutter bees which are a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.210 
box for leaf-cutter bees which are a
solitary<00:02:08.789> bee<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.569> are<00:02:09.929> prevalent<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
solitary bee that are prevalent in the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.130 
solitary bee that are prevalent in the
summertime<00:02:11.819> they<00:02:12.330> need<00:02:12.599> those<00:02:12.840> warm

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
summertime they need those warm

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.930 
summertime they need those warm
temperatures<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.950> order<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> action<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.790> be

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
temperatures in order to action to be

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.729 
temperatures in order to action to be
out<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.750> these<00:02:15.959> are<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.230> ones<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.560> are

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
out and so these are the ones that are

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.190 
out and so these are the ones that are
going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.010> handle<00:02:17.430> pollination<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.810> lot<00:02:19.019> of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
going to handle pollination of a lot of

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.380 
going to handle pollination of a lot of
your<00:02:19.349> summer<00:02:19.590> vegetables<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.030> little

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
your summer vegetables now the little

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.140 
your summer vegetables now the little
box<00:02:21.540> below<00:02:22.050> me<00:02:22.290> are<00:02:22.500> four<00:02:22.709> mason<00:02:23.190> bees<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
box below me are four mason bees so the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.790 
box below me are four mason bees so the
tubes<00:02:24.420> inside<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.290> bigger<00:02:25.530> to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
tubes inside here are bigger to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.400 
tubes inside here are bigger to
accommodate<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.670> mason<00:02:27.090> bee<00:02:27.900> which<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.260> also

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
accommodate the mason bee which is also

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.520 
accommodate the mason bee which is also
taught<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:28.950> an<00:02:29.069> orchard<00:02:29.220> bee<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.930> they<00:02:31.230> can

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
taught in an orchard bee and so they can

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.130 
taught in an orchard bee and so they can
go<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.860> there<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.340> build<00:02:32.670> their<00:02:33.000> cocoons<00:02:33.480> like

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
go in there and build their cocoons like

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.949 
go in there and build their cocoons like
I<00:02:34.260> said<00:02:34.500> for<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.739> next<00:02:35.069> generation<00:02:35.959> really

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
I said for the next generation really

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.780 
I said for the next generation really
easy<00:02:37.170> when<00:02:37.680> you're<00:02:37.830> setting<00:02:38.190> up<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.340> bee

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
easy when you're setting up the bee

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.660 
easy when you're setting up the bee
boxes<00:02:39.299> for<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> solitary<00:02:40.319> bees<00:02:40.590> I'm<00:02:40.980> just

you know have their cocoons in here not
a<00:03:05.370> big<00:03:05.670> deal<00:03:05.910> they're<00:03:06.120> not<00:03:06.299> storing<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:06.810> tons

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
a big deal they're not storing up tons

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.289 
a big deal they're not storing up tons
of<00:03:07.290> honey<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.829> putting<00:03:08.459> all<00:03:08.579> these<00:03:08.730> resources

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
of honey and putting all these resources

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.050 
of honey and putting all these resources
into<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.780> hive<00:03:10.049> like<00:03:10.079> honey<00:03:10.709> bees<00:03:10.980> are<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.790> honey

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
into a hive like honey bees are so honey

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.630 
into a hive like honey bees are so honey
bees<00:03:12.329> have<00:03:12.359> something<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.049> defend<00:03:13.640> solitary

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
bees have something you defend solitary

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.000 
bees have something you defend solitary
bees<00:03:14.910> they'll<00:03:15.540> just<00:03:15.780> turn<00:03:16.019> off<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.530> go<00:03:16.650> find

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
bees they'll just turn off and go find

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.800 
bees they'll just turn off and go find
some<00:03:17.160> more<00:03:17.280> nectar<00:03:17.670> they're<00:03:18.329> not<00:03:18.569> going<00:03:18.750> to

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
some more nectar they're not going to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.110 
some more nectar they're not going to
bother<00:03:18.930> with<00:03:19.139> you<00:03:19.470> from<00:03:20.340> people<00:03:20.760> I've<00:03:20.880> talked

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
bother with you from people I've talked

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.360 
bother with you from people I've talked
to<00:03:21.299> about<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.840> only<00:03:21.959> time<00:03:22.200> they<00:03:22.410> do<00:03:22.650> sting<00:03:23.100> is

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
to about the only time they do sting is

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.759 
to about the only time they do sting is
if<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.700> squish<00:03:24.030> them<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.450> even<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.560> guess

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
if you squish them and even so I guess

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.220 
if you squish them and even so I guess
their<00:03:26.190> venom<00:03:26.790> isn't<00:03:27.120> nearly<00:03:27.569> as<00:03:27.720> strong<00:03:28.049> as<00:03:28.200> a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
their venom isn't nearly as strong as a

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.440 
their venom isn't nearly as strong as a
honey<00:03:28.470> bee<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:29.670> good<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.060> know<00:03:30.209> if

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
honey bee so that is good to know if

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.960 
honey bee so that is good to know if
you're<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.810> an<00:03:31.049> urban<00:03:31.290> or<00:03:31.650> suburban<00:03:31.970> situation

you're in an urban or suburban situation

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.879 
you're in an urban or suburban situation
or<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.660> have<00:03:33.840> people<00:03:34.230> who<00:03:34.410> have<00:03:34.650> issues

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
or if you have people who have issues

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.430 
or if you have people who have issues
with<00:03:35.130> keys<00:03:35.609> not<00:03:36.540> saying<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:36.959> somebody<00:03:37.290> won't

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
with keys not saying that somebody won't

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.400 
with keys not saying that somebody won't
have<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> reaction<00:03:38.160> but<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.750> might<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.139> less

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
have a reaction but it might be less

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.059 
have a reaction but it might be less
harmful<00:03:41.160> than<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.700> honey<00:03:41.970> bee<00:03:42.209> sting<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:43.530> like<00:03:43.950> I

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
harmful than a honey bee sting so like I

said you just mount it on a wall
somewhere<00:03:46.760> facing<00:03:47.760> east<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.239> that's<00:03:48.480> that

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
somewhere facing east so that's that

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.340 
somewhere facing east so that's that
morning<00:03:49.829> Sun<00:03:50.100> warms<00:03:50.459> enough<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.690> what's

really neat is when you order cocoon
Xander's<00:03:55.350> definitely<00:03:56.310> these<00:03:56.459> are<00:03:56.519> good<00:03:56.819> to

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
Xander's definitely these are good to

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.180 
Xander's definitely these are good to
put<00:03:57.209> up<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.930> be<00:03:58.079> able<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.349> encourage<00:03:58.739> those

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
put up to be able to encourage those

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.670 
put up to be able to encourage those
native<00:03:59.639> bees<00:03:59.910> in<00:04:00.209> your<00:04:00.420> area<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.500> can

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
native bees in your area but you can

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.860 
native bees in your area but you can
also<00:04:01.859> order<00:04:02.310> them

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
also order them

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.199 
also order them
these<00:04:03.870> are<00:04:04.280> cocoons<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.700> leafcutter<00:04:05.910> bee

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
these are cocoons for the leafcutter bee

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.930 
these are cocoons for the leafcutter bee
so<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.380> summer<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.889> definitely<00:04:08.549> need<00:04:08.729> some

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
so this summer I definitely need some

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.300 
so this summer I definitely need some
more<00:04:08.970> pollinators<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.810> garden<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.380> so<00:04:10.889> as

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
more pollinators in the garden and so as

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.830 
more pollinators in the garden and so as
the<00:04:12.209> temperature

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
the temperature

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.320 
the temperature
warms<00:04:13.110> up<00:04:13.379> above<00:04:13.800> 70<00:04:14.250> degrees<00:04:14.580> it'll<00:04:15.120> take

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
warms up above 70 degrees it'll take

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.970 
warms up above 70 degrees it'll take
four<00:04:15.629> or<00:04:15.720> five<00:04:15.870> weeks<00:04:16.199> for<00:04:16.470> these<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.799> hatch

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
four or five weeks for these to hatch

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.770 
four or five weeks for these to hatch
out<00:04:17.280> which<00:04:17.519> should<00:04:18.000> be<00:04:18.180> coming<00:04:18.480> up<00:04:18.600> here

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
there's about a hundred in that little

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.050 
there's about a hundred in that little
bag<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.290> I'm<00:04:28.919> going<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.250> take<00:04:29.580> out<00:04:29.820> these

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
tubes and just put it right in the back

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.520 
tubes and just put it right in the back
whoops

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
whoops

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.550 
whoops
and<00:04:34.680> then<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.310> will<00:04:35.580> replace<00:04:36.560> theoretically

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
and then I will replace theoretically

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.500 
and then I will replace theoretically
all<00:04:37.830> my<00:04:38.160> two<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:39.770> so<00:04:40.770> that<00:04:41.250> way<00:04:41.639> once<00:04:42.270> they

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
all my two and so that way once they

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.870 
all my two and so that way once they
catch<00:04:42.810> there<00:04:43.410> already<00:04:43.979> this<00:04:44.490> they'll

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
catch there already this they'll

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.240 
catch there already this they'll
identify<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:45.690> is<00:04:46.200> home<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.800> keep<00:04:47.010> coming

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
identify this is home and keep coming

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.120 
identify this is home and keep coming
back<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:48.419> once<00:04:48.600> you<00:04:48.690> have<00:04:48.840> your<00:04:48.900> B's<00:04:49.260> going<00:04:49.830> the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
back so once you have your B's going the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.940 
back so once you have your B's going the
way<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.340> keep<00:04:50.729> them<00:04:50.970> going<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:52.620> give<00:04:52.770> them

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
way you keep them going is to give them

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.250 
way you keep them going is to give them
what<00:04:53.130> they<00:04:53.280> need<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.790> a<00:04:54.540> lot<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.870> flowers

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
what they need and a lot of the flowers

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.810 
what they need and a lot of the flowers
in<00:04:55.410> your<00:04:55.440> garden<00:04:55.560> are<00:04:55.950> going<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.220> handle<00:04:56.550> that

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
in your garden are going to handle that

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.230 
in your garden are going to handle that
that's<00:04:57.660> area<00:04:58.350> but<00:04:59.040> one<00:04:59.280> thing<00:04:59.520> that<00:04:59.550> solitary

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
that's area but one thing that solitary

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.879 
that's area but one thing that solitary
bees<00:05:00.479> need<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.139> lot<00:05:01.350> of<00:05:01.440> people<00:05:01.680> don't

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
bees need that a lot of people don't

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.690 
bees need that a lot of people don't
realize<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:02.580> mud<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.900> definitely<00:05:04.860> keep<00:05:05.250> muddy

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
realize is mud so definitely keep muddy

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.700 
realize is mud so definitely keep muddy
areas<00:05:06.300> whether<00:05:06.539> it's<00:05:06.750> in<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:06.990> garden<00:05:07.440> or

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
areas whether it's in the garden or

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.909 
areas whether it's in the garden or
around<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.720> birdbath<00:05:09.720> something<00:05:10.530> like<00:05:10.710> that

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
around a birdbath something like that

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.909 
around a birdbath something like that
then<00:05:11.340> you<00:05:11.520> do<00:05:11.729> need<00:05:12.030> fresh<00:05:12.539> mud<00:05:13.169> in<00:05:13.470> order<00:05:13.650> to

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
then you do need fresh mud in order to

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.320 
then you do need fresh mud in order to
build<00:05:14.160> their<00:05:14.370> cocoons<00:05:14.760> a<00:05:14.970> lot<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.180> times

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
build their cocoons a lot of times

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.480 
build their cocoons a lot of times
especially<00:05:15.479> with<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.080> mason<00:05:16.500> bees<00:05:16.710> in<00:05:17.250> the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
critical in order to do that after that

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.770 
critical in order to do that after that
after<00:05:22.620> about<00:05:23.160> six<00:05:23.729> weeks<00:05:23.820> or<00:05:24.180> so<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.600> life

while<00:06:12.150> honey<00:06:12.630> bees<00:06:12.870> will<00:06:13.050> only<00:06:13.200> pollinate

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
while honey bees will only pollinate

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.519 
while honey bees will only pollinate
half<00:06:14.520> pound

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529 
half pound

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.139
