00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.520
 their games tell us the other day 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.730
 they also proposed to do something 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.789
 of reality shows from there was actually not 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.980
 they made themselves heard more because you 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:22.060
 you would make the subject but its conditions 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.870
 certainly and not then a real one or did 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.180
 free 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.270
 these instead want to charge the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.920
 band to participate cover band you have 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.870
 I got it 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.329
 but the problem you know I connect to this 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.030
 these people only think about money 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.390
 fuck a fucking stuff for the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.339
 music is understood this is a war though 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.940
 we don't do it together we already have 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:52.269
 lost a thousand years ago , he writes them 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.659
 first but a number like t who cares 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.280
 metal man general award to whom 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.280
 it matters about the real music 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.589
 those people and those dreams ca n't 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.590
 get on with things you don't need to 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.750
 nothing does not help messina above all 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.520
 if you know how it works on TV 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
 the man who saw the trick but time 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.180
 I don't helmet anymore 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.260
 I think it's all fake made a 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.920
 small table 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.300
 the problem is not whether this is a portal 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.820
 third is the format that it is 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.040
 wrong the peaks and for everything from the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.500
 least detail row let's leave it 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.050
 that there is nothing positive about 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.390
 programs with which the theme is less bad 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 that these formats did not exist before 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.280
 pc 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.320
 otherwise as the uncle Alessandro says 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.610
 all the great musicians as facts 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:47.190
 the urban jackies but also the oceans 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.790
 purposes understood admitted himself 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.460
 I take it as a right and you want 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.650
 bikes to name but a few 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.810
 They would not have existed there 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.620
 they would never have done it because they were not 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.720
 neither material nor 10 papal but 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.820
 this move the head wo n't do it 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.040
 we certainly have to say money 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.979
 faithful listeners since he has it 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.430
 taught as unpaved stars by 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.640
 very high of 25 from an own-house 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.300
 a kiss from and excuse for the outcome 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.300
 bonino 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.890
 I think people are not like that 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.069
 somara no since these real that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.140
 they have existed for 30 years since they started 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:38.689
 it never came out that it was one 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.819
 someone came out who sang it 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:44.480
 find there any piano bar and bar 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.860
 find them and why keep them on 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.049
 why do you think people are concerned? 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.310
 because people unfortunately are concerned 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.010
 I got it 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.680
 so in my opinion if it could be done 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.889
 something true of this mass one 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.019
 part it could last however this does 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:10.299
 fear because then it means that people 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.299
 begins to reflect and is not good
