00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.970 
much I guess it helps more with the
bloating<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:56.290> makes<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.680> go<00:03:56.770> to<00:03:56.830> the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
bloating this makes you go to the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.740 
bloating this makes you go to the
bathroom<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:58.030> reason<00:03:58.330> I<00:03:58.420> guess<00:03:58.600> the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
bathroom and the reason I guess the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.720 
bathroom and the reason I guess the
reason<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.140> decided<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.770> get<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.100> because<00:04:00.370> you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
reason I decided to get this because you

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.600 
reason I decided to get this because you
get<00:04:00.940> these<00:04:01.180> two<00:04:01.510> baggies<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:03.250> two-week

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
get these two baggies and a two-week

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.390 
get these two baggies and a two-week
supply<00:04:03.760> cheaper<00:04:04.660> than<00:04:04.840> what<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.140> paid<00:04:05.500> for<00:04:05.560> just

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
supply cheaper than what I paid for just

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.479 
supply cheaper than what I paid for just
a<00:04:06.630> two-week<00:04:07.630> supply<00:04:07.780> for<00:04:08.320> just<00:04:08.560> one<00:04:09.250> bag

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
a two-week supply for just one bag

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.840 
a two-week supply for just one bag
really<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.540> one-week<00:04:11.050> supply<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.010> was<00:04:12.580> very

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
really a one-week supply so it was very

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.340 
really a one-week supply so it was very
it's<00:04:13.180> very<00:04:13.420> reasonable

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
it's very reasonable

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.320 
it's very reasonable
I<00:04:14.380> would<00:04:14.739> actually<00:04:14.920> order<00:04:15.459> this<00:04:15.610> again<00:04:16.000> I

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
I would actually order this again I

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.380 
I would actually order this again I
measured<00:04:17.320> myself<00:04:17.560> before<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.459> before<00:04:19.209> I

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
measured myself before I before I

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.870 
measured myself before I before I

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
because I forgot to measure

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.950 
because I forgot to measure
