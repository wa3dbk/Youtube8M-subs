00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.160
 video review and this time I bring you nothing 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:10.599
 more and nothing less than one more of the 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.490
 ninja classics turtles so is friends yes 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.250
 it is nothing more and nothing less than the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:21.180
 good-natured leader of the leonardo turtles 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.250
 appointed by the Renaissance artist 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.590
 I did verse effortlessly 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.619
 leonardo da vinci but here we can see 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.840
 friends the excellent detail and care 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.640
 with which this good friend is made 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.359
 leonardo who has here back some this 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.969
 then covers for your bells to settle 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.620
 in putting in but I remembered and 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.129
 Here we can see that it is in its 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.129
 booth 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.100
 who says his name we can hear him 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.100
 I say you can stop without any problem 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.250
 - what 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.199
 and here we can see your stand that says 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.149
 leonardo 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.939
 unlike bebop and rocksteady 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.880
 these are brought as a kind of 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:16.090
 very screams black paint to simulate 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.950
 dirt and the truth is that 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.300
 They are pretty good but 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.130
 these are pretty good those of bebop and 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.110
 rocksteady are a little chafas 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.050
 painted but here we can see the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.030
 excellent level of detail and 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.000
 articulation that these turtles have 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.690
 ninja classics and for sample let's 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.369
 put it in a pose here I have in winson 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.670
 ai cuchi cars here as beto the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.520
 apothecary see you friends 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.580
 the good level of detail and possibility 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.310
 that this turtle obviously has 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.610
 we put your your bells in your 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.009
 hands are going to see much more chingÃ³n 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.259
 wenchong and cuchi cars with the good friend 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:05.170
 Leo I read that he is not not true 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.960
 forgive you stupidity now something 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.980
 What can I say to you right away is 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.910
 that their unions are very very 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.280
 hard this you are seeing how 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.490
 I'm struggling to put the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.790
 katanas are very hard 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.090
 and this and I'm afraid of going to break something 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.610
 but that you can do it 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.460
 they can do it now another question that 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.790
 I have is that it has a small ones 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.940
 little simple of painting the truth 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.480
 this 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.650
 and now you can show in detail the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.410
 mistakes but it has some rollers 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.010
 painting that suddenly I say what wave 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.670
 put the batteries 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.620
 but see you friends always all 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.140
 the characters with the sword 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.540
 I like to put them like this in this kind of 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.600
 poses but see you are going to get a 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.360
 eye 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.600
 but you guys see how nice what 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.310
 good articulation well both in batches 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.370
 what I did to put the swords for 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.840
 take them off but they already know me I'm 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.280
 a man of complications like that is 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.470
 articulation well you have here in your torso 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.150
 have it has it divided in two and has 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.730
 so that we can do towards 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.590
 in front and back his head here 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.850
 is one of the paint errors that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.850
 he mentioned them from gm 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.630
 here it is there you can see a ray in the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.720
 painting here back also in the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.720
 bells have some paint rays 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.150
 you see just and I love it because 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.630
 this is soft plastic and with the heat of 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.840
 the lamps will be made like chewing gum 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.590
 but still everything stops well 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.209
 without its base I do not want to imagine right now 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.760
 it stops well but the truth is that it is 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.580
 quite heavy I do not want to imagine myself in 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.940
 ones in a few months that loosen a 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.370
 little joints this guy is going to 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.000
 be a nightmare to give the truth and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.130
 I already imagine how this will be 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.730
 fun but they always have 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.330
 you this base 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.360
 to help them stop their turtle 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.510
 ninja without any clear anger that yes 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.800
 you want and what is this doing 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.480
 your display with all this with the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.640
 other turtles because there they will have 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.230
 that make a little space because 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.420
 Well, as you already saw in the video 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.420
 of donatello all have a little 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.520
 this problem that n do not stop well 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.860
 let's save your catanas again 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.480
 but there's the paint problem that 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.120
 I tell them about gender 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.409
 I approach a little bit there is there you see 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.059
 the blue but 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:09.249
 even in spite of these problems I am 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:11.679
 fascinated enchanted and overwhelmed and all 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:15.099
 what I ended up with these turtles 

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:17.080
 ninja and I highly recommend them to 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.749
 principle yes I said no I'm not going to 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.360
 buy but I've seen them cheap now 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:26.110
 they are already being a little more common already 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.360
 I have Rafael and I have Donatello and 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.719
 this leonardo that was the last one 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.449
 buy and the truth is that I hope to be able to 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:37.059
 find miguel angel to have my 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.159
 my display with the four turtles 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:41.800
 friends friends 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.839
 it's worth it, of course, yes and not only in 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.059
 the nostalgia because they are good toys 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:48.610
 these of the classics and ninja turtles 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:50.769
 the truth is that I am very very happy 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.659
 I say have problems in painting by 

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:56.860
 example rafael I left a little virolo 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:59.379
 but if you are willing to leave 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.469
 spend those problems these guys 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.669
 They are worth a lot of friends 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:07.649
 I am a behler 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.649
 This is Leonardo and we said goodbye
