00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
that the actual carrier bearing support

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.790 
that the actual carrier bearing support
on<00:00:26.430> there<00:00:26.669> was<00:00:27.360> coming<00:00:27.869> apart<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.590> the

on there was coming apart for the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.130 
on there was coming apart for the
driveshaft<00:00:29.220> or<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.330> actual<00:00:30.630> carrier

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
bearings that are hold a differential in

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.590 
bearings that are hold a differential in
place<00:00:33.510> inside<00:00:34.470> the<00:00:34.589> axle<00:00:35.150> he's<00:00:36.150> travelling

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
place inside the axle he's travelling

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.270 
place inside the axle he's travelling
through<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.290> he's<00:00:37.379> at<00:00:37.530> he's<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> transport

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
through and he's at he's a transport

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.220 
through and he's at he's a transport
company<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.790> his<00:00:38.910> haulin<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.900> he<00:00:39.989> really

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
company so his haulin so he really

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.869 
company so his haulin so he really
thought<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:40.739> was<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.070> kind<00:00:41.339> of<00:00:41.489> bearing

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
thought there was some kind of bearing

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.490 
thought there was some kind of bearing
noise<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> back<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> axle<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
noise in the back from the axle and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.710 
noise in the back from the axle and
allegedly<00:00:44.159> what<00:00:44.339> I<00:00:44.369> found<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.150> and<00:00:45.330> it

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
allegedly what I found on it and it

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.969 
allegedly what I found on it and it
almost<00:00:45.839> sounds<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.710> me

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:46.979 
almost sounds like to me

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.119 
almost sounds like to me
um<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:48.360> backing<00:00:48.989> plates<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.440> thin<00:00:49.710> metal

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
um the backing plates that thin metal

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.640 
um the backing plates that thin metal
and<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.400> backing<00:00:50.820> plates<00:00:51.119> for<00:00:51.869> the<00:00:51.989> brakes<00:00:52.500> in

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
and the backing plates for the brakes in

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.530 
and the backing plates for the brakes in
the<00:00:52.680> back<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.089> they're<00:00:54.269> grinding

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
the back you think that they're grinding

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.439 
the back you think that they're grinding
somehow<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.790> go<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.210> start

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
somehow and you can go and start

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.299 
somehow and you can go and start
checking<00:00:57.900> all<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.320> stuff<00:00:58.619> out<00:00:58.830> looking

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
checking all that stuff out looking

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.649 
checking all that stuff out looking
around<00:00:59.400> back<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.360> seeing

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
around back there and not seeing

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.630 
around back there and not seeing
anything<00:01:00.900> I'm<00:01:01.500> gonna<00:01:01.739> show<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.010> exactly<00:01:02.129> what

anything I'm gonna show you exactly what
I<00:01:02.670> found<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.540> this<00:01:03.780> may<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.019> obvious<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.619> um

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
I found now this may be obvious it's um

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.980 
I found now this may be obvious it's um
maybe<00:01:05.100> not<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.430> others<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.150> anytime<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.810> hear

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
I'm gonna show you a few things to check

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700 
I'm gonna show you a few things to check
for<00:01:24.270> back<00:01:24.510> there<00:01:24.780> another<00:01:25.260> four<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.620> five

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
for back there another four or five

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.470 
for back there another four or five
hundreds<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.430> freestyles<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.180> all<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
hundreds and freestyles and all that

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.570 
hundreds and freestyles and all that
that<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.900> wheel<00:01:28.110> drive<00:01:28.230> had<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.310> same

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
that are all wheel drive had the same

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.760 
that are all wheel drive had the same
problem<00:01:30.150> they<00:01:30.300> have<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.260> heat<00:01:31.470> shield

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
problem they have the the heat shield

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.520 
problem they have the the heat shield
that<00:01:31.860> drops<00:01:32.340> down<00:01:32.460> onto<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.600> drive<00:01:33.900> shaft<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that drops down onto the drive shaft and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
that drops down onto the drive shaft and
then<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:36.030> grinds<00:01:36.450> into<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.050> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
then it actually just grinds into it and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
then it actually just grinds into it and
makes<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> same<00:01:37.830> noise<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
makes the same noise because it's that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.840 
makes the same noise because it's that
thin<00:01:38.970> tinny<00:01:39.300> metal<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.620> big<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.550> noise

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
thin tinny metal it's so big the noise

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
thin tinny metal it's so big the noise
is<00:01:42.120> immense<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.900> sounds<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.680> whole

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
is immense and it sounds like the whole

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.700 
is immense and it sounds like the whole
back<00:01:44.159> end<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.520> went<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.930> grinding<00:01:46.350> in

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
back end just went and it's grinding in

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.080 
back end just went and it's grinding in
there<00:01:46.830> as<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.040> drive<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.580> all<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there as you drive and all it is a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.350 
there as you drive and all it is a
really<00:01:48.300> simple<00:01:48.930> repair<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.120> I'll<00:01:51.240> let

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
really simple repair so I so I'll let

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.910 
really simple repair so I so I'll let
you<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.600> some<00:01:51.870> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.020> commonalities<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you know some of the commonalities and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
you know some of the commonalities and
the<00:01:52.979> Ford<00:01:53.250> models<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.790> what<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> look<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the Ford models and what to look for and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
the Ford models and what to look for and
it<00:01:55.500> check<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> few<00:01:55.770> things<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it check a few things out like this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.810 
it check a few things out like this
before<00:01:57.690> you<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.229> drop<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.620> and<00:01:58.950> add<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> shop

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
before you just drop it and add a shop

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.080 
before you just drop it and add a shop
and<00:02:00.120> you<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.170> look<00:02:01.380> X<00:02:01.650> they<00:02:01.890> may<00:02:02.220> or<00:02:02.640> may

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and you have that look X they may or may

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.289 
and you have that look X they may or may
not<00:02:03.500> sell<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.590> unnecessary<00:02:05.280> work<00:02:05.580> now<00:02:06.090> what

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
not sell you unnecessary work now what

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.399 
not sell you unnecessary work now what
this<00:02:06.420> also<00:02:06.659> sounds<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.929> front<00:02:09.929> iw

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
this also sounds like is the front iw

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.960 
this also sounds like is the front iw
ease<00:02:10.619> when<00:02:10.890> they<00:02:11.009> go<00:02:11.159> out<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.549> they<00:02:11.700> start

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
ease when they go out and they start

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.899 
ease when they go out and they start
half<00:02:12.239> engaging<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.049> they<00:02:13.170> take<00:02:13.349> that

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
half engaging and they take that

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.630 
half engaging and they take that
grinding<00:02:14.909> noise<00:02:15.659> this<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.709> what<00:02:17.190> they<00:02:17.340> sound

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
grinding noise this is what they sound

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.610 
grinding noise this is what they sound
like<00:02:17.760> also<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.659> may<00:02:18.810> get<00:02:18.870> confused<00:02:19.440> for

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
like also so you may get confused for

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.860 
like also so you may get confused for
the<00:02:19.739> iw<00:02:20.129> ease<00:02:20.340> when<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.209> actually<00:02:21.450> this

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
the iw ease when it's actually this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.199 
the iw ease when it's actually this
shield<00:02:22.499> in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.709> back<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.279> maybe<00:02:23.939> I<00:02:23.999> can

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
shield in the back and maybe I can

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.740 
shield in the back and maybe I can
duplicate<00:02:24.900> that

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
duplicate that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:47.820 
duplicate that
finding<00:02:26.140> type<00:02:26.410> noise<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:47.440> underneath

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
finding type noise here now underneath

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.710 
finding type noise here now underneath
here<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.280> can<00:02:48.400> see<00:02:48.730> down<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.150> drive<00:02:49.390> shaft

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
here you can see down the drive shaft

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.870 
here you can see down the drive shaft
right<00:02:50.020> here<00:02:50.050> where<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.100> heat<00:02:51.370> seal<00:02:51.670> is

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
right here where that heat seal is

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.990 
right here where that heat seal is
actually<00:02:52.420> come<00:02:52.810> apart<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.950> it's<00:02:54.610> actually

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
actually come apart and it's actually

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.180 
actually come apart and it's actually
just<00:02:55.180> sitting<00:02:55.390> there<00:02:55.480> grinding<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.770> it

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
just sitting there grinding on it and it

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.830 
just sitting there grinding on it and it
may<00:02:57.280> not<00:02:57.430> be<00:02:57.490> so<00:02:57.820> evident<00:02:58.300> because<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.720> be

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
may not be so evident because you be

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.090 
may not be so evident because you be
back<00:02:59.230> there<00:02:59.670> looking<00:03:00.670> at<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:02.410> backing<00:03:02.800> plates

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
back there looking at the backing plates

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.740 
back there looking at the backing plates
and<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.520> differential<00:03:04.239> maid<00:03:04.360> checking<00:03:04.690> the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
and the differential maid checking the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.199 
and the differential maid checking the
fluid<00:03:05.040> stuff<00:03:06.040> like<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.610> never<00:03:06.730> come<00:03:07.060> up

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
fluid stuff like that you never come up

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.560 
fluid stuff like that you never come up
to<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.510> point<00:03:07.959> right<00:03:08.200> here<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:10.360> just

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
to this point right here and it's just

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.440 
to this point right here and it's just
part<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.959> heat<00:03:11.170> shield<00:03:12.239> that's<00:03:13.239> that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
part of the heat shield that's that

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.360 
part of the heat shield that's that
really<00:03:13.810> thin<00:03:14.610> tinny<00:03:15.610> type<00:03:16.000> stuff<00:03:17.070> just<00:03:18.070> peel

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
here's that carrier bearing he was

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.289 
here's that carrier bearing he was
talking<00:03:38.530> about<00:03:38.700> he<00:03:39.700> thought<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:39.940> was<00:03:40.000> going

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
talking about he thought it was going

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.960 
talking about he thought it was going
out<00:03:40.480> on<00:03:40.690> there<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.590> these<00:03:42.459> have<00:03:42.610> an<00:03:42.700> actual

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
out on there and these have an actual

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.060 
out on there and these have an actual
bearing<00:03:43.450> right<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:43.900> here<00:03:44.260> for<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.620> ride<00:03:44.860> on

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
bearing right in here for the ride on

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.620 
bearing right in here for the ride on
and<00:03:45.250> that's<00:03:45.519> cushioned<00:03:46.000> by<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.180> actual

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
and that's cushioned by the actual

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.810 
and that's cushioned by the actual
rubber<00:03:46.810> dampener<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.590> then<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.160> loop<00:03:48.519> like<00:03:48.790> a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
rubber dampener and then a loop like a

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.020 
rubber dampener and then a loop like a
strap<00:03:49.150> loop<00:03:49.390> type<00:03:49.660> deal<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.790> these<00:03:51.790> ones

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
strap loop type deal and these ones

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.030 
strap loop type deal and these ones
don't<00:03:52.239> fail<00:03:52.570> too<00:03:52.840> often<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.320> they<00:03:53.500> do<00:03:53.560> fail

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
don't fail too often that they do fail

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.970 
don't fail too often that they do fail
usually<00:03:54.640> it's<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.320> Asheville<00:03:56.320> rubber<00:03:56.590> here

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
usually it's the Asheville rubber here

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.590 
usually it's the Asheville rubber here
and<00:03:57.190> I'll<00:03:57.310> be<00:03:57.400> ultra<00:03:57.880> loose<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.299> there<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.540> we

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
and I'll be ultra loose in there and we

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.420 
and I'll be ultra loose in there and we
tried<00:03:58.840> with<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.110> drive<00:03:59.290> shaft<00:03:59.530> around<00:03:59.620> and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
tried with the drive shaft around and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.729 
tried with the drive shaft around and
you<00:04:00.640> may<00:04:00.820> get<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.060> noise<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.870> or<00:04:02.079> vibration
