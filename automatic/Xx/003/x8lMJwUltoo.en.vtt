think<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:36.229> I<00:04:36.289> can<00:04:36.350> really<00:04:36.590> add<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.800> lot<00:04:36.889> of

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
think that I can really add a lot of

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.230 
think that I can really add a lot of
value<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.400> we're<00:04:37.520> so<00:04:37.729> different<00:04:37.910> that's<00:04:38.150> the

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
value and we're so different that's the

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
value and we're so different that's the
other<00:04:38.300> thing<00:04:38.389> that's<00:04:38.539> where<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.840> works<00:04:39.020> is

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
other thing that's where it works is

think that you know it gets a little

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.570 
think that you know it gets a little
stressful<00:05:26.170> with<00:05:26.500> work<00:05:26.740> but<00:05:26.980> at<00:05:27.040> least<00:05:27.310> we're

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
stressful with work but at least we're

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.180 
stressful with work but at least we're
both<00:05:27.970> fully<00:05:28.690> engaged<00:05:29.140> in<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.500> relationship

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
both fully engaged in the relationship
