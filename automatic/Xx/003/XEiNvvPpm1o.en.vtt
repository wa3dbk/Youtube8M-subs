00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 she water everyone it's true we 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.000
 ends up for a video after a 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.529
 abstinence week let's say during 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.639
 a week I did not do video and you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.750
 You said that during the holidays 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.570
 is really really hot at the level 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.530
 video but then I do not really go back to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.880
 from now on I'm doing a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.240
 little video on the last week of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.190
 vacation 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.900
 yes c to a week of vacation sorry 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.100
 for those who are still at home even 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.289
 world but me it pisses me off 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.060
 remind him all the time but that's it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.500
 so I'm coming back with a little video of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.289
 behind week and we will start again 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.029
 at the start of the season, three videos by 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.289
 week I took a step back his 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.610
 holidays when taking a little bit of 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.200
 back on my channel to see what she 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.450
 did not have to see what was right what 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.739
 I had to entrust the matter and that's 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.840
 so play with lots of videos 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.070
 I already have three projections to start 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.750
 so it is worth avoiding to restart others 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.890
 for back to school I want content from 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.079
 a few years I'll stop for a moment 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 drool when I make you that I 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.500
 would be a little tired of the three but 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.329
 So that's really it's really 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.190
 very nice friends to come back after 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.600
 a week of video mont is besides 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.710
 even the video I made the week 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.809
 last I had already pre-recorded 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.340
 so that's really very very 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.289
 long time I've done more video but 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.549
 it's always a great pleasure and for 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.070
 this video the title and the subscribers farm 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.380
 it's actually two people's gameplay 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.150
 the loose like a clan who shared 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.580
 in fact so there the clan is really 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.080
 start a super cool you'll see 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.630
 that's a pleasure but before this 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.159
 video how big is this game 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.180
 breasts too much but but I think that's 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.159
 necessary because really for 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.979
 explain a little everything that has happened 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.570
 spent during those months of the spear so 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.820
 exchange is on vacation with friends from 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.579
 from the family and that's what I wanted 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.860
 to say that I must not 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.720
 I do not usually forget about this 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.700
 either in relation to him so my top nude 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 maker for my person who makes me but 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.119
 miniature of videos really a big 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 big big up to him is called casey at 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.560
 clash of france if you want to go 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.729
 see him watching the inscriptions there are 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.380
 the link of his channel on youtube at 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.840
 reclassification that really makes you liked 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.280
 nature of madness of friends it makes me everything 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.299
 best for some time and that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.100
 is really very happy he is 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.020
 really very nice finally brief so we 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.640
 will start directly in the video 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.509
 friends the first alps the two enhco 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.189
 so of the candlelight clan like you 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.049
 had said it and he is cut off on a 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.640
 a little bit that goes in all directions 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.310
 He giant sorcerers of 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.900
 barbarians of the goblin archers 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.040
 healers etc Serwa Forgiveness in 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.209
 what his daughter in danger over played with 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.319
 the driver also because I have a 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.760
 I can stop everything for the holidays 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.290
 really pauses it's the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.610
 holiday invites them so the scales 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.170
 all these giants all these wizards 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.090
 really on the same line but it's 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.580
 not stupid he is not stupid van khoi but 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.290
 his healing spell to kill everything dies 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.680
 all to have a shot so this is a 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.060
 naughty game relatively not easy but 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.830
 no deficit it's a bit of a village 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.410

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.280

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.200

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.440
 for a week we really just 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.299
 for an inconvenience this type is profitable from 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.519
 blow for a moment we found full 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.700
 of resource base does it all 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.540
 simply and uncle to him he told himself 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.680
 we are going to make the resources not go 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.609
 also do the stars because there 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.340
 you 'll see you see he's out 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.420
 of them so they seek so I think 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.180
 to the stars so he will try to do 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.400
 maximum possible damage 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.489
 canvases possible so here's the guys 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.109
 so there really it is extremely 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.160
 pleasure to make this video I say 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.630
 again because that makes 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.130
 so much waited to announce no 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.840
 excuse me because I have when we have 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.920
 taken in the house 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.100
 and here it is really very very 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.060
 pleasure this video is here it is I 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.459
 not sure if any other videos well in 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.980
 this week only the future will tell us 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.940
 friends here so if you want I 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.600
 can talk a little bit about holidays 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.200
 because I passed two 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.389
 weeks to face and if you do not know 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.500
 I had an internship and that I had 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.000
 said many times so I think if 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.170
 you are a long time subscriber 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.639
 you know but if you are a subscriber 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.470
 recent you know now I had 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.660
 an internship is what made me this 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.350
 removed a less big one because I had 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.950
 in the world two months of vacation 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.870
 as everyone is going to say 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.010
 I had a month of vacation so this 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.079
 that I did I left two 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.450
 weeks with friends finally with a friend 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.940
 rather a week we left in the 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.260
 north of france in normandy to 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.060
 deauville thinks an act know 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
 and then clearly completely ali 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.419
 the opposite of France 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.190
 we are in the south we will be completely 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.270

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.610
 there I am left two weeks in 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.690
 my normal place we will say where I am 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.160
 usually there you see that I'm filming 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.979
 in a place you know 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.630
 I imagine if you look at my videos and 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.590
 I would say, however, two weeks later 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.510

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.930

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.780

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.800
