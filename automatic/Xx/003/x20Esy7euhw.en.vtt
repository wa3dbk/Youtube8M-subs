if you open them all at once you don't
get<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.640> amount<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.180> gold<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.990> get

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
get to see the amount of gold you get

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.620 
get to see the amount of gold you get
independently<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> mean<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.969> get<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
independently I mean you get to see the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.499 
independently I mean you get to see the
final<00:02:06.659> amount<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.619> don't<00:02:07.770> get<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.429> see

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
final amount but you don't get to see

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.089 
final amount but you don't get to see
how<00:02:09.509> much<00:02:09.690> every<00:02:10.170> crystal<00:02:10.560> gives<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.920> which

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
how much every crystal gives you which

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.760 
how much every crystal gives you which
really<00:02:11.310> stinks<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:12.330> here<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.690> are<00:02:12.720> home

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
really stinks but here we are home

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.900 
really stinks but here we are home
fully<00:02:13.920> working<00:02:14.100> again<00:02:14.370> sometime<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.850> to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
fully working again sometime going to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.970 
fully working again sometime going to
tap<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.300> because<00:02:16.110> obviously<00:02:16.440> there's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
tap on it because obviously there's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.520 
tap on it because obviously there's
nothing<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.460> look<00:02:17.610> at<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.270> might<00:02:18.990> as<00:02:19.170> well<00:02:19.350> just

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
nothing to look at so might as well just

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.990 
nothing to look at so might as well just
tap<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:23.360> okay<00:02:24.360> we're<00:02:24.510> getting<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:25.020> lot<00:02:25.320> of

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
tap on it okay we're getting a lot of

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.700 
tap on it okay we're getting a lot of
2400<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.960> two<00:02:28.110> thousand<00:02:28.560> four<00:02:28.680> hundred

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
2400 so we get two thousand four hundred

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.780 
2400 so we get two thousand four hundred
gold<00:02:29.160> how<00:02:30.030> much<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.420> converted<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.620> to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
gold how much is that converted in to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:40.700 
gold how much is that converted in to
dollars<00:02:32.790> anyways<00:02:38.930> alright<00:02:39.930> still<00:02:40.230> spinning

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
dollars anyways alright still spinning

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.970 
dollars anyways alright still spinning
again<00:02:41.180> I'm<00:02:42.180> hoping<00:02:42.510> at<00:02:42.990> least<00:02:43.050> give<00:02:43.560> me<00:02:43.590> like

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
again I'm hoping at least give me like

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.550 
again I'm hoping at least give me like
ten<00:02:44.490> thousand<00:02:45.210> that<00:02:45.750> would<00:02:45.930> be<00:02:46.110> nice<00:02:46.340> all<00:02:48.560> 2400

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
ten thousand that would be nice all 2400

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.110 
ten thousand that would be nice all 2400
again<00:02:50.220> oh<00:02:50.930> gosh<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.520> don't<00:02:53.520> know<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
again oh gosh I don't know is that the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.450 
again oh gosh I don't know is that the
smallest<00:02:54.600> amount<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.410> get<00:02:55.650> I'm<00:02:56.160> just

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
smallest amount that we can get I'm just

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.800 
smallest amount that we can get I'm just
wondering<00:02:57.410> how<00:02:58.410> many<00:02:58.470> gold<00:02:58.860> do<00:02:59.730> we<00:02:59.790> have

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.170 

that's<00:03:03.810> why<00:03:04.050> I'm<00:03:04.440> like<00:03:04.710> do<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.730> best<00:03:05.940> way

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
that's why I'm like do you the best way

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.660 
that's why I'm like do you the best way
to<00:03:06.750> get<00:03:06.930> gold<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.620> through<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> battleships

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
to get gold is through the battleships

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.060 
to get gold is through the battleships
but<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.600> know<00:03:09.720> getting<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.260> battleships<00:03:10.920> is

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
but you know getting the battleships is

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.360 
but you know getting the battleships is
hard<00:03:11.310> now<00:03:11.550> obviously<00:03:12.830> usually<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.860> used<00:03:14.100> to

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
hard now obviously usually I used to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.250 
hard now obviously usually I used to
compete<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:15.120> arena<00:03:15.420> for<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.780> characters

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
compete in the arena for the characters

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.900 
compete in the arena for the characters
now<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.530> don't<00:03:16.800> think<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.160> can<00:03:17.340> compete<00:03:17.640> in<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
now I don't think I can compete in the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.470 
now I don't think I can compete in the
arena<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.480> oh<00:03:19.010> gosh<00:03:20.010> we're<00:03:20.670> getting<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> gold

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
arena so oh gosh we're getting the gold

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.640 
arena so oh gosh we're getting the gold
crystal<00:03:25.130> it's<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:27.080> don't<00:03:28.080> they<00:03:28.260> have<00:03:28.410> any

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
crystal it's like don't they have any

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.040 
crystal it's like don't they have any
other<00:03:28.830> dollars<00:03:29.400> like<00:03:29.580> 5,000<00:03:30.480> or<00:03:30.570> something

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
other dollars like 5,000 or something

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.190 
other dollars like 5,000 or something
why<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:31.650> two<00:03:31.920> hundred<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.580> mean<00:03:33.200> 2,400

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
why is it all two hundred I mean 2,400

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.400 
why is it all two hundred I mean 2,400
it<00:03:34.260> sounded<00:03:34.680> strange<00:03:35.780> really<00:03:36.780> strange<00:03:36.930> in

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
it sounded strange really strange in

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.750 
it sounded strange really strange in
fact<00:03:38.840> but<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.560> what<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:40.830> is<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.490> can't

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
fact but it is what it is you can't

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.110 
fact but it is what it is you can't
really<00:03:42.000> change<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.360> numbers<00:03:43.970> hopefully<00:03:44.970> we

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
really change the numbers hopefully we

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.540 
really change the numbers hopefully we
get<00:03:45.270> you<00:03:45.990> know<00:03:46.020> hopefully<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.470> was<00:03:47.130> looking<00:03:47.400> for

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
get you know hopefully I was looking for

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.130 
get you know hopefully I was looking for
that<00:03:47.640> 50,000

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.640 

oh<00:03:53.670> boy<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:55.030> don't<00:03:55.720> know<00:03:55.810> what<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.140> say<00:03:56.170> I<00:03:56.380> mean<00:03:56.470> I

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
at once but they should independently

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.880 
at once but they should independently

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
know then I don't know what each crystal

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.400 
know then I don't know what each crystal
gave<00:04:11.140> me<00:04:11.410> which<00:04:11.770> really<00:04:12.580> stinks<00:04:12.760> right

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
all at once but might as well do this

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.990 
all at once but might as well do this
because<00:06:17.110> I<00:06:17.680> can't<00:06:18.040> really<00:06:18.310> see<00:06:18.520> what's<00:06:18.820> in

there when I do open them all at once

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:30.890 
there when I do open them all at once
which<00:06:21.760> really<00:06:22.450> stinks<00:06:25.710> okay<00:06:27.840> 2400<00:06:28.840> again<00:06:29.410> I

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
which really stinks okay 2400 again I

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.540 
which really stinks okay 2400 again I
think<00:06:31.900> it's<00:06:32.200> getting<00:06:32.620> pretty<00:06:32.740> much<00:06:33.040> end<00:06:33.340> off

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
think it's getting pretty much end off

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.850 
think it's getting pretty much end off
of<00:06:33.900> 2400<00:06:34.900> I<00:06:34.960> don't<00:06:35.140> think<00:06:35.350> there's<00:06:35.530> any<00:06:35.680> other
