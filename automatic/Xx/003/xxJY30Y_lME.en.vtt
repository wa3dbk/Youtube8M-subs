slow<00:00:27.090> no<00:00:27.300> longer<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> case<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:29.130> you

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
slow no longer the case so as you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.060 
slow no longer the case so as you
previously<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.980> scene<00:00:31.980> when<00:00:32.550> he<00:00:32.700> ganks<00:00:33.149> he<00:00:34.070> has

previously a scene when he ganks he has

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.709 
previously a scene when he ganks he has
a<00:00:35.100> very<00:00:35.520> good<00:00:36.000> reading<00:00:36.420> than<00:00:36.570> they'd

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
a very good reading than they'd

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
a very good reading than they'd
sort<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.200> escape<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> end<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.399> very

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
sort of escape at the end it is very

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.990 
sort of escape at the end it is very
annoying<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.070> now<00:00:41.070> he<00:00:41.129> has<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> minimum<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
annoying and now he has a minimum of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
annoying and now he has a minimum of
throw<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.570> four<00:00:42.809> hundred<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.410> fifty<00:00:43.829> units<00:00:44.100> so

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
throw of four hundred and fifty units so

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.950 
throw of four hundred and fifty units so
I'm<00:00:44.370> assuming<00:00:45.200> just<00:00:46.200> imagine<00:00:47.719> you<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.809> when

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I'm assuming just imagine you know when

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.220 
I'm assuming just imagine you know when
Oh<00:00:49.079> laughs<00:00:49.350> Q<00:00:49.680> could<00:00:50.129> go<00:00:50.340> through<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:53.190> know

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.549 

different<00:00:58.640> ranges<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.879> guess<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.379> think<00:01:01.379> it's

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
different ranges I guess I think it's

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.700 
different ranges I guess I think it's
now<00:01:01.829> stuck<00:01:02.550> onto<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.940> range<00:01:03.210> instead<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.809> going

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
now stuck onto a range instead of going

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.060 
now stuck onto a range instead of going
up<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.010> down<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.990> changing<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.860> really

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
up and down and changing that's really

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.399 
up and down and changing that's really
hard<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.250> explain<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.880> access<00:01:09.240> now<00:01:09.390> stick<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
hard to explain but access now stick to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.170 
hard to explain but access now stick to
walls<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.070> structures<00:01:11.640> rather<00:01:11.850> than<00:01:11.939> going

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
walls and structures rather than going

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.859 
walls and structures rather than going
through<00:01:12.270> them<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:12.960> sure<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:14.630> it's<00:01:15.630> good

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
through them I'm not sure that it's good

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.670 
through them I'm not sure that it's good
or<00:01:16.350> bad<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.920> guess<00:01:17.040> he<00:01:17.460> won't<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.640> able<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> throw

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
or bad I guess he won't be able to throw

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
or bad I guess he won't be able to throw
through<00:01:19.680> walls<00:01:19.860> as<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> very<00:01:20.549> good<00:01:20.700> gap<00:01:20.909> closer

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
through walls as a very good gap closer

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.550 
through walls as a very good gap closer
anymore<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.590> ok<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:24.290> slow<00:01:25.290> sort

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
anymore but it is ok because slow sort

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.980 
anymore but it is ok because slow sort
of<00:01:25.650> makes<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.880> hit<00:01:27.210> land

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
of makes up for it if you do hit land

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.530 
of makes up for it if you do hit land
your<00:01:28.170> cube<00:01:28.500> beforehand<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.340> look<00:01:29.909> at<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> w

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
your cube beforehand then look at the w

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.230 
your cube beforehand then look at the w
mana<00:01:31.350> costs<00:01:31.680> reduced<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> 25<00:01:32.340> from<00:01:33.119> 40<00:01:33.600> 45<00:01:34.170> so

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
mana costs reduced to 25 from 40 45 so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.289 
mana costs reduced to 25 from 40 45 so
really<00:01:36.240> buffed<00:01:36.479> his<00:01:36.689> manner<00:01:37.970> used<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.180> these

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
really buffed his manner used for these

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.370 
really buffed his manner used for these
w<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.750> that's<00:01:39.900> also<00:01:40.350> been<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.040> bad

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
w and that's also been a really bad

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.980 
w and that's also been a really bad
factor<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.470> our<00:01:43.649> life<00:01:43.829> he's<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.780> very<00:01:45.780> good

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
factor of our life he's a very good

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.719 
factor of our life he's a very good
journalist<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.619> sometimes<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.220> runs<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.700> of

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
journalist but sometimes you runs out of

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.450 
journalist but sometimes you runs out of
mana<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.689> mid<00:01:48.960> Jill<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.470> he<00:01:49.560> can't<00:01:49.799> use<00:01:49.979> his<00:01:50.009> W

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
mana in mid Jill and he can't use his W

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.030 
mana in mid Jill and he can't use his W
which<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> huge<00:01:51.180> factor<00:01:51.890> for<00:01:52.890> him<00:01:53.070> to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
which is a huge factor for him to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.160 
which is a huge factor for him to
compete<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.549> 1v1<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.479> he<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.960> needs

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
compete in a 1v1 because he really needs

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
compete in a 1v1 because he really needs
that<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:59.009> order<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.490> sustain<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.149> fight<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.570> I

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that in order to sustain the fight and I

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.940 
that in order to sustain the fight and I
think<00:02:00.869> right<00:02:01.049> wanted<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.619> UM<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.530> point

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
think right wanted to UM to really point

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.190 
think right wanted to UM to really point
out<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.850> wanted<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.750> wanted<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
out that we wanted that they wanted to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
out that we wanted that they wanted to
laugh<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> long-lasting<00:02:08.340> fight<00:02:09.090> instead

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
laugh to be a long-lasting fight instead

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.600 
laugh to be a long-lasting fight instead
of<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.569> really<00:02:09.810> bursty<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.610> they've

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
of a really bursty one and they've

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.180 
of a really bursty one and they've

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
they don't want him to be like a flat

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.490 
they don't want him to be like a flat
fighter<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:20.000> want<00:02:20.780> them<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.960> be<00:02:21.080> sort<00:02:21.320> of<00:02:21.350> a

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
fighter I want them to be sort of a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.880 
fighter I want them to be sort of a
sustainable<00:02:22.100> champion<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.170> think<00:02:24.260> if<00:02:24.470> its

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
sustainable champion and I think if its

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.760 
sustainable champion and I think if its
chief<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.430> because<00:02:26.000> now<00:02:26.870> provides<00:02:27.230> 1%

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
chief that because now provides 1%

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.340 
chief that because now provides 1%
enhanced<00:02:28.250> healing<00:02:28.430> from<00:02:28.790> all<00:02:29.090> sources<00:02:29.570> 2%

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.380 
enhanced healing from all sources 2%
health<00:02:31.010> or<00:02:31.280> life<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.640> missing<00:02:31.970> during<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
health or life is missing during the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.800 
health or life is missing during the
duration<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.880> it's<00:02:34.880> an<00:02:35.030> addition<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
duration and it's an addition to the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.770 
duration and it's an addition to the
country<00:02:36.170> connects<00:02:36.440> on<00:02:36.560> w<00:02:36.860> not<00:02:37.010> replacing<00:02:37.610> them

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
country connects on w not replacing them

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.490 
country connects on w not replacing them
so<00:02:38.780> that's<00:02:38.930> really<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:41.180> r<00:02:41.420> he's<00:02:41.960> all

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
so that's really on the r he's all

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.180 
so that's really on the r he's all
he's<00:02:42.830> old<00:02:43.010> he<00:02:43.130> Amanda<00:02:44.060> Kost<00:02:44.270> removed<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:46.070> is

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
he's old he Amanda Kost removed so it is

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.100 
he's old he Amanda Kost removed so it is
now<00:02:46.340> free<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.820> cast<00:02:47.240> after<00:02:47.600> he<00:02:47.840> has<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.960> really

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
interesting interesting active change

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.479 
interesting interesting active change
because<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.390> has<00:03:38.660> really<00:03:38.930> sort<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:39.920> buffed<00:03:40.220> him

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
because it has really sort of buffed him

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.870 
because it has really sort of buffed him
in<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.930> good<00:03:42.050> way<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.470> think<00:03:43.220> they've<00:03:43.459> done<00:03:43.820> a

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
in a good way I think they've done a

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.320 
in a good way I think they've done a
really<00:03:43.970> good<00:03:44.450> job<00:03:45.820> changing<00:03:46.820> or<00:03:46.940> laughs<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.300> I

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
really good job changing or laughs and I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.940 
really good job changing or laughs and I
think<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.630> ultimate<00:03:48.050> is<00:03:48.260> going<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.650> give<00:03:48.800> him

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
think the ultimate is going to give him

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.620 
think the ultimate is going to give him
a<00:03:49.040> bit<00:03:49.780> better<00:03:52.690> give<00:03:53.690> him<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.870> better<00:03:54.190> advantage

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
a bit better give him a better advantage

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.620 
a bit better give him a better advantage
in<00:03:56.630> duels<00:03:57.050> he's<00:03:57.650> not<00:03:57.769> exactly<00:03:58.130> week<00:03:58.630> but

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
in duels he's not exactly week but

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.050 
in duels he's not exactly week but
sometimes<00:04:00.230> he's<00:04:00.739> old<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.160> just<00:04:01.400> nearly

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
sometimes he's old is just nearly

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.680 
sometimes he's old is just nearly
pointless<00:04:02.390> as<00:04:02.750> just<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.170> get<00:04:03.410> away<00:04:03.530> from<00:04:03.620> CC

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
pointless as just to get away from CC

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.630 
pointless as just to get away from CC
obviously<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.840> attack<00:04:06.170> speed<00:04:06.500> buff<00:04:07.070> is

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
obviously the attack speed buff is

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.270 
obviously the attack speed buff is
definitely<00:04:08.060> going<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.410> help<00:04:09.410> him<00:04:09.650> in<00:04:09.980> those

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
definitely going to help him in those

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.070 
definitely going to help him in those
situations<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:11.000> I'd<00:04:11.420> like<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.840> note<00:04:12.050> that
