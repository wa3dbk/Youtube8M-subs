pretty<00:02:00.159> tricky<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.880> get<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.270> isn't<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.690> reload

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
pretty tricky to get this isn't a reload

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.080 
pretty tricky to get this isn't a reload
thing<00:02:02.350> but<00:02:03.220> um<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.950> hard<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.369> get<00:02:06.550> back<00:02:06.759> in

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
thing but um it's hard to get back in

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.570 
thing but um it's hard to get back in
you<00:02:07.330> can<00:02:07.450> pull<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.750> out<00:02:07.869> really<00:02:08.200> easy<00:02:11.580> just

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
you can pull it out really easy just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.229 
you can pull it out really easy just
like<00:02:12.910> right<00:02:13.180> out<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:14.140> um<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.790> hard<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.120> get

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
like right out but um it's hard to get

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.970 
like right out but um it's hard to get
back<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.930> doesn't<00:02:17.230> just<00:02:17.260> go<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:17.709> this

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
back in it doesn't just go like this

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.340 
back in it doesn't just go like this
because<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.430> doesn't<00:02:18.730> go<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.989> got<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.260> go

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
because it doesn't go in you got to go

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:29.340 
because it doesn't go in you got to go
at<00:02:20.500> this<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:27.340> goes<00:02:27.610> kind<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:27.970> crooked<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.510> then

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
at this it goes kind of crooked and then

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.240 
at this it goes kind of crooked and then
whenever<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.769> want<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.040> shoot<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.980> put<00:02:36.160> it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
whenever you want to shoot just put it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:49.530
