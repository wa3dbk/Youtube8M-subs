00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
redoing this tutorial to condense a few

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720 
redoing this tutorial to condense a few
things<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.960> also<00:00:13.500> because<00:00:13.799> public<00:00:14.370> matches

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
things and also because public matches

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.570 
things and also because public matches
for<00:00:14.880> black<00:00:15.030> ops<00:00:15.179> 2<00:00:15.450> got<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> nice<00:00:15.929> little<00:00:16.109> update

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.740 
for black ops 2 got a nice little update
it<00:00:17.580> seems<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:17.940> now<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.300> every<00:00:18.600> single

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
it seems like now that every single

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.260 
it seems like now that every single
publican<00:00:19.320> has<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> chance<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.250> get<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.580> dedicated

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
publican has a chance to get a dedicated

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.960 
publican has a chance to get a dedicated
server<00:00:22.010> keep<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.130> mind<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.580> not<00:00:23.640> every

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
server keep in mind this is not every

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.689 
server keep in mind this is not every
game<00:00:24.150> as<00:00:24.539> people<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:25.019> still<00:00:25.289> pull<00:00:25.500> hoes<00:00:25.710> but

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
game as people can still pull hoes but

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.980 
game as people can still pull hoes but
it's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> nice<00:00:27.060> little<00:00:27.210> addition<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
it's a nice little addition as is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.750 
it's a nice little addition as is
possible<00:00:28.170> not<00:00:28.500> hide<00:00:28.769> your<00:00:28.890> IP<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.250> every

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
possible not hide your IP in every

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.150 
possible not hide your IP in every
single<00:00:29.880> public<00:00:30.330> match<00:00:30.800> it's<00:00:31.800> also<00:00:31.920> possible

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
single public match it's also possible

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.459

for<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.910> dedicated<00:00:33.120> server<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.440> can

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
for a dedicated server and you can

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.020 
for a dedicated server and you can
actually<00:00:34.739> prevent<00:00:35.130> dedicated<00:00:35.610> servers<00:00:35.910> if

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030

will be kicked out of the game before it
even<00:05:37.890> starts<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:38.550> just

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
even starts and just

if<00:05:40.889> the<00:05:40.949> game<00:05:41.099> did<00:05:41.309> start<00:05:41.579> and<00:05:42.419> you'll<00:05:42.599> be<00:05:42.689> fine

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:42.869 
if the game did start and you'll be fine

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:45.019 
if the game did start and you'll be fine
I<00:05:43.169> have<00:05:43.619> had<00:05:43.769> only<00:05:44.039> once<00:05:44.459> that<00:05:44.549> the<00:05:44.729> game<00:05:44.849> has

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
I have had only once that the game has

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:47.059 
I have had only once that the game has
actually<00:05:45.360> started<00:05:45.959> with<00:05:46.409> me<00:05:46.559> blocking<00:05:46.979> him

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
actually started with me blocking him

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.129 
actually started with me blocking him
but<00:05:47.579> I<00:05:47.849> think<00:05:48.329> that<00:05:48.419> was<00:05:48.509> just<00:05:48.689> a<00:05:48.749> fluke<00:05:48.839> I<00:05:49.019> had

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
but I think that was just a fluke I had

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.779 
but I think that was just a fluke I had
no<00:05:49.289> idea<00:05:49.559> what<00:05:49.829> the<00:05:49.949> hell<00:05:50.129> happened<00:05:50.579> and

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
no idea what the hell happened and

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.269 
no idea what the hell happened and
luckily<00:05:51.299> they<00:05:51.479> didn't<00:05:51.689> -<00:05:51.839> in<00:05:52.739> this<00:05:52.860> tutorial

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
luckily they didn't - in this tutorial

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.309 
luckily they didn't - in this tutorial
we<00:05:53.549> went<00:05:53.759> over<00:05:54.029> forcing<00:05:54.479> dedicated<00:05:54.959> servers

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 
we went over forcing dedicated servers

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.899 
we went over forcing dedicated servers
there<00:05:55.860> were<00:05:56.039> people<00:05:56.189> who<00:05:56.369> don't<00:05:56.610> care<00:05:56.879> about

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
there were people who don't care about

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.219 
there were people who don't care about
having<00:05:57.209> hosting<00:05:57.659> they<00:05:57.719> just<00:05:57.869> want<00:05:58.019> to<00:05:58.079> have<00:05:58.169> a

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:11.999 
a little risky doing this because Kane

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:14.079 
a little risky doing this because Kane
has<00:06:12.299> been<00:06:12.869> known<00:06:13.079> to<00:06:13.110> crash<00:06:13.439> for<00:06:13.469> me

of the game we also went over preventing

of the game we also went over preventing
a<00:06:19.199> dedicated<00:06:19.559> server<00:06:19.860> I<00:06:20.149> don't<00:06:21.149> see<00:06:21.269> why

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
a dedicated server I don't see why

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.019 
a dedicated server I don't see why
anyone<00:06:21.419> would<00:06:21.869> do<00:06:22.139> this<00:06:22.349> without<00:06:22.619> actually

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
anyone would do this without actually

someone else host

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:40.759 
someone else host
otherwise<00:06:38.849> you'll<00:06:39.119> be<00:06:39.149> put<00:06:39.389> into<00:06:39.509> a<00:06:39.599> game<00:06:39.869> all

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:40.769 
otherwise you'll be put into a game all

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:41.929 
otherwise you'll be put into a game all
in<00:06:40.829> all<00:06:41.099> I<00:06:41.129> think<00:06:41.429> that's<00:06:41.579> pretty<00:06:41.759> much

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:41.939 
in all I think that's pretty much

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.699 
in all I think that's pretty much
everything<00:06:42.119> there's<00:06:43.110> more<00:06:43.319> things<00:06:43.499> you<00:06:43.589> can

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:43.709 
everything there's more things you can

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:44.689 
everything there's more things you can
do<00:06:43.800> with<00:06:43.919> this<00:06:44.009> but<00:06:44.129> I<00:06:44.189> really<00:06:44.399> don't<00:06:44.519> want<00:06:44.639> to

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
do with this but I really don't want to

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.879 
do with this but I really don't want to
show<00:06:44.819> people<00:06:45.059> how<00:06:45.539> to<00:06:45.569> do<00:06:45.839> this<00:06:46.019> because<00:06:46.649> I'm

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:46.889 
show people how to do this because I'm

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.139 
show people how to do this because I'm
pretty<00:06:47.189> sure<00:06:47.429> people<00:06:47.459> will<00:06:47.849> just<00:06:48.029> start

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:48.149 
pretty sure people will just start

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:51.319 
pretty sure people will just start
abusing<00:06:48.389> doing<00:06:49.319> this<00:06:49.469> crap<00:06:49.889> I<00:06:50.189> think<00:06:50.789> people

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:51.329 
abusing doing this crap I think people

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:53.929 
abusing doing this crap I think people
can<00:06:51.419> agree<00:06:51.719> but<00:06:52.619> all<00:06:52.739> in<00:06:52.860> all<00:06:52.979> I<00:06:53.249> think<00:06:53.759> that's

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:53.939 
can agree but all in all I think that's

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:54.379 
can agree but all in all I think that's
everything

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
everything

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.229 
everything
