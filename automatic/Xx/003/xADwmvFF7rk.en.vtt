00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.719
 The slender shape of the trainer 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.679
 I will explain the foreign student minister and the way of action model 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.439
 The reason why comes with work 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.039
 Clean up the riot 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.310
 It is very important to clean the statement 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.310
 Is 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.320
 Then I put it on the board for each part properly 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.770
 Whether it is in the riot outline 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.960
 I checked the whole image 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.080
 Change the direction of the land in the press agreement with the Wax Ministry 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.880
 By 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.500
 To fit various code outlines 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.480
 Designed 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.480
 Kao, whichever weapon please cite here 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.790
 Do you put it on the market that you want to do? 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 I removed the thread according to the shape 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.180
 Using it from above 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.030
 I cut the sheet with a cutter 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.810
 A quilt hail to see if it's a puff after it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 It looks like 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 Then the first piece is eight places 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.890
 I will talk about Urakami at the slit part of the center 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.000
 When I decided 1 it was in soft joint 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.330
 Less than 1 outside like carefully hold from the management of the slit part 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.010
 Next I'm in charge of stringer guard and it 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.910
 I spoke Urakami a bit 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.960
 And from the center I want 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.790
 I will slowly enter Heisei in the direction of the stringer 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.140
 At that time, be careful not to pull people who are more than necessary 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.140
 please 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.659
 We received treatment with capital roller to finish 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.829
 continue 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.159
 While spreading the Berger 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.469
 I spoke Urakami a bit 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.839
 And spread the power from the seat center slowly and carefully 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.699
 I will enter 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:37.509
 Do not pull the sheet more than necessary as before 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.509
 be careful 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:45.340
 In the same way 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.609
 Can finish the roller and apply body pressure 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.489
 If there is no poller 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.489
 You may use Toray etc. 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.299
 There is a possibility that a room has entered into the area by any chance 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.409
 Make a small hole in the student with a tip or a tear to win 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.409
 Please kick out the room with a roller etc. 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:13.149
 Also mark the side which is not the same as the 1st sheet with a stool 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.069
 Secure a sheet 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.739
 The card after the cut is a fraudulent quilt flow 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.739
 It becomes prevention 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:25.979
 Here are the notes 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.869
 If yarns do not 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.989
 c. Take a distance of about mm 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.799
 Then there are also areas with stretches 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.649
 Easy to overlap 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:43.769
 If it happens, it will cause separation. 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.759
 In the case of the second and subsequent series 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.699
 be careful 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.179
 Let's wait for the second generation 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:57.579
 In the same way as the first sheet, the large center of the attached center is 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.019
 Break through 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.039
 We decide base and cosponsor 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.039
 First we will run in the direction of the stringer 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:11.780
 continue 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.780
 I will break in the direction to come out 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.859
 The first piece of the third piece is the first 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.979
 Masaru Murakami of the joint part of the center 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.050
 Cultivate one decided 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.050
 First of all, we will fight against Stringer 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.809
 continue 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:34.809
 I will go in the direction to get out 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.499
 Let's finish four 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:48.499
 Murakami tears off the part of the center 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.529
 Installed in the road 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.529
 First we will go in the direction of the stringer 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:02.840
 continue 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.840
 I will try to live direction 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.599
 And I finish rolling over the whole that I finished last 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.599
 I will 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.639
 This is completed 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.729
 Avoid using immediately and store for more than 24 hours as it is 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.059
 please 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:31.289
