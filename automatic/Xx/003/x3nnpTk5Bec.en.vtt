00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
to engage in premarital sex and that's

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.160 
to engage in premarital sex and that's
bad<00:01:00.190> that's<00:01:00.220> a<00:01:00.489> sin<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:00.820> Bible<00:01:01.089> says<00:01:01.269> so<00:01:01.510> but

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
bad that's a sin the Bible says so but

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.360 
bad that's a sin the Bible says so but
like<00:01:02.350> if<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.530> have<00:01:02.680> that<00:01:02.829> big<00:01:02.920> of<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.129> problem

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
like if you have that big of a problem

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.160 
like if you have that big of a problem
with<00:01:03.640> premarital<00:01:03.970> sex<00:01:04.390> there's<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.659> solution

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
with premarital sex there's a solution

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.380 
with premarital sex there's a solution
and<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.890> solution<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.340> premarital<00:01:06.670> sex<00:01:07.060> isn't

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
and the solution to premarital sex isn't

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.960 
and the solution to premarital sex isn't
abstinence<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.470> solution<00:01:08.740> is<00:01:08.979> just<00:01:09.039> don't

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
abstinence the solution is just don't

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.200 
abstinence the solution is just don't
ever<00:01:10.180> get<00:01:10.539> married

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.760 

right<00:01:14.840> because<00:01:14.930> then<00:01:15.110> it's<00:01:15.260> not<00:01:15.350> premarital

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
right because then it's not premarital

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.260 
right because then it's not premarital
it's<00:01:15.920> just<00:01:16.070> fucking<00:01:16.280> right<00:01:16.580> it's<00:01:16.760> just<00:01:16.909> good

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
it's just fucking right it's just good

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.060 
it's just fucking right it's just good
old-fashioned

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.830 

to<00:01:22.670> kind<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:22.909> stuff<00:01:23.060> our<00:01:23.150> parents<00:01:23.480> grew<00:01:23.600> up<00:01:23.690> on

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
to kind of stuff our parents grew up on

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.440 
to kind of stuff our parents grew up on
so<00:01:24.110> yeah<00:01:24.790> plus<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:25.909> don't<00:01:26.000> think<00:01:26.210> we<00:01:26.270> should

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
so yeah plus I don't think we should

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.060 
so yeah plus I don't think we should
give<00:01:26.630> condoms<00:01:27.050> to<00:01:27.140> teenagers<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:27.650> high<00:01:27.800> school

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
give condoms to teenagers in high school

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.560 
give condoms to teenagers in high school
I<00:01:28.100> think<00:01:28.370> instead<00:01:28.640> what<00:01:28.850> we<00:01:28.940> should<00:01:29.150> do<00:01:29.330> is

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
I think instead what we should do is

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.880 
I think instead what we should do is
give<00:01:30.080> them<00:01:30.170> sex<00:01:30.470> toys<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:33.440> that's<00:01:33.800> just

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
give them sex toys and that's just

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.930 
give them sex toys and that's just
because<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.340> have<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.550> learn<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.729> love

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
because you have to learn to love

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.100 
because you have to learn to love
yourself<00:01:35.060> before<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.720> can<00:01:35.810> love<00:01:35.869> other

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
yourself before you can love other

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.770 
yourself before you can love other
people<00:01:36.170> that's<00:01:36.590> really<00:01:36.890> my<00:01:37.300> message<00:01:38.300> here<00:01:38.510> for

it out together it's brutal but it's

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.060 
it out together it's brutal but it's
still<00:02:57.230> graceful<00:02:57.680> because<00:02:57.890> they've<00:02:58.040> been

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
still graceful because they've been

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.100 
still graceful because they've been
highly<00:02:58.550> trained<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:58.940> like<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.270> think<00:02:59.990> that's
