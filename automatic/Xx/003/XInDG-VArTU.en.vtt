00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 all in this video of meat and balls 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.700
 let's show them what are the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.030
 basic care that we should have with 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.840
 our coarse toxic plants 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.660
 They catch insects through their leaves 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.690
 they have traps as you can see in flat 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.119
 there are little hairs they call filaments and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.880
 a few droplets at the ends is called 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.650
 mucilage this substance is adhesive and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.439
 It also has nutrients , therefore 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.529
 insect feels attracted comes flying 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.890
 and when it gets to the trap, 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.170
 immobilized 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.079
 later the plant what it does is 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.930
 go stooping his sheet and secreting 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.180
 enzymes that allow the insect to digest 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.190
 as in this case, notice that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.750
 started talking and just in fact we have 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.640
 an insect that is trying to get out 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.270
 good when we locate these plants 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.760
 always on the outside outside and that 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.000
 have a roof because because the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.130
 Midday radiation is very strong 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.630
 for plants and can reach the area 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.970
 of the then that have very good light 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.040
 but that he asked them for the noon we have 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.350
 Beware of very strong winds and 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.020
 be careful with temperatures 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.990
 above 38 degrees or below 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.840
 2 degrees below zero as they are watered 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.250
 let's go here we have another copy that 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.690
 is under irrigation 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.850
 whenever you put them in a 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.160
 any vessel for example this one 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.310
 that is clear of plastic is cast the 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.740
 water entered here then enter the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.110
 plant the plant absorbs the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.560
 Water 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.420
 and nothing more than that is very simple 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.390
 regulate every day that you always have 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.760
 water in the container a centimeter or a 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.080
 little bit notice that when you're 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.480
 well watered they will see that the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.000
 surface of the substrate will be a 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.590
 dark color you can form this 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.890
 moss that is good but softens not the 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.470
 weeks and do not be scared 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.850
 It is very easy as you can see a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.610
 maintenance that can be done to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.430
 these plants is to cut the leaves that 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.810
 are about to die are always the leaves of 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.940
 down normal that they are getting 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.060
 black as in this case where it gets 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.860
 the black end and then it grows 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.720
 the whole sheet what can you do 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.120
 to make your plants look better is 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.820
 take scissors disinfected give it 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.920
 alcohol in the century the scissors with 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.920
 cotton and subsequently 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.180
 they cut the leaf in its base 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.010
 It's that simple, nothing more than that 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.930
 an adversity that we can have with 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.250
 these plants is rare but you can 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.769
 get to happen especially when it does 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.280
 heat and aphids appear 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.330
 aphids are a plague 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.890
 an insect that carnivorous is not going to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.819
 to be able to eat 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.579
 young make 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.280
 these little white dots that you see 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:55.549
 on the screen they are very young then 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.459
 if it shows on camera but those little dots 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.379
 whites are aphids as they can 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.650
 control can also be black eyes 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.000
 to control them is the best if you 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.519
 they have on a plant is that they 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.170
 take out somehow with some cloth 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.239
 or with some tool they go 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.310
 dragging them out and pulling them out 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.560
 if you have more than one plant or the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.969
 infestation the infestation is very large 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.099
 what they can do is take some 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.260
 pyrethroid insecticide which are those of 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.299
 domestic use those who come do not want 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.909
 give marks but rotate the spray of use 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.500
 domestic are good at controlling 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.669
 pyrethroids even though usually 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.900
 you are going to find that you do not know 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.939
 recommend for carnivorous plants 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.769
 the insecticides we have done 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.469
 tests and we are satisfied with the 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.090
 good results this was how to take care of 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.799
 a rude I hope you liked it 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.359
 and soon we will upload new
