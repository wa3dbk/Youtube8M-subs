00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.350 

this<00:00:13.860> year<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.219> my<00:00:14.370> driving<00:00:14.580> position<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.240> my

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
this year is my driving position in my

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.170 
this year is my driving position in my
race<00:00:15.540> car<00:00:15.809> it's<00:00:16.770> very<00:00:17.070> much<00:00:17.279> lying<00:00:17.730> down<00:00:17.970> you

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
race car it's very much lying down you

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.490 
race car it's very much lying down you
know<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.450> you<00:00:18.570> can't<00:00:18.600> really<00:00:18.900> imagine<00:00:19.140> from

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
know is you can't really imagine from

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
know is you can't really imagine from
outside<00:00:19.860> but<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> way<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
outside but that's the way it is the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.450 
outside but that's the way it is the
feet<00:00:21.869> even<00:00:22.230> go<00:00:22.349> upwards<00:00:22.860> as<00:00:23.009> you<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.279> see

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
feet even go upwards as you can see

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.980 
feet even go upwards as you can see
because<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.970> cockpit<00:00:24.330> goes<00:00:24.360> up<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
because the cockpit goes up so the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.200 
because the cockpit goes up so the
pedals<00:00:25.290> are<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.529> there<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:26.490> looks<00:00:26.640> strange<00:00:26.939> but

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
pedals are up there it looks strange but

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.999 
pedals are up there it looks strange but
feels<00:00:27.630> quite<00:00:27.900> normal<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.860> not<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
feels quite normal and it's not a

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.530 
feels quite normal and it's not a
problem<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.430> really<00:00:29.669> feels<00:00:29.880> dynamic

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
problem it really feels dynamic

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.760 
problem it really feels dynamic
aggressive<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.169> it's<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.590> you're

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
aggressive you know it's not like you're

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.139 
aggressive you know it's not like you're
sleeping<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.220> there<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.460> fine<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:38.700> compromise

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
sleeping in there is fine the compromise

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.790 
sleeping in there is fine the compromise
is<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> little<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.350> need<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.680> as

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is a little bit that you need to be as

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.229 
is a little bit that you need to be as
low<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.190> possible<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
low as possible you know to get the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.600 
low as possible you know to get the
center<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.629> gravity<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> car<00:00:43.379> down<00:00:43.610> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
center of gravity in the car down and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
center of gravity in the car down and
then<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.270> always<00:00:45.390> difficult<00:00:45.720> sometimes<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
then it's always difficult sometimes to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
then it's always difficult sometimes to
see<00:00:46.740> where<00:00:46.890> you're<00:00:47.040> going<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.400> you're

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
see where you're going because you're

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
see where you're going because you're
sitting<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.060> low<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> car<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.200> very<00:00:49.410> often

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
sitting so low in the car so very often

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.200 
sitting so low in the car so very often
I<00:00:49.800> even<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.220> lean<00:00:50.400> up<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.120> bit

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
I even have to lean up with a little bit

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.090 
I even have to lean up with a little bit
with<00:00:51.329> my<00:00:51.450> head<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.200> see<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:52.530> corner<00:00:52.890> or

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
with my head to see the corner or

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
with my head to see the corner or
something<00:00:53.220> depending<00:00:53.970> on<00:00:54.120> where<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> am<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
something depending on where I am on the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.970 
something depending on where I am on the
track<00:00:56.090> then<00:00:57.090> also<00:00:57.240> the<00:00:57.540> making<00:00:58.380> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> seats

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
track then also the making of the seats

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.190 
track then also the making of the seats
is<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.520> really<00:01:00.000> difficult<00:01:00.180> process<00:01:00.810> because

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
is a really difficult process because

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.639 
is a really difficult process because
the<00:01:01.410> carbon<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.229> shape<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
the carbon is is really in the shape of

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.090 
the carbon is is really in the shape of
your<00:01:04.710> body<00:01:05.329> and<00:01:06.380> then<00:01:07.380> obviously<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.950> you're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
your body and then obviously if you're

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
your body and then obviously if you're
sitting<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.579> garage<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.000> making<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
sitting in the garage and making the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.730 
sitting in the garage and making the
seed<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.689> driving<00:01:09.899> out<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.170> track<00:01:10.530> where

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
seed or driving out on track where

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.109 
seed or driving out on track where
you're<00:01:10.860> dynamically<00:01:11.310> driving<00:01:11.790> changing

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
you're dynamically driving changing

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.340 
you're dynamically driving changing
position<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.930> completely<00:01:13.229> different

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
position it's a completely different

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.380 
position it's a completely different
feelings<00:01:13.829> so<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.399> of<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.729> sudden<00:01:15.030> things<00:01:15.210> will

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
feelings so all of a sudden things will

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.899 
feelings so all of a sudden things will
be<00:01:15.509> hurting<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:17.070> say<00:01:17.399> okay<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.670> need

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
be hurting and and I say okay I need

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.629 
be hurting and and I say okay I need
more<00:01:18.060> support<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:20.009> more<00:01:20.249> support<00:01:20.579> on

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:20.639 
more support here and more support on

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.099 
more support here and more support on
the<00:01:20.729> ribs<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.179> it's<00:01:21.299> difficult<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.899> more

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
the ribs but it's difficult to do more

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.440 
the ribs but it's difficult to do more
support<00:01:22.499> because<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.859> carbon<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.460> hard<00:01:23.759> so

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
support because the carbon is so hard so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.849 
support because the carbon is so hard so
very<00:01:24.689> often<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.109> have<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.350> put<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.679> bit

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
very often you have to put a little bit

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.069 
very often you have to put a little bit
of<00:01:25.889> bits<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.340> foam<00:01:26.520> everywhere<00:01:26.899> but<00:01:27.899> at<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
of bits of foam everywhere but at the

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.389 
of bits of foam everywhere but at the
same<00:01:28.289> time<00:01:28.469> you<00:01:28.649> don't<00:01:28.709> want<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.979> put<00:01:29.100> too<00:01:29.130> much

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
same time you don't want to put too much

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.459 
same time you don't want to put too much
foam<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:29.939> foam<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.389> very<00:01:30.569> heavy<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
foam because foam is very heavy and you

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.599 
foam because foam is very heavy and you
want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.679> keep<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> seat<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.219> light<00:01:32.459> as

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
want to keep the seat as light as

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.849 
want to keep the seat as light as
possible<00:01:32.639> so<00:01:33.569> that's<00:01:33.810> an<00:01:33.959> ongoing<00:01:34.289> process

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
possible so that's an ongoing process

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.819 
possible so that's an ongoing process
you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.729> difficult<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.299> find<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
you know it's very difficult to find the

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.739 
you know it's very difficult to find the
optimum<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.209> going<00:01:39.359> to<00:01:39.450> take<00:01:39.569> my

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
optimum now I'm going to take my

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.480 
optimum now I'm going to take my
steering<00:01:40.109> wheel<00:01:40.139> as<00:01:40.380> well<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.159> show

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
steering wheel as well just so you show

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.859 
steering wheel as well just so you show
you<00:01:41.549> how<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> position<00:01:42.209> is<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.539> steering

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you how the position is with a steering

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.410 
you how the position is with a steering
wheel<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.469> about<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.999> it's<00:01:45.149> also<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
wheel it's about here and it's also a
