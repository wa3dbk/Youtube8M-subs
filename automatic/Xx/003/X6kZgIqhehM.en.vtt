something off yeah my worst nightmare on

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.730 
something off yeah my worst nightmare on
a<00:00:26.789> sec<00:00:27.090> because<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.580> have<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> score<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.740> i'm

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
a sec because I have a score like i'm

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.270 
a sec because I have a score like i'm
not<00:00:32.040> sure<00:00:32.309> i<00:00:32.610> will<00:00:33.540> show<00:00:33.960> four<00:00:34.440> points<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
not sure i will show four points out of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.910 
not sure i will show four points out of
40<00:00:35.700> or<00:00:35.880> something<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:37.800> really<00:00:38.280> ridiculous

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
40 or something it's really ridiculous

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.139 
40 or something it's really ridiculous
but<00:00:41.000> he's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> strong<00:00:42.450> player<00:00:43.430> very<00:00:44.430> quick<00:00:44.789> and

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.920 

it<00:00:48.149> doesn't<00:00:48.510> make<00:00:48.690> many<00:00:48.930> mistakes<00:00:50.239> ok<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it doesn't make many mistakes ok got a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.319 
it doesn't make many mistakes ok got a
Catalan<00:00:52.800> opening<00:00:54.710> I'm<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.920> sure<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.610> some

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
Catalan opening I'm not sure if I'm some

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.570 
Catalan opening I'm not sure if I'm some
are<00:00:57.449> confused<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.379> loose<00:00:58.859> already<00:01:04.519> ok<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
are confused and loose already ok it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:23.679 
are confused and loose already ok it
still<00:01:05.939> looks<00:01:07.040> fairly<00:01:08.040> healthy

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.469 

so<00:01:24.689> rather<00:01:24.899> typical<00:01:25.700> endgame<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.119> cattle

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
so rather typical endgame for the cattle

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:36.950 
so rather typical endgame for the cattle
and<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:33.180> should<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.539> three<00:01:34.020> maybe<00:01:35.720> he's<00:01:36.720> having

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
and it should be three maybe he's having

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.730 
and it should be three maybe he's having
us<00:01:37.200> hanging<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:37.830> I<00:01:41.479> don't<00:01:42.479> mind<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.140> had<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
us hanging now I don't mind to I had the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.490 
us hanging now I don't mind to I had the
night<00:01:43.950> well<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.700> sure<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:46.259> night

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
night well so be sure because the night

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
night well so be sure because the night
always<00:01:46.920> has<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.310> chances<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:49.009> get<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:50.250> play

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
always has got chances to get some play

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.899 
always has got chances to get some play
against<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.270> UM<00:01:51.630> slightly<00:01:52.530> weakened<00:01:52.890> pawns

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.749 

the<00:01:56.909> problem<00:01:57.409> against<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.590> guy<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.069> that<00:01:59.520> he

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the problem against this guy is that he

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.880 
the problem against this guy is that he
basically<00:02:02.179> doesn't<00:02:03.179> make<00:02:03.720> any<00:02:04.049> mistakes<00:02:04.649> in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
basically doesn't make any mistakes in

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.430 
basically doesn't make any mistakes in
the<00:02:05.039> end<00:02:05.190> game<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.380> need<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.709> kill<00:02:07.950> him

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
the end game so you need to kill him

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.360 
the end game so you need to kill him
more<00:02:10.440> than<00:02:10.590> once<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:11.910> say<00:02:12.299> check<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.590> better

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
more than once so to say check a better

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.610 
more than once so to say check a better
end<00:02:14.640> game<00:02:14.880> usually<00:02:16.040> doesn't<00:02:17.040> mean<00:02:17.190> much<00:02:18.620> this

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
end game usually doesn't mean much this

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:33.450 
end game usually doesn't mean much this
is<00:02:19.829> a<00:02:19.859> better<00:02:20.160> hand<00:02:20.370> game

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:50.010 

okay<00:02:34.210> keep<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.140> simple<00:02:47.130> maybe<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.250> should<00:02:49.020> play

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
okay keep it simple maybe I should play

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.190 
okay keep it simple maybe I should play
for<00:02:50.350> more<00:02:50.650> here<00:02:51.010> but<00:02:51.210> it's<00:02:52.210> just<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.750> my

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
for more here but it's just that my

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
for more here but it's just that my
score<00:02:53.590> against<00:02:53.890> him<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.490> ridiculously<00:02:55.120> bad

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
score against him is so ridiculously bad

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.550 
score against him is so ridiculously bad
i'm<00:02:57.220> always<00:02:57.640> content<00:02:58.600> with<00:02:58.840> a<00:03:01.140> very<00:03:02.140> dry

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
i'm always content with a very dry

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.680 
i'm always content with a very dry
position<00:03:04.320> where<00:03:05.320> i<00:03:05.350> can<00:03:05.380> make<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:05.800> draw<00:03:06.690> it's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
position where i can make a draw it's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:17.720 
position where i can make a draw it's
just<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:08.200> simple

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730
