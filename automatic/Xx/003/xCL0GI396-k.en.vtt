00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.310 

as<00:01:25.600> opposed<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.290> number<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.860> engines<00:01:27.340> which

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
as opposed to a number of engines which

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.660 
as opposed to a number of engines which
appear<00:01:29.320> on<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.590> download<00:01:30.010> station<00:01:30.520> which

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
appear on the download station which

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.380 
appear on the download station which
will<00:01:30.880> not<00:01:31.150> operate<00:01:31.600> correctly<00:01:32.110> in<00:01:33.060> inch<00:01:34.060> range

will not operate correctly in inch range
12<00:01:34.870> that's<00:01:35.770> why<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.070> think<00:01:36.370> it's<00:01:36.490> worthwhile

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
12 that's why I think it's worthwhile

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.360 
12 that's why I think it's worthwhile
doing<00:01:37.480> these<00:01:37.840> reviews<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:39.070> you<00:01:39.130> can
