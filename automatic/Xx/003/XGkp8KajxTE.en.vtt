00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:21.659
 wh 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.999
 this one member in the following sentence told the heart bleed 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.250
 Kurrat is murmuring of course she is still widespread there is none 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.490
 acute occasion to dispose of the cork decorates 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.490
 which is really amazing if you know the disadvantages of the customer 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.560
 the seamless graduate Sony and founder of the Weinschule Berlin shows the 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.560
 pros and cons of different wines closures on 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.540
 For a long time the natural cork was considered to have been the ideal closure for 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.120
 his 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.810
 especially because the rumor has held that the wine by the 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.980
 Basket Hartmut and thus ideally developed 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.650
 but today we know that the wine is always Petrucci free 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.200
 that is, oxygen is the great finest wine tire 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.780
 that is to say today the goal is to burn the lights shutter is the more 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.539
 it is better for the wine we have the big problem with the natural cork 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:24.689
 Coop tastes it 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.889
 that means that percent is a MOF tone in the leg of natural cork 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:30.939
 is caused 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.170
 the mixtures know process that is going on 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.960
 and the reason is that in the bark of the corduroy in our case so the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.060
 cork 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.429
 Percent lichens and fungi live in it 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.940
 and they will fight with herbicides and fungicides 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.080
 we assume that we make five to ten percent of total wine production 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.170
 to lose 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.860
 which is closed with cork because just this TCR this percent Priklopil 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.860
 School percent forms 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.170
 JAL surely has a legitimate question as to why these accounts are still there 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.949
 used 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.869
 we must say that just the German market but also the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:11.740
 French people 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.830
 that is still the oriented and we connect him with the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.930
 Natural cork the feel that the beautiful on the leg and 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.330
 Carstensen screw cap and plastic places now finally open 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.260
 There are many consumers but many teams have had problems with it and there 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.780
 You have to say that the winemakers produce original impeccable 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.810
 Product and seal that Baumann with a lock of the so 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.370
 error-prone is Rhein I am now in Vienna to plead and easy 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.370
 say you should use AMD alternatives 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.949
 DAPD 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.449
 So we have the longest experience with the woman just before the end 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.789
 Australians experiment with it for over 30 years 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.699
 as always by info for example also has 30 years one 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.299
 Per cent one closed so the one he is the one with screw cap 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.969
 the other half with natural cork around I percent ago there two years ago 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.659
 Place tasted such a wine 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.400
 and it turned out there too 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.880
 that the screw cap is the plan to do so clearly was the reason 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.320
 is that the screw cap is simply tight even over years 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.040
 Decades of the savior comes at some point 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.690
 Muller give up but you must also cleanse the fabric 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.690
 Roxy is there now and then animals will spoil and will be in the back then 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.690
 be achieved 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.600
 What a grotesque impact our love for Motor Corp has 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.420
 especially in Prescott "This is really more catching closure 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.830
 especially the cheapest press mail but a binder simply pressed together 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.150
 Tidende looks a bit like natural cork but has few advantages for 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.260
 legs as we do in one of these press-product granules 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.180
 HTC Athens have 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.450
 This can have negative consequences for the whole Weinheim 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.450
 So that's the shutter it was with which we can completely do without 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.720
 the auxiliary Stadler for the misjudges is the silicone head of the 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:24.330
 Plastic place 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.340
 is perfectly fine only for those who have not been in the choir for more than two years 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.050
 tilt 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.569
 then fit but somehow start to pick up longer should this 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:33.670
 Do not have closure 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.440
 since just the Froschauer fabric lets through as well quotes Irvine 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.440
 and spoils 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.900
 a haptic and visually percent nice alternative is the class river 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.530
 The market is also very popular with consumers 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.580
 Closure Dr 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.680
 However, Zidan's experiences are missing the four years we are now this 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.130
 Try closure and make it very positive 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.420
 There are hardly any negative reports but as said before, they are doing well for a long time 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.420
 She's still missing us 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.889
 could summarize so that he blows such oddities in 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.210
 Silicone cork or the Prescott can totally do without we can do this 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.110
 even high quality bottles might just be for the nostalgic one more 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.050
 Close a little bit with a basket than many other screw caps 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.099
 Ideal closure of clubs and everything else should actually 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.099
 do not worry anymore 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.919
 The expansion of the country should therefore not only pay attention to the new label 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.340
 Son also on the closure of the car
