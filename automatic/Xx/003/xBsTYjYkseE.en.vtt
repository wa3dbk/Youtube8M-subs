150 million from the end of the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.299 
150 million from the end of the
intercooler<00:00:35.430> yeah<00:00:35.940> if<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> switch<00:00:37.380> at

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
intercooler yeah if there is a switch at

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
intercooler yeah if there is a switch at
the<00:00:38.370> back<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> motor<00:00:39.390> pointing<00:00:39.989> towards

the back of the motor pointing towards

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.830 
the back of the motor pointing towards
the<00:00:40.739> foot<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.370> firewall<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.750> get

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the foot the firewall see if I can get

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.540 
the foot the firewall see if I can get
her<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> back<00:00:43.350> there

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.880 

and<00:00:52.030> what<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:52.240> do<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.450> unplug<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.380> factory

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
and what you do you unplug the factory

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.070 
and what you do you unplug the factory
plug<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.160> root<00:00:57.340> systems<00:00:57.820> wiring<00:00:58.720> harness

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
plug in the root systems wiring harness

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.790 
plug in the root systems wiring harness
plugs<00:00:59.530> on<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.460> where<00:01:00.610> that<00:01:00.760> existing<00:01:01.239> plug<00:01:01.450> was

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
plugs on to where that existing plug was

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.120 
plugs on to where that existing plug was
then<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.950> factory<00:01:03.520> plug<00:01:04.320> will<00:01:05.320> plug<00:01:05.920> back

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
then the factory plug will plug back

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:17.840 
then the factory plug will plug back
into<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:07.450> roof<00:01:07.630> systems<00:01:08.050> harness

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.790 

but<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.230> been<00:01:19.409> hard<00:01:19.620> to<00:01:19.680> get

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
but as you can see it's been hard to get

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.399 
but as you can see it's been hard to get
down<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.310> look<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.080> lift

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
down in there but look if you just lift

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.250 
down in there but look if you just lift
the<00:01:22.790> two<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.940> a<00:01:24.060> heater<00:01:24.360> hoses<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.930> Steve

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
the two of a heater hoses there Steve

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.590

yeah<00:01:25.590> lift<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.550> two<00:01:26.700> heater<00:01:26.970> hoses<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
yeah lift the two heater hoses up and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080 
yeah lift the two heater hoses up and
make<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.870> access<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.530> bit<00:01:28.740> easier<00:01:29.100> one

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
