with it by doing that right yeah well
here's<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> deal<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.829> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
here's the deal I know that this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.520 
here's the deal I know that this
alternator<00:00:41.399> doesn't<00:00:41.820> charge<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.530> two

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
alternator doesn't charge for two

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.529 
alternator doesn't charge for two
reasons<00:00:43.950> first<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.280> all<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> tested<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.180> because

I'm going to show you how to check them

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.790 
I'm going to show you how to check them

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
out and if you watch this panel while

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.950 
out and if you watch this panel while
the<00:00:49.950> engines<00:00:50.309> running<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:51.390> panel<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the engines running this panel the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.900 
the engines running this panel the
alternate<00:00:52.410> recharge<00:00:52.800> light<00:00:53.010> stays<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.579> stays

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
alternate recharge light stays on stays

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.979 
alternate recharge light stays on stays
illuminated<00:00:54.780> some<00:00:55.649> patents<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:57.570> start<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
illuminated some patents so we start the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
illuminated some patents so we start the
engine<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.910> we<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.329> there's<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
engine and we have see there's the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:10.040 
engine and we have see there's the
charging<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.289> there

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:17.160
