00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.400 
opportunity to look it didn't happen you
know<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.230> think<00:00:16.850> that<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.750> doubt<00:00:18.990> from<00:00:19.260> me

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
know I think that I was in doubt from me

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.470 
know I think that I was in doubt from me
last<00:00:19.619> summer<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.789> don't<00:00:20.939> think<00:00:21.060> anyone<00:00:21.390> was

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
last summer and I don't think anyone was

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.359 
last summer and I don't think anyone was
ready<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.619> come<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> grips<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.160> that

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
ready to to come to grips with that

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.029 
ready to to come to grips with that
young<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:25.230> know<00:00:25.260> tried<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> make<00:00:26.010> it

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
young and so you know tried to make it

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.830 
young and so you know tried to make it
work<00:00:26.160> again<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.210> doesn't<00:00:27.390> seem<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
work again it just doesn't seem to be a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.410 
work again it just doesn't seem to be a
really<00:00:28.019> good<00:00:28.109> fit<00:00:31.040> uh<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.880> haven't<00:00:33.210> asked<00:00:33.390> for

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
really good fit uh I haven't asked for

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.819 
really good fit uh I haven't asked for
anything<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.380> everyone

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
anything but I think everyone

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
anything but I think everyone
understands<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> situation<00:00:35.550> where<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:38.210> gets

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
understands the situation where it gets

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
understands the situation where it gets
to<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> point<00:00:39.480> where<00:00:40.070> there's<00:00:41.070> absolutely<00:00:41.430> no

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
to a point where there's absolutely no

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.000 
to a point where there's absolutely no
communication<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.360> months<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> 10<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.140> think<00:00:43.920> we

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
communication for months a 10 I think we

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.670 
communication for months a 10 I think we
all<00:00:44.040> know<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.309> that's<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.730> real<00:00:44.879> damage<00:00:45.680> what

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.980 
i think i started off on the first few
games<00:01:28.700> but<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.270> know<00:01:29.390> i<00:01:29.420> would<00:01:29.540> can<00:01:29.750> tell<00:01:29.930> us

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
to shoot the ball well i think as people

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.600 
to shoot the ball well i think as people
started<00:01:35.450> going<00:01:36.230> down<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:36.770> i<00:01:36.830> was<00:01:37.070> able<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.460> get

started going down and i was able to get

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.190 
started going down and i was able to get
more<00:01:37.790> time<00:01:38.000> on<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.270> cord<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:38.750> start<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.020> get<00:01:39.170> a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
more time on the cord and start to get a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.420 
more time on the cord and start to get a
little<00:01:39.290> rhythm<00:01:39.620> that<00:01:39.860> i<00:01:39.950> started<00:01:40.130> shooting

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
little rhythm that i started shooting

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.790 
little rhythm that i started shooting
the<00:01:40.460> ball<00:01:40.580> better<00:01:41.080> but<00:01:42.080> unfortunately<00:01:42.620> i<00:01:42.680> got

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
the ball better but unfortunately i got

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.410 
the ball better but unfortunately i got
injured<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.100> maybe<00:01:43.640> some<00:01:43.850> things<00:01:44.030> happening
