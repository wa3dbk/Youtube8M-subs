00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.270
 Many have always commented 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.170
 that winning losing losing always 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.240
 growing exhibiting learning and good 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.070
 unfortunately work with a 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.990
 defeat is not ours is the best not 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.759
 but good if in future shared 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.960
 Friendly embraces God who does not 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.090
 they counted no points here since 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.619
 I think I'm here with your club to do it 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.160
 in the best way and good they will come 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.609
 matches 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.180
 Javier is lost in a moment in a 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.860
 party night Javier I 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.330
 unfortunately I think that no player 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.370
 Mexican wants to lose there is not much 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.809
 less but good if our effort goes 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.550
 if our wear unfortunately not 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.930
 let's be forceful it's not going to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.149
 get it once they got it they could 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.200
 indicate as open cause and with is 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.760
 difficult is nothing defeat take out 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.050
 conclusions but good you have to follow 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.879
 working that you have to grow there 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.950
 that learn from mistakes always what 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.420
 mentioned not that winning by losing 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.630
 always tying that keep growing and 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.770
 learning 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.630
 but 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.059
 has happened tonight is not usual in 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.579
 a such a defeat against the us 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.890
 and obviously always always lose 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.920
 hurts and more against an equal with usa and 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.140
 cassano but but hey there's that you have to 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.600
 always give you the positive side I like 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.729
 in that way 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.939
 it's a friendly match again under 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.460
 our official party and they did 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.560
 their work not what they came to have a 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.390
 counterattack opportunity was the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.740
 ball there, they concretized and we 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.750
 missing that not only the ball 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.119
 come in because we had the shots the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.789
 arrival his archer had a good pair of 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.310
 interventions and even speaking like that is the 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.180
 football does not choose the mind wins and they the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.410
 could 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.260
 all the first time in fact not 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.430
 they were in a single arrival to smoke 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.700
 to defend we knew we were going to play 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.219
 so we always know 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.549
 but well I tell you this is soccer is not 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.229
 the one that the mind wins they had a 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.929
 played out there they put it and we 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.969
 what we had we could not take advantage of 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.340
 and talk but I think that in operation 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.580
 and in delivery the equipment is still in good condition 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.860
 we had good plays on the walls 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.260
 shot me distance was entered the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.970
 header and on the team there is no 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.830
 insisting and do not have to follow much 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.390
 to pass not because they tell 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.450
 Adoptive love is that it hurts this 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.599
 defeat for rivalry and good that 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.430
 be calm that the team knows and is 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.829
 aware of what he did well because 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.690
 He did many things well even though 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.640
 lost and that there were also details that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.110
 will have to correct that it is a match 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.380
 friendly and that we're going to work so that 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.900
 let's go official 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.579
 many lies 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.409
 it will be important to win we always go out to 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.019
 unfortunately gain an opportunity 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.129
 who has scored the goal for us 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.870
 we have the opportunities 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.950
 unfortunately we do not specify it and so 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.950
 it's the game the game stays 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.860
 because this party would be for that 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.519
 our goal is costa rica in the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.470
 USA 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.300
 We knew that that match was important 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.810
 friendly for what's coming 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.819
 great defeat 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.440
 it hurts clear that yes see so much that 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.640
 opportunity where the goalie comes out 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.870
 whatever 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.980
 it was a good opportunity that they have 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.020
 as I tell you and see the goal for the 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.970
 amateur just because it hurts so much 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.520
 for the rivalry that exists with the us 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.150
 and that they come home to win for 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.440
 we are playing we are playing 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.600
 they are the ones that we start from the armament 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.450
 of the pitch and well I think that 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.730
 that hurts us a lot, he missed the punch 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.890
 The team lacked 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.450
 tri are then I just think that we 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.040
 failed to put it and I think the income was 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.890
 today we arrive by the bands by the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.410
 center for being centers that yesterday killed 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.910
 chicharito out there we did everything now 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.080
 unfortunately not as it has not the 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.080
 we put in and it was what we 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.030
 it will always hurt us against the USA but 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.430
 you have to raise the face you tell the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.239
 amateur even if I 'm calm I think 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.090
 they have to understand a little how 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.890
 is football is part of this and the most 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.590
 important is to raise the face that 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.650
 important comes forward 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.299
 I believe that 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.299
 Of course it hurts not always lose hurts 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.670
 more so not playing practically have 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.190
 a single arrival to them we live on 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.740
 I think it played well but I do not know 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.969
 made the goal concrete and that affected us 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.709
 final 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.389
 the fact that for the first time 

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:35.459
 lose against this team here at home and 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.400
 well, you can not always win, I think 

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:38.410
 what 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.080
 a team that stood up well with good 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.660
 players and in your match do not defend 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.840
 well and having an opportunity is a 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.910
 our carelessness and they took advantage of it there 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.400
 missed ponchartrain there was not a 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.310
 opportunity missed making the goal I do not think 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.770
 that played well missed the last pass the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.889
 network but but I think it played well with 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.380
 a lot of intensity I think all my 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.640
 companions 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.040
 They gave one hundred percent 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.590
 unfortunately, it was not possible to win what 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.610
 what the amateur was looking for something that you 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.800
 you know there's a rivalry here 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.280
 important in terms of the area not 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.220
 obviously 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.780
 one is sad not like them I 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.940
 I think one more for what was lived in 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.490
 the match but you have to continue not to 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.550
 I say you can not always win you lost 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.680
 an unfortunate way for by how 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.060
 it was the whole game but but hey 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.440
 their support is always critical 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.440
 and it was always shown
