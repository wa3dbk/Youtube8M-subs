the only downside is that the
application<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.190> bit<00:02:08.310> laggy<00:02:08.520> but

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
application is a little bit laggy but

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.510 
application is a little bit laggy but
the<00:02:09.030> fact<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.509> running<00:02:09.810> over<00:02:10.520> Wi-Fi

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the fact that it's running over Wi-Fi

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.720 
the fact that it's running over Wi-Fi
network

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
network

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.759 
network
and<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.180> not<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:14.010> direct<00:02:15.010> feed<00:02:15.659> would

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
and it's not a direct feed would

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.530 
and it's not a direct feed would
certainly<00:02:17.769> allow<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.459> be<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> little<00:02:18.940> laggy

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
certainly allow it to be a little laggy

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.680 
certainly allow it to be a little laggy
but<00:02:19.900> overall<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:20.920> usable<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:22.510> you're

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
but overall it is usable if you're

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.210 
but overall it is usable if you're
looking<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:25.090> easy<00:02:25.900> way<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.860> keep<00:02:27.129> an
