you need some bananas a container and a
chopping<00:00:16.560> board<00:00:16.770> or<00:00:17.430> two<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.180> usually<00:00:19.109> cut<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
chopping board or two I usually cut the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.679 
chopping board or two I usually cut the
skins<00:00:19.830> off<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.490> chopping<00:00:20.850> board<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.270> then

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
skins off on one chopping board and then

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.170 
skins off on one chopping board and then
cut<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> banana<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.859> half<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.490> another<00:00:23.910> board

cut the banana in half on another board
this<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.050> because<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.740> think<00:00:25.800> there<00:00:26.099> might<00:00:26.250> be

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
this is because I think there might be

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.810 
this is because I think there might be
some<00:00:26.670> pesticides<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> banana<00:00:28.289> skins<00:00:28.820> but

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
some pesticides on the banana skins but

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.990 
some pesticides on the banana skins but
I<00:00:29.849> don't<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.480> if<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.900> really<00:00:31.470> necessary

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
I don't know if it's really necessary

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.209 
I don't know if it's really necessary
these<00:00:33.000> bananas<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.570> perfectly<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.590> nice

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
these bananas are perfectly right nice

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.370 
these bananas are perfectly right nice
and<00:00:35.460> brown<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> outside<00:00:36.170> they're<00:00:37.170> not

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and brown on the outside they're not

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.010 
and brown on the outside they're not
rotten<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> inside<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.570> bananas

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
rotten on the inside if the bananas

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.959 
rotten on the inside if the bananas
aren't<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.530> Brown<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:41.760> think

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
aren't going Brown then I don't think

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.790 
aren't going Brown then I don't think
they're<00:00:42.180> sweet<00:00:42.450> enough

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
that you want to eat in one go because

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.100 
that you want to eat in one go because
it<00:01:29.200> doesn't<00:01:29.530> taste<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.950> great<00:01:30.130> refrozen

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it doesn't taste that great refrozen

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.270 
it doesn't taste that great refrozen
although<00:01:32.110> you<00:01:32.170> can't<00:01:32.470> just<00:01:32.680> throw<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.159> a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
although you can't just throw it in a

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.249 
although you can't just throw it in a
smoothie<00:01:33.520> next<00:01:33.970> time<00:01:34.149> which<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:34.630> what<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:34.960> did

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
smoothie next time which is what I did

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.190 
smoothie next time which is what I did
after<00:01:35.560> making<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.190> actually<00:01:36.810> slice<00:01:37.810> the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
after making this actually slice the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.440 
after making this actually slice the
bananas<00:01:38.710> this<00:01:39.399> is<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.850> make<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.240> bit<00:01:40.420> easier

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
bananas this is to make it a bit easier

for<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.440> food<00:01:41.649> processor<00:01:42.280> my<00:01:42.909> food<00:01:43.180> processor

for the food processor my food processor
doesn't<00:01:43.960> actually<00:01:44.200> work<00:01:44.649> if<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:45.070> put<00:01:45.310> the

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
doesn't actually work if I put the

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.520 
doesn't actually work if I put the
frozen<00:01:45.640> bananas<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.630> without<00:01:47.020> cutting<00:01:47.289> them

frozen bananas and without cutting them
the<00:01:47.920> blade<00:01:48.220> pops<00:01:48.700> up<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.420> middle<00:01:49.720> thing

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
the blade pops up and the middle thing

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.980 
the blade pops up and the middle thing
keeps<00:01:50.200> spinning<00:01:50.740> around<00:01:50.860> by<00:01:51.310> itself<00:01:51.670> mix<00:01:52.630> the
