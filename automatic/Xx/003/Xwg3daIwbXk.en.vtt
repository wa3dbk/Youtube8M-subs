00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.559
 we are at Christmas and it is good to eat 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.660
 absolutely everything and this rich 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.610
 walk along the avenue of the river 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.519
 We ate a delicious meal a 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.800
 very thick gastronomy that's why I invited 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.750
 to this pair of talented girls because 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.450
 right now, sometimes we suffer 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.149
 a lot like because give away yes and then 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.509
 we complicate ourselves knowing that there are things 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:30.369
 good nice healthy delicious and 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.770
 that we can get out of the way true if 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.399
 every one is as you were and your tablet as 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.199
 you were older to speak English to her 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.789
 that we have for this Christmas I want 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:44.949
 for example, give a fruit arrangement to 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.050
 man woman also if it is for everyone 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.140
 the fish for sex for men to 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.510
 any woman and for children for moms 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.940
 that is, an arrangement of fruits is 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.089
 like flowers but they eat then it's 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.730
 much easier every time where it comes from 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.560
 let's say the design and this combination so 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.870
 pretty to make gifts 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.800
 this idea came about five years ago 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.660
 in the market we started five years ago 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.670
 when they gave me an arrangement 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.950
 similar but not here but in another 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.550
 city ​​in the USA because it was 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.160
 there 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.440
 they gave me one I thought was very original 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.140
 so I said good because you can not 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.870
 bring the idea here and we start 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.030
 develop it then if there is emerged it is 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.070
 if you really are cordially 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.690
 invited to open channel for we wanted 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.670
 that you were because more or less 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.250
 they are like that in the pioneering rooms that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.470
 they started with that beautiful process and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.660
 how the English people get or a gift 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.910
 like this one is good the facing because it is 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.260
 something very novel if there is so he likes 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.430
 because normally people are 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.500
 used to receive flowers chocolates 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.570
 then it is a very different option 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.790
 Well, people are delighted with the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.100
 arrangements because it 's something totally new 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.950

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.790
 today yesterday that is tired of especially 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.830
 of the strawberry with the chocolate that's a 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.780
 sensational thing and today we brought a 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.850
 new combination that is pineapple with 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.580
 chocolate then these little dolls that 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.760
 They are like Christmas and are made of pineapple 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.500
 and saved chocolate 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.129
 delicious one always eats strawberries with 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.930
 chocolate or banana with chocolate apple 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.200
 with chocolate but the pineapple never 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.599
 we had danced 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.879
 and tastes delicious and also beautiful 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.150
 appears as a more bad as a more 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.010
 fast since the sensation is delicious or 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.650
 be not only see the arrangement that already 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.170
 we will start doing it but also 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.640
 the feeling that fruits produce 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.200
 combined with this type of chocolate 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.459
 Well, I guess it's not a chocolate 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.489
 anybody but I feel with the one of 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.569
 special if we use not only 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.269
 the national chocolates products 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.299
 and we also have products for 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.700
 dietary chocolate dietary that stops 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.139
 diabetics can consume it because 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.790
 many people apart from receiving 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.590
 the fruits say no but I do not want 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.870
 get fat with the calculate then by 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.159
 please also with dietary chocolate 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.349
 then we also have that option 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.269
 white chocolate made for example 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.819
 the braids are decorated with 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.340
 White chocolate is also then laughs 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.010
 and we try to give many options to 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.780
 customers if for example they do not want 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.640
 so take for example 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.020
 star because the time of 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.180
 Christmas and if not they want a 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.550
 little heart then we change the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.660
 figures agree as to the 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.370
 occasion what kind of fruit are used 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.500
 we leave almost all the fruits 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.739
 that can shape it because there are some 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.650
 very liquid fruits like chanting the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.319
 orange if we use it but sometimes it drips 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.330
 much then we use pineapple mango the 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.520
 strawberry was always kiwi mango the melon the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.709
 watermelon there are also some fruits that are not 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.620
 they leave as we say to do the manual 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.209
 data and then manipulate then those are 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.180
 what we are using at the moment 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.500
 good and 7 it's hard to make the designs 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.430
 Well normally the designs are already 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.310
 as established and sometimes clients 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.079
 we are changed as the designs 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.540
 they say I want to return from flowers I want 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.850
 hearts but normally since 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.820
 we have standardized ones like 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.090
 arrangements then no and also how cute 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.300
 let's look at the vegetables 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.310
 and not an arrangement this is very big 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.960
 then there is so much fruit that after 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.229
 of can be one of the fruits because the 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.150
 lettuce is let's say something easy is 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.910
 then and juice then it is not that it is a 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.889
 arrangement that apart from that is very nice 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.770
 because then aesthetically it looks very 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.870
 cute you can enjoy sharing and you 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.550
 you can give other uses clear besides that 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.400
 you forget that that will not be 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.330
 there ready for people to reach the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.130
 two days and go not everything is very cool 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.040
 and also afterwards with an order but they are 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.100
 they delay we finish the gift there 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.960

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.330
