 yes 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.570
 in this school and already living in 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.460
 armchairs from many different countries in 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.260
 three little ones who is 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.820
 brave in the hyper paellas in sacred 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.519
 learn to experiment and perez 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.699
 scientist in our school works 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:43.050
 special that is evil is more fun 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.149
 madrid from a summary 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.860
 At the school we had a submarine 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.160
 that at first it was a battle of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 Weakness of the sea stars in life 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.120
 special of animals and plants that do not 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.160
 they knew 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.160
 now it is in painting the world the patio 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.979
 because the mind is more fun 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.570
 martina bar school participate in 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.460
 a magnet project at the hand of a 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.040
 prestigious institution such as the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.710
 Total sea science institute 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 involved cloisters of the past in the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.690
 that projects and will start a 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.590
 advice to train us in which 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.710
 theme the purpose is to learn how to produce 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 methodological didactic proposals 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.780
 contextualized in the sea of legality of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.540
 marine science as a public and central 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.700
 so maintain a commitment to defense in 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.600
 society work together to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.479
 schools town halls museums centers 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.280
 civic libraries and libraries in projects that 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.080
 aim to transfer 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.910
 of knowledge so that the activity 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.160
 of psuv maría the one that advances where this 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.630
 is the fifth base samples to plan 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.459
 a miquette as they could sign 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.009
 students at the hours from here to 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.560
 the classes are going to work you see through 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.569
 of the question that could lock 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.060
 alfonso marin or who thought 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.310
 it's like I would take no comas you could xavi 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.620
 to the colossal magician here where advisory 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.340
 So many things where are you, could there be a 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.310
 year 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.439
 swim to a tank with minsk pits 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.049
 Basurto and something cava of houses could 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.299
 it would be very submarine from here to 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.700
 the highs already had more ideal if banfield 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.620
 and I go to a summary companies although they will go 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.109
 and I began to take the actual image 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.519
 underwater case of the parental if 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.919
 it turns out we're going the attraction and very 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.599
 experiential and good as a result will be 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:48.209
 very positive so walls that has gone down 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.799
 very much and for us it is also 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.290
 because they can work in a very 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.389
 competence in all areas from the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.879
 simple affectation drawing is already 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.370
 working the artistic competition 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.650
 going by example for the calculations and 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.349
 estimates of the founds already sun and after 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.269
 that I believe in the bottom of the sea and 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.459
 Anglo several mathematics and about 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.609
 all the most important is the offer for 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.739
 the question that would be the whole issue of the 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.650
 communicative competence to her husband 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.930
 is a replica of her real husband who have 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.490
 served the scientist to study 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.780
 alfonso of the animal 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.150
 at 40 in the can see a video 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.060
 filmed from within the submarine or not 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.640
 They are taught as funds in the area 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.040
 from cap de creus to organisms that 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.050
 they live to the hesperides that threatened them 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.290
 for the fine brossa and be calm 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.840
 they give fishermen and vibrate uniquely 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.400
 experience of being at the bottom of the sea 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.310
 This activity is planned to 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.700
 stimulate observation and curiosity 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.500
 of children do not learn an essay that 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.770
 they are fine without hardly having worked 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.500
 a collaborative way and then I could 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.160
 projected that this penalty marks other 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.560
 areas and it's also very experiential and 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.140
 motivating paris with a garment made in 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.150
 significant volume casal if they wanted 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.220
 see her going on back here to me 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.350
 valfint almonds and bones overconsumption 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.670
 align the form and king of the 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.680
 emotive me and then with those months 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.299
 previous from here they will see that 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.190
 we have drawn his has things that do not 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.500
 they have more saavedra to form and eat 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.000
 the spongebob and go decide and it was a 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.740
 trobada to a scientist of the institute of 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.360
 sciences of the sea and from here it goes to 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.860
 arise the idea of ​​painting a new house 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.080
 information they had acquired 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.970
 pupils to the parents of the school and the 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.890
 psuv 11 am the collective and rewind now 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.890
 my district of sant martí since I have 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.590
 choose shows with your poses a straight 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.190
 so they are working a way 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.200
 different 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.580
 in many cases many of us do not 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.470
 they had worked in this way for your 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.180
 diets and it's also an incentive because 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.610
 we work this animal that you always 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.640
 to the institute of marine science and this 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.800
 map in the mold that scientists also 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.860
 in our training because in revol 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.370
 salmon and also the productions 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.620
 what they do for the students is finer 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.360
 but it's more satisfying for us 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.960
 so that they see that facing the children 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.960
 also wells
