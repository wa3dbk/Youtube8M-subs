00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you'll notice that this is a very simple

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.720 
you'll notice that this is a very simple
interface<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.329> all<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.440> gotta<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:40.950> just

it's very bright obviously and on the
bottom<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.219> there's<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> strobel

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
bottom here there's actually a strobel

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.500 
bottom here there's actually a strobel
option<00:00:48.809> where<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.260> adjust<00:00:49.590> how<00:00:50.520> fast<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
option where it can adjust how fast the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.959 
option where it can adjust how fast the
strobe<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> slowest<00:00:53.399> speed<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
strobe is this is the slowest speed and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.229 
strobe is this is the slowest speed and
I'll<00:00:54.660> show<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> fastest<00:00:55.940> just<00:00:56.940> saying

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
I'll show you the fastest just saying

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.709 
I'll show you the fastest just saying
this<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.140> give<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> seizure<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.629> you

this can give you a seizure so there you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.850 
this can give you a seizure so there you
go<00:01:01.820> anyways<00:01:02.820> um<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.930> newest<00:01:04.199> update<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
go anyways um the newest update that

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.560 
go anyways um the newest update that
they<00:01:05.040> had<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.729> few<00:01:05.909> days<00:01:06.030> ago<00:01:07.790> they<00:01:08.790> enabled<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
they had a few days ago they enabled a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.990 
they had a few days ago they enabled a
new<00:01:09.900> settings<00:01:10.439> tab<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.939> allows

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
new settings tab and what this allows

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
new settings tab and what this allows
you<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.750> customize<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you to do is to customize the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
you to do is to customize the
application<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> little<00:01:14.610> bit<00:01:14.700> more<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.600> can

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
application a little bit more you can

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.050 
application a little bit more you can
hold<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.320> button<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.830> light<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.610> it's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
hold the button for the light so it's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
hold the button for the light so it's
more<00:01:18.330> realistic<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:19.140> by<00:01:19.320> holding<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
more realistic just by holding it you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
more realistic just by holding it you
can<00:01:20.280> turn<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.670> sort<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.450> annoying<00:01:21.659> because

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
can turn it on sort of annoying because

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
can turn it on sort of annoying because
you<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.680> hold<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> whole<00:01:23.340> time

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you would have to hold it the whole time

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.469 
you would have to hold it the whole time
but<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:25.049> rather<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:26.479> there's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
but I would rather not do that there's

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.179 
but I would rather not do that there's
also<00:01:27.689> lights<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.170> by<00:01:28.320> default<00:01:28.470> which<00:01:28.829> allows

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
also lights on by default which allows

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.590 
also lights on by default which allows
you<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.780> have<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.380> flashlight<00:01:31.650> turn<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.729> right

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
you to have the flashlight turn on right

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.120 
you to have the flashlight turn on right
when<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.960> open<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> application<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.100> can

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
when you open the application you can

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.440 
when you open the application you can
always<00:01:35.490> enable<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.390> where<00:01:36.829> disabled<00:01:37.829> that

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
always enable that where disabled that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.350 
always enable that where disabled that
I'm<00:01:39.450> not<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.960> sure<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.380> SOS<00:01:40.799> mode<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.360> oh

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
I'm not really sure what SOS mode was oh

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.060 
I'm not really sure what SOS mode was oh
right<00:01:43.159> there<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.570> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.750> SOS<00:01:46.200> mode<00:01:49.070> it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
right there you go this is SOS mode it's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.300 
right there you go this is SOS mode it's
like<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> signaling<00:01:51.020> but<00:01:52.020> yeah<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.439> there's

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
like a signaling but yeah and there's

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
like a signaling but yeah and there's
also<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.700> DoubleTap<00:01:54.240> toggle<00:01:54.630> screen<00:01:54.840> which

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
also a DoubleTap toggle screen which

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.950 
also a DoubleTap toggle screen which
allows<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.560> sort<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.280> turn<00:01:56.610> off<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.299> guess

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
allows you to sort of turn off I guess

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.069 
allows you to sort of turn off I guess
the<00:01:58.469> screen<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:59.340> makes<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> black<00:02:00.060> some<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
the screen just makes it black some of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.170 
the screen just makes it black some of
the<00:02:01.140> double<00:02:01.439> tap<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.219> allows<00:02:02.460> oh<00:02:02.729> sorry

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the double tap this allows oh sorry

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.690
