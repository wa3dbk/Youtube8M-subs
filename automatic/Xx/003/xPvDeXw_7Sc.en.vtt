00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.770
 shrimp friends now i want to talk 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:13.460
 about magical properties 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:18.090
 I have never been in a cream 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:21.330
 emphasize and strengthen what I tell you 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.060
 said that without enough 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.480
 silicon cell cannot produce 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.730
 metabolic processes and therefore 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.649
 cell metabolism he is constantly 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:44.370
 to suffer especially ring means without 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:49.260
 enough silicon exchange 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.980
 cage occurs very weak and therefore 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.870
 the cell starts as a body generated 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.739
 and do not perform my functions as I have already 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:07.070
 talked about where in where as possible 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.070
 increase the amount of silicon blood 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.140
 first when i met about what 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 not enough kremlin and except 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.020
 then I began to search and when I had 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.189
 one of my students became my friend 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.400
 - and he was very inquisitive and herself 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:34.590
 living he raised his like 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.979
 health knowledge was bosch 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.229
 handicapped and in two years he completely 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.280
 regained his health and he told me 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:51.840
 then said where are the rinks 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:55.200
 like this stone right now one second I 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.290
 I'll show you this black stone later 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.869
 simple black stone which 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.229
 formed over many 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.700
 million years and acquired such 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.120
 interesting volume matrix which and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:19.290
 is an active catalyst 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 for structuring water and he when i 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.500
 came to him remember showed this water here 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.470
 in the water were these stones 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.310
 were dark black black what's this 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.220
 cream it and somehow says try and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.690
 gave me a try this water and i just 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:48.510
 surprised ghoul on so tasty and, moreover 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:53.370
 taste is like a spring that's it 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:58.099
 scientists writes about this that in this this 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:02.459
 stone of his energy she is so 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:05.519
 structures this water that water itself 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.349
 becomes very universe not only that 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:15.299
 it is saturated with atoms and molecules and 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:19.980
 energy and this cream does not mean we 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:25.430
 We already know that tap water is not available. 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:28.489
 only dangerous she just destroy and to 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.349
 bed action on our cells 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.790
 not only is it dead 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:39.530
 a lot of bacteria and germs 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:45.510
 here are different inorganic poisons 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:50.160
 radionuclides here and parasites and so I 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:54.299
 her usually desler yes she is dead then i 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.410
 reviving it in the sun and putting it there 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.579
 Crystal I already told beginnings to 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.720
 distilled dead water 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:06.209
 turns into a living energy 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:11.970
 containing solar energy together there 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:15.900
 still put here this stone kremlin 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:21.200
 then she becomes magical 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:24.550
 property regenerate and do and 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.320
 more lively structured 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.290
 why so much because cells 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:37.120
 begin to produce a very good exchange 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:41.150
 substances to and cheese increases speed 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:46.550
 metabolism cells cleared 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:51.640
 lymphatic system and here are all these 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.640
 vitamins hormones enzymes they sort of 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.430
 recover much more active 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:03.950
 much faster than the weight of such a water 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:12.080
 silicon water like galya silicon 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:15.580
 water she takes out various poisons which 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.580
 are in the lymphatic system 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:26.900
 make it very simple means 20 grams 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:31.400
 this stone to 1 liter of water and find that 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:36.790
 stone is also very simple to keep it in 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:40.400
 water must be away from the sun and 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:44.480
 yourself then add this stone and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.140
 keep in the dark and another eight nine 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:52.130
 days so here when i tried this water 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:56.020
 comrades how much do you take this 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:06:01.040
 the water already stands he says about a year and 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:05.990
 this water tasted amazing 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:09.760
 spring water so let's friends 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.250
 we will be together with nature 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.830
 restore your energy 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:20.740
 to restore your health therefore to 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:22.040
 you please find out everything read 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:28.490
 realize 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:34.849
 and understand that water is much 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:40.969
 great nutrition for human health 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:44.619
 than food and naturally drink when you 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:48.679
 boil water it already becomes a lot 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:52.330
 so if you even want to boil 

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:55.300
 water to destroy bacteria and germs 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:59.770
 the hood must be revived and 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:09.080
 structure this on black stone 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:09.769
 silicone so before something 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.229
 do 

00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:17.559
 could you read advice 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:20.589
 obsleduete analyze 

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:25.039
 believe what you don't understand 

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:28.639
 impossible or like religious people they 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:30.349
 how to measure normally what they don't 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:35.209
 understand most 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:40.939
 but in order to understand it is necessary to 

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:46.699
 all sides read analyze and 

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:50.990
 make inferences my another tip 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:51.939
 never drink and never eat at 1 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.479
 tour 

00:07:51.939 --> 00:08:00.919
 always blowing in 20-30 minutes and after 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:03.889
 igromkom hour and a half 2 3 and so 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:07.729
 further but when else will you allow 

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:10.419
 to do the second time there and twitter 

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:15.469
 always the interval should be at least 

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:18.309
 half an hour good luck to you friends of happiness and 

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:18.309
 health
