steals 154cm I think was the original
the<00:01:42.540> original<00:01:42.570> version<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:44.940> it's<00:01:45.600> just

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the original version and so it's just

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050 
the original version and so it's just
just<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.110> few<00:01:46.260> changes<00:01:46.590> along<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.830> way<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.400> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
just a few changes along the way and of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.700 
just a few changes along the way and of

along<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.830> years<00:02:09.259> one<00:02:10.259> thing<00:02:10.440> I've<00:02:10.560> always

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
along the years one thing I've always

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.920 
along the years one thing I've always
done<00:02:11.519> did<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.060> annoyed<00:02:12.480> me<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> little<00:02:12.810> bit

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
done did so annoyed me a little bit

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.209 
done did so annoyed me a little bit
about<00:02:13.109> venturing<00:02:13.469> that<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:13.980> they're<00:02:14.129> not

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
about venturing that is that they're not

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.619 
about venturing that is that they're not
that<00:02:14.489> sharp<00:02:14.819> when<00:02:14.999> they<00:02:15.090> come<00:02:15.239> out<00:02:15.269> of<00:02:15.359> the<00:02:15.420> box

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
that sharp when they come out of the box

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.150 
that sharp when they come out of the box
do<00:02:15.870> not<00:02:16.049> like<00:02:16.290> spyderco<00:02:16.769> sharp

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
do not like spyderco sharp

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.260 
do not like spyderco sharp
and<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:18.540> know<00:02:18.660> i<00:02:18.900> mean<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:20.760> it's

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
and you know i mean it's it's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.990 
and you know i mean it's it's
unfortunate<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:21.960> that's<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.820> that's<00:02:23.820> just

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
unfortunate but that's just that's just

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.670 
unfortunate but that's just that's just
what<00:02:24.300> what<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.690> get<00:02:24.840> when<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.050> my<00:02:25.200> benchmade

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
what what you get when you my benchmade

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.380 
what what you get when you my benchmade
right<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:28.520> just<00:02:29.520> under<00:02:29.670> four<00:02:29.970> inches<00:02:30.240> on

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
right so this just under four inches on

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.210 
right so this just under four inches on
the<00:02:30.420> blade<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.690> overall<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:31.800> under<00:02:32.040> nine

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
the blade and overall is just under nine

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.680 
the blade and overall is just under nine
inches<00:02:32.640> here<00:02:33.110> g10<00:02:35.390> one<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.540> Knights

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
inches here g10 one of the Knights

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.630 
inches here g10 one of the Knights
reaches<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.200> full<00:02:37.440> back<00:02:37.650> spacer<00:02:38.190> here<00:02:38.220> all

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
reaches the full back spacer here all

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.760 
reaches the full back spacer here all
the<00:02:38.880> way<00:02:38.910> across<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.570> when<00:02:39.690> your<00:02:39.840> woman<00:02:40.380> your

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
the way across so when your woman your

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.980 
the way across so when your woman your
palm<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.430> don't<00:02:41.580> get<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.420> edges<00:02:42.690> dig<00:02:42.870> in

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
palm you don't get that the edges dig in

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.780 
palm you don't get that the edges dig in
feels<00:02:43.470> like<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.770> nice<00:02:44.420> good<00:02:45.530> solid<00:02:46.530> sort<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.550> but

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
feels like a nice good solid sort of but

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.760 
feels like a nice good solid sort of but
in<00:02:48.060> your<00:02:48.540> hand<00:02:48.750> which<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.260> would<00:02:49.440> really<00:02:49.590> like

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
in your hand which I would really like

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.710 
in your hand which I would really like
about<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.730> course<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.090> most<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.390> access

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
about it of course like most the access

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.030 
about it of course like most the access
log<00:02:51.900> folders<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.530> has<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> little<00:02:52.830> bit<00:02:52.980> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
log folders it has a little bit of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.980 
log folders it has a little bit of
jumping<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> inside<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.660> liner's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
jumping on the inside of the liner's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.220 
jumping on the inside of the liner's
here<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.380> here<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.670> when<00:02:57.660> you're<00:02:57.780> holding<00:02:58.110> it

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
here and here so when you're holding it

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.410 
here and here so when you're holding it
it<00:02:58.740> looks<00:02:58.950> clean<00:02:59.400> from<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.850> front<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.330> when

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
it looks clean from the front but when

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.130 
it looks clean from the front but when
you're<00:03:00.510> actually<00:03:00.630> holding<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.200> feel<00:03:01.440> that

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
you're actually holding you feel that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.300 
you're actually holding you feel that
though<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.290> complaints<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.740> this<00:03:04.860> knife<00:03:05.070> is

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
though the complaints of this knife is

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.190 
though the complaints of this knife is
that<00:03:06.030> there's<00:03:06.210> not<00:03:06.330> much<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.690> finger<00:03:06.990> choil

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
that there's not much of a finger choil

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.320 
that there's not much of a finger choil
and<00:03:07.470> there's<00:03:07.590> no<00:03:07.710> some<00:03:08.070> ramp<00:03:08.340> up<00:03:08.550> here<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.240> you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
and there's no some ramp up here so you

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.580 
and there's no some ramp up here so you
can't<00:03:09.540> really<00:03:09.630> get<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.050> there<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.380> fine

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
can't really get in there with fine

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.250 
can't really get in there with fine
clothes<00:03:10.860> work<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:12.300> because<00:03:12.990> it's<00:03:13.200> a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
clothes work and because it's a

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.540 
clothes work and because it's a
four-inch<00:03:13.590> blade<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.220> whole<00:03:14.400> that

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
four-inch blade you have the whole that

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.000 
four-inch blade you have the whole that
kind<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.850> far<00:03:15.060> back<00:03:15.270> so<00:03:15.300> doing<00:03:16.260> fine<00:03:16.530> work<00:03:16.770> was

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
kind of far back so doing fine work was

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.340 
kind of far back so doing fine work was
is<00:03:17.190> not<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.610> greatest<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.240> knife<00:03:18.450> be

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
is not the greatest with this knife be

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.080 
is not the greatest with this knife be
nicer<00:03:19.710> if<00:03:19.740> you<00:03:19.860> could<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.340> know<00:03:20.460> get<00:03:20.970> your

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
nicer if you could you know get your

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.390 
nicer if you could you know get your
thumb<00:03:21.270> up<00:03:21.390> closer<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.410> maybe<00:03:22.590> finger<00:03:23.160> troll

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
thumb up closer and maybe finger troll

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.940 
thumb up closer and maybe finger troll
up<00:03:23.580> front<00:03:23.850> here<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.560> can't<00:03:25.560> do<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.800> with

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
up front here but can't do that with

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.570 
up front here but can't do that with
this<00:03:26.070> one<00:03:27.380> blade<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.070> blade<00:03:29.250> shape<00:03:29.400> is

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
this one blade is is the blade shape is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.100 
this one blade is is the blade shape is
actually<00:03:29.940> pretty<00:03:30.240> interesting<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:30.959> one

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
actually pretty interesting on this one

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.380 
actually pretty interesting on this one
it<00:03:31.620> follows<00:03:31.980> sort<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.340> larger<00:03:32.760> curve<00:03:33.060> of

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
it follows sort of a larger curve of

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.170 
it follows sort of a larger curve of
larger<00:03:34.110> recurve<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.800> belly<00:03:35.070> up<00:03:35.760> here<00:03:36.090> in

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
larger recurve but the belly up here in

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.000 
larger recurve but the belly up here in
like<00:03:36.630> further<00:03:36.990> back<00:03:37.260> as<00:03:37.500> opposed<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:37.890> most

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
like further back as opposed to most

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.710 
like further back as opposed to most
bellies<00:03:38.459> which<00:03:38.640> kind<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.060> start<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.420> little<00:03:39.630> bit

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
bellies which kind of start a little bit

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.140 
bellies which kind of start a little bit
earlier<00:03:40.070> that<00:03:41.070> gives<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.400> sort<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.850> longer

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
earlier that gives you sort of a longer

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.300 
earlier that gives you sort of a longer
round<00:03:42.720> edge<00:03:42.990> to<00:03:43.230> use<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.709> it's<00:03:43.980> actually

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
round edge to use so that it's actually

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.860 
round edge to use so that it's actually
quite<00:03:44.459> good<00:03:44.580> for<00:03:44.850> slicing<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.510> stuff<00:03:45.720> like

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
quite good for slicing and stuff like

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.710 
quite good for slicing and stuff like
that<00:03:46.580> well<00:03:47.580> then<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.760> notice<00:03:48.060> about<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.420> one

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
that well then I notice about this one

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.620 
that well then I notice about this one
particular<00:03:49.020> is<00:03:49.520> there<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.700> bit<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.090> QC<00:03:51.510> issue

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
particular is there is a bit of QC issue

a little little little quirks so

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.880 
a little little little quirks so
generally<00:04:14.070> speaking<00:04:14.400> six<00:04:14.880> seven<00:04:15.209> ten<00:04:15.330> is

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
generally speaking six seven ten is

generally speaking six seven ten is
probably<00:04:16.890> one<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.430> most<00:04:18.060> well<00:04:18.390> designed

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880
