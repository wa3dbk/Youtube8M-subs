00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.819 
have this pre scaled so I'll just do
okay<00:00:32.340> pixels<00:00:34.489> 1728<00:00:35.489> pixels<00:00:35.940> wide<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.829> 1016

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
okay pixels 1728 pixels wide and 1016

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.220 
okay pixels 1728 pixels wide and 1016
pixels<00:00:38.370> high<00:00:39.210> ok<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.510> your<00:00:42.540> basic

whole image is scaled okay now this is
our<00:01:34.259> basement<00:01:34.500> issue<00:01:35.060> let's<00:01:36.060> create<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:37.020> new

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
our basement issue let's create a new

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.130 
our basement issue let's create a new
layer<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:39.470> one<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:40.740> layer<00:01:41.040> these<00:01:41.930> will<00:01:42.930> be

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
layer and one more layer these will be

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.749 
layer and one more layer these will be
for<00:01:43.350> our<00:01:43.380> things<00:01:44.930> next<00:01:45.930> let's<00:01:46.259> take<00:01:46.560> an<00:01:46.890> esper

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
for our things next let's take an esper

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.520 
for our things next let's take an esper
and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:01.280 
and
put<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:55.380> layer<00:01:58.970> now<00:01:59.970> scale<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
put that on this layer now scale it a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.859 
put that on this layer now scale it a
little<00:02:01.500> bit<00:02:01.680> more<00:02:06.710> now<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:08.220> take<00:02:08.399> your<00:02:08.869> what

render and that's done then let's just

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:47.200 
render and that's done then let's just
take<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.459> Pokemon<00:02:36.030> logo

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:56.240 

take<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:50.990> magic<00:02:51.990> copy<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:54.920> then<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.130> our

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
take this magic copy and then in our

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.600 
take this magic copy and then in our
final<00:02:56.760> layer<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:58.170> piece<00:02:58.440> dead<00:02:58.770> but<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.580> a

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
final layer the piece dead but this is a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.990 
final layer the piece dead but this is a
really<00:03:00.120> big<00:03:00.450> scale<00:03:00.930> one<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:01.770> we're<00:03:02.610> gonna<00:03:02.730> have

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
really big scale one so we're gonna have

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.690 
really big scale one so we're gonna have
to<00:03:03.030> shrink<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.840> down<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:07.140> size<00:03:07.530> not<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.520> do

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
to shrink it down that size not you do

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:21.290 
to shrink it down that size not you do
scale<00:03:14.420> let's<00:03:15.420> stretch<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.110> out<00:03:20.000> across<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
scale let's stretch it out across the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.330 
scale let's stretch it out across the
top<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:21.600> we<00:03:21.960> can<00:03:22.080> see<00:03:22.350> our<00:03:22.560> awesome<00:03:23.100> Betty

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.590 
tool one more time cut that off don't
forget<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.060> sections<00:03:33.920> inside<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.330> did<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
forget the sections inside and I did the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.120 
forget the sections inside and I did the
round<00:03:36.780> one<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.200> control<00:03:37.590> Z<00:03:37.890> allows<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:39.000> to

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
round one so control Z allows you to

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:49.220 
round one so control Z allows you to
track<00:03:41.130> things<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:47.360> there<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.450> go<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.630> pretty

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
track things and there you go a pretty

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.710 
track things and there you go a pretty
basic<00:03:49.610> albeit<00:03:50.610> but<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.360> background

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
basic albeit but a background

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.100 
basic albeit but a background
nonetheless<00:03:52.280> now<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:54.360> just<00:03:54.570> save<00:03:54.840> this

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
nonetheless now this you just save this

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.540 
nonetheless now this you just save this
file<00:03:56.450> so<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.720> go<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.350> your<00:03:58.650> file

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
file so you go to your file

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.680 
file so you go to your file
and<00:04:00.470> since<00:04:01.470> Gimp<00:04:02.100> uses<00:04:02.489> its<00:04:02.850> own<00:04:03.030> files<00:04:03.450> which

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
and since Gimp uses its own files which

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.900 
and since Gimp uses its own files which
are<00:04:03.840> pretty<00:04:04.110> much<00:04:04.260> useless<00:04:04.890> outside<00:04:05.550> of<00:04:05.700> Kim

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
are pretty much useless outside of Kim

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.660 
are pretty much useless outside of Kim
