here<00:01:03.759> just<00:01:04.759> there<00:01:04.999> okay<00:01:05.799> there<00:01:06.799> on<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.819> map

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
here just there okay there on the map

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.499 
here just there okay there on the map
okay<00:01:08.719> there's<00:01:09.530> three<00:01:09.799> of<00:01:09.920> them<00:01:10.130> but<00:01:11.060> there's

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
okay there's three of them but there's

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.749 
okay there's three of them but there's
three<00:01:12.079> yellow<00:01:12.469> cuts<00:01:12.799> but<00:01:13.009> one<00:01:13.310> of<00:01:13.399> them<00:01:13.520> just

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
three yellow cuts but one of them just

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.330 
three yellow cuts but one of them just
stands<00:01:14.090> out<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.270> most<00:01:14.389> is<00:01:14.630> two<00:01:14.899> over<00:01:15.049> there<00:01:15.340> so

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
stands out the most is two over there so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.410 
stands out the most is two over there so
I<00:01:16.369> don't<00:01:16.520> know<00:01:16.609> if<00:01:16.700> there's<00:01:16.880> actually<00:01:17.179> like

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
I don't know if there's actually like

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.080 
I don't know if there's actually like
technically<00:01:17.929> three<00:01:18.139> but<00:01:18.709> you<00:01:19.009> don't<00:01:19.969> really

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
technically three but you don't really

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.719 
technically three but you don't really
seeing<00:01:20.389> them<00:01:20.509> often<00:01:20.840> around<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.139> map<00:01:21.350> and

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
seeing them often around the map and

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.249 
seeing them often around the map and
there's<00:01:22.729> one<00:01:22.880> over<00:01:23.030> there<00:01:23.149> I<00:01:23.569> think<00:01:23.959> that<00:01:24.109> one

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
there's one over there I think that one

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.169 
there's one over there I think that one
is<00:01:24.499> the<00:01:24.920> best<00:01:25.189> one<00:01:25.399> particular<00:01:25.700> because<00:01:26.060> it's

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
is the best one particular because it's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.389 
is the best one particular because it's
always<00:01:26.380> spawned<00:01:27.380> by<00:01:27.649> itself<00:01:27.979> it's<00:01:28.280> not

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
always spawned by itself it's not

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.010 
always spawned by itself it's not
usually<00:01:28.819> in<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:28.999> group<00:01:29.209> but<00:01:29.359> if<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.569> does<00:01:29.719> it

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
usually in the group but if it does it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.709 
usually in the group but if it does it
does<00:01:30.200> but<00:01:30.819> anyway<00:01:31.819> I'm<00:01:31.969> gonna<00:01:32.090> try<00:01:32.179> and<00:01:32.450> go<00:01:32.569> and

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719
