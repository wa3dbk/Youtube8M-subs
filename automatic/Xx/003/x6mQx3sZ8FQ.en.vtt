going to be any start or end to any
particular<00:01:39.119> color<00:01:39.329> everything<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.439> just

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
particular color everything is just

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.679 
particular color everything is just
going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.920> blended<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.970> nicely<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
going to be blended in really nicely and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.530 
going to be blended in really nicely and
to<00:01:43.320> avoid<00:01:43.649> any<00:01:43.890> harsh<00:01:44.280> edges<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.909> helps<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
to avoid any harsh edges it helps to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.109 
to avoid any harsh edges it helps to
move<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.259> brush<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.880> windshield<00:01:47.880> wiper

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
move the brush in windshield wiper

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.410 
move the brush in windshield wiper
motions<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.049> circular<00:01:49.590> motions<00:01:50.299> next<00:01:51.299> I'm

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
motions and in circular motions next I'm

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.170 
motions and in circular motions next I'm
taking<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.899> more<00:01:52.229> dense<00:01:52.560> blending<00:01:53.460> brush<00:01:53.729> it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
taking a more dense blending brush it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.149 
taking a more dense blending brush it
has<00:01:54.720> shorter<00:01:55.170> bristle<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159

i want my eyeliner to look I talked
about<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:53.760> my<00:03:53.970> last<00:03:54.180> video<00:03:54.540> where<00:03:55.200> I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
about this in my last video where I

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.949 
about this in my last video where I
create<00:03:55.800> this<00:03:56.250> shape<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.209> want<00:03:57.300> using

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
create this shape that I want using

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.380 
create this shape that I want using
liquid<00:03:58.230> eyeliner<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.160> then<00:03:59.730> I<00:03:59.760> fill<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.090> in

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
liquid eyeliner and then I fill it in

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.560 
liquid eyeliner and then I fill it in
with<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.780> gel<00:04:01.290> or<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.620> cream<00:04:01.920> eyeliner<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.670> don't

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
with a gel or a cream eyeliner I don't

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.540 
with a gel or a cream eyeliner I don't
always<00:04:03.750> use<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:04.290> technique<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.310> don't

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
always use this technique and I don't

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.170 
always use this technique and I don't
recommend<00:04:05.880> this<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.510> anyone<00:04:06.989> who<00:04:08.090> struggles<00:04:09.090> a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
recommend this to anyone who struggles a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.150 
recommend this to anyone who struggles a
little<00:04:09.209> bit<00:04:09.570> with<00:04:09.870> doing<00:04:10.380> weight<00:04:10.739> eyeliner

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
little bit with doing weight eyeliner

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.759 
little bit with doing weight eyeliner
because<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.700> is<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.940> little<00:04:12.330> bit

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
because it is a little bit

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.800 
because it is a little bit
time-consuming<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.459> tedious<00:04:14.570> but<00:04:15.570> if<00:04:15.690> you

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
time-consuming and tedious but if you

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.390 
time-consuming and tedious but if you
have<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.169> time<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.680> do<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.890> i<00:04:17.070> would

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
have the time to do it i would

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.830 
have the time to do it i would
definitely<00:04:17.669> recommend<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.359> because<00:04:18.570> it

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
definitely recommend it because it

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.340 
definitely recommend it because it
allows<00:04:19.080> you<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.500> create<00:04:19.710> a<00:04:20.419> more<00:04:21.419> precise<00:04:21.930> line

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
allows you to create a more precise line

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.500 
allows you to create a more precise line
using<00:04:22.890> a<00:04:23.039> liquid

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
using a liquid

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.770 
using a liquid
eyeliner<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:25.490> gel<00:04:25.700> eyeliner<00:04:26.120> helps<00:04:26.600> to

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
eyeliner and the gel eyeliner helps to

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.050 
eyeliner and the gel eyeliner helps to
bring<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.740> out<00:04:27.800> even<00:04:28.190> more<00:04:28.220> because<00:04:28.670> it's<00:04:28.970> a

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
bring it out even more because it's a

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.810 
bring it out even more because it's a
bit<00:04:29.240> more<00:04:29.480> darker<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.200> it's<00:04:30.320> mad<00:04:30.620> as<00:04:31.010> opposed

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
bit more darker and it's mad as opposed

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.180 
bit more darker and it's mad as opposed
to<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.570> liquid<00:04:32.960> eyeliner<00:04:33.290> which<00:04:33.530> has<00:04:33.740> more<00:04:34.040> of

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
to the liquid eyeliner which has more of

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.610 
to the liquid eyeliner which has more of
a<00:04:34.280> shine<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:36.050> if<00:04:36.320> you're<00:04:36.470> more

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
a shine to it so if you're more

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.220 
a shine to it so if you're more
comfortable<00:04:37.000> using<00:04:38.000> one<00:04:38.450> or<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.720> other<00:04:38.750> just

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
comfortable using one or the other just

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.120 
comfortable using one or the other just
go<00:04:39.380> ahead<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.620> stick<00:04:39.950> with<00:04:40.070> that<00:04:41.560> next<00:04:42.560> top<00:04:42.950> it

there because I just feel like it really

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.050 
there because I just feel like it really

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.280

they're perfect for a date out or you

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.380 
they're perfect for a date out or you
know<00:05:33.380> just<00:05:33.410> something<00:05:33.890> more<00:05:34.100> romantic<00:05:34.280> so<00:05:35.090> and

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
know just something more romantic so and

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.510 
know just something more romantic so and
i<00:05:36.050> like<00:05:36.230> the<00:05:36.350> fact<00:05:36.380> that<00:05:36.620> they're<00:05:36.830> more<00:05:37.010> wispy

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
i like the fact that they're more wispy

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.430 
i like the fact that they're more wispy
so<00:05:38.150> they<00:05:38.240> look<00:05:38.450> quite<00:05:38.600> natural<00:05:39.140> but<00:05:39.290> they're

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
so they look quite natural but they're

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.310 
so they look quite natural but they're
extremely<00:05:39.980> long<00:05:40.340> and<00:05:40.730> they<00:05:41.360> flare<00:05:41.720> out<00:05:41.750> really

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
extremely long and they flare out really

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.870 
extremely long and they flare out really
nicely<00:05:42.530> so<00:05:43.010> these<00:05:43.130> are<00:05:43.280> probably<00:05:43.580> one<00:05:43.760> of<00:05:43.790> my
