00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.070
 what a fart how is my name is get my 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.230
 In this video I bring my list 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.600
 best murderous doll movies 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.820
 I want to clarify that it is a list and not 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.310
 a top so places do not matter to 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.290
 exception of the first good post before 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.820
 I will tell you that I was going to upload a 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.400
 list of the best horror movies 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.770
 but as it still does not convince me better I went up 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.960
 is also upload a video of the 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.880
 best gore movies to be seen without 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.100
 more than saying we start with the list 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.470
 the first movie on the list is the 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.420
 trilogy of terror or rather the 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.880
 third story of this film that takes 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.280
 the amelia title good this story 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.410
 it's relatively short does not last more than 30 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.840
 minutes and the truth is very little I can 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.850
 tell you have to see yourselves 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.290
 but the reason why I put it in the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.270
 list is that it's a classic and 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.190
 it's probably the story that most 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.590
 Fame has in the trilogy of terror 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.900
 the second movie is up and launched 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.270
 the puppet as it is known in Spanish and 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.920
 many who already think but saw 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.750
 what the hell if in this movie the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.730
 puppets are not the ones who kill the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.040
 people but I want to clarify that if 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.050
 they have a lot to do since they are the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.310
 legacy and the means for it to appear 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.380
 main antagonist 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.480
 also clear that they are the main theme 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.550
 of the movie this movie deserves 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.650
 be on the list for your argument that a 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.600
 it made me interesting besides 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.030
 several scenes that manage to scare you and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.430
 make you feel tension in general the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.470
 movie knows how to entertain well that is 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.030
 the basics in every movie so if not 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.310
 You have seen it I recommend it 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.960
 apart from the fact that the creators are the same 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.230
 that the saw saga and that shows 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.230
 quite 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.220
 the third movie is to lead is 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.320
 called also as playing to kill 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.880
 this movie in my opinion they made it 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.190
 because of the success of the movie 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.320
 chiles play but with the big difference 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.990
 in quotes is that here is a doll 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.790
 while chillies play is a male the 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.040
 story begins when a family 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.140
 American moves to Mexico because 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.630
 They acquired an old doll factory 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.670
 and his idea is to invest in that factory 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.410
 to re-inaugurate it again as a 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.720
 doll factory called doll and of 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.670
 ares but what they do not know is that very 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.670
 There are some ruins near the factory 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.440
 ancient of an extinct civilization of 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.600
 which releases an evil spirit 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.330
 who takes possession of the dolls of the 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.370
 good factory in my opinion is a copy 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.260
 of chucky but not in every way 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.630
 since it has some things that are 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.760
 original but even so it saves 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.870
 movie is over - but it does not hurt 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.930
 see it because there is something in this list 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.060
 the fourth movie is from monitors the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.920
 movie offers some performances not so 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.620
 good but in my opinion in the same way 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.360
 the characters are somewhat forced the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.430
 protagonist is the only one who achieves 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.290
 develop an acceptable role for not 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.599
 say good the argument develops 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.700
 one night in an old warehouse 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.799
 toys where they are trapped 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.110
 police and a weapons dealer after 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.450
 of a shooting and persecution by 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.579
 the police are added after others 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.290
 characters that are the same 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.269
 night in the store but all 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.700
 they do not know the danger that is coming 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.500
 because an evil spirit has been imprisoned 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.420
 in the warehouse and will do everything possible 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.090
 gain strength and own the future child 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.799
 that will have the police protagonist that 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.659
 includes controlling and giving life to 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.269
 place toys for your darks 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.430
 intentions good as they see the movie 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.290
 it's a bit salty but it manages 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.420
 entertain and if they ask me what was it 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.730
 Best film will tell you that was the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.950
 girl my july for god what an old tan 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.640
 more good although it only appeared by very 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.250
 Little time 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.560
 the fifth movie is called dolls the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.720
 home of the diabolical dolls in what 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.430
 personal this film pleased me more not 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.590
 a lot since it has several flaws and 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.959
 irregularities like all series film 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.970
 b still this movie is fun and 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.459
 keeps you watching it until the end what 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.650
 which it is good noteworthy how 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.660
 that the dolls were designed 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.970
 I have to say that this movie has 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.739
 to the diabolic dolls plus tripis and 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.019
 Like every porcelain doll 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.150
 it is sinister to this is added the 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.820
 animation and the faces they take giving 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.010
 result to terrifying dolls in 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.780
 end the plot takes us to a Gothic house 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.760
 in the middle of nowhere where the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.070
 owners of these are a couple of 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.590
 elders dedicated to making dolls and 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.570
 porcelain then during a night is 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.760
 when a torrential rain hits the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.650
 road forcing several people 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.169
 divert your car to the house of the 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.060
 couple where they took refuge for the rest 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.130
 at night is here when guests 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.110
 They enter the house and discover the 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.020
 disturbing decoration of dolls 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.000
 porcelain in almost the whole house good 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.590
 you will have to see it to discover 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.969
 what happens inside this mysterious 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.550
 home 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:03.250
 apple and the fun to a cat 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.860
 the sixth movie speed master and with 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.840
 this I mean the whole saga though 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.670
 I've only seen four movies and 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.950
 done I have one in originally divided 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.140
 I know very well to this saga and I know what 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.270
 represents since it has been one of the most 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.970
 successes within the doll genre 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.440
 devilish and an icon of terror 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.570
 I recognize the importance of all 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.690
 movies of the saga but I will limit myself to 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.730
 tell them about the first movie coupet 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.680
 master speaks of a famous hetero marion 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.960
 andrew called tolÃ³n he has discovered 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.420
 an ancient Egyptian formula so that 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.670
 dead come back to life he used it for 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.470
 give life to his puppets then 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.420
 Nazi agents who had already 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.400
 been following for years are looking for it in 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.230
 the hotel where he was at 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.020
 find out about it andrew hides his 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.060
 puppets and commits suicide after 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.310
 several years some psychics are sent 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.660
 to the hotel where he died have blom challenge for 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.920
 investigate about the facts 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.330
 supernatural 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.070
 it is here where his sinister and 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.800
 Bloodthirsty puppets will make their 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.990
 appearance as I said is a movie 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.000
 of worship and the truth that is very good and 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.860
 entertaining besides having a 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.180
 pretty creepy atmosphere 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.840
 an interesting story 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.280
 and original and some terrifying dolls 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.110
 I also recommend the second movie 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.740
 that was good for me but personally 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.930
 I liked more is the seventh movie and 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.150
 the best obviously skills play and all 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.100
 its sequels but eye me and 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.810
 probably the majority of lan that the 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.600
 three first are those that have more 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.520
 elements of terror and that's why they are the 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.380
 which are more appreciated although the others do not 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.289
 they are wrong but they changed the gender of 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.539
 terror to black comedy although the last 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.520
 movie that is the sixth installment had more 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.729
 elements of terror but honestly 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.860
 I almost did not like it, it was very predictable that 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:46.690
 I would put this movie on my list and it's 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.970
 that the great impact it caused in the 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.800
 horror genre was amazing and that 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.990
 impact not only hit the public 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.300
 adult but he also did it in the 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.220
 childish I recognize that it provoked me 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.500
 fear of very child but is that they see 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.810
 click mariak doll or how I was not going to 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.940
 escape I will tell you about the first 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.949
 delivery that your argument is about a 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.900
 famous and wanted serial killer 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:09.699
 called Charles Lee King who is 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.590
 chased one night by a detective 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:14.020
 unleashing a shooting in the streets 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.940
 resulting charles mortally wounded 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.099
 in his desperation he hid in a 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.810
 toy store where with knowledge of 

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:22.120
 black magic passed his soul to that of a 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.250
 doll that was there the spell 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.620
 He caused lightning to fall into the toy store 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.259
 blowing up almost the entire place and 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.090
 Charles Viceroy was presumed dead 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:33.280
 then a vagabond picked up the doll 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.990
 possessed by the soul of charles reads king and 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.000
 he sold it to karen barkley for 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.879
 give it to her birthday gift to her 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.620
 son andy the chucky possessed doll as 

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:43.270
 he calls himself to the little andy and 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.430
 will use it to resolve issues 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.490
 pending his supposed death and 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.169
 to transfer his soul to the body of andy 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.180
 well the truth is the plot is quite 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:54.400
 original and the movie offers some
