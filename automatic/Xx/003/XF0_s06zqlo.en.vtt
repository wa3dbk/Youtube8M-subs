00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hey people 3 max disappointed we show 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.509
 this cool pearl effect on your car 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.450
 You just have to bring that 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.130
 in sallys customs my kita was now 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.780
 back in white so you can see 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.360
 how I did it all here 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.800
 on the primary color chooses dull black 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.470
 from like or here it does not matter 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.400
 main thing a dull color I think 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.900
 just black looks best 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.580
 from places we will see soon 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 then you go to a metallic color 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 select these but do not buy them and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.609
 Now go to the tires and choose one 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 other fields type really out now 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 no matter which field type we do 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.730
 Can change from sport rims to others 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 sport wheels from suv to sport wheels from 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.969
 low rider to sport length so or 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.969
 turned over as really completely no matter 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.610
 main thing changes the rims that stop 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.289
 others are like it was fire 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.420
 if you have done that with me so far 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.860
 a bit used to me actually 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.030
 times to decide in any case 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.469
 you did that, just go back 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.940
 on paint and you see you have 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.879
 there a new category and that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.500
 Pearl effect here you can just one 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.489
 Select any color and see it 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.020
 already you have a really hot 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.850
 Perfect in the car and now you know 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.229
 also why I said matte black 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.270
 It just looks the best 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.570
 you just have to say it clearly and yes 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.340
 I hope you have this clip 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.840
 please and if you have questions 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.760
 then he looks in the comments 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.900
 but before I get the video here now 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.670
 I would like to end a bit more 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.680
 say to my last videos me 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.180
 I've done that and now I have 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.890
 I think so or so 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.470
 my last two videos became easy 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.630
 let me be honest personally 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.820
 Although I can not understand why 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.320
 the display must be it is just 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.840
 an intro video in the decision against 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.939
 klitschko but good that life that 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 its i think thats because if 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.240
 I also often read in the comments 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.040
 have you stole from or 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.840
 when I saw it or knew what 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.979
 i am yes people is so i mean i do 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.270
 it is not a secret I have 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.229
 I never claim that I am the church 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.020
 find yourself 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.840
 and I mean, it's just like that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.909
 sometimes look at others like that 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.009
 just normal that there is not 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.600
 daily thousands of gta glitches that 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.399
 everyone else can do it completely 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.110
 normal and I mean what is it 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.149
 so bad if not on the internet 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.380
 looked up and this maybe from 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.689
 English into German translated for 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.179
 the German community with it 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.129
 The easiest way to have these clips in the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.330
 can perform quite honestly today 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.110
 I do not quite understand, though 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.510
 lounger 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.590
 active one so i want to 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.420
 again like to point out that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.370
 Tonight at 20 o'clock the autolobby 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.440
 will take place and just comes out 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.970
 first there I will go to the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.150
 comments written the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.770
 trigger names and yes well then I would 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.010

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.010
