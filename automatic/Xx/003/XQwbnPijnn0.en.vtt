00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.829
 Hello 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.509
 I want to show you weavers today at TAKKT Spiro 3d a city 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.019
 a type 2 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.530
 which does not exist in the database of Tacho is included 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.869
 For example, we have here 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.829
 Austrian the budget is not so many cities in it and a user has me 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.469
 addressed on how he can paste because St Pölten 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.060
 and I would like to show it now 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:30.720
 to 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 we give the name 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.780
 the start at St Pölten at Akku Wetter com 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.690
 I've done this before 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.940
 at the top of the address bar 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.000
 we find their reason for St Pölten 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.760
 The copies are now easy 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.290
 now we start on the speedometer AG 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.420
 Weather data but is editor 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.990
 and go 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.390
 rich to the biggest that is at the bottom of this program 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.920
 all percent 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 Countries with de or oil are here at the bottom 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.430
 Now we get Citizen 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.910
 and 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.560
 Red City 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 First enter the city name here 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 and copying 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.270
 the area from the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 Address of all with the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.180
 the Soli Growth Fund St Pölten 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.820
 Herford Minden in the line for Orco Weather Code 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.740
 of course we have to get the signs here 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.609
 correct 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.249
 he can not do Internet Explorer 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.399
 represent evil and as 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:21.779
 So let's just write here 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.779
 St Pölten as it stands above 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.329
 Let's also write that at Parkour Weather Code n 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.069
 so it sounds okay you 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.469
 then way 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.719
 and exactly 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.229
 and now you can 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.279
 the city 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.279
 Add 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.299
 It takes a few seconds to download the weather data 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.090
 and how he sows 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.419
 that works wonderfully 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.290
 he downloaded the data, ie the PEA 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.189
 That's why it went so fast 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.359
 that's a pretty fast connection 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.629

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.479
