00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
few that's one here one here another one

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.780 
few that's one here one here another one
there<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:30.650> can<00:01:30.800> even<00:01:30.920> fit<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.250> bottle<00:01:31.550> in

the<00:01:32.390> side<00:01:32.600> door<00:01:32.930> bin<00:01:33.260> now<00:01:34.010> I<00:01:34.040> was<00:01:34.250> wondering

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
the side door bin now I was wondering

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.010 
the side door bin now I was wondering
what<00:01:34.790> this<00:01:34.940> little<00:01:35.180> compartment<00:01:35.510> was<00:01:35.810> for

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
what this little compartment was for

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.570 
what this little compartment was for
down<00:01:36.230> here<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.680> thought<00:01:36.860> maybe<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:37.460> could

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
down here and thought maybe you could

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.330 
down here and thought maybe you could
fit<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.000> standard<00:01:38.870> keyless<00:01:39.290> go<00:01:39.650> in<00:01:39.830> there<00:01:40.010> but

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
fit the standard keyless go in there but

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.730 
fit the standard keyless go in there but
doesn't<00:01:40.909> actually<00:01:41.150> seem<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.540> fit<00:01:42.440> then<00:01:42.650> I

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
doesn't actually seem to fit then I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.240 
doesn't actually seem to fit then I
figured<00:01:42.980> it<00:01:43.100> out

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
figured it out

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.370 
figured it out
it's<00:01:43.610> been<00:01:43.760> specifically<00:01:44.330> designed<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.200> hold

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
it's been specifically designed to hold

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.510 
it's been specifically designed to hold
half-eaten

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
half-eaten

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.030 
half-eaten
chewing<00:01:47.210> gum<00:01:47.360> packets<00:01:48.610> see

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
cheap it's a nice positive mechanical

cheap it's a nice positive mechanical
feel<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.880> then<00:02:26.299> there's<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.600> simple

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
feel to it and then there's a simple

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.270 
feel to it and then there's a simple
suspension<00:02:27.440> because<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.739> just<00:02:27.920> don't<00:02:28.130> have

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
suspension because you just don't have

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.090 
suspension because you just don't have
to<00:02:28.459> worry<00:02:28.610> about<00:02:28.670> speed<00:02:29.120> humps<00:02:29.450> or<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.890> get<00:02:31.010> it

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
to worry about speed humps or to get it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.790 
to worry about speed humps or to get it
slightly<00:02:31.370> wrong<00:02:31.670> that's<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.480> mini<00:02:32.630> roundabout

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.980 

the<00:02:40.250> jacked-up<00:02:40.460> white-eyed<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.390> also<00:02:41.720> good<00:02:41.900> at

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
the jacked-up white-eyed is also good at

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.020 
the jacked-up white-eyed is also good at
smoothing<00:02:42.380> out<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.500> bumps<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:43.100> higher<00:02:43.640> speeds

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
smoothing out the bumps a higher speeds

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.520 
smoothing out the bumps a higher speeds
which<00:02:44.210> means<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.690> ASX<00:02:45.080> is<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.260> great

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
which means that the ASX is a great

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.070 
which means that the ASX is a great
long-distance<00:02:46.100> Cruiser<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.720> can<00:02:47.930> factor

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
long-distance Cruiser and I can factor

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.240 
long-distance Cruiser and I can factor
that<00:02:48.260> because<00:02:48.560> I've<00:02:48.620> actually<00:02:48.740> driven<00:02:48.980> one

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
that because I've actually driven one

that because I've actually driven one

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
was the fact that you get quite a bit of

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.650 
was the fact that you get quite a bit of
wind<00:02:57.860> noise<00:02:57.920> from<00:02:58.670> around<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.030> a-pillar<00:02:59.480> up

wind noise from around the a-pillar up
here<00:02:59.930> which<00:03:00.560> can<00:03:00.680> get<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.920> bit<00:03:01.040> annoying<00:03:01.250> after

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
here which can get a bit annoying after

here which can get a bit annoying after
a<00:03:01.670> while<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.030> these<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.210> have<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.360> turn<00:03:02.510> up

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
a while and these you have to turn up

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.930 
a while and these you have to turn up
the<00:03:02.720> stereo<00:03:02.780> quite<00:03:03.470> loud<00:03:03.800> another<00:03:04.610> problem<00:03:04.910> I
