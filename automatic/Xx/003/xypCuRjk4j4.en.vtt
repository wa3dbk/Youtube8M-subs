hello<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.439> lead<00:00:01.829> ghost<00:00:02.100> driver<00:00:02.370> and

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hello this is lead ghost driver and

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.849 
hello this is lead ghost driver and
today<00:00:03.149> I'm<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.750> show<00:00:04.049> you<00:00:04.110> how<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.410> drift

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
today I'm going to show you how to drift

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.490 
today I'm going to show you how to drift
and<00:00:05.040> all<00:00:05.609> will<00:00:05.790> drive<00:00:06.029> car<00:00:06.359> without<00:00:06.690> tuning

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
and all will drive car without tuning

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.799 
and all will drive car without tuning
now<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:09.000> with<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> manual<00:00:09.660> transmission

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
now I do this with a manual transmission

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.129 
now I do this with a manual transmission
it<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:11.130> possible<00:00:11.400> with<00:00:11.910> an<00:00:12.059> automatic<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.900> is

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
it is possible with an automatic but is

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.560 
it is possible with an automatic but is
believe<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.009> or<00:00:14.070> not<00:00:14.250> harder<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:14.969> sustain<00:00:15.299> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
believe it or not harder to sustain a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.920 
believe it or not harder to sustain a
drift<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.199> must<00:00:16.949> also<00:00:17.160> state<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.699> all<00:00:18.359> drive

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
drift I must also state that all drive

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.470 
drift I must also state that all drive
drifting<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.560> not<00:00:19.890> accepted<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.820> most<00:00:21.090> drift

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
drifting is not accepted in most drift

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.230 
drifting is not accepted in most drift
kinds<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:22.470> will<00:00:22.859> drive<00:00:23.100> drifting<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.789> good<00:00:24.060> for

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
kinds or will drive drifting is good for

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.310 
kinds or will drive drifting is good for
beginners<00:00:24.359> since<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.380> easy<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.670> hold<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
beginners since it's easy to hold and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.880 
beginners since it's easy to hold and
getting<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> max<00:00:28.740> amount<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.340> ties<00:00:29.640> milk

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
getting the max amount of ties milk

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
getting the max amount of ties milk
today<00:00:31.890> I'm<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:32.669> using<00:00:32.850> lines<00:00:33.420> sky

into a wall but with practice you can

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
into a wall but with practice you can
stop<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> from<00:01:06.990> happening<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.619> more<00:01:08.369> poor

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700

you can't get an idea of how it feels

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.039 
you can't get an idea of how it feels
until<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.540> whenever<00:01:21.750> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
until you actually do it so whenever you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.740 
until you actually do it so whenever you
get<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> chance<00:01:22.580> practice<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:23.790> much<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
get the chance practice as much as you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:02:31.380 
get the chance practice as much as you
can

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.860 

Oh
