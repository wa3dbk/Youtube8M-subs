00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:25.140
 the British tradition maker 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.480
 has a little with the monitor 30.1 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.910
 artwork created which 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.740
 probably the last one probably 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.910
 be speakers it has the they 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.350
 buy in your life 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.220
 unlike many others 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.650
 loudspeakers , the hfr looks a bit 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.440
 old school standard seventies moderately 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.780
 and not as slim as that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.809
 Most speakers have a good one 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.580
 reason for speakers to be from 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.030
 very many sound producing 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.769
 artists and also radio stations 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.320
 used where it is not about that one 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.269
 speaker looks like a piece of furniture 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.519
 but it worked like a 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.790
 instrument and that sets just certain 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.200
 geometric shapes ahead but now 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.090
 works in contrast to most 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.460
 other speakers manufacturers too 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.530
 not totally muted and very 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 strong when lying and around the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.310
 to resign resonances but that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.870
 housing is treated like one 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.330
 instrument one has very agile wood 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.700
 be used and the front and the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.190
 Backside not yet glued 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.120
 but with a defined torque 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.490
 bolted and the whole is in the reason 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.490
 a construct seen as an instrument 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.730
 which just depends on that 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 is just sounds very natural and in 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.200
 connection with that of herbert 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.780
 developed radially deep midrange 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.659
 This results in a scary 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 natural fall dissolved and without 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.430
 very balanced sound picture that makes 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.869
 especially noticeable if one 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.840
 recordings that were not taken so well 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.969
 are classics from the 80s first 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.320
 digital shots old soul write the 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.960
 a bit thinner 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.000
 old rock stuff 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.920
 old stories of stones last for 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.230
 the modern speaker is not so 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.200
 All this sounds nice on this one 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.580
 have no problem at all because of this 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.750
 speakers just music 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.020
 are not matched by 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.030
 any effects for us here 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.260
 fan and one of the absolute 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.390
 indispensable speaker 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.010
 meanwhile, have a look 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.410
 bit used to the optics and 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.540
 not necessarily the varnished now 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.280
 slim state floor speaker 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.530
 absolutely want to have that on here 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.840
 a loudspeaker with which you very much 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.060
 can become happy 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.290
 and when it might be this 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.360
 speakers 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.940
 I would very much time in our 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.930
 studio welcome and in the hair monitor 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.930
 Show off 30 times
