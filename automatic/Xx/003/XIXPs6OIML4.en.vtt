00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.160
 hi we all know Marians 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.490
 welcome to this video where we will test 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.590
 gps- related settings 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.520
 we are essentially talking about the top range 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.590
 of home wico we carry out this test 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.829
 outdoors to avoid leakage of 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.739
 signal however malfunctions 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.629
 related to the use of satellite GPS for 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.950
 which we show you that they have 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.750
 chosen an open-air location also 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.320
 if it is cloudy this should not 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.970
 affect our video test 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.950
 essentially we will share our test 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.030
 in two parts or in a first part 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.239
 we will analyze the gps only with gps 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.309
 active therefore without wifi 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.380
 as you can appreciate we activate 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.259
 only the gps 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:11.619
 we go to the maps google maps and see 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:13.810
 how the sensor behaves so it comes 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.630
 notified of the GPS search 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.310
 after which once he has found the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.229
 satellites will be hooked to ours 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:27.249
 satellite will go out of position 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:32.439
 revealed therefore we await a question 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:39.579
 of seconds of course and after we will see 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:42.209
 how it will behave is still researching 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.209
 your position 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.750
 as I said before 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.510
 after which we will follow this test with 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.460
 active wifi 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.140
 here you see position established by 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.590
 gps means that he searched for us with 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.450
 let's go to his own describes his 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.830
 position 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.250
 you see that the signal has been locked 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.670
 but it is not enough to say 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.590
 integrate maps to get to know 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.840
 the area where we are therefore not 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.760
 they are reported in the locality 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.740
 this means what it means 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.190
 we necessarily need one 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.820
 wifi data connection 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.200
 obviously in the car is needed 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.200
 a data connection 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:47.500
 let's wait for a while to see if something 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:48.760
 change even if I doubt I remind you that 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.970
 this is its function 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.410
 of the GPS antenna 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.239
 here the various google maps settings 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.220
 which allows us to analyze the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.810
 traffic public transport i 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.440
 bicycle routes 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.450
 the routes the satellite map what it wants 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.820
 say the views from the other side of the landscape 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.640
 which we will later show you with wife 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.070
 finally active google earth 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.470
 the version is the last to 8.0 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:20.080
 google maps was the little upgrade 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:29.130
 long ago we see that little changes for which 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:33.760
 go to close the application this 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.320
 let's finish clearing the cache so 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.580
 really a cleaner signal we go 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:43.180
 activate our wifi 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:46.769
 here you see that he has connected will be 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.280
 notified by the icon above 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:54.900
 when he comes with the former, get ready here now 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.900
 let's go back to maps 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.380
 we see that he has already hooked up wifi 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.540
 see here already launched gps as the says 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.700
 gps stability position and also has 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.310
 also loaded the routes if we go to 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.530
 pinching we also find the different ways 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.410
 that surround us and very fast there 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:23.590
 navigation on if you have one 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:26.560
 data connection with a good operator 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.760
 the thing will be just as fast there 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.760
 we find essentially northeast of 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.550
 milan to caponago a country provinces 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.280
 monza brianza for which we are not in 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.780
 centro milano and the signal will be more 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.300
 clean they know essentially in the countryside 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.800
 how can you appreciate from the map then 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.840
 if we change mode we see there is the 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.170
 satellite modes are surrounded by 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.550
 verde those minds takes a while 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:05:00.150
 always load for the same problem 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:04.450
 the wifi but this should not have 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.210
 here we go to enlarge to see 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.360
 where is our area but just 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.170
 crush this will bring us back to the point 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:21.520
 of departure 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:23.440
 See, I'm crushing, so here we are 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.920
 took us to the location of 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.920
 departure 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.930
 then recapping the gps works 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.520
 even without data connection but not yes 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.670
 can surf because you often go 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.550
 meeting at bridge galleries anyway 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.530
 closed places that obstruct the 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.900
 signal reception and if we are in 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.210
 an open environment figured in 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.760
 car what could happen 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.480
 so if the gps supported by a 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.250
 Data connection 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.569
 the navigation is excellent and will be more than 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.189
 fluid like now 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.839
 for this focus is everything you remember 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.699
 follow us in the social media channels linked below 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:01.509
 a greeting of alessandro maya baked
