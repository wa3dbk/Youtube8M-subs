00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello welcome to the back my 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.710
 day i am mine and today will be 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.809
 For once we did not baked 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.219
 make a cheesecake the whole 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.570
 he actually works without baking 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.700
 only briefly in the fridge must 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.529
 before it can be eaten and that is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.910
 the one white chocolate blue 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 unbelievably tasty and totally easy 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.090
 made and so great things in there cup 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.340
 without cream cheese and white cream 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.140
 I would say chocolate and chocolate 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.610
 start by getting the white one first 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.079
 then chocolate can melt 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.120
 we like to cool down a bit 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.640
 the residues war I want now 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 is white chocolate in water bath while 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.460
 important for white chocolate 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.640
 bit more sensitive when melting 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.440
 is as the dark chocolate that the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.870
 peel in the white chocolate 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 not what he touches and that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.260
 Water is not quite as strong a cook 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.010
 it slightly to himself but to simmer 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.350
 should her much to himself and then 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.050
 slowly melt the chocolate 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.539
 with much patience and then from time to time 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.159
 a bit uneasy while the chocolate 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.600
 because melt so slowly to itself 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.939
 Let's take care of the floor 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.430
 I have my shoulder here for that 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.229
 is a 20's springform and I have 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.820
 the designed with baking paper leaves the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.540
 then very easily trigger on 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.000
 end and I've got butter biscuits the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.770
 are particularly suitable as a floor 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 and you can either now 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 run as long as beautiful scary 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.150
 are best with a wooden rod or 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.640
 like this or you just take here like me 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.110
 so last chopper machine there they have to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.450
 but then be careful that you do not 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.079
 chaffed too long because too fine to 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.079
 that will not be 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.120
 and then I melted here 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.890
 butter and here are the crumbs 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.470
 pure and then the whole thing will be nice 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.470
 touched that so correct max works 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.880
 and you can do that crumbly mass 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.140
 now so in your france falls now 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.880
 nice to third now we have ours 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.320
 wonderful floor ever and now 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.210
 I look again so white 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.430
 chocolate on whether she is already finished 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.950
 and then we continue with the rest 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.770
 the filling my white chocolate stands 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.300
 already ready for use next to me 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.450
 Now let's take care of them 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:41.640
 other ingredients, and I take here 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:49.200
 mascarpone cream cheese cream and one 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:53.580
 teaspoon vanilla extract and earlier that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.150
 with one let you stir nice 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.220
 Time 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.110
 should i see her is so fluid and 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.040
 the rest be that solid otherwise 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.239
 something goes wrong for the fund 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.640
 and if you have that then you can 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.640
 slowly add the white chocolate 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:17.840
 Look at that, that will be right 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.950
 delicious and now again stir well 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.829
 if you have that then you will miss it 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.599
 of course last but not least the 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.030
 Blueberries gives you some for 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.239
 later to learn but otherwise let you 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.189
 the rest just a giant as many me 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.750
 I'm still spied on now 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:40.879
 Carefully fold in and come now 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.879
 All that is beautiful our women 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.109
 it tastes so delicious 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.659
 I can not wait to get it done 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:04:03.599
 is now only the blueberries 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:04:05.400

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.560

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.989
 fridge so that it becomes nice and firm 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.370
 then he can cut him 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.139
 cheesecake was definitely long now 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.139
 Enough in the fridge I notice that 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.599
 that has become very nice and 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.280
 Now I read the form for it 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.959
 I take a knife and cut the 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.300
 first along the edge 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:29.610
 so you do not tear right away I have 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.789
 finished it now we set 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.740

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.930

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.490
 Try now we cut him 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.050

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.770
 I can not wait to see him 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.770

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.710
 yes is so delicious this cream is easy 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.120
 wonderful with the white chocolate 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.970
 although he's not an extra sugar in it 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.450
 like the 75 enough and with the blue 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.130
 become 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.990
 then comes the right frogs 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.340
 just perfect because it comes necessarily 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.050
