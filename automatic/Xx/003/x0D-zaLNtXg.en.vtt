Takeshi
it's<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.930> blades<00:00:07.259> tighten<00:00:07.919> now<00:00:08.360> the<00:00:09.360> first

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
it's the blades tighten now the first

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.290 
it's the blades tighten now the first
one<00:00:09.750> was<00:00:09.900> called<00:00:10.110> grants<00:00:10.800> Titan<00:00:11.400> second<00:00:12.150> from

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
one was called grants Titan second from

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.810 
one was called grants Titan second from
supernova<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:13.590> blade<00:00:14.190> Titan<00:00:14.639> so

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
supernova and this one blade Titan so

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.090 
supernova and this one blade Titan so
it's<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.030> second<00:00:15.389> title<00:00:15.650> but<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.770> Hertz

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
it's the second title but it's Hertz

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.189 
it's the second title but it's Hertz
robot<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.970> looks<00:00:18.240> pretty<00:00:18.510> cool<00:00:18.660> way

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
robot and it looks pretty cool way

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.340 
robot and it looks pretty cool way
different<00:00:19.619> than<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> other<00:00:20.010> two<00:00:20.900> so<00:00:21.900> let's

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
different than the other two so let's

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.910 
different than the other two so let's
get<00:00:22.529> started<00:00:22.949> first<00:00:23.910> armor<00:00:24.470> it's<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.590> long

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
get started first armor it's a long

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.200 
get started first armor it's a long
window<00:00:27.650> it's<00:00:28.650> two<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> these<00:00:29.189> things<00:00:29.429> which

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
window it's two of these things which

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.260 
window it's two of these things which
can<00:00:30.449> move<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.050> down<00:00:31.730> there's<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.910> little

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
can move up and down there's a little

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.240 
can move up and down there's a little
laser<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.260> nothing<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.950> one

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
laser on this one but nothing that one

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
laser on this one but nothing that one
so<00:00:35.960> it's<00:00:36.960> got<00:00:37.140> cool<00:00:37.399> shield<00:00:38.399> which<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:39.780> two

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
so it's got cool shield which has two

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.680 
so it's got cool shield which has two
this<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.770> rotating<00:00:41.190> gun<00:00:41.520> T<00:00:41.790> there's<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
this one is a rotating gun T there's a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.740 
this one is a rotating gun T there's a
satellite<00:00:43.110> by<00:00:43.920> here's<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.370> receiver<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> they

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
satellite by here's a receiver and they

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.340 
satellite by here's a receiver and they
can<00:00:45.989> move<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.800> down<00:00:47.039> that's<00:00:47.520> alright

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
can move up and down that's alright

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
can move up and down that's alright
also<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> sense<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.969> life<00:00:51.120> can

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
also that good and the sense of life can

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
also that good and the sense of life can
do<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:52.460> it's<00:00:53.460> pretty<00:00:53.670> fun<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.390> wax<00:00:55.190> almost

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
do that it's pretty fun the wax almost

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.990 
do that it's pretty fun the wax almost
healed<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:59.239> it<00:01:00.239> still<00:01:00.420> has<00:01:00.750> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
rotates and when it rotates it extends

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.969 
rotates and when it rotates it extends
but<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.850> show<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.090> here's<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.079> gear<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.590> if

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
but I will show you here's a gear and if

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
you turn that so star two

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.750 
you turn that so star two
the<00:01:46.960> extent<00:01:47.960> nada<00:01:48.410> shields<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:48.950> bigger<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.610> as

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
the extent nada shields is bigger and as

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.580 
the extent nada shields is bigger and as
you<00:01:49.880> can<00:01:50.030> see<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:52.010> I<00:01:52.280> can<00:01:52.520> also<00:01:54.130> see<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.590> she'll

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
you can see and I can also see so she'll

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.560 
you can see and I can also see so she'll
become<00:01:57.800> figure<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:58.910> all<00:01:59.120> I<00:01:59.240> have<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.540> say

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
become figure it's all I have to say

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.450 
become figure it's all I have to say
about<00:01:59.870> that<00:02:00.020> one<00:02:00.200> that's<00:02:00.710> that's<00:02:01.070> pretty<00:02:01.250> much

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
about that one that's that's pretty much

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.500 
about that one that's that's pretty much
to<00:02:01.640> say<00:02:01.820> but<00:02:01.880> it's<00:02:02.210> still<00:02:02.420> pretty<00:02:02.600> cool<00:02:02.750> robot

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
to say but it's still pretty cool robot

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.420 
to say but it's still pretty cool robot
so<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:06.650> must<00:02:06.860> be<00:02:06.950> it

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
so that must be it

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.570 
so that must be it
next<00:02:08.300> we<00:02:08.420> feel<00:02:08.660> will<00:02:08.869> be<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.440> turtles<00:02:10.160> off

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
next we feel will be the turtles off

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.960 
next we feel will be the turtles off
