00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.350
 see black game on this topic 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.300
 both farmers and hunters red the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.849
 population of animals has become in the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.410
 increased explosively in recent years 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.600
 bavarians alone are round every year 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.670
 60,000 wild boars were killed 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.949
 Just watch that whole now 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.480
 landscape has changed you have to say that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 the fields are getting bigger and bigger 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.890
 connected areas with the most 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.260
 For example, corn is usually feed 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.000
 that's what the wild boars want to do this year 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.649
 sven hunter extremely heavy that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.360
 to hunt wild boars because if it is in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.860
 the middle of the field is why in the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.860
 hunters come in it just works 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.230
 simply adds the mild winter 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.530
 the forests for the wild boars in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.930
 a real land of milk and honey transforms 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.910
 bucheckern or acorn the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.489
 feed supply is enormous 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.440
 without snow and cold also sinks 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.230
 natural mortality rate of 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.739
 Schwarzwalds no wonder so that the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.570
 number of animals continues to rise 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.659
 markus m端hlbauer has a solution for 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.390
 this problem is the topic of black game 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.880
 his specialty for hunting 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.130
 wild boar he has a very special 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.990
 tool made this whole 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.030
 conventional mobile phone believe in the long run 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.490
 fiddled so that you then in broken 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.580
 circuit have brought the where then 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.820
 build a call and shake it 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.979
 then to those who call the owners that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.409
 Handy stuck in a wild watch case 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.540
 how the hunter has been using for a long time 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.970
 and that was set up outside 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.369
 object or classic analog clock 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.049
 and when it has been thrown out 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.490
 then the clock stopped on 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.829
 next day is the hunter 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.720
 has gone to the clockwork 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.560
 screwed up and saw today 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.119
 At 2:34 am the pigs were there 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.270
 the whole thing was a solution but that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.990
 is just too late information in 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 Real time the mobile phone delivers the application 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.790
 is quite simple with the bait 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.430
 which should attract the black game 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.039
 markus m端hlbauer buries the mobile phone in 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.140
 leaves when the pigs forage 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.780
 look for the wild watch case 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.470
 it's going to be shaken up by that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.050
 mobile phone out 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.510
 The owner immediately receives one 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.710
 call and know that the animals government 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.560
 So have found the feeding point 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.870
 the idea is not completely new 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.070
 but the model of markus m端hlbauer has 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.020
 a definite advantage it handy 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.580
 given before my time but that is 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.940
 another technique and that is quite 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.400
 other price range around the 300 or far 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.410
 cost over 300 euros and therefore also 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.030
 thought so what are out in the woods 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.860
 where anyone finds it and takes it 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.360
 But it is also said other technique 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.700
 This is just trying for me 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.370
 Solution to find level relatively cheap 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.780
 and it is not one in the same way 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.980
 ruin drives you if you really want to 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.260
 someone puts someone around 90 euro costs 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.709
 the mobile of markus m端hlbauer since 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.080
 2006 is successfully in use and 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.350
 no longer just in his territory 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.540
 the demand is great 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.190
 the internet makes it possible as 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.900
 actually all over the world, that's it 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.519
 as it was yesterday eleven pieces still in 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.280
 Czech republic also shipped Czech republic 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.390
 or Austria switzerland spain so that 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.239
 is really everywhere 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.660
 many hundreds of cell phones are now in the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.090
 use a small device that's a big one 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.280
 easing work for the hunters and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.430
 hope for the farmers with them 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.630
 thus brings these images in the future 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.630
 belong to the past
