about four and a half i-495 for an hour
centimeters<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:13.049> could<00:00:13.170> also<00:00:13.290> buy<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> chops

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
centimeters you could also buy the chops

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.820 
centimeters you could also buy the chops
at<00:00:14.130> x<00:00:14.280> cube<00:00:14.790> for<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.440> even<00:00:16.440> though<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.710> small

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
at x cube for you even though it's small

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.590 
at x cube for you even though it's small
you<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.220> still<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.520> pretty<00:00:18.029> fun<00:00:18.180> started<00:00:18.510> with

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
you can still do pretty fun started with

00:00:18.600 --> 00:01:14.870 
you can still do pretty fun started with
it<00:00:18.720> let<00:00:19.080> me<00:00:19.170> show<00:00:19.320> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:05:16.999 

shia<00:01:15.659> over<00:01:15.960> there

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:33.419 

Oh

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:33.429 

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:35.799 

so<00:05:34.429> the<00:05:34.549> average<00:05:34.639> said<00:05:34.999> it<00:05:35.209> where<00:05:35.389> the<00:05:35.509> scoop

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:35.809 
so the average said it where the scoop

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:38.349 
so the average said it where the scoop
was<00:05:35.989> 12.6<00:05:36.799> to<00:05:36.919> do<00:05:37.069> this<00:05:37.519> was<00:05:37.729> rolling<00:05:38.119> average

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:38.359 
was 12.6 to do this was rolling average

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:40.929 
was 12.6 to do this was rolling average
of<00:05:38.509> 15<00:05:38.869> cubes<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.979> best<00:05:40.159> average<00:05:40.309> of<00:05:40.489> five<00:05:40.699> in

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:40.939 
of 15 cubes the best average of five in

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:45.039 
of 15 cubes the best average of five in
this<00:05:41.059> session<00:05:41.449> was<00:05:41.899> 12<00:05:42.349> point<00:05:42.649> 26<00:05:43.809> with<00:05:44.809> 12

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:45.049 
this session was 12 point 26 with 12

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:46.779 
this session was 12 point 26 with 12
point<00:05:45.259> 26<00:05:45.589> he<00:05:45.769> would<00:05:45.889> actually<00:05:46.219> have<00:05:46.339> won<00:05:46.579> two

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
point 26 he would actually have won two

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.829 
point 26 he would actually have won two
World<00:05:46.999> Championships<00:05:47.499> 2007<00:05:49.299> as<00:05:50.299> you<00:05:50.479> see<00:05:50.659> you

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:50.839 
World Championships 2007 as you see you

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.379 
World Championships 2007 as you see you
can<00:05:50.959> still<00:05:51.139> do<00:05:51.259> good<00:05:51.439> times<00:05:51.709> with<00:05:51.860> this<00:05:52.009> q<00:05:52.389> the

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
can still do good times with this q the

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:54.909 
can still do good times with this q the
downside<00:05:53.779> of<00:05:53.809> this<00:05:53.929> cube<00:05:54.289> is<00:05:54.409> actually<00:05:54.769> not

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
downside of this cube is actually not

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.909 
downside of this cube is actually not
that<00:05:54.979> it's<00:05:55.279> that<00:05:55.989> you<00:05:56.989> cannot<00:05:57.169> turn<00:05:57.469> fast<00:05:57.739> with

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
that it's that you cannot turn fast with

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.429 
that it's that you cannot turn fast with
it<00:05:58.039> actually<00:05:58.759> it's<00:05:58.969> recognition<00:05:59.449> for<00:06:00.319> me

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:00.439 
it actually it's recognition for me

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.459 
it actually it's recognition for me
itself<00:06:00.769> front<00:06:01.249> for<00:06:01.429> me<00:06:01.519> personally<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:03.110> the

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469 
itself front for me personally the the

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.799 
itself front for me personally the the
white<00:06:03.969> plastic<00:06:04.969> makes<00:06:05.239> it<00:06:05.360> really<00:06:05.539> hard<00:06:05.629> to

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:05.809 
white plastic makes it really hard to

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:09.299 
white plastic makes it really hard to
recognize<00:06:06.339> also<00:06:07.339> the<00:06:07.459> colors<00:06:07.759> of<00:06:07.939> this<00:06:08.569> cube<00:06:08.899> I

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:09.309 
recognize also the colors of this cube I

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.439 
recognize also the colors of this cube I
don't<00:06:10.309> know<00:06:10.369> if<00:06:10.489> you<00:06:10.549> can<00:06:10.669> see<00:06:10.909> it<00:06:10.939> but<00:06:11.149> they

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
don't know if you can see it but they

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.359 
don't know if you can see it but they
are<00:06:11.599> not<00:06:11.839> there<00:06:12.469> are<00:06:12.649> stickers<00:06:12.889> they're<00:06:13.339> just

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:13.369 
are not there are stickers they're just

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:15.279 
are not there are stickers they're just
printed<00:06:13.939> on<00:06:14.089> this<00:06:14.599> means<00:06:14.839> that<00:06:14.929> they<00:06:15.139> all

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
printed on this means that they all

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.489 
printed on this means that they all
scuff<00:06:15.679> up<00:06:15.799> over<00:06:16.129> time<00:06:17.079> after<00:06:18.079> that<00:06:18.199> I<00:06:18.379> will

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:18.499 
scuff up over time after that I will

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:20.799 
scuff up over time after that I will
skip<00:06:19.129> sticker<00:06:19.429> it<00:06:19.549> normally<00:06:19.999> with<00:06:20.509> normal

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:20.809 
skip sticker it normally with normal

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.619 
skip sticker it normally with normal
stickers<00:06:21.669> probably<00:06:22.669> recognition<00:06:23.209> of<00:06:23.389> the

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:23.629 
stickers probably recognition of the

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.919 
stickers probably recognition of the
cube<00:06:23.929> will<00:06:24.049> that<00:06:24.199> improve<00:06:24.559> and<00:06:25.089> also<00:06:26.089> with<00:06:26.899> a

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:26.929 
cube will that improve and also with a

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:28.569 
cube will that improve and also with a
bit<00:06:27.110> of<00:06:27.139> practice<00:06:27.589> i<00:06:27.769> think<00:06:27.949> i<00:06:28.009> can<00:06:28.069> do<00:06:28.309> is<00:06:28.429> sub

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:28.579 
bit of practice i think i can do is sub

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:31.449 
bit of practice i think i can do is sub
12<00:06:28.819> average<00:06:29.059> with<00:06:29.239> the<00:06:29.329> scoop<00:06:29.569> to<00:06:29.860> when<00:06:30.860> i<00:06:30.889> do

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:31.459 
12 average with the scoop to when i do

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.039 
12 average with the scoop to when i do
is<00:06:31.610> i<00:06:31.759> will<00:06:31.819> upload<00:06:32.119> a<00:06:32.239> video<00:06:32.419> of<00:06:32.599> this<00:06:32.719> to<00:06:32.929> of

is i will upload a video of this to of

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:34.869 
is i will upload a video of this to of
course<00:06:33.229> i<00:06:33.499> hope<00:06:34.159> you<00:06:34.279> enjoyed<00:06:34.519> watching<00:06:34.669> this
