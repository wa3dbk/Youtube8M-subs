00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 here we finish one more step 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.610
 here is the last loop and now that he 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.790
 I didnâ€™t lay like that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.029
 raised can make such a tricky one 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.220
 knitting here they are two holes enter the back 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:27.150
 in these two holes and pull the thread and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 we knit two together 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.950
 holes 1 2 will be here for this line 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.430
 pa checker which 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.899
 and he taught a little bit more here 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.289
 hole here it is and here it is again behind 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.190
 we enter under 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:52.590
 ra line which steps and thus 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.440
 let's raise it a little 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.840
 hole his hole like this 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.989
 pick the right hook then 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.590
 it is completely easy to do this if hook 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.750
 thinner it can slip if it is thicker 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.280
 he won't just pass into these 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.970
 holes do it with love with interest 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.970
 you can listen to the radio 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.009
 music to someone talking i'm very 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.280
 I like to listen to movies 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.909
 and then when there is no knitting by chance 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.189
 get on this movie and wonder 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.880
 not at all imagined these 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.150
 actors here we raised a little bit this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 row below it looks like this 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:50.340
 pot if on the model this one 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:54.710
 moment this moment 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.420
 and now let's try to tie 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.899
 regular double crochet but I 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.329
 man here and here is this lower turn with 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.319
 through which we lifted all this 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.950
 beauty 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:11.790
 here we knit two three columns in one 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.980
 hole to save the stick once 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.220
 failed to delay a 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.330
 double crochet not yet some 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:26.150
 wonders show do not forget the most 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:31.610
 first double crochet bars 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.610
 that here I have a little bit, 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.180
 we lay a tail so that it does not stick out and 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.190
 2 loops if we see that a little bit 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.170
 delays here it no longer goes raskroshim 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:53.440
 add here one more column and 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.670
 It turns out such a vase with a beautiful 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.470
 relief from a raised row in the middle i 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.470
 here it is this relief is beautiful
