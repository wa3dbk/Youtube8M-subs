 To me 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.880
 A dress and selfish pretty important 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.900
 It is not a cheap battered batter I bought in that area 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.090
 Wakewakan no guy whether fighting spirit range not to no or 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:43.360
 Somehow this even when little training Tteyuu I wish the Mendoku See the no ingredients 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.950
 I think also the Toka wonder if trying to do when I bought new shoes 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.480
 What 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.600

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.800
 This cry Tsu what to wear in order to 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.480
 Tteyuu what you wear soooo important for with motivation 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.680
 For example, Goku 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.530
 Maybe dressed in Tianjin rice 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 I think I would not be motivated if I had a ladder when I was indented 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.680
 In bg height 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.240
 Goku's Dressing Tart 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:18.850
 Originally Look country is good very painful people with combat clothing 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 Toka When you are Vegeta's Well the way of that uniforms orange 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.980
 Toka protect expect you what each person to write from 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:32.540
 Place that Somehow look for people not because there That's what raised the motivation 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.540
 I 'm fine with my favorite brand and stuff, but I usually have left and right 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.980
 Things Toka neck 2 sorry lightly 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.460
 to introduce 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.460
 under 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.900
 In normal color But sneakers that do of Under Armor 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.900
 Now processing 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.940
 When the spit this kind of color this without But separately okay even sober colors from professional 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.630
 Etc high 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.190
 If you don't feel like it's going to be baked, it's Haruna . 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.970
 Well I think I have a favorite color 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.630
 I hope I can't say it 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.659
 Simon loves shoes 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.879
 Distant arch 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.879
 It is a feeling decided only by the design that only the apocalypse disabled person 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.420
 Tokachi 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.370
 Well done 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.970
 I say something like this 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.540
 The lower says 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.540
 It's sober, but this also undergrows the life of the other 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.709
 This is just plain 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.030
 Also easy to move up to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.490
 Well but what's 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.890
 I say this 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.930
 Well this is a normal sea pan 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.930
 I'm not quite flashy 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.150
 Stand out in the other it just, let alone a little while ago of the edge 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.569
 Enter these things 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.610
 I wonder if it is okay 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.170
 If you can say Abyss 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.150
 What do 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.730
 what 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.760
 What is most useless 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:16.800
 I like the jersey I used when I was in junior high school or high school 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:20.470
 It is absolutely impossible to cut the jersey that the team wore at high school as it is 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.740
 That training beginner is not good though 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.940
 I in this 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:32.000
 Something many cool guy that I bought to increase the motivation 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.360
 Above are some compressions and sometimes there is a local deity in the deity 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.860
 I tank top 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.860

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.920

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.680

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.150
 What do you say this 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.260
 6 or something 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.290

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.970

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.060
 Is there a lot of 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:15.260
 I'm not doing Dora but I'm training myself 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.799
 I have prepared my own fighting clothes to enhance my motivation 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.630
 It may be good to rent even if you say something like a gym 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.930
 It might also do well good rental Forgot 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.160
 I wish I was called insisted 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:31.180
 After rental, the rental examination is my child 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.180
 It is better to firm prepared 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.009
 It Compression not it not too bad from entering from appearance 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.180
 Even out your Nekodon Sir 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:43.270
 Certainly it's no good 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:47.940
 If the person who cures is good, it should be a child and compression 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.810
 Who felt in supervision to become a body this look good 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.240
 So that 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.960
 It is to Bamba training or tray of dressing gown 8 Re even open carp dragon

 Oh dear 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.449
 That's what it sounds like 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.720
 By say 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.889
 If there is a case that there is no question 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.590
