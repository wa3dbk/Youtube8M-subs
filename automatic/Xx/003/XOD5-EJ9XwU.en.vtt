00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
ingredients so what I'm going to do is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.090 
ingredients so what I'm going to do is
start<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.809> Jumbo<00:00:58.140> roads<00:00:58.320> now<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
start off with the Jumbo roads now you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.950 
start off with the Jumbo roads now you
can<00:00:59.340> process<00:00:59.579> these<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.120> two<00:01:00.390> ways<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.809> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
can process these in two ways you can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.900 
can process these in two ways you can
either<00:01:01.020> use<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> mortar<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.859> pestle<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
either use a mortar and pestle and do it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
either use a mortar and pestle and do it
the<00:01:03.000> old-fashioned<00:01:03.539> way<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.260> things

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the old-fashioned way but I like things

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.859 
the old-fashioned way but I like things
to<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:04.979> really<00:01:05.280> quick<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.610> easy<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> tend<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
to be really quick and easy so I tend to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.679 
to be really quick and easy so I tend to
use<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.200> blending<00:01:07.650> stick<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.909> I've<00:01:09.180> pre<00:01:09.450> done

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
use my blending stick so I've pre done

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.210 
use my blending stick so I've pre done
that<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.650> noisy<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.130> I'm

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that because it's kind of noisy and I'm

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
that because it's kind of noisy and I'm
sure<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> don't<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> noise<00:01:12.299> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
sure you don't want to have the noise so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.990 
sure you don't want to have the noise so
I've<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.350> ground<00:01:13.830> those<00:01:14.130> down<00:01:14.460> into<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I've just ground those down into a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.539 
I've just ground those down into a
fairly<00:01:15.509> fine<00:01:15.840> texture<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
fairly fine texture and that's going to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
fairly fine texture and that's going to
help<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.850> exfoliate<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.420> skin<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.409> next<00:01:19.830> step

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
help to exfoliate the skin the next step

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.760 
help to exfoliate the skin the next step
is<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.880> mash<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.659> beautiful<00:01:21.930> strawberries

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so I'm just going to use a fork for that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.630 
so I'm just going to use a fork for that
and<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.640> need<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.880> remove<00:01:27.119> all<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> green
