00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:14.799
 and if we see a bloody blood 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.699
 there is a saying that the same cat rolled 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.699
 let's go to the wallow 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.970
 long ago that when saying football evening 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.970
 we talk about high-risk works 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.160
 here in pumas chivas is one of those 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 games in which there is no room for 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.570
 truce or speculation a doubt and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 nothing planned will have the result 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.650
 required thus the change in completito 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.510
 it was one more with which he started than anyone 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.820
 as studied until from its 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 arrival we have to be the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 controlling we know that they will get there 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.050
 many beige tones but that the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.110
 visitor 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.080
 [Music] 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.640
 that's why the review is thorough 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.950
 here what we have to take care of first 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 as soon as they arrive we have to circulate 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.690
 the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.480
 we have to circulate the and this to the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.339
 income and give meticulously everything that 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.339
 want because only in 3-d 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:16.120
 explosive artifacts flares 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.860
 for the concerts do not leave them 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.780
 entities to limit the person without 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.870
 review it from the beginning 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.920
 at the beginning it does not set the rules and 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.920
 start to press them 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.030
 also yes sometimes yes so in all 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.430
 the stadiums are welcome but but 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.230
 things so it's part of the show and of 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.680
 wherever it is, here we are first of all 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.270
 would be good security provision 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.670
 because yes, there has been a lot 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.530
 security and this book has been ported 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.910
 well well as a few places the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.040
 true that we do not come to 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.390
 look for him to look for problems or anything 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.310
 we are encouraged the team to spend and 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.080
 so if there is a good disposition of 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.760
 the security as we equal for 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.890
 both up to the height and although they try 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.300
 go through the marked line never miss the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.300
 that can not take the party in peace 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.769
 among all this security there is someone 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.720
 still finds room to escape 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.910
 Of the routine 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.960
 it has been lost 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.150
 as were others who win the 20 at 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.730
 final some riots came back 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.730
 overshadow this sport called soccer 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.010
