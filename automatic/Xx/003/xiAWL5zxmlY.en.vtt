package now this has the four inputs
just<00:05:08.590> like<00:05:08.920> a<00:05:08.950> regular<00:05:09.480> 1959<00:05:10.480> plexi<00:05:10.990> has<00:05:11.650> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
just like a regular 1959 plexi has the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.640 
just like a regular 1959 plexi has the
high<00:05:12.070> high<00:05:12.400> input<00:05:12.820> or<00:05:13.090> high<00:05:13.210> gain<00:05:13.450> input<00:05:14.020> and

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.050 
the low gain inputs for regular and dark
or<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.590> guess<00:05:17.890> would<00:05:18.070> be<00:05:18.100> normal<00:05:18.730> and<00:05:18.880> bright
