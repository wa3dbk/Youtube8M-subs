00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
but you can do it if you do it enough

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.889 
but you can do it if you do it enough
times<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.290> keep<00:02:07.800> trying<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:09.450> will

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
times if you keep trying and it will

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.570 
times if you keep trying and it will
take<00:02:10.110> ages<00:02:10.410> though<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.860> don't<00:02:11.310> give<00:02:11.459> up

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
take ages though but don't give up

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.640 
take ages though but don't give up
because<00:02:11.819> i<00:02:11.970> didn't<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.420> i<00:02:12.450> was<00:02:13.350> going<00:02:13.560> for

because i didn't and i was going for
over<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.010> hundred<00:02:14.190> times<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.850> I've<00:02:15.840> managed<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
over a hundred times and I've managed to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.720 
over a hundred times and I've managed to
get<00:02:16.470> one<00:02:16.530> more<00:02:16.739> number<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.340> there<00:02:17.580> are<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
get one more number because there are a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.460 
get one more number because there are a
lot<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.060> pedestrians<00:02:18.720> walking<00:02:18.900> around<00:02:19.200> here
