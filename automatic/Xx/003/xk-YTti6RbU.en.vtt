00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.870
 only in the morning 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.640
 on 1 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 am here now in cala millor we know 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.659
 it probably all of us in 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.090
 germany because it is so cheap here 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.310
 At that time, I believe in ownership 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 there really changed often and always 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 set in the sand again 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.080
 he really saw me the good tip 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.000
 that I changed that correctly 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.550
 namely has the owner of this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.710
 locally this time even in the hand 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.330
 says i can do that better than 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.560
 all other elected in here 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:39.479
 must and especially the really good 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.830
 music for everyone 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.220
 So I mean a little bit 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.220
 dance 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.850
 more 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.260
 Great 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.789
 I got it in there it was 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.410
 bit loud ico 19 bit rest 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.750
 entertained do not take the manuel the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.960
 right hand here from the director of 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.990
 Carousel just like you are the man 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.770
 The culprit now a little bit about it 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.290
 that it not now what 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.740
 you have every day open every day 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.490
 1 pm we open and then so 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.840
 quarter of an hour later as it goes 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.940
 also come with the first guests 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.260
 I'll dance like a standard dance 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.760
 they want to come sooner 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.310
 then you have the greeks alone 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.980
 Absolutely so who has special wishes 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.900
 if the beginning comes before 11 12 o'clock 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.150
 Of course, that has bigger chances 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.040
 his songs are also played as 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.739
 later turn load is full and then the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.910
 abandon the game 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.950
 which music is playing again exactly 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.150
 So basically a mixture of three 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.160
 So you can say a little bit 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.220
 German pop and hit so helene 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.840
 fischer bertrich then we enter 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.730
 a bit of Spanish music but also so 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.950
 that it not only pleases the Spaniard 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.970
 but also the international one 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.350
 especially the german guests or 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.420
 German-speaking guests 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.830
 yes and then music as you said 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.090
 from the 80s also times 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.519
 a little bit 70 or 90 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.299
 So Michael Jackson is the same 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.950
 for me music also for the 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.660
 the music is also very young 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.400
 Spaniard here, that's what we mean 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.900
 yes , you have to be in spain too 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.519
 if you like spanish music too 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.959
 a little bit but it is varied 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.269
 Of course you have to say that 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.390
 spectators already know the carousel 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.680
 yes that's a bit older 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.900
 and it also has a bit of a change 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.330
 but have taken place so must 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.489
 also glad that it worked 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.100
 ask now, the solo that is the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.650
 son of pedro in the 70s 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.810
 the carousel has ever made 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.530
 then there was something for a few years 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.489
 unappealing to other operators 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.680
 well one has noticed the everywhere 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.840
 and now the so begins quasi has 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.090
 back to zero since august 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.190
 Last year, that makes it again 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.049
 initially only weekends now since 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.440
 the first april we open daily 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.540
 and try again a line in to 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.700
 get like that back in the 80s 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.199
 Of course, years were like that, of course 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.820
 with modern music of today 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.329
 So we did not get stuck there 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.020
 Now please with me as current 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:29.240
 I really liked it and I will 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.590
 a little party is a lot of fun here 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.800
 still contribute and party up 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.800
 equal 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.539
 dpa 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.289
 like 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.289
 despite the day 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.520
 I danced neatly now 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.710
 seen 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.060
 I just enjoyed it 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.889
 recommend now you can really neat 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.750
 what is important what do you want 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.830
 from a disco you want something decent 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.840
 I got that 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.370
 got delicious and tasted 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.319
 most importantly you just want to 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.419
 just make cool music dance and party 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.639
 and that's possible for every carousel 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.639
