00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.920 
amplifiers now are able to work down to
the<00:02:35.890> lower<00:02:36.070> DC<00:02:36.459> resistance<00:02:36.609> value<00:02:37.359> so<00:02:37.900> that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
the lower DC resistance value so that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.729 
the lower DC resistance value so that
you're<00:02:38.140> able<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.560> run<00:02:38.799> your<00:02:39.670> speakers<00:02:40.090> in

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
you're able to run your speakers in

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.020 
you're able to run your speakers in
parallel<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.340> channels<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.760> one<00:02:42.819> of<00:02:42.970> our

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
parallel to the channels in one of our

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.449 
parallel to the channels in one of our
amplifiers<00:02:43.540> some<00:02:44.410> amplifiers<00:02:44.890> or<00:02:45.190> DC

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
amplifiers some amplifiers or DC

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.300 
amplifiers some amplifiers or DC
resistance<00:02:46.060> value<00:02:46.810> per<00:02:47.230> channel<00:02:47.680> isn't

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
resistance value per channel isn't

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.470 
resistance value per channel isn't
efficient<00:02:48.700> enough<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.120> that's<00:02:49.180> where<00:02:49.390> they

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
efficient enough and that's where they

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.920 
efficient enough and that's where they
can<00:02:49.510> get<00:02:49.690> hot<00:02:49.930> start<00:02:50.680> shutting<00:02:51.010> down<00:02:51.930> hope

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
can get hot start shutting down hope

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.599 
can get hot start shutting down hope
this<00:02:53.109> helps<00:02:53.470> care<00:02:53.739> your<00:02:53.890> problems<00:02:54.280> with<00:02:54.489> your

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
this helps care your problems with your

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.949 
this helps care your problems with your
system<00:02:54.880> shutting<00:02:55.090> down<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:55.569> we're<00:02:55.750> getting

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
system shutting down and we're getting

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:05.830 
system shutting down and we're getting
hot<00:02:56.109> thanks

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.900
