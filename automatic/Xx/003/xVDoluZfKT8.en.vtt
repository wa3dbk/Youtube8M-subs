like<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.630> standstill<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.620> value<00:00:50.190> compare<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
like a standstill in value compare the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.170 
like a standstill in value compare the
dollar<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.260> floor<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:53.610> is

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
dollar because of this floor it is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.390 
dollar because of this floor it is
dropping<00:00:54.900> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.410> bit<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:56.100> third

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
dropping a little bit on like third

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.220 
dropping a little bit on like third
party<00:00:56.790> websites<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.510> we're<00:00:57.690> talking<00:00:58.110> about

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
party websites but we're talking about

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.170 
party websites but we're talking about
less<00:00:58.590> than<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.829> percent<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.310> day<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.550> I<00:01:00.000> don't

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
less than a percent a day so I don't

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.690 
less than a percent a day so I don't
think<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.480> anything<00:01:00.660> significant<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:02.579> know

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
think it's anything significant you know

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.299 
think it's anything significant you know
holding<00:01:03.120> onto<00:01:03.270> gold<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.309> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
holding onto gold right now is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.700 
holding onto gold right now is
essentially<00:01:05.970> held<00:01:06.329> up<00:01:06.540> by<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.899> artificial

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
essentially held up by the artificial

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.440 
essentially held up by the artificial
floor<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> lose

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
floor and it's not really going to lose

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020 
floor and it's not really going to lose
value<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.190> have<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.550> of<00:01:11.580> gold<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
value so if you have a lot of gold you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.270 
value so if you have a lot of gold you
can<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.330> hang<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> until<00:01:13.500> some<00:01:13.979> good

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
can just hang on to it until some good

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820 
can just hang on to it until some good
pops<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> auction<00:01:15.120> house<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.830> that's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.620

pretty much it that's pretty much the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
pretty much it that's pretty much the
whole<00:01:18.840> game<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.260> me<00:01:19.590> right<00:01:19.799> now<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.370> a
