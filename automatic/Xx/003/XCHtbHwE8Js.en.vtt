00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.449 
this game for the rest of my life I'm
not<00:03:55.989> gonna<00:03:56.200> pay<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.470> service<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:57.100> do<00:03:57.220> that

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
not gonna pay a service to do that

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.759 
not gonna pay a service to do that
because<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.209> have<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.660> game<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.079> I'm<00:03:59.230> gonna<00:03:59.410> be

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
because I have the game and I'm gonna be

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.300 
because I have the game and I'm gonna be
the<00:03:59.920> same<00:04:00.070> way<00:04:00.280> about<00:04:00.400> games<00:04:00.790> in<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.090> future

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
the same way about games in the future

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.280 
the same way about games in the future
so<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.340> think<00:04:03.640> online<00:04:03.820> is<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.390> fucking<00:04:04.900> bunch<00:04:05.140> of

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
so I think online is a fucking bunch of

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.370 
so I think online is a fucking bunch of
bullshit<00:04:05.799> all<00:04:06.040> right<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:07.420> game<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:08.170> games

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
are gonna be fucking laggy the graphics

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.819 
are gonna be fucking laggy the graphics
are<00:04:10.420> gonna<00:04:10.540> suck<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:11.019> don't<00:04:11.230> care<00:04:11.440> what<00:04:11.680> they

say
the<00:04:12.519> resolution<00:04:13.150> is<00:04:13.299> of<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.690> games<00:04:13.900> then

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
the resolution is of the games then

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.740 
the resolution is of the games then
which<00:04:14.950> by<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.190> way<00:04:15.310> they<00:04:15.700> said<00:04:15.910> was<00:04:16.090> 1280<00:04:16.570> by

which by the way they said was 1280 by
720<00:04:17.140> at<00:04:17.590> 60<00:04:18.250> frames<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.640> second<00:04:19.109> assuming<00:04:20.109> your

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
720 at 60 frames a second assuming your

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.590 
720 at 60 frames a second assuming your
connection<00:04:20.650> will<00:04:20.890> support<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.489> but

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
connection will support that but

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.080 
connection will support that but
they<00:04:24.350> say<00:04:24.590> it's<00:04:24.770> going<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.920> be<00:04:24.980> 720<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:25.730> already

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
they say it's going to be 720 so already

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.960 
they say it's going to be 720 so already
consoles<00:04:26.990> had<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.290> beat<00:04:27.470> out<00:04:27.620> Xbox<00:04:28.220> 360<00:04:28.820> and

the PlayStation 3 have it beat out now
even<00:04:34.010> if<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.550> were<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:34.670> compare<00:04:35.120> well<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.570> 720

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
even if you were to compare well a 720

from online online is going to suffer

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.490 
from online online is going to suffer
think<00:04:43.760> about<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.630> difference<00:04:45.200> in<00:04:45.320> quality

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
think about the difference in quality

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.230 
think about the difference in quality
between<00:04:45.830> component<00:04:46.730> cables<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.270> HDMI<00:04:47.870> in

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
between component cables and HDMI in

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.600 
between component cables and HDMI in
720p<00:04:50.240> now<00:04:51.080> if<00:04:51.520> there's<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.730> loss<00:04:53.210> in<00:04:53.570> quality

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
720p now if there's a loss in quality

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.190 
720p now if there's a loss in quality
just<00:04:55.610> using<00:04:55.970> like<00:04:56.270> a<00:04:56.300> certain<00:04:56.690> type<00:04:56.810> of<00:04:56.870> cable

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
just using like a certain type of cable

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.450 
just using like a certain type of cable
for<00:04:57.980> just<00:04:58.160> as<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:58.460> certain<00:04:58.940> number<00:04:59.840> of<00:04:59.870> feet

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
for just as a certain number of feet

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.650 
for just as a certain number of feet
imagine<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> loss<00:05:01.730> in<00:05:01.970> quality<00:05:02.120> when<00:05:02.540> you

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
imagine the loss in quality when you

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.540 
imagine the loss in quality when you
have<00:05:02.870> when<00:05:03.350> you're<00:05:03.500> trying<00:05:03.530> to<00:05:03.800> screen<00:05:04.130> stream
