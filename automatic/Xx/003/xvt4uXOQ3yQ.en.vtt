00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.230

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.350
 Kraft again you will find down with 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.130
 which you can use to call 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.689
 minions 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.970

 click calling here's one and yes and all four 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.200
 to manage them let's go from 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.020
 one point another we need a nail 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.660
 right mouse button here they go here 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.129
 if we go far then we press about 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 mouse button they teleport too we 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.710
 we can work tomorrow well without 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.640
 this is carried out by the whole team on 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:03.589
 the m button is the first command 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:09.060
 in fact they all went back somewhere 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:12.270
 it is to dig exactly like a rock type rock 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.180
 metal well and here it is exactly drip on 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.530
 the earth of rocks that is to say the earth also 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.299
 You can now choose how to dig that one and 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.549
 the last command is nothing 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.040
 just you leave the team well 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:36.840
 let's say i will show it by example 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.579
 will choose to dig the ground and they start 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.119
 dig for dimka that truth fled 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:47.009
 I do not know why why they will pass 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 open up to termini not me until you have them 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.189
 stop you can stop them right 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.850
 mouse and they just come here one more 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.060
 to someone that they have gained or here 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.090
 I will show you not here started the tunnel I will show 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.110
 you how they dig such such 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.580
 that's the kind of tunnel 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:15.209
 brakes when all 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:19.290
 and park to you but it is a fee for such 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.450
 free labor and not actually 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.450
 gorse rinks will drip nations 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.720
 little workers if you already have them 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.769
 stop then they will come to you well 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.819
 to the point that you indicated the stones and 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:42.239
 will give you all that they worked 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:53.100
 as well they can be driven let's 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:56.730
 make them work again you can choose 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.239
 how much they will dig here all 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:09.150
 painted 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:19.670
 I will not let us work faster which 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:19.670
 the same speed probably does not drip 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.570
 free labor also they build 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.560
 such a ladder for you 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.340
 more convenient here is such a mod 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.019
