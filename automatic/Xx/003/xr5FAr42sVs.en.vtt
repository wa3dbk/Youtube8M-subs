00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.469
 Hello everyone, slayer with you and we 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.009
 We continue the story about the adventures of the tank 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.139
 sq-5 on New Year and Christmas 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.859
 holidays this fight on the Pearl River 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.119
 passing just around christmas 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.210
 accordingly, I drove this car 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.010
 still very, very little on will 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.990
 more interesting to see what 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.070
 I made mistakes somewhere 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.840
 and where I collected very well and so 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.570
 pearl river battle of the eighth level 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.149
 the probability of winning is as much as fifty five 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.320
 percent as a whole is more or less 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.289
 not bad, I have already successfully dealt damage to the tree 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.629
 and now I'm hiding behind an enemy's pebble 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.690
 Hamit three artillery is not very 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.579
 ok and now we watched 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.300
 beautiful thing called the blast 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.020
 combat packs 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.969
 us root of 6 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.280
 shot out for me as you see here 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.290
 specially clearly shot them into the roof 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.430
 towers remind there rain dance till 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 millimeter collections i.e. 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.869
 makes its way without problems on silly 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.060
 my square 5 happily love all sorts of enemies 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.750
 bad according to them then we 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.270
 have already figured out that is to my account 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.330
 the device has two frags one of them 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.700
 artillery and 1 p. 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.400
 it was very unpleasant here if you 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 carefully watched me butterflies and 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.560
 struck apt-5 let's even see where 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.990
 just click to pause and free camera 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.750
 she is all clear as always standard 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.189
 the tower of the radio operator made its way into the tower and 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.860
 no problem with rotate into battle I certainly 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.079
 don't stay in debt and in destroying enemy 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.210
 kv-5 account is already 77 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.290
 that is, the whole is more or less 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.869
 not bad our task here is to get from 6 to 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.000
 Unfortunately , the answer is clearly a shot in the field 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.030
 Wanted here of course it would be more logical 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.780
 shoot was shoot of course in 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.069
 I'm waiting for the roof when the guys go on the attack 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
 because I have very little left 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.090
 health here lion practical catch 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.209
 and accordingly, of course it would be better 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.880
 forward skip what I do and earlier 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.459
 we could already observe what I 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.950
 was somewhat annoyed by the fact that 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.470
 sing about the depth of the bump rolled out 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.080
 unsuccessful grabbed 2+ truth on these 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.120
 It was from art here from this and unfortunately 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.340
 here I shoot a little bit later 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.640
 as a result, the frag goes to live as well 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.920
 in fact, I would still have been here 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.709
 and warrior 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.860
 firing off under t-50 score of 10:11 is not 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.290
 our favor hummel remember shot out 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.290
 I've got 130 hit points I finish 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.709
 panther 2 I slide down I already have 2 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.700
 thousand damage to a huge number of frags 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.650
 and account 1111 respectively the situation 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.069
 very interesting consists in our 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.970
 base tiger 2 there t-44 such a take 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.340
 incomprehensible 2 sorts of our already one 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.040
 seize the base and so exchanged 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.950
 Hummel Left Overall, not bad for us 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.980
 three cars of the enemy t-44 still 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.040
 butting with our tiger 2 together 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.989
 stand on the grip do not pay for a glitch in 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:29.400
 replay that way tiger us out of stay 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.850
 me and t32 goes capture 11 seconds all 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.430
 it would seem more or less not bad 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.540
 I remind you that I already have five frags and 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.700
 respectively, the board 3 seconds and then 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.700
 peteshechka 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.310
 and of course I capture capture 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.380
 I shoot Selene why am I blowing it up 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.630
 so hiding behind a very successful stone 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.760
 camera will raise behind him even apt-5 can 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.180
 hide it very cool and so i 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.859
 I remain one enemy Fri-Shka and Tiger 2 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.980
 of course before which not to get here 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.260
 in the meantime, I will be in time 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.940
 hiding in the last seconds that's just 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.680
 here after the capture took place and 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.620
 the enemy base was captured I already 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.620
 roll out that in 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.190
 the friend will shoot the sixth frag for 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.349
 Well, not the warrior turned to watch the end of 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.320
 the results of the battle received awards Spartan 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.120
 steel wall and and the invader destroyed 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.880
 five enemy vehicles received more 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.660
 5000 potential damage at 12 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.389
 hits itself carried 2700 damage that is 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.389
 the fight was basically good and if 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.970
 there would be a little bit less luck a little bit 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.760
 more ingenuity in the latter 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.220
 enemy poteshki it is quite possible that 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.669
 this battle would turn and with victory in 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.850
 defeat and so this is a well-deserved victory 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.530
