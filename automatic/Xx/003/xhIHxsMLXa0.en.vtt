00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
do

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.590 
do
ackee<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:03.899> saltfish<00:01:04.820> with<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> onions<00:01:06.420> and

ackee and saltfish with the onions and
tomatoes<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.580> I'd<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> try<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.360> way

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
tomatoes and I'd like to try it that way

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.840 
tomatoes and I'd like to try it that way
as<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.229> enjoy<00:01:10.439> eating<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> hands

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
as I enjoy eating it just out of hands

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.630 
as I enjoy eating it just out of hands
so<00:01:12.060> there's<00:01:12.900> there's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> danger<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.310> eating

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so there's there's a danger in eating

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
so there's there's a danger in eating
these<00:01:14.760> things<00:01:14.820> when<00:01:15.600> they're<00:01:15.750> -<00:01:15.960> when<00:01:16.830> they're

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
these things when they're - when they're

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
these things when they're - when they're
under<00:01:17.220> ripe<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:17.850> they're<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.299> little<00:01:18.630> bit

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
under ripe and when they're a little bit

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.210 
under ripe and when they're a little bit
overripe<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.040> catch

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
overripe so you got to kind of catch

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.780 
overripe so you got to kind of catch
them<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> right<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.659> time<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.140> eat

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
them on the right the right time to eat

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.219 
them on the right the right time to eat
so<00:01:23.790> there's<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.060> caveat<00:01:24.450> attached<00:01:24.750> eating

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
so there's a caveat attached eating

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
so there's a caveat attached eating
these<00:01:25.380> things<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.180> margins<00:01:27.630> are

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
these things but the the margins are

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
these things but the the margins are
pretty<00:01:27.990> wide<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> blight<00:01:29.189> tree

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
pretty wide so there's the blight tree

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
pretty wide so there's the blight tree
there<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> Aki<00:01:30.479> tree<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> little

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
there the Aki tree you can see a little

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.149 
there the Aki tree you can see a little
bit<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.920> cold<00:01:32.189> damage<00:01:32.430> from<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> bad<00:01:33.090> winter

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
bit of cold damage from the bad winter

bit of cold damage from the bad winter
2010-2011<00:01:35.570> 2009-2010<00:01:37.759> but<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> recovered

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
2010-2011 2009-2010 but I recovered

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.990 
2010-2011 2009-2010 but I recovered
nicely<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:40.049> there's<00:01:40.590> fruit<00:01:41.549> hanging<00:01:41.759> all
