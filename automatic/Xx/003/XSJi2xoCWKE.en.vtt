right here on my iphone 4s there is my
music<00:00:11.429> library<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:12.000> what<00:00:12.210> multi<00:00:12.540> tunes

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
music library but what multi tunes

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.209 
music library but what multi tunes
allows<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.679> multiple

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
allows you to do is have multiple

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.650 
allows you to do is have multiple
libraries<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.910> that's<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.330> kind<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.570> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
libraries and that's really kind of a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.840 
libraries and that's really kind of a
weird<00:00:15.900> concept<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.190> really<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.640> see

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
weird concept but you really have to see

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.700 
weird concept but you really have to see
it<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.060> action<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.630> what<00:00:18.750> i<00:00:18.779> mean<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.380> now

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it in action to see what i mean here now

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.290 
it in action to see what i mean here now
here's<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> default<00:00:20.430> library<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:21.119> of

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
here's the default library that of

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.210 
here's the default library that of
course<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.720> your<00:00:22.050> main<00:00:22.350> library<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:23.160> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
course is your main library that you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.950 
course is your main library that you
have<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:24.000> if<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.150> press<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.510> little<00:00:24.660> plus

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
have but if you press this little plus

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.089 
have but if you press this little plus
on<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:25.619> create<00:00:25.859> your<00:00:26.039> own

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
on here you can create your own

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.189 
on here you can create your own
additional<00:00:26.939> library<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.689> create<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
additional library you can create a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.230 
additional library you can create a
seemingly<00:00:28.890> infinite<00:00:29.279> amount<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.760> library<00:00:30.119> so

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
seemingly infinite amount of library so

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.359 
seemingly infinite amount of library so
i'm<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> create<00:00:30.869> sebastian's<00:00:31.619> hits<00:00:31.920> you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
i'm going to create sebastian's hits you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.740 
i'm going to create sebastian's hits you
guys<00:00:32.550> didn't<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:32.910> Sebastian<00:00:33.239> had<00:00:33.600> his

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
guys didn't know Sebastian had his

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.479 
guys didn't know Sebastian had his
greatest<00:00:34.020> hits<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.950> ask<00:00:35.100> him<00:00:35.190> about<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
greatest hits you can ask him about it

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.950 
greatest hits you can ask him about it
on<00:00:35.670> Twitter<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.120> something<00:00:36.390> maybe<00:00:36.540> I'll<00:00:36.780> tell

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
on Twitter or something maybe I'll tell

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
on Twitter or something maybe I'll tell
you<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.230> don't<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.910> all<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:39.090> go<00:00:39.210> ahead<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you I don't know all right go ahead and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.180 
you I don't know all right go ahead and
hit<00:00:39.570> done<00:00:39.870> there<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.860> should<00:00:41.040> see

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
hit done there and then you should see

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.950 
hit done there and then you should see
the<00:00:41.430> additional<00:00:41.700> library<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.719> select

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the additional library now if I select

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200 
the additional library now if I select
that<00:00:43.230> library<00:00:43.860> guess<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.610> happens<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that library guess what happens if I

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.049 
that library guess what happens if I
shoot<00:00:45.780> back<00:00:45.989> over<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.800> my<00:00:46.829> music<00:00:47.190> app<00:00:47.489> it'll<00:00:47.879> be

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
shoot back over to my music app it'll be

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.990 
shoot back over to my music app it'll be
empty<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:48.629> watch<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
empty right now watch this you see that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880 
empty right now watch this you see that
now<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.539> empty<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:52.469> trying

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
now it's empty now it's actually trying

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.619 
now it's empty now it's actually trying
to<00:00:52.980> hold<00:00:53.190> iTunes<00:00:53.699> matches<00:00:54.090> trying<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> load<00:00:54.510> my

iTunes<00:00:54.989> Match<00:00:55.170> library<00:00:55.739> which<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.890> pretty

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
iTunes Match library which is pretty

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.889 
iTunes Match library which is pretty
neat<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.910> i<00:00:56.969> went<00:00:57.149> ahead<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.360> plug<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.750> my

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
neat up so i went ahead and plug in my

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.250 
neat up so i went ahead and plug in my
phone<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:59.210> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.390> see<00:01:00.600> where<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> begins

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
plugged in and it starts sinking so i

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
plugged in and it starts sinking so i

have two separate libraries with itunes

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.990 
have two separate libraries with itunes

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
switch between them and you can actually

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550

you see all my album art is there so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
you see all my album art is there so
these<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.869> two<00:01:33.900> definite<00:01:34.710> separate

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
these are two definite separate

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.160 
these are two definite separate
libraries<00:01:35.280> I've<00:01:35.640> actually<00:01:35.790> downloaded<00:01:36.540> files

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
libraries I've actually downloaded files

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
libraries I've actually downloaded files
on<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.950> library<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:38.610> weren't

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
on one library and they weren't

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
on one library and they weren't
downloaded<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> other<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.930> vice<00:01:39.990> versa

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
downloaded on the other and vice versa

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.740 
downloaded on the other and vice versa
so<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.340> two<00:01:41.369> completely<00:01:42.060> separate

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
so these are two completely separate

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.170 
so these are two completely separate
libraries<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.920> uses<00:01:44.130> itunes<00:01:44.399> match<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.060> in

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
libraries and it uses itunes match so in

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.330 
libraries and it uses itunes match so in
theory<00:01:45.540> now<00:01:46.320> i'm<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.619> assuming<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.189> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
theory now i'm just assuming here you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
theory now i'm just assuming here you
could<00:01:47.490> probably<00:01:47.790> use<00:01:48.299> someone<00:01:48.840> else's<00:01:49.140> iTunes

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
could probably use someone else's iTunes

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.469 
could probably use someone else's iTunes
Match<00:01:49.649> library<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.549> well<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.329> have

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
Match library as well so you can have

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.960 
Match library as well so you can have
two<00:01:51.960> iTunes<00:01:52.259> Match<00:01:52.619> libraries<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.700> device

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
two iTunes Match libraries on one device

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
two iTunes Match libraries on one device
I<00:01:54.180> don't<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.170> theory<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
I don't know it's just a theory but it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
I don't know it's just a theory but it
definitely<00:01:55.950> seems<00:01:56.520> possible<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.210> what

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
definitely seems possible with what

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.749 
definitely seems possible with what
we've<00:01:57.600> seen<00:01:57.840> thus<00:01:58.170> far<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.100> called<00:01:59.340> multi

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
we've seen thus far it is called multi

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.630 
we've seen thus far it is called multi
tunes<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.270> allows<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.960> multiple

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
tunes it allows you to have multiple

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.789 
tunes it allows you to have multiple
itunes<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:02.850> music<00:02:03.329> libraries<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.320> single

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
itunes or music libraries on a single

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.260 
itunes or music libraries on a single
device<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.250> course<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.729> don't<00:02:05.880> want<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> use

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
device of course you don't want to use

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
device of course you don't want to use
this<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:06.689> syncing<00:02:07.079> apps<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.649> using<00:02:07.979> itunes

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
this when syncing apps are using itunes

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.160 
this when syncing apps are using itunes
for<00:02:08.580> anything<00:02:08.819> else<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.720> want<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.050> use

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
for anything else you just want to use

for anything else you just want to use
this<00:02:10.259> for<00:02:10.500> music<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:10.950> exclusively<00:02:11.580> for

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
on city as bigboss repo I was really

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.100 
on city as bigboss repo I was really
skeptical<00:02:24.210> at<00:02:24.450> first<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:24.750> if<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:24.990> have

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
skeptical at first but if you have

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.750 
skeptical at first but if you have
multiple<00:02:25.350> people<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.010> household<00:02:26.400> with

multiple people in the household with

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.690 
multiple people in the household with
all<00:02:27.030> their<00:02:27.390> own<00:02:27.540> individual<00:02:28.460> libraries<00:02:29.460> on

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
all their own individual libraries on

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.610 
all their own individual libraries on
itunes<00:02:30.150> then<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:30.810> theoretically<00:02:31.170> have

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
itunes then you can theoretically have

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.650 
itunes then you can theoretically have
all<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.160> those<00:02:32.280> libraries<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.850> one<00:02:33.060> device<00:02:33.330> and

all of those libraries on one device and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.690 
all of those libraries on one device and
just<00:02:33.840> enjoy<00:02:34.110> everyone's<00:02:34.650> music<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.430> let<00:02:35.610> me
