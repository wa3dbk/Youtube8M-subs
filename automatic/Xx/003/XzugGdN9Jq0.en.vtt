in the drills at the bottom of the ipad

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.410 
in the drills at the bottom of the ipad
and<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.790> lot<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> people<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.299> actually

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and a lot of people are actually

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.969 
and a lot of people are actually
expecting<00:02:04.049> those<00:02:04.140> i<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.680> much

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
expecting those i have to be much

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.520 
expecting those i have to be much
lighter<00:02:05.369> than<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.759> previous<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.600> even

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
lighter than the previous one and even

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.199 
lighter than the previous one and even
though<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.890> attest<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.459> obviously<00:02:08.970> all

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
though we can attest this obviously all

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.660 
though we can attest this obviously all
we<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.599> our<00:02:09.810> league<00:02:10.080> photos<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:11.280> would<00:02:11.520> be

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
we have our league photos this would be

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
we have our league photos this would be
the<00:02:11.790> second<00:02:12.209> cycle<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> ipad

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the second cycle for the ipad

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.530 
the second cycle for the ipad
many<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.040> could<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.520> be<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.790> we<00:02:15.090> are<00:02:15.210> at<00:02:15.360> least

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
many so could it be that we are at least

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.420 
many so could it be that we are at least
getting<00:02:15.750> something<00:02:16.080> for<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.800> ipad<00:02:17.100> mini<00:02:17.130> are

this<00:02:43.350> design<00:02:43.740> it<00:02:44.190> looks<00:02:44.340> very<00:02:44.430> premium<00:02:45.060> it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
this design it looks very premium it

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.860

looks<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.780> an<00:02:45.990> iphone<00:02:46.140> 5<00:02:47.040> from<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.550> sides

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
looks like an iphone 5 from the sides

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.060 
looks like an iphone 5 from the sides
but<00:02:48.870> still<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.290> would<00:02:49.470> be<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.710> first<00:02:49.860> time

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
but still this would be the first time

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.440 
but still this would be the first time
that<00:02:50.130> Samsung<00:02:50.640> actually<00:02:51.060> brings<00:02:51.300> us<00:02:51.420> some

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
that Samsung actually brings us some

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.900 
that Samsung actually brings us some
aluminum<00:02:51.960> even<00:02:52.200> though<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.560> back<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:53.070> plastic

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
aluminum even though the back is plastic

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.430 
aluminum even though the back is plastic
but<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.600> leads<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.900> see<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.110> question<00:02:55.230> of

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
but that leads you see the question of

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.500 
but that leads you see the question of
the<00:02:55.530> day<00:02:55.790> since<00:02:56.790> Samsung<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.240> currently

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
the day since Samsung is currently

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.630 
the day since Samsung is currently
struggling<00:02:57.930> do<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.950> think<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.460> this

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
struggling do you think that this

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.090 
struggling do you think that this
aluminum<00:03:00.420> Galaxy<00:03:00.930> alpha<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.500> what<00:03:01.740> everybody

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
aluminum Galaxy alpha is what everybody

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.130 
aluminum Galaxy alpha is what everybody
wants<00:03:02.490> because<00:03:02.610> in<00:03:02.790> my<00:03:02.880> particular<00:03:03.030> case<00:03:03.330> yeah

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
wants because in my particular case yeah

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.230 
wants because in my particular case yeah
sure<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.410> would<00:03:04.650> love<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.920> better<00:03:05.280> design<00:03:05.760> but

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
sure I would love a better design but

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.900 
sure I would love a better design but
that<00:03:07.170> doesn't<00:03:07.350> change<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.860> fact<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.430> it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
that doesn't change the fact that it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.250 
that doesn't change the fact that it
still<00:03:09.210> looks<00:03:09.450> like<00:03:09.600> every<00:03:09.900> other<00:03:09.990> galaxy

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
