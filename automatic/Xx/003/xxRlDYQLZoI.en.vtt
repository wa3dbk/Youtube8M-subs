SOT FB that's a mouthful to talk about
but<00:04:43.289> it's<00:04:43.439> actually<00:04:44.129> it's<00:04:44.219> a<00:04:44.310> fairly<00:04:44.520> decent

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
but it's actually it's a fairly decent

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.640 
but it's actually it's a fairly decent
knife<00:04:45.210> it's<00:04:45.449> kind<00:04:45.689> of<00:04:45.810> short<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.349> the<00:04:46.439> blade

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
knife it's kind of short in the blade

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.020 
knife it's kind of short in the blade
and<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:46.979> has<00:04:47.129> a<00:04:47.159> little<00:04:47.400> bit<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.699> a<00:04:47.789> forward

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
and it has a little bit of a forward

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.570 
and it has a little bit of a forward
recurve<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.289> it<00:04:49.439> that<00:04:50.039> it's<00:04:50.159> a<00:04:50.219> little<00:04:50.370> unusual

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
recurve to it that it's a little unusual

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.390 
recurve to it that it's a little unusual
for<00:04:50.969> chopping<00:04:51.629> it<00:04:52.110> does<00:04:52.349> slicing<00:04:52.919> very<00:04:53.159> well

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
for chopping it does slicing very well

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.760 
for chopping it does slicing very well
again<00:04:54.120> this<00:04:54.330> might<00:04:54.599> be<00:04:54.870> more<00:04:55.139> for<00:04:55.469> a<00:04:55.530> young

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
again this might be more for a young

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.339 
again this might be more for a young
adult<00:04:56.120> alright<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.330> figured<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:57.900> really

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
adult alright so I figured I really

00:04:58.349 --> 00:04:59.629 
adult alright so I figured I really
needed<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.740> narrow<00:04:58.949> this<00:04:59.159> down

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
needed to narrow this down

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.490 
needed to narrow this down
I<00:04:59.669> actually<00:05:00.060> narrowed<00:05:00.599> it<00:05:00.719> down<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.900> three

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
I actually narrowed it down to three

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.040 
I actually narrowed it down to three
blades<00:05:01.770> that<00:05:02.340> I'm<00:05:02.520> really<00:05:02.939> really<00:05:03.599> pleased

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
blades that I'm really really pleased

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.219 
blades that I'm really really pleased

with so let me tell you about them and

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.769 
with so let me tell you about them and
why<00:05:07.590> I<00:05:08.039> chose<00:05:08.129> them<00:05:08.699> to<00:05:08.849> be<00:05:08.969> on<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.150> list<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.599> I

in<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.759> field<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.900> would<00:05:36.960> be<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.139> little<00:05:37.259> bit

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.480 
difficult but I think if you plan ahead
and<00:05:40.020> you<00:05:40.080> have<00:05:40.110> it<00:05:40.469> a<00:05:40.620> sharpener<00:05:41.219> that<00:05:41.250> can

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
and you have it a sharpener that can

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.180 
and you have it a sharpener that can
