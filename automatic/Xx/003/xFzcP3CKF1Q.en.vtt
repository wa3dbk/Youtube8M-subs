00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
see how what it could do so i took my s3

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.390 
see how what it could do so i took my s3
over<00:02:30.050> here<00:02:30.260> i<00:02:30.290> was<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.530> eleven<00:02:30.860> percent<00:02:31.160> took

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
over here i was that eleven percent took

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.880 
over here i was that eleven percent took
it<00:02:31.490> out<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.760> box<00:02:31.940> plugged<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.050> right<00:02:33.350> in

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
first test my phone was at eleven

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.480 
first test my phone was at eleven
percent<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.440> went<00:02:48.590> from<00:02:48.710> eleven<00:02:49.160> percent

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
percent and it went from eleven percent

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.480 
percent and it went from eleven percent
to<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.820> hundred<00:02:50.150> percent<00:02:50.240> charged<00:02:51.010> with<00:02:52.010> Wi-Fi

not<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.910> didn't<00:02:56.630> turn<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.870> on<00:02:57.020> at<00:02:57.140> all<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.470> took

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
not I didn't turn it on at all it took

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.100 
not I didn't turn it on at all it took
about<00:02:58.070> two<00:02:58.430> hours<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:59.030> fully<00:02:59.330> charge<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.990> went

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
about two hours to fully charge and went

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.510 
about two hours to fully charge and went
from<00:03:00.200> having<00:03:00.560> four<00:03:00.740> lights<00:03:00.950> down<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.310> two

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
from having four lights down to two

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.610 
from having four lights down to two
lights<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:02.810> gives<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.170> an<00:03:03.230> idea<00:03:03.290> you

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
lights so that gives you an idea you

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.780 
lights so that gives you an idea you
could<00:03:03.740> probably<00:03:03.920> get<00:03:04.100> about<00:03:04.190> two<00:03:04.460> three

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
could probably get about two three

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.440 
could probably get about two three
charges<00:03:05.150> on<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.960> galaxy<00:03:06.560> s3<00:03:07.180> from<00:03:08.180> out<00:03:08.300> of<00:03:08.390> the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
charges on a galaxy s3 from out of the

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.020 
charges on a galaxy s3 from out of the
box<00:03:08.660> that's<00:03:09.080> impressive<00:03:09.350> charging<00:03:10.310> time<00:03:10.610> I

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
box that's impressive charging time I

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.690 
box that's impressive charging time I
did<00:03:11.810> two<00:03:11.990> different<00:03:12.140> chart<00:03:12.620> trials<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.490> this

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
did two different chart trials on this

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.820 
did two different chart trials on this
one<00:03:14.000> from<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.450> computer<00:03:14.870> one<00:03:15.230> from<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> wall

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
one from the computer one from the wall

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.600 
one from the computer one from the wall
and<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:17.390> way<00:03:17.510> i<00:03:17.540> could<00:03:17.750> give<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:17.930> guys<00:03:18.610> both

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
and that way i could give you guys both

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.460 
and that way i could give you guys both
looks<00:03:20.000> at<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.540> can<00:03:20.750> decide<00:03:20.990> which<00:03:21.230> one

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
looks at it and you can decide which one

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.300 
looks at it and you can decide which one
you<00:03:21.500> want<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.830> use<00:03:21.890> from<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:23.230> computer<00:03:24.310> from
