hey<00:00:01.860> guys<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:03.000> u-shaped<00:00:03.600> wider<00:00:03.899> Wilson<00:00:04.620> snow

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
hey guys the u-shaped wider Wilson snow

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.610 
hey guys the u-shaped wider Wilson snow
is<00:00:05.190> more<00:00:05.670> popular<00:00:06.240> more<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.930> more<00:00:07.170> popular

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
is more popular more and more popular

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.850 
is more popular more and more popular
and<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:08.730> becomes<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.330> nowadays<00:00:09.780> trend<00:00:10.170> but

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
and it becomes the nowadays trend but

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.450 
and it becomes the nowadays trend but
why<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:11.820> popular<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.599> think<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.130> with

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
why it is so popular I think it is with

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.269 
why it is so popular I think it is with
five<00:00:14.910> reasons<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.049> first<00:00:16.289> one<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.980> they<00:00:17.250> have

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
five reasons the first one is they have

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.120 
five reasons the first one is they have
smoother<00:00:18.090> breaking<00:00:18.630> war<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.529> second<00:00:19.949> is

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
smoother breaking war and the second is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.859 
smoother breaking war and the second is
they<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.550> stronger<00:00:21.090> because<00:00:21.300> they<00:00:21.630> have

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
they are stronger because they have

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.710 
they are stronger because they have
bigger<00:00:22.170> cross<00:00:22.650> session<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.760> more<00:00:24.090> Wars

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
bigger cross session with more Wars

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.560 
bigger cross session with more Wars
the<00:00:25.230> third<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.740> they<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.340> wider<00:00:26.640> spacing<00:00:27.269> so

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the third is they have wider spacing so

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.080 
the third is they have wider spacing so
they<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:27.900> more<00:00:28.170> aerodynamic<00:00:28.980> than<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.939> we

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
they are more aerodynamic than the we

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.840 
they are more aerodynamic than the we
shape<00:00:30.390> also<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.560> fourth<00:00:31.830> reason<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.550> they<00:00:32.820> are

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
shape also the fourth reason is they are

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.930 
shape also the fourth reason is they are
wider<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.960> better<00:00:34.260> tire<00:00:34.829> performance<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
wider for better tire performance and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.240 
wider for better tire performance and
the<00:00:36.390> fifth<00:00:36.690> reason<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the fifth reason is they have a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.240 
the fifth reason is they have a
straighter<00:00:38.790> line<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.739> smoother

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
straighter line and a smoother

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.090 
straighter line and a smoother
transition<00:00:42.180> from<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.719> tires<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.350> way<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
transition from the tires I way to the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.510 
transition from the tires I way to the
rim<00:00:44.340> edge<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.059> now<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.930> see<00:00:46.410> closely<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
rim edge and now the see closely of the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
rim edge and now the see closely of the
you<00:00:48.329> shape<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.649> shape<00:00:50.010> will<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:50.670> hand<00:00:51.530> this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you shape you shape will in my hand this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.939 
you shape you shape will in my hand this
you<00:00:52.829> should<00:00:53.129> wear<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.140> 25<00:00:55.140> millimeter

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
you should wear it with a 25 millimeter

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.380 
you should wear it with a 25 millimeter
wide<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:57.620> they<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.879> tubular

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
wide and they are it's in the tubular

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.789 
wide and they are it's in the tubular
u-shape<00:01:01.340> version<00:01:02.340> also<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.539> widest<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
u-shape version also the widest the
