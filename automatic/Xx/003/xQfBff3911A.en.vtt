00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
morning I go to band and I felt that

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.150 
morning I go to band and I felt that
banding<00:00:17.940> wasn't<00:00:18.330> really<00:00:18.869> helping<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.920> any<00:00:20.010> way

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
banding wasn't really helping in any way

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.010 
banding wasn't really helping in any way
like<00:00:20.520> know<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:20.910> someone<00:00:21.210> breaks<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.630> rules

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
like know what someone breaks a rules

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
like know what someone breaks a rules
like<00:00:22.170> budding<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.680> whatever<00:00:22.949> they<00:00:23.670> shouldn't

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
like budding or whatever they shouldn't

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.640 
like budding or whatever they shouldn't
be<00:00:24.150> banned<00:00:24.390> because<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.810> doesn't<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.320> help

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
be banned because it doesn't really help

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.150 
be banned because it doesn't really help
for<00:00:25.949> anything<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:27.050> MMG<00:00:28.050> commented<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:28.980> this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
saying that well maybe you guys have

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.310 
saying that well maybe you guys have
something<00:00:32.130> better<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.170> ban

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
something better like if you don't ban

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.979 
something better like if you don't ban
people<00:00:34.559> banning<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> ban<00:00:35.640> site<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> guy<00:00:36.239> who

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
people banning the ban site the guy who

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
people banning the ban site the guy who
made<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.260> thread<00:00:37.500> suggested<00:00:38.360> happens<00:00:39.360> like

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
made it thread suggested happens like

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.940 
made it thread suggested happens like
what<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> option<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:40.770> would

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
what would be the option what would

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.740 
what would be the option what would
rather<00:00:41.190> deal<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.180> found<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.480> kind<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
rather deal and I found this kind of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.090 
rather deal and I found this kind of
interesting<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.350> they<00:00:43.590> maybe<00:00:43.770> think

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
interesting because they maybe think

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.240 
interesting because they maybe think
like<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:45.120> should<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.840> actually<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.710> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
like what should we actually do and I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.860 
like what should we actually do and I
started<00:00:47.579> thinking<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.480> quite<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
started thinking about this for quite a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590 
started thinking about this for quite a
while<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.920> mmt<00:00:50.370> himself<00:00:50.879> suggested<00:00:51.420> was

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
while and what mmt himself suggested was

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.010 
while and what mmt himself suggested was
that<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.079> could<00:00:52.289> use<00:00:52.590> something<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:54.020> let's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
that we could use something like let's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
that we could use something like let's
say<00:00:55.050> remove<00:00:55.410> everything<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.309> player

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
say remove everything that the player

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
say remove everything that the player
can<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.090> they<00:00:57.539> can't<00:00:57.780> toll<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.469> trade<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
can do they can't toll to get trade it

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.709 
can do they can't toll to get trade it
can't<00:00:59.309> really<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.789> much<00:00:59.820> everything<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.600> all

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
can't really do much everything at all

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.349 
can't really do much everything at all
like<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.440> XP<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.160> bet<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.940> can't<00:01:03.149> still

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
like I get an XP I bet you can't still

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.700 
like I get an XP I bet you can't still
look<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> walk<00:01:04.049> around<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.439> pretty<00:01:04.619> much

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
look in and walk around in pretty much

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
look in and walk around in pretty much
an<00:01:04.949> iPhone<00:01:05.339> god<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.909> don't<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> would

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
an iPhone god I don't think that would

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.380 
an iPhone god I don't think that would
help<00:01:07.439> much<00:01:07.770> more<00:01:08.070> than<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.580> banning<00:01:08.970> would<00:01:09.270> do

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
help much more than one banning would do

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.090 
help much more than one banning would do
because<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.080> they're<00:01:10.500> still<00:01:10.740> able<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
because you know they're still able to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.310 
because you know they're still able to
walk<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.520> game<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.030> their<00:01:12.180> harasser<00:01:12.720> or

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
walk in game like if their harasser or

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.450 
walk in game like if their harasser or
something<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.890> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
something like that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.270 
something like that
the<00:01:14.670> kids<00:01:14.909> still<00:01:15.150> follow<00:01:15.750> they<00:01:16.560> target<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the kids still follow they target and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
the kids still follow they target and
kind<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.580> make<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:17.970> feel<00:01:18.150> comfortable<00:01:18.780> or

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
kind of make them feel comfortable or

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.810 
kind of make them feel comfortable or
something<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.619> which<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> kind<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.640> why

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
something like that which is kind of why

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.749 
something like that which is kind of why
I<00:01:21.150> felt<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> bad<00:01:22.350> idea<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.189> personally

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I felt that was a bad idea so personally

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.999 
I felt that was a bad idea so personally
I<00:01:23.790> feel<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.090> banning<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.900> helps<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.799> do

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
I feel that banning really helps to do

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
I feel that banning really helps to do
whatever<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> game<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.420> don't<00:01:27.659> really

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
whatever in the game like I don't really

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.480 
whatever in the game like I don't really
think<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.110> anything<00:01:28.680> else<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.100> could<00:01:29.340> be

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
think this anything else that could be

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.520 
think this anything else that could be
necessarily<00:01:29.970> used<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.810> would<00:01:30.930> help<00:01:31.110> more

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
necessarily used that would help more

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.249 
necessarily used that would help more
than<00:01:31.829> simply<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.640> banning<00:01:33.180> whoever<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
than simply just banning whoever so

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.920 
than simply just banning whoever so
javascript<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.340> his<00:01:35.549> cool<00:01:35.850> name<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.720> pretty

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
javascript in his cool name they pretty

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.149 
javascript in his cool name they pretty
much<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.500> don't<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:37.920> there's

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
much I don't really think there's

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.060 
much I don't really think there's
anything<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.540> normal<00:01:40.530> banning<00:01:40.950> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
anything but the normal banning that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
anything but the normal banning that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
would work in order to punish player

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.080 
would work in order to punish player
it's<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> best<00:01:43.409> possible<00:01:43.950> way<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> know

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it's the best possible way but you know

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's the best possible way but you know
I<00:01:45.119> don't<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.229> guys<00:01:46.409> know

I don't really know what you guys know

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
I don't really know what you guys know
think<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.280> even<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.000> padding<00:01:48.299> doesn't

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
think about that even if padding doesn't

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
think about that even if padding doesn't
really<00:01:48.720> make<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> rule<00:01:49.229> breaker<00:01:49.439> understand

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
really make the rule breaker understand

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.340 
really make the rule breaker understand
that<00:01:50.280> breaking<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> rules<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.750> bad<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.290> still

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that breaking the rules is bad you still

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770 
that breaking the rules is bad you still
kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.159> player<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:54.090> remove<00:01:54.450> from

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
kind of get that player to remove from

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
kind of get that player to remove from
the<00:01:54.899> community<00:01:55.380> temporarily<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.250> every

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the community temporarily like every

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.480 
the community temporarily like every
single<00:01:56.790> thing<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.149> done<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.229> progress<00:01:58.619> as

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
single thing that done as a progress as

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.830 
single thing that done as a progress as
you<00:01:59.549> sort<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> real<00:02:00.240> breaking<00:02:00.659> like

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you sort of the real breaking like

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.780 
you sort of the real breaking like
budding<00:02:01.229> or<00:02:01.380> harassing<00:02:01.740> or<00:02:02.009> real<00:02:02.610> word

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
budding or harassing or real word

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.789 
budding or harassing or real word
trading<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:03.149> whatever<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.630> gone<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
trading or whatever is gone you know and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.100 
trading or whatever is gone you know and
I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:05.070> that's<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.490> good<00:02:05.610> thing<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.509> be

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
I think that's a really good thing to be

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.710 
I think that's a really good thing to be
able<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:09.000> didn't<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.539> pay

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
able to know that it didn't really pay

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.930 
able to know that it didn't really pay
off<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:09.989> them<00:02:10.170> because<00:02:11.099> even<00:02:11.520> if<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:11.730> can

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
off for them because even if they can

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
off for them because even if they can
look<00:02:12.060> in

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
look in

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.300 
look in
and<00:02:13.110> during<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.560> trailer<00:02:13.800> whatever<00:02:14.130> they're

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and during the trailer whatever they're

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.220 
and during the trailer whatever they're
still<00:02:14.490> able<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.820> play<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.240> game<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:16.020> that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
still able to play the game and if that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.170 
still able to play the game and if that
was<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.860> case<00:02:17.040> i<00:02:17.280> jaggus<00:02:17.640> would<00:02:17.760> get<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> lot<00:02:18.030> of

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
was the case i jaggus would get a lot of

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.000 
was the case i jaggus would get a lot of
hate<00:02:18.330> for<00:02:18.570> removing<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> ban<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.710> whatever

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
hate for removing the ban so whatever

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.000 
hate for removing the ban so whatever
for<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.580> don't<00:02:20.820> know<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:22.230> don't<00:02:22.530> know<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
for I don't know I don't know like it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.950 
for I don't know I don't know like it
they're<00:02:23.160> trying<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.430> get<00:02:23.880> more<00:02:24.480> people<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.810> pay

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
they're trying to get more people to pay

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.810 
they're trying to get more people to pay
membership<00:02:25.140> or<00:02:25.530> whatever<00:02:25.800> for<00:02:26.100> very<00:02:26.640> serious

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
membership or whatever for very serious

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.220 
membership or whatever for very serious
I<00:02:27.150> don't<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.420> know<00:02:27.570> how<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.900> would<00:02:28.050> be

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
I don't really know how that would be

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.290 
I don't really know how that would be
but<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> don't<00:02:28.980> think<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.700> would<00:02:29.820> help<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
but I don't think that it would help to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.350 
but I don't think that it would help to
let<00:02:30.600> players<00:02:30.920> stay<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.310> game<00:02:32.550> if<00:02:32.820> that

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
let players stay in the game if that

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.860 
let players stay in the game if that
were<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.930> case<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.980> remove<00:02:35.270> bans<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.690> maybe

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
were the case to remove bans but maybe

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.570 
were the case to remove bans but maybe
you<00:02:37.080> guys<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.470> some<00:02:37.590> creative<00:02:38.040> ideas<00:02:38.130> on

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
you guys have some creative ideas on

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.690 
you guys have some creative ideas on
what<00:02:39.210> could<00:02:39.390> potentially<00:02:39.540> be<00:02:40.020> done<00:02:40.700> instead

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
what could potentially be done instead

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.510 
what could potentially be done instead
of<00:02:41.880> actually<00:02:42.300> removing<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.350> bans<00:02:43.590> let<00:02:44.430> me
