00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 Hello today I will tell you how and 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.189
 made the illumination of his dashboard 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.440
 on the nine without special position 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.980
 almost for nothing neon lights 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.170
 costs about 30 rubles 30 centimeters 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.570
 you might think she beats her eyes 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.500
 but they are so somewhat this is just a video 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.519
 so removes the phone green price tags 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.210
 and red price tags, I singled out 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.930
 division 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.399
 Here are these divisions up to 70 divisions of strawberries 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:43.260
 that you can accelerate and 80 is all 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.950
 You can not red division of course arrow I 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:53.129
 too red as it stuck here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:56.340
 red zero package and here is the temperature 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 also tachometer then just answered 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.610
 now not as visible as it should be a check 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.200
 lit the hell that's the backlight did the legs 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.680
 a few nothing beats here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.580
 you see nothing beats on the track 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.560
 and this does not interfere with fastening here 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.280
 who is here I took 40 centimeters this 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.890
 pennies there goes the cheapest tape 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.159
 40 rubles somewhere 38 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.579
 probably even comfortable here legs 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:35.460
 it can be seen very well here I did myself 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:38.009
 voltmeter is also very convenient to monitor 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.049
 battery how much music to listen 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.829
 listen or can not switches not 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.990
 turn off watching the generator well, you can 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.689
 brushes here change my world bot here 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.000
 very little charge to go I will say right away 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.680
 I understand that I need a brush 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.229
 change brushes brushes me myself again 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.590
 but also included the dimensions of the reasons 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.360
 LED backlight stove instead 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.000
 standard light bulbs 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.909
 12 volt went buy waves it stands 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.080
 10 rubles is of course needed 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.510
 little electrician skills a little bit and 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.240
 hooked it all up on the switch will 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.200
 now there is no light in the cabin broke light 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.920
 need to do so he turns off here 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 see me everything changes the old time 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.640
 here I turn off the voltmeter 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.730
 didn't bother making the ignition so 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.370
 how should i like i want to look behind 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.660
 battery for a clean battery 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.690
 when you turn on the ignition 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.410
 the dash ignition turns on the voltmeter then I 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.130
 I see already 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:51.010
 not exactly showed will work 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:55.090
 gasoline pump so it will always 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.590
 change when testing the panel 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.570
 appliances will add voltage 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.269
 next video i will tell you how i did 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.269
 dashboard everything is very simple
