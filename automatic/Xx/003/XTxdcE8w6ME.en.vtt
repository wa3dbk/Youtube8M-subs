00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.199
 thanks to this victory now it would have to 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.029
 actually the commands are excellent 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.740
 book was done by voice input 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.060
 but I mean it's all 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.680
 voice-controlled has been revealed 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.480
 I thought you had to go now 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.160

 accepted can be activated in the program 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.430

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.420
 I like that choice is there I go 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.420
 equal to the mature flat 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.460
 [Music] 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:06.700
 the underlying idea is not 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:08.619
 noticed to see second 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.910
 I see what I think I knew 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.500
 is the tenant of the lot yesterday 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.680
 evening I'm just making a comparison with 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.580
 her photos from the oil platform 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.470
 questioner one is identical and 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.640
 surely you will not be like that 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.640
 appropriate search is already running 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.619
 the three are rich and moving 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:37.570
 all in the direction of the online positions 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:39.220
 the boys recognize each other 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.720
 Agree you are the lady of the party 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.460
 Last night, they want us now 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.140
 our culprit will be too much luggage 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.149
 they can keep the free frequencies 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.149
 see it today is the ski started 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.590
 is there where you are at the moment? 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.580
 cable connection i want to be in top form 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.640
 finally grown up 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.750
 they always come out of it 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.580
 again quite happy by the washing machine 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.580
 before I meet my friends 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.440

 that's why he's dead then he's allowed to do that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:28.599
