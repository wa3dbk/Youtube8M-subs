00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.370 

an<00:00:31.280> equal<00:00:31.850> parts<00:00:32.210> sugar<00:00:32.330> so<00:00:33.050> there's<00:00:33.170> two<00:00:33.260> 1/2

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
an equal parts sugar so there's two 1/2

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.509 
an equal parts sugar so there's two 1/2
cups<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.710> sugar

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.560 

that's<00:00:42.519> the<00:00:42.609> base<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.940> pickle<00:00:43.239> right<00:00:43.329> there

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
that's the base the pickle right there

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.630 
that's the base the pickle right there
and<00:00:44.260> at<00:00:44.410> that<00:00:44.469> point<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.859> just<00:00:44.890> add<00:00:45.219> any<00:00:45.460> kind

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
and at that point you just add any kind

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.849 
and at that point you just add any kind
of<00:00:45.760> spices<00:00:46.059> that<00:00:46.269> you<00:00:46.329> want<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:47.649> this<00:00:47.800> case

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
because of the grapes I like using some

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.840 
because of the grapes I like using some
warm<00:00:50.379> spices<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:51.190> there's<00:00:51.430> a<00:00:51.489> little<00:00:51.670> dried

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
warm spices so there's a little dried

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.770 
warm spices so there's a little dried

clove cloves like go and very light on

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.660 
clove cloves like go and very light on
because<00:01:02.500> they<00:01:02.829> have<00:01:02.860> such<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.100> strong<00:01:03.460> flavor

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
because they have such a strong flavor

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.130 
because they have such a strong flavor
they<00:01:04.000> can<00:01:04.089> kind<00:01:04.269> of<00:01:04.330> take<00:01:04.509> over<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.780> whole<00:01:04.930> dish

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
they can kind of take over a whole dish

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.950 
they can kind of take over a whole dish
sometimes<00:01:05.880> take<00:01:06.880> this

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.760 

into<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.680> pot

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.890 

my<00:01:15.310> views<00:01:15.549> mix<00:01:15.850> us<00:01:15.970> up

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.140 

let<00:01:23.900> me<00:01:23.960> go<00:01:24.080> over<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.410> stove<00:01:24.940> take<00:01:25.940> this

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
let me go over to the stove take this

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.200 
let me go over to the stove take this
you<00:01:26.420> bring<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.720> up<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.960> boil

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
you bring it up to a boil

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.230 
you bring it up to a boil
once<00:01:29.750> it's<00:01:29.900> boiling<00:01:30.080> turn<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.040> off<00:01:31.190> let<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:31.970> cool

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
once it's boiling turn it off let a cool

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.200 
once it's boiling turn it off let a cool
back<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.510> room<00:01:32.630> temperature<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.710> you're<00:01:33.950> done

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
back to room temperature and you're done

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.910 
back to room temperature and you're done
and<00:01:35.210> with<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.390> grapes<00:01:35.600> it's<00:01:36.200> kind<00:01:36.410> of<00:01:36.470> easier

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
and with the grapes it's kind of easier

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.440 
and with the grapes it's kind of easier
to<00:01:37.100> break<00:01:37.280> them<00:01:37.400> up<00:01:37.550> as<00:01:37.700> opposed<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.030> be<00:01:38.150> in<00:01:38.240> one

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
to break them up as opposed to be in one

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.750 
to break them up as opposed to be in one
large<00:01:38.780> bunch<00:01:39.620> breaking<00:01:40.130> up<00:01:40.220> into<00:01:40.430> smaller

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
large bunch breaking up into smaller

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.420 
large bunch breaking up into smaller
little<00:01:41.060> clusters<00:01:41.540> like<00:01:42.280> so

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.810 

I<00:01:46.520> kind<00:01:47.120> of<00:01:47.180> like<00:01:47.540> keeping<00:01:47.870> them<00:01:48.080> on<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.040> little

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
I kind of like keeping them on a little

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.250 
I kind of like keeping them on a little
bit<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.030> like<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.210> branch<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:50.960> they're<00:01:51.080> all

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
bit of like a branch so they're all

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.600 
bit of like a branch so they're all
together<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.800> think<00:01:51.980> they<00:01:52.040> look<00:01:52.190> pretty<00:01:52.220> on<00:01:52.580> a

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
together I think they look pretty on a

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.490 
together I think they look pretty on a
plate<00:01:52.910> when<00:01:53.360> they're<00:01:53.510> all<00:01:53.630> together<00:01:53.870> one

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
plate when they're all together one

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.380 
plate when they're all together one
small<00:01:54.920> cluster<00:01:55.340> as<00:01:55.490> opposed<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:55.820> individual

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
small cluster as opposed to individual

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.690 
small cluster as opposed to individual
grapes<00:01:56.890> stuff<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:57.980> let<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.190> cool<00:01:58.370> for<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.670> few

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
grapes stuff you let it cool for a few

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.490 
grapes stuff you let it cool for a few
minutes<00:01:58.870> then<00:01:59.870> it's<00:01:59.990> ready<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.200> be<00:02:00.260> poured

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
minutes then it's ready to be poured

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.420 
minutes then it's ready to be poured
over<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.860> grapes

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
over the grapes

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.430 
over the grapes
I<00:02:02.860> know<00:02:03.860> jarring<00:02:04.310> can<00:02:04.490> seem<00:02:04.790> very

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
I know jarring can seem very

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.080 
I know jarring can seem very
intimidating<00:02:06.440> sometimes<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.460> like<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.610> keep<00:02:07.970> it

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
intimidating sometimes I like to keep it

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.719 
intimidating sometimes I like to keep it
really<00:02:08.270> simple<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.959> I'll<00:02:09.259> use<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.590> food<00:02:10.580> grade

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
really simple and I'll use a food grade

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.150 
really simple and I'll use a food grade
plastic<00:02:10.880> I'll<00:02:11.780> put<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.020> grapes<00:02:12.230> in<00:02:12.380> there<00:02:12.500> and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
plastic I'll put the grapes in there and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:25.890 
plastic I'll put the grapes in there and
I'll<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.370> pour<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.700> brine<00:02:13.910> over<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.570> grapes
