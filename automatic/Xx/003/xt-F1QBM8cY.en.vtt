00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.500

 standard tomatoes somewhere 2 3 pieces but 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.550
 I take cherry tomatoes 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.680
 because they are more gentle such 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.239
 sweet and very tasty 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.879
 especially in winter 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.670
 3-4 cucumbers here in this 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.120
 case 5 because they are small and 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.879
 very nice cucumbers from our here 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.640
 local state farm called spring 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.090
 do advertising so we also need 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.750
 leaf lettuce a few few twigs 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.050
 parsley and dill 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.030
 1 red sweet pepper can take 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.539
 yellow green in general is not meaning 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.009
 It has 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:18.830
 and let's start with the fact that 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:22.610
 white cabbage prepared for you 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.110
 the whole me already shredded as always it 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.970
 cabbage left me from the previous 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.700
 dishes will require means such a small 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.399
 so let's say the rubbing that fly 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.720
 Kapustochki so she slightly let the juice 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:44.599
 after which we will deal now 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.360
 cutting the remaining vegetables cucumbers 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.390
 cut into 2 halves and cut here 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.849
 such half rings cherry tomatoes 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.119
 also cut in half if you like 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:59.989
 softer means cutting into quarters 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.179
 cheese we grate on a coarse grater sweet 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:06.530

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.220

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.580
 after which we add our tomatoes 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.420

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:53.000
 so stir my friends recommend 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:56.360
 neatly so that is not particularly 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.040
 damage all of our design after 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.829

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.780
 stirred we add heart here 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.709

 they can reduce and can even 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.810

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:55.600
 some salt pepper 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.050
 by the way instead of salt basically you can 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.680
 add a little more soy 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.080

 at your discretion 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.810
 also you can fill just lemon 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.460
