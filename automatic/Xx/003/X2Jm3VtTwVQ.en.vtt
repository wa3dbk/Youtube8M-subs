apparently go ahead and forgot that part
of<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.760> but<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:27.490> magic<00:02:28.490> mirror<00:02:28.760> than<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.390> we're

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
of it but a magic mirror than that we're

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.500 
of it but a magic mirror than that we're
just<00:02:30.110> holding<00:02:30.320> out<00:02:30.670> we're<00:02:31.670> just<00:02:31.970> holding<00:02:32.180> out

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
just holding out we're just holding out

waiting<00:02:33.290> for<00:02:33.730> waiting<00:02:34.730> for<00:02:35.000> some<00:02:35.150> good

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
waiting for waiting for some good

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.960 
waiting for waiting for some good
weather<00:02:35.980> we've<00:02:36.980> gotten<00:02:37.250> reports<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.820> it's

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
weather we've gotten reports that it's

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.210 
weather we've gotten reports that it's
supposed<00:02:38.210> to<00:02:38.270> clear<00:02:38.420> up<00:02:38.540> after<00:02:39.440> Friday<00:02:40.040> so

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
supposed to clear up after Friday so

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.790 
supposed to clear up after Friday so
we're<00:02:40.640> going<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.570> guess<00:02:42.140> not<00:02:42.440> hold<00:02:42.710> our

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
we're going to I guess not hold our

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.010 
we're going to I guess not hold our
breath<00:02:43.010> but<00:02:43.490> hope<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.630> best<00:02:44.810> and

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
breath but hope for the best and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.470 
breath but hope for the best and
hopefully<00:02:45.230> we<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.680> get<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.280> thing<00:02:46.880> going<00:02:47.090> I

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
hopefully we can get this thing going I

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.320 
hopefully we can get this thing going I
guess<00:02:47.720> that's<00:02:48.710> all<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.250> really<00:02:49.760> have<00:02:49.790> for<00:02:50.150> now

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
guess that's all I really have for now

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.780 
guess that's all I really have for now
but<00:02:50.630> um<00:02:50.840> we<00:02:51.650> still<00:02:51.920> got<00:02:52.040> one<00:02:52.190> more<00:02:52.220> member<00:02:52.550> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.750 
he likes to talk he's also a handsome
man<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:57.790> guess<00:02:58.790> that's<00:02:59.030> me<00:03:00.160> but<00:03:01.160> yeah<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.670> only

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
man I guess that's me but yeah the only

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.950 
man I guess that's me but yeah the only
thing<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.060> could<00:03:02.120> say<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.390> hasn't<00:03:02.840> been<00:03:02.870> said

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
thing I could say that hasn't been said

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.460 
thing I could say that hasn't been said
is<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:04.220> wind<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.670> weather<00:03:04.820> really

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
is that the wind and the weather really

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.660 
is that the wind and the weather really
screwing<00:03:06.470> us<00:03:06.650> up<00:03:06.800> right<00:03:06.860> now<00:03:07.250> because<00:03:07.520> it's

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
screwing us up right now because it's

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.420 
screwing us up right now because it's
been<00:03:08.030> super<00:03:08.750> cold<00:03:09.050> super<00:03:09.530> super<00:03:09.830> cold<00:03:10.070> i<00:03:10.250> think

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
been super cold super super cold i think

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.890 
been super cold super super cold i think
we're<00:03:10.580> under<00:03:10.850> estimating<00:03:11.360> how<00:03:11.420> cold<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.810> is

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
we're under estimating how cold it is

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.949 
we're under estimating how cold it is
down<00:03:12.200> here<00:03:12.380> at<00:03:12.440> base<00:03:12.590> camp<00:03:12.890> it's<00:03:13.100> probably<00:03:13.959> you

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
down here at base camp it's probably you

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.760 
down here at base camp it's probably you
know<00:03:14.989> in<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:16.040> teens<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.550> then<00:03:17.500> with<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.590> wind

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
know in the teens and then with the wind

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.030 
know in the teens and then with the wind
chill<00:03:18.860> it's<00:03:19.190> far<00:03:19.370> colder<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:20.030> up<00:03:20.510> at<00:03:21.040> 19,000

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860

concerned not only with the snow on the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.900 
concerned not only with the snow on the
face<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:32.750> there's<00:03:33.320> a<00:03:33.760> ninety-nine<00:03:34.760> percent

face but there's a ninety-nine percent
chance<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.480> our<00:03:35.600> 10<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:35.989> flattened<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.560> torn

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
chance that our 10 is flattened and torn

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.850 
chance that our 10 is flattened and torn
through<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.060> polls<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.780> gear<00:03:39.560> could<00:03:39.739> be

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
through the polls and gear could be

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.070 
through the polls and gear could be
strewn<00:03:40.190> throughout<00:03:40.580> Camp<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.209> camp<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.720> do<00:03:41.840> so

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
strewn throughout Camp to camp to do so

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.050 
strewn throughout Camp to camp to do so
there's<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.860> lot<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.070> question<00:03:43.550> marks<00:03:43.580> we<00:03:43.910> don't

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
there's a lot of question marks we don't

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.050 
there's a lot of question marks we don't
know<00:03:44.150> what's<00:03:44.360> going<00:03:44.630> on<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.080> uh<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.580> really

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
know what's going on so uh and really

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.490 
know what's going on so uh and really
there's<00:03:47.269> no<00:03:47.420> way<00:03:47.570> we<00:03:47.720> can<00:03:47.810> even<00:03:47.989> walk<00:03:48.230> up<00:03:48.410> to

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
there's no way we can even walk up to

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.410 
there's no way we can even walk up to
camp<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.860> right<00:03:49.070> now<00:03:49.250> because<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.880> wind<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.180> so

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
camp to right now because the wind is so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.270 
camp to right now because the wind is so
strong<00:03:50.450> right<00:03:51.080> this<00:03:51.350> current<00:03:51.830> moment<00:03:51.980> it's

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
strong right this current moment it's

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.780 
strong right this current moment it's
nothing<00:03:52.670> but<00:03:53.050> it's<00:03:54.050> huge<00:03:54.950> lenticular<00:03:55.280> over

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
nothing but it's huge lenticular over

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.360 
nothing but it's huge lenticular over
the<00:03:55.880> peak<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.510> wake<00:03:57.500> old<00:03:57.830> when<00:03:58.100> I<00:03:58.160> walk<00:03:58.340> down

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
the peak and wake old when I walk down

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.820 
the peak and wake old when I walk down
from<00:03:58.760> cam<00:03:58.970> 2<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.330> 2<00:03:59.600> days<00:03:59.750> ago<00:03:59.810> I<00:04:00.320> have<00:04:00.530> four

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
from cam 2 to 2 days ago I have four

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.150 
from cam 2 to 2 days ago I have four
layers<00:04:01.070> on<00:04:01.370> including<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.880> pared-down<00:04:02.239> pants

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
layers on including a pared-down pants

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.410 
layers on including a pared-down pants
checking<00:04:04.160> pants<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.940> pair<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.150> gore-tex

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
checking pants and a pair of gore-tex

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.440 
checking pants and a pair of gore-tex
shell<00:04:05.810> pants<00:04:06.260> which<00:04:06.440> it's<00:04:07.310> unbelievably<00:04:08.239> cold

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
shell pants which it's unbelievably cold

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.259 
shell pants which it's unbelievably cold
so<00:04:08.900> there's<00:04:09.709> no<00:04:09.890> reason<00:04:10.070> really<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.880> head<00:04:11.090> up

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
so there's no reason really to head up

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.120 
so there's no reason really to head up
and<00:04:11.420> we're<00:04:11.540> just<00:04:11.690> waiting<00:04:12.050> we're<00:04:12.769> playing<00:04:12.950> the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
and we're just waiting we're playing the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.479 
and we're just waiting we're playing the
mountain<00:04:13.430> waiting<00:04:13.550> game<00:04:13.940> it's<00:04:14.300> not<00:04:14.450> easy<00:04:14.690> so

hard time right now you know probably

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.700 
hard time right now you know probably
probably<00:05:00.770> another<00:05:01.310> week<00:05:01.550> I'd<00:05:02.270> say<00:05:02.590> but<00:05:03.590> right

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
forming over the peak that could

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.790 
forming over the peak that could
possibly<00:05:13.580> blow<00:05:13.910> over<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.510> just<00:05:14.960> are<00:05:15.260> geared

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
possibly blow over and just are geared

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.090 
possibly blow over and just are geared
might<00:05:16.039> just<00:05:16.220> be<00:05:16.340> gone<00:05:16.520> and<00:05:17.440> so<00:05:18.440> there's<00:05:18.889> a<00:05:18.949> lot

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.439 
might just be gone and so there's a lot
of<00:05:19.160> questions<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.729> right<00:05:19.880> now<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.120> know

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449

go and to leave kind of prematurely

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.430 
go and to leave kind of prematurely
would<00:05:40.970> be<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> shame<00:05:41.389> so<00:05:41.750> we're<00:05:41.930> you<00:05:42.200> know<00:05:42.289> we
