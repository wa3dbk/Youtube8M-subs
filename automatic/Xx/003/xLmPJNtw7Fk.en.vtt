00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
Tupperware and having the deal with all

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.810 
Tupperware and having the deal with all
that<00:01:03.360> stuff<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.900> it<00:01:03.960> makes<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.170> easier<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.530> use

that stuff so it makes it easier to use
but<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> also<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.590> synthesis<00:01:07.590> protein

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
but I also have the synthesis protein

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.109 
but I also have the synthesis protein
shake<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.790> soon<00:01:08.940> as<00:01:09.030> my

shake you can have as soon as my
workouts<00:01:09.510> done<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.470> the

workouts done because if you know the
best<00:01:11.640> time<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.210> protein<00:01:12.690> in<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.260> within

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
best time to get protein in is within

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.649 
best time to get protein in is within
the<00:01:13.950> first<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.400> 20<00:01:14.700> minutes<00:01:14.970> after<00:01:15.119> your

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
and I'm gonna have my syntha-6 protein

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.580 
and I'm gonna have my syntha-6 protein
40<00:03:36.030> grits<00:03:36.269> 40<00:03:36.599> grams<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:37.019> protein<00:03:37.169> which<00:03:37.500> I

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
40 grits 40 grams of protein which I

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.280 
40 grits 40 grams of protein which I
like<00:03:37.829> because<00:03:38.419> your<00:03:39.419> body<00:03:39.660> can't<00:03:39.989> really

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
like because your body can't really

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.629 
like because your body can't really
handle<00:03:40.560> more<00:03:41.069> than<00:03:41.269> 50<00:03:42.269> at<00:03:42.450> max<00:03:42.810> for<00:03:43.169> protein

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
handle more than 50 at max for protein

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.339 
handle more than 50 at max for protein
okay<00:03:44.639> you<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.910> body<00:03:45.329> just<00:03:45.450> can't<00:03:45.690> utilize<00:03:45.900> all

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
okay you a body just can't utilize all

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.720 
okay you a body just can't utilize all
that<00:03:46.560> at<00:03:46.680> once<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.250> if<00:03:47.489> you're<00:03:47.609> getting

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
that at once so if you're getting

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.460 
that at once so if you're getting
protein<00:03:48.329> shakes<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.930> you're<00:03:49.079> putting<00:03:49.260> like

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
protein shakes and you're putting like

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.039 
protein shakes and you're putting like
seven<00:03:49.859> scoops<00:03:50.160> in<00:03:50.310> your<00:03:50.430> protein<00:03:50.790> drink<00:03:51.090> if

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
seven scoops in your protein drink if

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.270 
seven scoops in your protein drink if
you're<00:03:52.139> getting<00:03:52.260> really<00:03:52.440> any<00:03:52.650> more<00:03:52.859> than<00:03:52.980> 40

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
you're getting really any more than 40

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.830 
you're getting really any more than 40
grams<00:03:53.489> you're<00:03:53.730> wasting<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.060> protein<00:03:54.419> so<00:03:54.630> it's

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
grams you're wasting the protein so it's

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.150 
grams you're wasting the protein so it's
perfect<00:03:55.260> amount<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.739> need<00:03:55.919> for<00:03:55.950> my
