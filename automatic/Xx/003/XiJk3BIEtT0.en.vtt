00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.339
 press conference of sg dynamo dresden 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.299
 after the second league home game against the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.639
 first cologne 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.660
 the game ended with one to one me 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.280
 welcome everyone in vip yesterday 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.139
 premises of the fortune gas stadium 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.269
 and the two coaches hereof next 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.010
 peter stöger from the first cologne and me 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.510
 our head coach peter pacult weber 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.990
 heard the first is in the gaastra stöger 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:30.529
 how is her conclusion? 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:32.790
 he says it that interests a point 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.370
 You should be satisfied because you know 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.390
 that they have a strong team too 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.910
 home in the factory is with great 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.649
 Support the fans for the game 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.350
 over long distances of my team 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.500
 Satisfied with the result, however 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.230
 Not 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.590
 Thank you Mr Stoeger trainer how do you fall 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.590
 conclusion 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.010
 Of course, it's time to play as a coach 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.670
 especially in a home game around 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.739
 win 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.439
 in other words, the hammer knew with 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.180
 the first FC Cologne comes with the team 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.670
 ambitions of new trainers new 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.200
 euphoria and that is of course not 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.479
 but there are also in advance 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 already explained that we, of course, too 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.700
 These ten days relegation the residue 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.869
 in the training but have the team 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.549
 I have to say has always got better in 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.229
 the game is worked on 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.840
 at the beginning said that cologne but a bit 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.049
 even further is training 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.200
 from the example but with persistence of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.310
 Game guess they have very good 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.430
 of course, have two incorporated 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 huge possibilities comes on the 1 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.420
 0 is not meant to be and we think 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.180
 still the are 0 1 the team still in the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.860
 gang and gained has certainly 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.210
 earned this compensation was that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.220
 actually play the last one 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.920
 fifteen minutes back and forth 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.869
 also for uwe and of course with some 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.310
 possibilities on both sides so think 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.850
 the tie all right 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.710
 Thank you 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.810
 Thank goodness now is time for again 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.950
 their and your ask to see you 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.619
 as the request for a short hand sign 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.270
 then the microphone comes as long before 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.850
 they have decided to only with 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.220
 aground a striker which has then 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.140
 at least they were a few for 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.430
 confusion worried 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.520
 I already knew that in the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.890
 last game because it's totally for 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.690
 I think both are very logical 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.220
 players are not in this yet 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.350
 makeup where I would like it 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.390
 then comes filip trojan to what 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.519
 Of course, complete weeks of training 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.830
 get along is as greeting the channel can 90 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.360
 minutes and thus this was 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.400
 for me it is completely clear that they are 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.290
 not two games or three players on 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.269
 Hamannplatz is optivo your computer 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.850
 the break must still be 60 70 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.590
 minutes and change only three times 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.069
 This made it pretty easy 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.140
 Of course we are a bit more 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.890
 security in it have the error behind 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.130
 the top and a chamber are right 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.130
 given 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:11.090
 manufacturers word to the opposing party 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:15.890
 maybe they have already seen that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:19.819
 happy avoidable was unhappy 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.150
 think you're on the scene today 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.220
 Position in the goal is a mistake most of the time 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.770
 also a serious mistake mostly 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.390
 it's a pity for a 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.370
 We think it was just in a phase 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.290
 where we got the game back so far 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.430
 where good feeling had controlled 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.970
 had and good 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.180
 It happens to be about the scene 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.450
 goalkeeper ulf kirsten and the fc player 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.370
 praised if I remember correctly 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.019
 stronger they are required in sky 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.730
 have it a clear red card 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.080
 if you do not get punished it will be in 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.580
 the next weeks can be dangerous 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.110
 you have to comment please again 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.140
 and maybe the trainer Peter 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.420
 pacult to this scene yes you have 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.250
 they listened well I only 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.070
 meant if these actions are not red 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.730
 map and get players 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.630
 then watch this action then that can 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.980
 dangerous because I do not have it 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.419
 meant really when you have a 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.340
 stretch Rhine I are my only is 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.829
 for me was a very clear red card 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.870
 I believe that the action before with 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.190
 whistle off the flank ball about what 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.050
 It was also a correct decision 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.680
 One attack the gate that was one 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.169
 foul play 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.400
 but the action one changes over the 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.590
 I do not think I need that either 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.169
 discuss as well as very awkwardly 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.900
 if you say that then 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.979
 you need television pictures 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.979
 actually nothing more together 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.050
 there are more questions this is not the 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.550
 Thank you for your help 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.380
 attention if yesterday from 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.919
 Cologne pleasant entry to the 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.919
 next time shoot
