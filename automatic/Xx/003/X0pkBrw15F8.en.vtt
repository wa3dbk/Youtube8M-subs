broad daylight however in low light or
at<00:00:34.640> night<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.510> back<00:00:35.870> camera<00:00:36.080> does<00:00:36.440> very<00:00:36.830> well

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
at night the back camera does very well

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.340 
at night the back camera does very well
and<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.910> front<00:00:38.090> where<00:00:38.330> camera<00:00:38.750> fails<00:00:39.050> to

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
and the front where camera fails to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.010 
and the front where camera fails to
deliver<00:00:39.680> good<00:00:40.010> quality<00:00:40.040> photographs<00:00:41.020> so

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
deliver good quality photographs so

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.860 
deliver good quality photographs so
that's<00:00:42.350> one<00:00:42.530> disadvantage<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.120> second

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
that's one disadvantage and the second

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.500 
that's one disadvantage and the second
feature<00:00:45.110> is<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:45.590> it<00:00:46.010> shoots<00:00:46.430> we<00:00:47.000> use<00:00:47.180> up<00:00:47.390> to

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
feature is that it shoots we use up to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.930 
feature is that it shoots we use up to
the<00:00:47.630> resolution<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.260> 1080p<00:00:49.010> that<00:00:49.310> is<00:00:49.430> full<00:00:49.610> HD

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
the resolution of 1080p that is full HD

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.420 
the resolution of 1080p that is full HD
at<00:00:50.150> 30<00:00:50.510> frames<00:00:50.720> per<00:00:50.930> second<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.500> this<00:00:52.190> frame

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
at 30 frames per second and this frame

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.250 
at 30 frames per second and this frame
rate<00:00:52.610> is<00:00:52.730> pretty<00:00:52.880> good<00:00:53.210> because<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.900> video

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
rate is pretty good because the video

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.470 
rate is pretty good because the video
will<00:00:54.380> seem<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.740> be<00:00:54.830> stable<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:55.430> smooth<00:00:55.850> if<00:00:56.090> I

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
will seem to be stable and smooth if I

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.510 
will seem to be stable and smooth if I
am<00:00:56.540> moving<00:00:56.900> around<00:00:57.200> with<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.530> camera<00:00:57.680> so

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
am moving around with the camera so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.420 
am moving around with the camera so
that's<00:00:58.700> pretty<00:00:58.910> good<00:00:59.440> third<00:01:00.440> it<00:01:00.710> allows<00:01:01.250> to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
that's pretty good third it allows to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.460 
that's pretty good third it allows to
shoot<00:01:01.640> photographs<00:01:02.270> in<00:01:02.570> different<00:01:03.200> modes

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
shoot photographs in different modes

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.800 
shoot photographs in different modes
that<00:01:03.740> is<00:01:04.220> like<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> smiling<00:01:04.970> mode<00:01:05.150> a<00:01:05.330> person

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
that is like a smiling mode a person

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.050 
that is like a smiling mode a person
smiles<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.590> photograph<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:06.980> click<00:01:07.370> or<00:01:07.550> in

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
smiles and the photograph is click or in

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.150 
smiles and the photograph is click or in
the<00:01:08.150> action<00:01:08.540> mode<00:01:08.720> or<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.020> panorama<00:01:09.740> mode<00:01:09.920> or

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
the action mode or the panorama mode or

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.940 
the action mode or the panorama mode or
the<00:01:10.220> beauty<00:01:10.700> mode<00:01:10.910> etc<00:01:11.120> etc<00:01:11.510> so<00:01:12.050> these<00:01:12.680> are<00:01:12.920> a

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
the beauty mode etc etc so these are a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.460 
the beauty mode etc etc so these are a
few<00:01:13.010> modes<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.610> it<00:01:13.850> provides<00:01:14.180> then<00:01:15.110> fourth

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
few modes that it provides then fourth

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.680 
few modes that it provides then fourth
it<00:01:15.770> has<00:01:16.220> got<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.460> self<00:01:16.700> timer<00:01:16.940> which<00:01:17.240> supports

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
it has got a self timer which supports

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.920 
it has got a self timer which supports
both<00:01:18.440> video<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.310> photograph<00:01:20.000> II<00:01:20.120> so<00:01:20.540> I<00:01:20.570> can

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
both video and photograph II so I can

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.660 
both video and photograph II so I can
put<00:01:21.050> a<00:01:21.110> self<00:01:21.350> timer<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:21.950> click<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.370> photograph

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
put a self timer and click a photograph

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.660 
put a self timer and click a photograph
or<00:01:23.120> a<00:01:23.180> video<00:01:23.450> according<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.260> my<00:01:24.440> needs<00:01:24.680> fifth

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
or a video according to my needs fifth

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.460 
or a video according to my needs fifth
it<00:01:25.910> allows<00:01:26.240> us<00:01:26.480> to<00:01:26.630> change<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.080> exposure

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
it allows us to change the exposure

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.060 
it allows us to change the exposure
value<00:01:28.010> from<00:01:28.190> 0<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.580> 2<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.000> 0<00:01:29.180> 2-2<00:01:29.510> here<00:01:30.500> in

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
value from 0 to 2 and 0 2-2 here in

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.220 
value from 0 to 2 and 0 2-2 here in
photographs<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.090> too<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.480> even<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.080> the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
photographs and that too and even in the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.930 
photographs and that too and even in the
videos<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.340> that's<00:01:34.520> another<00:01:34.880> good<00:01:35.120> feature

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
videos so that's another good feature

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.320 
videos so that's another good feature
sixth<00:01:37.940> it<00:01:38.690> allows<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:40.340> act<00:01:40.610> actually<00:01:40.880> has<00:01:41.300> the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
sixth it allows it act actually has the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.710 
sixth it allows it act actually has the
ISO<00:01:41.659> sensitivity<00:01:41.990> from<00:01:43.390> minimum<00:01:44.390> ISO

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
ISO sensitivity from minimum ISO

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.770 
ISO sensitivity from minimum ISO
sensitivity<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.470> 100<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.090> I'm<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.210> my<00:01:47.300> senses

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
sensitivity of 100 and I'm of my senses

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380 
sensitivity of 100 and I'm of my senses
sensitivity<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.500> 800<00:01:49.220> that's<00:01:49.729> also<00:01:50.030> very<00:01:50.060> good

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
sensitivity of 800 that's also very good

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.330 
sensitivity of 800 that's also very good
weekend<00:01:50.750> man<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:51.050> manually<00:01:51.560> select<00:01:51.979> our<00:01:52.100> ISO

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
weekend man is manually select our ISO

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.660 
weekend man is manually select our ISO
sensitivity<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.270> click<00:01:53.990> much<00:01:54.770> better<00:01:55.040> images

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
sensitivity and click much better images

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.789 
sensitivity and click much better images
especially<00:01:56.240> during<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.080> low<00:01:57.380> light<00:01:57.620> and

especially during the low light and

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.690 
especially during the low light and
basically<00:01:58.640> ISO<00:01:58.880> sensitivity<00:01:59.470> is<00:02:00.470> used<00:02:01.370> in

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
basically ISO sensitivity is used in

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.880 
basically ISO sensitivity is used in
lowell<00:02:02.000> high<00:02:02.420> iso<00:02:02.720> sensitivity<00:02:03.049> is<00:02:03.470> used<00:02:03.710> in

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.260 
stable and it moves then it pretty it
stabilizes<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:34.960> images<00:02:35.530> pretty<00:02:36.430> well<00:02:36.700> so

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
stabilizes the images pretty well so

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.730 
stabilizes the images pretty well so
that's<00:02:37.450> also<00:02:37.660> one<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.200> good<00:02:38.320> features

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.770 
that's also one of the good features
that<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:38.980> noticed<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.580> we<00:02:40.180> can<00:02:40.330> also<00:02:40.450> set<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.380 
that I noticed and we can also set the
contrast<00:02:41.470> in<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.830> camera<00:02:42.790> that's<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.210> eight

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
contrast in the camera that's the eight

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.900 
contrast in the camera that's the eight
feature<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:44.410> set<00:02:44.710> it<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.860> auto<00:02:45.100> or<00:02:45.520> we<00:02:45.700> can

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
feature we can set it to auto or we can

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.840 
feature we can set it to auto or we can
set<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.450> contrast<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:48.070> way<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:48.430> want<00:02:48.670> and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
set the contrast the way we want and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.050 
set the contrast the way we want and
finally<00:02:49.840> let's<00:02:50.050> test<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.530> out<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.010> Sun<00:02:51.880> and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
finally let's test it out in the Sun and

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.110 
finally let's test it out in the Sun and
in<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.540> low<00:02:52.780> light<00:02:53.020> so<00:02:53.500> there<00:02:54.220> we<00:02:54.340> go<00:02:54.370> that's

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
in the low light so there we go that's

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.320 
in the low light so there we go that's
the<00:02:55.270> Sun<00:02:55.570> over<00:02:55.840> there<00:02:56.460> so<00:02:57.460> you<00:02:57.520> can<00:02:57.910> see<00:02:58.120> it

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
the Sun over there so you can see it

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.430 
the Sun over there so you can see it
that's<00:02:58.810> pretty<00:02:58.990> well<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.970> that's<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.440> low

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
that's pretty well and that's the low

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.020 
that's pretty well and that's the low
light<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:03.220> takes<00:03:03.490> a<00:03:03.610> bit<00:03:03.760> time<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:05.280> get<00:03:06.280> used<00:03:06.910> to

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
light it takes a bit time to get used to

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.020 
light it takes a bit time to get used to
the<00:03:07.120> contrast<00:03:07.570> ratio<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.790> it

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
the contrast ratio so that but it

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.180 
the contrast ratio so that but it
performs<00:03:10.540> very<00:03:10.750> well<00:03:10.840> by<00:03:11.650> changing<00:03:12.070> the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
performs very well by changing the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.040 
performs very well by changing the
contrast<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:12.820> have<00:03:13.210> also<00:03:13.480> posted<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.870> few

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
contrast I have also posted a few

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.440 
contrast I have also posted a few
pictures<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:15.460> I<00:03:15.490> took<00:03:15.610> from<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.150> samsung

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
pictures that I took from the samsung

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.110 
pictures that I took from the samsung
galaxy<00:03:16.570> s2<00:03:17.110> at<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.190> end<00:03:18.460> of<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.640> video<00:03:18.790> and

galaxy s2 at the end of the video and

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.330 
galaxy s2 at the end of the video and
they<00:03:19.420> have<00:03:19.510> been<00:03:19.630> categorized<00:03:20.110> into<00:03:20.340> daylight

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
they have been categorized into daylight

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.400 
they have been categorized into daylight
evening<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.180> night<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:23.110> think<00:03:23.320> even

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
evening and night and I think even
