reviews we've got pictures up of how we
drill<00:00:57.489> everything<00:00:57.820> including<00:00:58.210> our<00:00:58.300> surfaces

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.619

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
third ball we want to start with the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.040 
third ball we want to start with the
mastermind<00:01:09.250> that<00:01:09.460> we<00:01:09.580> took<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:10.000> look<00:01:10.240> at<00:01:10.450> hook

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
mastermind that we took a look at hook

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.719 
mastermind that we took a look at hook
by<00:01:11.560> comparing<00:01:12.070> where<00:01:12.190> we<00:01:12.250> laid<00:01:12.399> it<00:01:12.429> over<00:01:12.550> the

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
by comparing where we laid it over the

arrows 5 at the break point it was by

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.450 
arrows 5 at the break point it was by
far<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:19.030> most<00:01:19.240> angular<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:21.009> cleanest

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
far the most angular and the cleanest

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.499 
far the most angular and the cleanest
through<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.759> front<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.179> allowed<00:01:22.360> us<00:01:22.390> to

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
through the front it allowed us to

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.570 
through the front it allowed us to
really<00:01:22.690> open<00:01:23.050> up<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.380> lane<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:23.619> really<00:01:23.950> get<00:01:24.100> a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
really open up the lane and really get a

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.990 
really open up the lane and really get a
good<00:01:25.240> carry<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.890> endless<00:01:27.250> nightmare<00:01:27.460> was<00:01:27.970> a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
good carry the endless nightmare was a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.890 
good carry the endless nightmare was a
stronger<00:01:28.659> 32<00:01:29.110> at<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.290> dots<00:01:29.500> 27<00:01:30.250> at<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.460> arrows

10<00:01:31.900> board<00:01:32.229> at<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.470> break<00:01:32.710> point<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.520> was<00:01:33.970> we

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
10 board at the break point it was we

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.420 
10 board at the break point it was we
found<00:01:34.840> it<00:01:35.049> was<00:01:35.200> our<00:01:35.320> heaviest<00:01:35.890> hooking<00:01:36.250> ball

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
found it was our heaviest hooking ball

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.990 
found it was our heaviest hooking ball
it<00:01:36.850> also<00:01:36.970> had<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.240> most<00:01:37.360> surface<00:01:37.780> on<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.140> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it also had the most surface on it and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.850 
it also had the most surface on it and
then<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.360> ruckus<00:01:40.930> now<00:01:41.259> you'll<00:01:41.439> notice<00:01:41.500> with

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
then the ruckus now you'll notice with

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.380 
then the ruckus now you'll notice with
our<00:01:41.950> line<00:01:42.159> here<00:01:42.549> it<00:01:42.670> looks<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.939> little<00:01:43.060> unusual

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
our line here it looks a little unusual

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.480 
our line here it looks a little unusual
this<00:01:43.750> ball<00:01:44.020> has<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.229> lot<00:01:44.530> more<00:01:44.560> mid<00:01:45.189> lane

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
this ball has a lot more mid lane

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.830 
this ball has a lot more mid lane
traction<00:01:46.210> than<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.320> other<00:01:47.500> ones<00:01:47.829> did<00:01:48.840> alright

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
traction than the other ones did alright

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.389 
traction than the other ones did alright
guys<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.140> here<00:01:50.409> are<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.590> results<00:01:50.799> as<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.280> can

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
guys so here are the results as you can

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.679 
guys so here are the results as you can
see<00:01:51.490> all<00:01:51.640> three<00:01:51.820> balls<00:01:52.030> perform<00:01:52.360> just<00:01:52.570> about

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
see all three balls perform just about

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.209 
see all three balls perform just about
the<00:01:52.810> same<00:01:52.990> we<00:01:53.170> just<00:01:53.320> played<00:01:53.530> them<00:01:53.649> in<00:01:53.740> slightly

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
the same we just played them in slightly

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:55.920 
the same we just played them in slightly
different<00:01:54.340> parts<00:01:54.790> of<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.909> lane<00:01:55.149> as<00:01:55.329> you<00:01:55.810> can

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
different parts of the lane as you can

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.780 
different parts of the lane as you can
see<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.380> mastermind<00:01:56.799> was<00:01:56.950> more<00:01:57.100> angular<00:01:57.460> it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
see the mastermind was more angular it

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.370 
see the mastermind was more angular it
was<00:01:57.939> also<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.360> cleanest<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.020> front<00:01:59.200> part

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
was also the cleanest of the front part

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.990 
was also the cleanest of the front part
of<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.469> lane<00:01:59.649> the<00:02:00.159> endless<00:02:00.399> nightmare<00:02:00.640> had

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
of the lane the endless nightmare had

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.990 
of the lane the endless nightmare had
the<00:02:01.149> strongest<00:02:01.630> overall<00:02:02.259> hook<00:02:02.649> motion<00:02:03.189> and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
the strongest overall hook motion and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.480 
the strongest overall hook motion and
the<00:02:04.329> ruckus<00:02:04.780> while<00:02:05.530> had<00:02:05.799> about<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.460> same

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the ruckus while had about the same

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.190 
the ruckus while had about the same
amount<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:06.939> hook<00:02:07.180> as<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.750> endless<00:02:07.990> nightmare

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
amount of hook as the endless nightmare

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.800 
amount of hook as the endless nightmare
it<00:02:08.860> broke<00:02:09.340> about<00:02:09.729> two<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.149> three<00:02:10.179> feet<00:02:10.390> earlier

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
it broke about two to three feet earlier

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.229 
it broke about two to three feet earlier
as<00:02:11.530> we<00:02:11.680> said<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.040> was<00:02:12.160> basically<00:02:12.579> mid<00:02:12.940> lane<00:02:13.120> in

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
as we said it was basically mid lane in

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.420 
as we said it was basically mid lane in
