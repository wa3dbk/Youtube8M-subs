00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.690 

I<00:00:33.809> thought<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.530> d<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.100> are<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
I thought you d be here are the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.790 
I thought you d be here are the
Millennials<00:00:36.090> actually<00:00:36.930> those<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.350> want<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
Millennials actually those that want a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.780 
Millennials actually those that want a
powerful<00:00:38.250> force<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> lighter<00:00:40.290> price<00:00:40.860> okay

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
powerful force but a lighter price okay

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.160 
powerful force but a lighter price okay
so<00:00:42.480> coming<00:00:42.840> from<00:00:42.989> infinity<00:00:44.329> infinity<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.570> this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so coming from infinity infinity to this

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.729 
so coming from infinity infinity to this
one<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.860> equally<00:00:47.340> powerful<00:00:48.020> because<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.440> terms

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
one is equally powerful because in terms

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.279 
one is equally powerful because in terms
of<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.340> go<00:00:50.550> straight<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> memory

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
of I go straight to the to the memory

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.549 
of I go straight to the to the memory
it's<00:00:52.440> also<00:00:52.620> 16gb<00:00:53.610> rose<00:00:53.969> into<00:00:54.239> GE<00:00:54.570> lab<00:00:54.989> okay<00:00:55.500> so

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it's also 16gb rose into GE lab okay so

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.830 
it's also 16gb rose into GE lab okay so
it's<00:00:55.949> powerhouse<00:00:56.489> pecs<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.149> turns<00:00:57.600> yes

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's powerhouse pecs but it turns yes

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.900 
it's powerhouse pecs but it turns yes
but<00:00:58.230> other<00:00:58.440> lighter<00:00:58.770> price<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.579> for

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
but other lighter price like for

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
but other lighter price like for

nine okay so you basically have two

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
nine okay so you basically have two
variants<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.170> release<00:01:25.530> okay<00:01:26.040> that's

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
variants of just release okay that's

variants of just release okay that's
wonderful<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.270> being<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.570> minute<00:01:27.990> being

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
wonderful and then being a minute being

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.319 
wonderful and then being a minute being
at<00:01:28.380> infinity<00:01:29.159> release<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> would<00:01:30.000> imagine

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
at infinity release now I would imagine

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.840 
at infinity release now I would imagine
that<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.200> also<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.460> ability

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that this one also has like your ability

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.940 
that this one also has like your ability
to<00:01:33.030> veteran<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.900> assign<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.380> or<00:01:34.530> not

man so infinity pool is aluminum and for
this<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.740> fancy<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.280> light<00:01:41.579> its<00:01:41.880> McNally

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
this one fancy little light its McNally

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.240 
this one fancy little light its McNally
oh<00:01:42.479> value

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
oh value

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.950 
oh value
kind<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.850> method<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.630> makes<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.730> 40%<00:01:48.960> lighter

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
kind of method that makes it 40% lighter

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.400 
kind of method that makes it 40% lighter
but<00:01:51.390> practically<00:01:52.390> two<00:01:52.600> times<00:01:52.900> or<00:01:53.230> three<00:01:53.260> times

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
but practically two times or three times

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.890 
but practically two times or three times
its<00:01:54.130> strength<00:01:54.610> also<00:01:55.150> so<00:01:55.300> it's<00:01:55.450> pretty<00:01:55.570> life

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
its strength also so it's pretty life

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.469 
its strength also so it's pretty life
compared<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:57.070> Infinity<00:01:57.820> fashion<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.450> very

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
compared to the Infinity fashion is very

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.180 
compared to the Infinity fashion is very

okay<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:35.470> cameras<00:04:35.950> from<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.220> front<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.640> can

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
okay the cameras from the front that can

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.630 
okay the cameras from the front that can
rock<00:04:37.330> this<00:04:37.900> one<00:04:38.110> is<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.290> five<00:04:38.530> megapixel<00:04:38.770> at<00:04:39.460> the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
rock this one is a five megapixel at the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.810 
rock this one is a five megapixel at the
fraud<00:04:39.910> can<00:04:40.330> we<00:04:40.450> try<00:04:40.690> that<00:04:40.720> out<00:04:41.050> yeah<00:04:41.640> we<00:04:42.640> love

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
fraud can we try that out yeah we love

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:53.330 
fraud can we try that out yeah we love
the<00:04:42.970> big<00:04:43.180> selfies<00:04:49.380> let's<00:04:50.380> try<00:04:50.680> this

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.260 

okay<00:04:56.460> where<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.520> difference<00:04:57.940> here<00:04:58.180> is<00:04:58.240> that

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
okay where the difference here is that

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.480 
okay where the difference here is that
is<00:04:58.480> pi<00:04:58.660> also<00:04:58.870> five<00:04:59.200> megapixels<00:04:59.950> but<00:05:00.070> this<00:05:00.280> one

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
is pi also five megapixels but this one

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.610 
is pi also five megapixels but this one
doesn't<00:05:00.669> have<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.940> front-facing<00:05:01.480> flash<00:05:04.620> but

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
doesn't have a front-facing flash but

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.010 
doesn't have a front-facing flash but
they<00:05:05.919> both<00:05:06.100> both<00:05:06.940> cameras<00:05:07.419> except<00:05:07.720> red<00:05:07.840> are

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
they both both cameras except red are

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.990 
they both both cameras except red are
both<00:05:08.169> 5<00:05:08.410> megapixels<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.190> on<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.520> back<00:05:09.700> it's

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
both 5 megapixels and on the back it's

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.100 
both 5 megapixels and on the back it's
like<00:05:10.680> it's<00:05:11.680> also<00:05:11.950> Sony<00:05:12.160> sensor<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:13.150> will<00:05:13.720> have

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
like it's also Sony sensor it will have

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.530 
like it's also Sony sensor it will have
great<00:05:14.530> low-light<00:05:15.070> performance<00:05:15.180> that's<00:05:16.180> what

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
great low-light performance that's what

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.450 
great low-light performance that's what
he<00:05:16.720> would<00:05:16.870> expect<00:05:16.900> also<00:05:17.650> blue<00:05:17.980> glass<00:05:18.280> eye<00:05:20.460> okay

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
he would expect also blue glass eye okay

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.310 
he would expect also blue glass eye okay
so<00:05:21.520> that's<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:22.120> very<00:05:22.300> useful<00:05:22.750> for<00:05:22.870> example<00:05:22.930> with

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
so that's a very useful for example with

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.340 
so that's a very useful for example with
a<00:05:23.440> really<00:05:23.830> bright<00:05:24.130> bright<00:05:25.090> similar<00:05:25.750> subjects

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
a really bright bright similar subjects

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.700 
a really bright bright similar subjects
and<00:05:26.560> Ybarra<00:05:26.830> it<00:05:26.979> lessens<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.580> Claire<00:05:28.650> okay<00:05:29.650> so

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
and Ybarra it lessens the Claire okay so

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.270 
and Ybarra it lessens the Claire okay so
BAM

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280
