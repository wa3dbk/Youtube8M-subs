laws about protecting native animals

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.710

like<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.470> know<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.949> kangaroo<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.720> Platypus

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
like you know the kangaroo the Platypus

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.070 
like you know the kangaroo the Platypus
the<00:00:18.990> possum<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.800> echidna<00:00:20.789> there's<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:21.689> sorts

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
the possum the echidna there's all sorts

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
of native animals and it will protect it

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.089 
of native animals and it will protect it
which<00:00:24.480> means<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.140> can't<00:00:25.380> keep<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> pet

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099

protecting native animals by not letting

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.630 
protecting native animals by not letting
them<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.360> pets<00:00:51.660> means<00:00:52.289> making<00:00:52.800> other<00:00:53.190> animals

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
them be pets means making other animals

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.939

it<00:00:56.699> sort<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.239> doesn't<00:00:57.539> make<00:00:57.840> sense<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.440> me<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it sort of doesn't make sense to me I

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.310 
it sort of doesn't make sense to me I
think<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.550> Australia<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.930> should<00:01:01.140> have

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
think in Australia we should have

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.439 
think in Australia we should have
Australian<00:01:01.980> animals<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.789> pets<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.329> should

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
Australian animals as pets and we should

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.070
