let's<00:02:52.519> see<00:02:52.760> how<00:02:53.360> do<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.570> put<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.190> where<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
let's see how do I put this where the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.500 
let's see how do I put this where the
most<00:02:56.060> vulnerable<00:02:57.070> defenses<00:02:58.070> are<00:02:58.370> ahead<00:02:59.239> and

most vulnerable defenses are ahead and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.800 
most vulnerable defenses are ahead and
then<00:02:59.750> mean<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:01.400> air<00:03:01.610> defenses<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.390> visit

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
then mean the air defenses and the visit

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.979 
then mean the air defenses and the visit
towers<00:03:03.310> now<00:03:04.310> I'll<00:03:04.459> put<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.700> line<00:03:04.970> right<00:03:05.329> up

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
towers now I'll put a line right up

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.030 
towers now I'll put a line right up
against<00:03:06.950> visit<00:03:07.640> towers<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.209> air<00:03:08.450> defence

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
against visit towers and the air defence

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.550 
against visit towers and the air defence
wait<00:03:10.040> until<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.640> dragons<00:03:11.239> get<00:03:11.510> aggro<00:03:12.140> enough

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
wait until the dragons get aggro enough

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.370 
wait until the dragons get aggro enough
and<00:03:12.890> then<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.459> send<00:03:14.180> my<00:03:14.720> balloons

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
and then I send my balloons

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.370 
and then I send my balloons
so<00:03:15.920> my<00:03:16.070> balloons<00:03:16.430> reach<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.690> air<00:03:17.870> defenses

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
so my balloons reach the air defenses

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.780 
so my balloons reach the air defenses
and<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.890> visit<00:03:19.400> tiles<00:03:19.700> because<00:03:20.030> visitors<00:03:20.989> are

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
and the visit tiles because visitors are

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.240 
and the visit tiles because visitors are
terribly<00:03:22.790> bad<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:24.049> balloons<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:27.620> when<00:03:28.100> they

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
terribly bad for balloons and when they

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.090 
terribly bad for balloons and when they
are<00:03:28.400> over<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.170> visitors<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.470> air<00:03:30.680> defense

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
are over the visitors in the air defense

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.030 
are over the visitors in the air defense
actually<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:32.299> fight<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.900> almost<00:03:33.200> done<00:03:33.829> now

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
just waiting until the timer is up or

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.590 
just waiting until the timer is up or

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
you have a complete device and although

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.849 
you have a complete device and although
it's<00:03:45.019> a<00:03:45.230> very<00:03:45.260> expensive<00:03:46.329> tactic<00:03:47.329> it's<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.500> very

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
it's a very expensive tactic it's a very
