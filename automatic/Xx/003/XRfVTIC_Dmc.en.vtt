I<00:01:09.659> guess<00:01:09.810> because<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.200> haven't<00:01:10.500> been

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
I guess because there haven't been

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.319 
I guess because there haven't been
enough<00:01:10.830> kits<00:01:11.130> imported<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.759> really<00:01:11.969> make<00:01:12.180> it

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
enough kits imported to really make it

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.660 
enough kits imported to really make it
worth<00:01:12.479> their<00:01:12.659> while<00:01:13.070> apex<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:14.189> had<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> kits

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
worth their while apex has had the kits

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060 
worth their while apex has had the kits
on<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.630> couple<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.619> years<00:01:16.799> but

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
on and off for a couple of years but

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.679 
on and off for a couple of years but
that's<00:01:17.219> about<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.579> only<00:01:17.640> steady<00:01:18.119> source<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that's about the only steady source of

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.209 
that's about the only steady source of
them<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.469> one<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.829> course<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.399> 7.62<00:01:21.240> by<00:01:21.360> 39

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219

them this one of course is in 7.62 by 39
it's<00:01:23.570> pretty<00:01:24.570> much<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> standard<00:01:26.659> AKM<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.079> only

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
it's pretty much a standard AKM the only

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's pretty much a standard AKM the only
difference<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> metal<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> notice

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
difference in the metal is if you notice

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.560 
difference in the metal is if you notice
up<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.880> instead<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.969> having<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.390> smaller

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
up here instead of having the smaller

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.800 
up here instead of having the smaller
loop<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:35.549> has<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> larger<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> sling

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
loop it has a larger one that the sling

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.389 
loop it has a larger one that the sling
goes<00:01:36.990> through<00:01:37.200> directly<00:01:37.619> without<00:01:37.770> using<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
goes through directly without using the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.190 
goes through directly without using the
d-ring<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.060> snap<00:01:39.359> it's<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.109> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
d-ring and snap it's just one of the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
d-ring and snap it's just one of the
small<00:01:40.320> changes<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:41.009> did<00:01:41.189> otherwise<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
small changes they did otherwise the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.969 
small changes they did otherwise the
metal<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.630> pretty<00:01:42.899> identical<00:01:43.320> than<00:01:43.590> any<00:01:43.770> other

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
of course the furniture is different

plastic lower as well but they found out

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.179 
plastic lower as well but they found out
there<00:01:59.579> was<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> minor<00:01:59.939> problem<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:01.189> plastic

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
there was a minor problem the plastic

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.800 
there was a minor problem the plastic
