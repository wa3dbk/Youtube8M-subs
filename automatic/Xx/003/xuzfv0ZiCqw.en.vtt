00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 perfect crime trainer ed 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.800
 international will have to take legal action 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.660
 as a perfect crime valid today 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.139
 no a ball is a goal 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.310
 let's say you went well went well 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.500
 why 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.180
 if once we put them there too 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.180
 one of English are a team 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.260
 to express themselves 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.170
 the few items that find a hotel 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.560
 do a bit of the first games are not 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.570
 never easy then find an opponent 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.930
 grants little in this series b the other 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.870
 it is not therefore 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.220
 however, vincenzo al 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.930
 design the messenger when you are 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.470
 entered what the technician asked 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.840
 by type of practical star 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.880
 recommendation that I settle on 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.800
 inactive balls 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.120
 what tactical recommendation and nothing 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.120
 more two-headed game 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.909
 let's say I started doing the first one 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.119
 tip what I make up for but not 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.759
 there has not been a tactical task 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.649
 precisely made a change he took one off 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.220
 tip for another so surely it has 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:23.180
 changed characteristics but then he has me 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.210
 given only that provisions on the balls 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.210
 inactive 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.060
 this has gone even difference is not 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.090
 never left but for the part you need 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.619
 we must give a lover who is there in the end 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.619
 so ignorant, in short, not only 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.080
 let's say the defensive phase started 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.060
 strikers then modern football 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:57.940
 and this too must be all 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.220
 Also tactically so that means 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.979
 that maybe you didn't kill the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.530
 category but then I made a goal from 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.950
 striker to have them a bit of kidnapping 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.509
 php asp to the merit I said e 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.290
 betrayals born who fought that 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.910
 ball on the cross because if it was not him 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.250
 attacking the near post another 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.350
 defender first defender in front of the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.209
 chest cloth with the ball so as 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.519
 when you go into the area, close in two 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.319
 against two defenders account that between 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.470
 one-on-one games is definitely 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.900
 easier an account that you go to jump 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.420
 with two when the ball to fold into 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.450
 half ahead of the first to be at bay 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.000
 too much too clean too unbalanced 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.910
 but instead when to close in 2 2 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.310
 against 2 if it passes to be awake if 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.290
 the hard-fought as has remained to the most 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.530
 good for now, in short, for the merit 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.180
 in my opinion also his impression 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.360
 soul weeks Nerazzurri with you 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.980
 been what a team 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.010
 buy nothing again a good group 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.630
 a good group of people who want to 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.700
 work with this philosophy 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.830
 of the coach and I believe that with work 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.670
 is the only thing that then pays them in 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.540
 field is not work sensations is 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.120
 absolutely so 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.910
 about working always in the middle 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.220
 recovery but this was predictable 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.770
 what do you think we have to do with work? 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.570
 expect to be able to count on sforzini 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:32.390
 from the first minute because you recognize why 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.030
 I follow your past that I know I have 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.010
 need a little to put gas in the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.840
 seen on a ball after you have me 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.370
 shot in the middle of the field lost a bit the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.409
 step because 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.409
 but perhaps there is no explanation under the 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.599
 romance explained ie up in support 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.330
 the aero gel in range was not missing 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.629
 breathless this is good he took her away 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.670
 maybe given that numerical superiority 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.319
 and therefore it certainly takes a while 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.200
 because I lost 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.959
 moments 25 abundant days and I miss it 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.019
 above all the match or mini-matches 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.980
 rather than because of the racing jobs e 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:13.189
 however, you do it until you do 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.880
 we will be with the team fails to 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:19.789
 put in the legs of so many players 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.209
 strikers in pink which is ideal but 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.209
 I 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.750
 I get on well with everyone and play with the 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.629
 I think he played with the second one 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.690
 bet played grosseto played 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:36.639
 with gerardi cardboard 90 so it takes 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.009
 spirit of adaptation then you are 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.919
 they lived in two important games a 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.860
 speak to each other, that is, if there is a dialogue between 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.289
 attackers if already and availability 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.569
 especially in a message because you 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.550
 He did suffer until today are 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:55.590
 of marirosa lowers the tones 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.590
 no I do n't have anything, maybe 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.669
 let's say I don't want to think about the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.350
 I've been here now and I'm enjoying this 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.250
 moment I just hope it's alone 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.320
 the beginning for me but above all for the 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.470
 my team for this life an area 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:18.060
 material technique forcing them to six months 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.539
 and support both marcello to wait for 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.539
 sea ​​of ​​sardinia 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.090
 let's say we were hoping, however, presented 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.490
 then with malice it is when 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.910
 a state has gone out of its head not 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.000
 angry is not lucid, there is malice 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.350
 positive because resentment so does not go by 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.830
 Nowhere 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.830
 I 'm happy
