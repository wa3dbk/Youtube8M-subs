00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
okay then just put a line like that a

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.590 
okay then just put a line like that a
curved<00:01:45.690> line<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.979> good<00:01:47.310> tipping<00:01:48.270> spot

gonna<00:03:19.520> add<00:03:19.730> just<00:03:19.760> two<00:03:20.300> dots<00:03:21.100> like<00:03:22.100> that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
gonna add just two dots like that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.500 
gonna add just two dots like that
where's<00:03:23.450> nose<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:26.140> yeah<00:03:27.140> it's<00:03:27.770> pretty<00:03:27.980> basic

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
nostril and um there's a them add a line

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.990 
nostril and um there's a them add a line
from<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:34.160> point<00:03:34.660> from<00:03:35.660> at<00:03:35.960> the<00:03:36.170> nose<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:37.000> go

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
from this point from at the nose and go

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.810 
from this point from at the nose and go
through<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.870> eye<00:03:41.590> okay<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:43.040> that's<00:03:43.370> gonna<00:03:43.610> be

here

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
here

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.979 
here
excuse<00:04:05.360> me<00:04:05.510> curved<00:04:05.840> line<00:04:06.050> like<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.820> then<00:04:07.989> per

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
excuse me curved line like that then per

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.420 
excuse me curved line like that then per
line<00:04:09.260> like<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:10.420> put<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.450> little<00:04:11.660> stub

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
line like this and put a little stub

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.330 
line like this and put a little stub
then<00:04:13.430> connect<00:04:14.270> it<00:04:17.380> okay<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.950> now<00:04:19.070> we're<00:04:19.220> going

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
then connect it okay and now we're going

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.030 
then connect it okay and now we're going
to<00:04:19.430> put<00:04:20.239> this<00:04:20.359> early<00:04:20.660> part<00:04:20.810> of<00:04:20.930> his<00:04:21.019> tail<00:04:21.350> so

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
to put this early part of his tail so

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.370 
to put this early part of his tail so
just<00:04:22.220> start<00:04:22.460> like<00:04:22.640> that<00:04:22.910> put<00:04:23.660> two<00:04:23.840> lines<00:04:24.050> like

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
just start like that put two lines like

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.850 
just start like that put two lines like
that<00:04:25.870> then<00:04:26.870> keep<00:04:27.200> going

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
that then keep going

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.550 
that then keep going
so<00:04:28.040> just<00:04:28.640> take<00:04:28.820> one<00:04:29.060> line<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.600> put<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.140> swirl

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
so just take one line and put a swirl

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.390 
so just take one line and put a swirl
and<00:04:30.980> connect<00:04:31.370> then<00:04:32.180> take<00:04:32.390> the<00:04:32.510> other<00:04:32.540> line

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
and connect then take the other line

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.570 
and connect then take the other line
whose<00:04:34.400> road<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:35.120> connect<00:04:36.130> then<00:04:37.130> right<00:04:37.340> now<00:04:37.520> we

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
whose road and connect then right now we

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.220 
whose road and connect then right now we
could<00:04:37.850> just<00:04:38.060> erase<00:04:38.450> those<00:04:39.169> two<00:04:39.470> overlapping

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
the last leg so it starts over here put

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:59.540 
the last leg so it starts over here put
a<00:04:49.040> grid<00:04:49.280> line<00:04:50.980> line<00:04:52.840> connect<00:04:53.840> them<00:04:54.520> put

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550
