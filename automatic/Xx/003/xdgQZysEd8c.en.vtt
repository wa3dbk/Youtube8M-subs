those will just come off and you can't
like<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.960> rip<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:47.100> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
like really like rip this out because of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.119 
like really like rip this out because of
the<00:00:47.460> pieces<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.149> come<00:00:48.329> off<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.100> try<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the pieces will just come off and try to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.150 
the pieces will just come off and try to
turn<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:51.649> but<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:53.309> still<00:00:54.680> but<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.890> still

one<00:00:56.399> open<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.820> turn<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.710> combination<00:01:01.710> dial

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
one open so you turn a combination dial

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.760 
one open so you turn a combination dial
clockwise<00:01:04.400> to<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.640> orange<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.770> then

counterclockwise to the yellow and then

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.850 
counterclockwise to the yellow and then
this<00:01:13.140> lever<00:01:13.740> moves<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.860> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
this lever moves up like that and the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.859 
this lever moves up like that and the
drawer<00:01:17.159> opens<00:01:19.040> could<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.430> very<00:01:21.090> large<00:01:21.390> drawer

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

can see when the safe is locked uh yeah
you<00:01:34.140> could<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.799> those<00:01:35.579> Technic<00:01:36.360> pieces<00:01:36.630> like

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
you could see those Technic pieces like

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.590 
you could see those Technic pieces like
right<00:01:37.290> there<00:01:37.590> there's<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> there's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
right there there's that one and there's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.330 
right there there's that one and there's
one<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> back<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.860> can't<00:01:41.130> really

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
one for the back that you can't really

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.749 
one for the back that you can't really
say<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.740> yeah<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:44.009> they're<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
say and yeah when they're down all the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.800 
say and yeah when they're down all the
way<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> other<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.500> that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
way you can see the other one and that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.539 
way you can see the other one and that
interlocks<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.259> these<00:01:49.680> holes<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.159> here

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
interlocks with these holes right here

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.850 
interlocks with these holes right here
and<00:01:50.759> then<00:01:51.570> when<00:01:51.810> they're<00:01:52.049> closed<00:01:52.530> when

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and then when they're closed when

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.340 
and then when they're closed when
they're<00:01:53.040> down<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.270> can't<00:01:54.899> like

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
they're down like that you can't like

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
they're down like that you can't like
pull<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.740> closer<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.969> hole<00:01:57.149> there<00:01:57.360> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
pull it closer in the hole there and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.760 
pull it closer in the hole there and
it's<00:01:57.799> jamming<00:01:58.799> it

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's jamming it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.139 
it's jamming it
alright<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.979> I'll<00:02:02.250> show<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.880> mechanism<00:02:03.540> now

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
alright so I'll show you a mechanism now

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.639 
alright so I'll show you a mechanism now
very<00:02:06.149> easy<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.600> take<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> pawn<00:02:07.110> off<00:02:07.259> I'll<00:02:07.469> have

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
very easy to take a pawn off I'll have

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.570 
very easy to take a pawn off I'll have
to<00:02:07.829> take<00:02:07.950> off<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.520> panel

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
to take off one panel

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:20.910 
to take off one panel
all<00:02:11.390> right<00:02:11.750> off<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:16.480> camera<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.780> here

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.470 

all<00:02:21.920> right<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.490> is<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.880> mechanism<00:02:23.230> its

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
all right this is the mechanism its

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.130 
all right this is the mechanism its
unplug<00:02:26.480> my<00:02:26.660> phone<00:02:27.730> all<00:02:28.730> right<00:02:28.820> it's<00:02:29.510> basically

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
unplug my phone all right it's basically

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.650 
unplug my phone all right it's basically
the<00:02:30.440> same<00:02:30.740> mechanism<00:02:31.520> as<00:02:31.700> my<00:02:32.120> second

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
the same mechanism as my second

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.330 
the same mechanism as my second
combination<00:02:32.990> safe<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:34.370> it's<00:02:34.900> it's<00:02:35.900> on

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
combination safe but it's it's on

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.200 
combination safe but it's it's on
horizontally<00:02:37.340> mounted<00:02:37.520> instead<00:02:38.090> of

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
horizontally mounted instead of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.830 
horizontally mounted instead of
vertically<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.500> could<00:02:39.710> say<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.700> L<00:02:40.940> shapes

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
vertically so you could say the L shapes

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.200 
vertically so you could say the L shapes
order<00:02:42.290> which<00:02:42.650> locks<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.940> same

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
order which locks it and the same

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.330 
order which locks it and the same

so<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.370> first<00:02:52.870> color<00:02:53.870> will<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:57.140> first

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
so the first color will be the first

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.060 
so the first color will be the first
color<00:02:57.710> with<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.250> orange<00:02:59.590> right<00:03:00.590> there<00:03:00.860> and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
color with the orange right there and

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.330 
color with the orange right there and
then<00:03:02.000> as<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.930> orange<00:03:03.320> lines<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.070> far

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
then as the orange lines up the far

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.370 
then as the orange lines up the far
rotor<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.910> can<00:03:05.480> see<00:03:05.630> there's<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.870> little<00:03:06.050> gap

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
rotor you can see there's a little gap

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.070 
rotor you can see there's a little gap
there<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.920> then<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:08.120> turn<00:03:08.390> it<00:03:08.600> back

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
there and then you have to turn it back

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.850 
there and then you have to turn it back
to<00:03:09.530> yellow<00:03:10.460> and<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:11.080> lines<00:03:12.080> up<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.620> near

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
to yellow and that lines up the near

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.210 
to yellow and that lines up the near
rotor<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.520> then<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.270> can<00:03:15.170> move<00:03:15.380> this<00:03:15.650> really

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
rotor and then I can move this really

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.210 
rotor and then I can move this really
and<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:17.090> Technic<00:03:17.510> pieces<00:03:17.780> are<00:03:18.200> out<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.560> the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
and the Technic pieces are out of the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.870 
and the Technic pieces are out of the
way<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.730> door<00:03:20.890> just<00:03:21.890> slides<00:03:22.190> out<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:25.160> that's

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
way and door just slides out so that's

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:40.479 
way and door just slides out so that's
basically<00:03:26.540> how<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.840> works<00:03:28.750> safe<00:03:29.750> locked<00:03:39.489> so

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
basically how it works safe locked so

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.979 
basically how it works safe locked so
very<00:03:41.480> neat<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.530> liked<00:03:42.920> it<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> lot<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.989> I

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
very neat I liked it a lot and I

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.490 
very neat I liked it a lot and I
probably<00:03:45.470> won't<00:03:45.980> be<00:03:46.280> taking<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:46.910> apart

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
probably won't be taking this apart

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.900 
probably won't be taking this apart
anytime<00:03:48.500> soon<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.750> might<00:03:51.500> give<00:03:52.070> an<00:03:52.310> inside

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
anytime soon so I might give an inside

pennies you can say so I'll just put
those<00:05:09.370> in<00:05:09.430> there<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:13.570> drawer<00:05:13.900> in<00:05:15.630> mess<00:05:16.630> up<00:05:16.900> the

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
those in there the drawer in mess up the

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.290 
those in there the drawer in mess up the
combination<00:05:17.890> and<00:05:18.750> once<00:05:19.750> again<00:05:20.310> my<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.940> is

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
combination and once again my it is

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.990 
combination and once again my it is
locked<00:05:23.370> so<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:24.930> is<00:05:26.340> basically<00:05:27.340> my<00:05:27.490> third

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
locked so that is basically my third

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.640 
locked so that is basically my third
combination<00:05:28.870> see<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:30.550> size<00:05:30.850> of<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:32.100> again

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
combination see and the size of it again

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.650 
combination see and the size of it again
it's<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.980> size<00:05:36.250> that<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.640> use<00:05:36.910> for<00:05:37.210> most<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.630> my

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
it's the size that I use for most of my

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.340 
it's the size that I use for most of my
safes

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
safes

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.280 
safes
I<00:05:39.300> believe<00:05:40.300> it's<00:05:40.480> 16<00:05:40.930> by<00:05:41.080> 16<00:05:42.030> yeah<00:05:43.030> so<00:05:43.390> 16<00:05:44.050> by<00:05:44.230> 16

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
I believe it's 16 by 16 yeah so 16 by 16

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
I believe it's 16 by 16 yeah so 16 by 16
base<00:05:44.920> and<00:05:47.940> that's<00:05:48.940> it
