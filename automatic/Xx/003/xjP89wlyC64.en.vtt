deck tech right after mine so taking a

deck tech right after mine so taking a
look<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> deck<00:00:33.750> we'll<00:00:33.960> start<00:00:34.140> off<00:00:34.230> with

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
look at the deck we'll start off with

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.630 
look at the deck we'll start off with
the<00:00:34.440> creature<00:00:34.710> since<00:00:35.100> those<00:00:35.280> are<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> most

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the creature since those are the most

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.370 
the creature since those are the most
important<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.090> think<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.809> affinity<00:00:37.079> deck

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
important I think for this affinity deck

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.760 
important I think for this affinity deck
we<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.100> 80<00:00:38.670> drop<00:00:38.910> creatures<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.440> 4<00:00:40.680> on

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
we have 80 drop creatures we have 4 on

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.139 
we have 80 drop creatures we have 4 on
the<00:00:40.800> top<00:00:41.010> tears<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.520> mem<00:00:41.670> nights<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the top tears and for mem nights and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
the top tears and for mem nights and
what<00:00:42.360> these<00:00:42.600> creatures<00:00:42.870> allow<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
what these creatures allow you to do is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.510 
what these creatures allow you to do is
to<00:00:44.820> turn<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.420> stuff<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.200> mox<00:00:46.620> opal<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.309> that

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
to turn on stuff like mox opal so that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.910 
to turn on stuff like mox opal so that
it<00:00:47.670> activates<00:00:48.300> more<00:00:48.660> quickly<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:49.530> well<00:00:49.770> as

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it activates more quickly as well as

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.650 
it activates more quickly as well as
edge<00:00:50.100> champions<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> has<00:00:51.270> protection

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
edge champions so that it has protection

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
edge champions so that it has protection
more<00:00:51.899> quickly<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:53.850> helps<00:00:54.149> produce<00:00:55.129> artifacts

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
more quickly it helps produce artifacts

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.860 
more quickly it helps produce artifacts
more<00:00:56.340> quickly<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.000> cranial<00:00:57.510> plating

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
more quickly so that cranial plating

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.020 
more quickly so that cranial plating
gets<00:00:58.079> bigger<00:00:58.379> stronger<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.140> much<00:01:01.140> faster

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
gets bigger stronger and much faster

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.090 
gets bigger stronger and much faster

we could place Shivan Reeves but there

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.870 
we could place Shivan Reeves but there
are<00:04:16.380> so<00:04:16.500> many<00:04:16.590> paths<00:04:16.859> exiles<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.549> format

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
are so many paths exiles in the format

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.000 
are so many paths exiles in the format
that<00:04:18.419> we<00:04:18.509> wanted<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.810> have<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.199> basic<00:04:19.529> or<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.799> be

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
that we wanted to have a basic or to be

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.949 
that we wanted to have a basic or to be
able<00:04:20.039> to<00:04:20.219> fetch<00:04:20.430> up<00:04:20.639> and<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.389> think<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.779> having

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
able to fetch up and I think that having

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.540 
able to fetch up and I think that having
one<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.289> each<00:04:22.380> basic<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.950> just

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
one of each basic is just

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.089 
one of each basic is just
good<00:04:23.669> enough<00:04:23.909> but<00:04:24.180> there<00:04:24.990> might<00:04:25.379> be<00:04:25.409> some

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
good enough but there might be some

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.559 
good enough but there might be some
argument<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.550> be<00:04:26.639> playing<00:04:26.909> shivan<00:04:27.240> reef<00:04:27.270> and

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:27.569 
argument to be playing shivan reef and

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:29.059 
argument to be playing shivan reef and
just<00:04:27.720> like<00:04:27.810> no<00:04:27.990> basics<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.620> not<00:04:28.740> care<00:04:28.949> about

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
just like no basics and not care about

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.399 
just like no basics and not care about
path<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.430> exile<00:04:29.490> but<00:04:30.000> whatever<00:04:30.990> your<00:04:31.110> opponent

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409
