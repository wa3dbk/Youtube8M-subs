00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello from Sister the welcome back who 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.890
 on my channels I am as rich as al 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.049
 usual 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.309
 today we are going to see anammox areas 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.580
 probably this will be the second one 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.450
 boxing of the day another game for 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.100
 ps life 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 released very recently as usual 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.340
 you have lost your sight, certain clanks 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.160
 trilogy indeed the recent click in clank 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.660
 trilogy output on playstation 3 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.730
 now the dawn of time ago reported 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.590
 now it seems I am informed assembles 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.190
 really better than his 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.160
 home party its counterpart 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.840
 on playstation 3 it really seems to be 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.739
 made to have been made in a manner 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.629
 best 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.239
 we hope that since three years 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.989
 in short, more or less, I would say that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.230
 is the minimum but I repeat is what I have 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.640
 read around by other users we hope 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.129
 let's read behind two heroes 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.090
 brave in three epic adventures 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.379
 take a journey through time for 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.539
 return to the beginning of the saga 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.729
 intergalactic is accepted in clank e 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.890
 defeat the classic enemies in the first ones 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.920
 three very successful missions for 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.170
 save the universe supplies tidiani 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.729
 Gadget Fights Evil Enemies Scans 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.430
 strange planets was 100 and clank 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.619
 recent in clank 2 and race the black iii 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.880
 so it obviously contains if not a 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.750
 trilogy all three chapters chapters left 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.549
 individually 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.770
 I hadn't played them this heart 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.729
 will be an excellent opportunity to do so 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:39.930
 player we see a space player 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:42.659
 minimum required to focus 6 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.860
 mega then very little touchscreen e 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.610
 rear touchpad 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.299
 let's see if it will really be like this we go 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.790
 to open a fast unbox because i 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.470
 guys so much in here i'm skeptical 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.469
 I don't think there will be much was right for 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.469
 let you see a bit of a word in between 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:06.180
 get an overview of the game get him 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.740
 know that it came out in fact I opened 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.520
 to see as usual that there is not 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.390
 if she were caught how far away from my mother 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.370
 Roman 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.680
 I must contain it all because it is coming out 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.080
 from all points all the sides ok 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.760
 useless sarcasm aside we have the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.780
 cartridge and nothing more then I would say of 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.720
 don't delay any longer 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.660
 let's see if we ca n't see we have 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.000
 understood that at least one thing 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.590
 positive is that you apologize as usual i 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.420
 reflections a positive thing is that i 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.120
 games are all contained in 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.140
 cartridge I hope theoretically seen that 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.200
 I have not spotted no code 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.440
 I suppose we are all content 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.970
 in the cartridge something very pleasing to me 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.030
 not like sly trilogy than the last one 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.380
 you have to download it and sincerely 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.700
 in short, he left me a little bitter 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.530
 okay mouth that was not there though 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.130
 there probably won't be 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.320
 in short, he wouldn't expect me to 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.110
 have everything on the support instead 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.840
 download having a bit of da lo field 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.450
 I see good guys for this fast 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.820
 a boxing and everything is no longer intense from 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.620
 show you I remind you of what arms 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.209
 think of it with a comment left out 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.329
 I like them like I always like a 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.340
 depending on how much you enjoyed the video 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.820
 and we'll see you at the next hello video 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.820
