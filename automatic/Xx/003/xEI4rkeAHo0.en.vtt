don't release the game plus the scoring
system<00:02:10.119> just<00:02:10.539> made<00:02:10.690> no<00:02:10.869> sense<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.560> think<00:02:11.650> it

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
system just made no sense I think it

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.380 
system just made no sense I think it
gives<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.370> points<00:02:12.520> on<00:02:12.730> how<00:02:12.879> much<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.180> likes

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390

gives you points on how much it likes
your<00:02:13.599> answer<00:02:13.930> good<00:02:14.200> or<00:02:14.349> bad<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.190> seems

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
your answer good or bad and that seems

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.970 
your answer good or bad and that seems
so<00:02:15.640> arbitrary<00:02:15.879> why<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.840> one<00:02:17.349> answer<00:02:17.590> better

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
so arbitrary why is one answer better

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.860 
so arbitrary why is one answer better
than<00:02:18.250> another<00:02:18.520> how<00:02:19.030> could<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.300> really<00:02:19.480> judge

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
than another how could you really judge

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
than another how could you really judge
a<00:02:19.900> truthful<00:02:20.500> answer

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890

I<00:02:21.099> think<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.459> publishers<00:02:21.910> even<00:02:22.030> knew<00:02:22.360> they

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
I think the publishers even knew they

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.240 
I think the publishers even knew they
were<00:02:22.599> making<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:23.020> bad<00:02:23.230> game<00:02:23.500> because<00:02:24.160> they

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
were making a bad game because they

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.860 
were making a bad game because they
didn't<00:02:24.489> expand<00:02:24.849> on<00:02:24.969> the<00:02:25.060> party<00:02:25.390> mode<00:02:25.540> at<00:02:25.719> all

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
didn't expand on the party mode at all

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.199 
didn't expand on the party mode at all
it's<00:02:26.349> played<00:02:26.620> out<00:02:26.650> like<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:26.980> computer<00:02:27.969> asks

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
it's played out like this computer asks

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.240 
it's played out like this computer asks
a<00:02:28.239> question<00:02:28.629> we<00:02:29.079> see<00:02:29.260> if<00:02:29.349> it's<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.560> lie

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
a question we see if it's a lie

title is in the hotseat mode and it's a

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.080 
title is in the hotseat mode and it's a
very<00:02:59.200> simple<00:02:59.470> mode<00:02:59.800> you<00:03:00.160> ask<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.459> question<00:03:00.910> and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
very simple mode you ask a question and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.280 
very simple mode you ask a question and
then<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.480> game<00:03:01.630> will<00:03:01.750> read<00:03:01.930> your<00:03:02.080> voice

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
then the game will read your voice

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.080 
then the game will read your voice
presumably<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.280> will<00:03:03.489> tell<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.790> if<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.000> a
