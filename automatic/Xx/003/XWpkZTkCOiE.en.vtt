getting pretty real on this one because

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.330 
getting pretty real on this one because
he<00:04:29.720> even<00:04:30.020> spits<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.380> bit<00:04:30.560> about<00:04:30.919> some<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
he even spits a bit about some of the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.370 
he even spits a bit about some of the
stuff<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.610> he<00:04:31.910> went<00:04:32.090> through<00:04:32.210> as<00:04:32.630> he<00:04:33.110> tried

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
stuff that he went through as he tried

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.310 
stuff that he went through as he tried
to<00:04:33.410> find<00:04:33.800> himself<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.490> become<00:04:34.820> who<00:04:35.000> he<00:04:35.150> is<00:04:35.320> so

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
to find himself and become who he is so

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.140 
to find himself and become who he is so
this<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.710> pretty<00:04:36.980> cool<00:04:37.250> album<00:04:37.580> that<00:04:38.120> I

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
this is a pretty cool album that I

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.360 
this is a pretty cool album that I
expect<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.750> get<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.930> lot<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.470> praise<00:04:39.710> because<00:04:40.220> of

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
expect to get a lot of praise because of

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.030 
expect to get a lot of praise because of
the<00:04:40.460> experimentation<00:04:41.270> with<00:04:41.870> rock<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.500> sultry

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
the experimentation with rock and sultry

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.670 
the experimentation with rock and sultry
R&amp;B<00:04:43.220> but<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.210> also<00:04:44.450> think<00:04:44.870> that<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.200> rakesh

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
R&amp;B but I also think that the rakesh

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.800 
R&amp;B but I also think that the rakesh
miss<00:04:45.919> will<00:04:46.340> turn<00:04:46.580> off<00:04:46.820> those<00:04:47.060> who<00:04:47.389> are<00:04:47.480> looking

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
miss will turn off those who are looking

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.110 
miss will turn off those who are looking
for<00:04:48.020> some<00:04:48.200> smooth<00:04:48.590> grooves<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:49.400> mellow<00:04:49.669> jams

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
for some smooth grooves and mellow jams

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.850 
for some smooth grooves and mellow jams
because<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:50.780> album<00:04:51.020> does<00:04:51.320> have<00:04:51.530> some<00:04:51.770> of

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
because this album does have some of

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.440 
because this album does have some of
that<00:04:51.889> but<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.490> doesn't<00:04:52.790> have<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.940> whole<00:04:53.150> lot<00:04:53.419> of

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
that but it doesn't have a whole lot of

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.480 
that but it doesn't have a whole lot of
it<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:54.080> does<00:04:54.260> get<00:04:54.470> pretty<00:04:54.530> dark<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.250> grimy

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
it and it does get pretty dark and grimy

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.090 
it and it does get pretty dark and grimy
at<00:04:55.790> times<00:04:56.090> like<00:04:56.570> I<00:04:56.690> said<00:04:56.930> earlier<00:04:57.320> still

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
at times like I said earlier still

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.210 
at times like I said earlier still
Miguel<00:04:59.000> really<00:04:59.300> has<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.660> nice<00:05:00.169> voice<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.889> I

he's<00:05:09.290> pushing<00:05:09.740> boundaries<00:05:10.130> and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
he's pushing boundaries and

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.640 
he's pushing boundaries and
experimenting<00:05:11.270> instead<00:05:11.960> of<00:05:12.080> pigeonholing

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
experimenting instead of pigeonholing

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.650 
experimenting instead of pigeonholing
himself<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:13.310> making<00:05:13.790> the<00:05:13.910> same<00:05:14.240> type<00:05:14.510> of

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
himself and making the same type of

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.440 
himself and making the same type of
music<00:05:14.990> over<00:05:15.560> and<00:05:15.740> over<00:05:16.040> and<00:05:16.160> over<00:05:16.550> but<00:05:17.210> that's

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
music over and over and over but that's

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.360 
music over and over and over but that's
just<00:05:17.720> what<00:05:17.840> I<00:05:17.870> thought<00:05:18.139> about<00:05:18.290> it<00:05:18.680> as<00:05:18.740> usual

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
just what I thought about it as usual

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.280
