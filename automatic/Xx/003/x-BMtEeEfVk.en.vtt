 the side subscribers 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.130
 okay with you here who speaks is the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.110
 magnifying glass and in today's video is one more 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.309
 episode of our status series 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.560
 conditions right 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 where have we talked about ban already talked 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.699
 today paralysis we talk about pokémons 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.160
 Sunday, I'm going to put aside the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.710
 links for you to watch all 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.990
 explanation videos I'm fine now 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.210
 talking about statue of alterations of 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.340
 primary statutes are those 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.950
 what you do is when you finish a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.719
 battle in story mode and is 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.110
 interned on paralyzed pokémon sunday 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.719
 continues with this status of 70 another 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.870
 because you will not continue to 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.910
 Analyzing beautiful has even something in the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.559
 battle for him something out of the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.449
 battle for him as a pokémon center 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.120
 a wire 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.160
 Now I'm going to talk about confusion to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.859
 a little different confusion to do is 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.800
 not having noticed that it is volatile 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.110
 confusion is volatile what is this 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.979
 Let's feel the Pokémon in battle. 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.200
 He puts another place and loses his 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.110
 a state of confusion even happens with 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.180
 a battle ends but anyway 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.369
 even with pokémon losing the confusion 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.240
 were very well out of the battle as he 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.650
 back dared to suite or the workout he goes 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.180
 lose the state of confusion and will 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.250
 get hold of 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.100
 anyway the confusion is very good 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.780
 because time because confusion has 50% of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.439
 chances and could lose their own 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.650
 turn and in addition if you beat the pokémon 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.720
 sympathy with the attack that has 40 goods 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.400
 power and there is no ethic 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.710
 ie a little do not have much 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.829
 attack and little defense he will give himself 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.200
 much damage when it hit right 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:54.899
 moreover, the conclusion is better than 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.040
 paralysis in this sense because it is paradise 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.840
 has a 25% chance 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.610
 cause the Pokémon paralyzed in 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.550
 attack that round right 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.860
 while the mess is not 50 per cent 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.630
 double chance we can lose round 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.840
 so it's very appealing to a little 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.570
 paralysis and confusion over time for two 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.400
 reasons first because the confusion she 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.700
 lasts between one and four shifts but 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.640
 important only count turn when pokémon 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.160
 attack, or if for some reason and not 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.890
 attack as long as you have Sunday 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.540
 attacked no will not spend time 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.820
 to the confusion 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.490
 that is if for any reason the pokémon 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.980
 attack if he has a client if he 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.020
 you are sleeping if you have been paralyzed 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.560
 lose round anything you do 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.170
 he does not attack does not pass the time to 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.890
 conclusion, ie you can not end 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.450
 56 shifts confused because he did not 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.480
 managed to attack for some other reason 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.360
 so it also makes confusion to be 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.810
 stronger in the competitive ends not 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.540
 being so called precisely because 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.930
 anything cures confusion right then and there 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.940
 it is not as well used is the right 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.970
 South is money I'm going to make another video 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.500
 still explaining why they handle them 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.720
 was toilet and even when I made a 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.700
 talking channel video about this is gum 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.340
 a lot of people want to use people 's ego 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.709
 already spoke of father but the Swede is still 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.360
 week can help make a video 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.100
 explaining about this is great for who 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.930
 still did not understand but it was gum 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.030
 to summarize an attack that causes 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.130
 that anyone who takes the vega increases 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.370
 your attack and gets confused at the same 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.560
 time a very strong thing but then 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.900
 crowd that was what I had to say 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.940
 about confusion is that the status of 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.519
 city ​​determines when Pokemon 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.180
 battle that can be healed one ran away 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.040
 can be cured with wool 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.939
 so if you're too scared to go up 1 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.519
 and put fire on him and they paralyze 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.650
 This you think will work a lot 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.359
 year combat place a lamborghini in the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.209
 your pokémon it will be cured if 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.819
 subscribe to the mdb legend 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.590
 the person was this, do not forget daun 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.060
 joinha this video favorite characters 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.260
 always back on the channel 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.260
