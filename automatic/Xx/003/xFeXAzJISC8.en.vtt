00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello to all of you guys and here we are today with 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.609
 a new of tallinn gang tactics in 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.680
 this video we're going to see which ones 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.110
 will be the shotguns present in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.360
 black ops 2 and then through 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.040
 some excerpts of gameplay we will go to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.650
 see what their abilities are and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.570
 what role can they play in the future 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.609
 call of duty due out in November but 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.119
 we immediately begin the first rifle a 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.010
 pump we're going to see is 1216 m it 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.930
 he had made his very first appearance 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 in the official black ops 2 trailer 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.430
 as you see now but logically from one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.750
 so small gameplay excerpt is 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.860
 we can't make ourselves king 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.940
 actually an idea of ​​his 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.440
 potentiality 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.079
 while from this clip a little longer 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 instead we can do a minimum of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.680
 we are beginning to understand a little more 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.539
 how this pump shotgun works 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.760
 first we can see that a 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.170
 automatic rifle at least for teams 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.610
 lower right is written auto then 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.260
 it means that inter and should 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.789
 get closer to 12 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.219
 in reality it is not quite so picasso 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.050
 as you can see now it can only be occupied 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.899
 four strokes per face then it will be 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.320
 necessary to stop for a fraction of 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.710
 according to I can not reverse which are 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.090
 some kind of semi loader 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.010
 which, however, is not very well understood in 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.260
 other parts should use 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.110
 therefore technologies of the future are not 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.330
 explainable so perfectly and nothing 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.740
 then we notice the big magazine 24 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.360
 shots are really really many 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.380
 although most likely they are given 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.939
 from the use of increased loaders but 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.310
 let's move on to the next one 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.990
 pump shotgun and the sanga 12 of this 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.909
 gun knows very little since the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 gameplay has managed to find and a lot 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.509
 very little information that is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.400
 they can make are these and a rifle 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.470
 semi - automatic with a charger of ten 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.960
 strokes but could be brought to 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.299
 15 with increased magazine and from which yes 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.530
 may also find that for the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.030
 shotgun available 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.649
 to the quickdraw accessory this 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.020
 accessory will serve for me to be able to aim 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.790
 faster but obviously usefulness 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.590
 that will have on the bike I think the pump will be 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.299
 very much reduced 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.899
 the third and last shotgun that is 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.369
 lr 870 mcs has been discovered so far 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.110
 this, instead, is the rifle you have 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.020
 longer gameplay because it was 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.149
 used by one of the pro players 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.160
 players that were protagonists at 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.460
 gamescon 2012 of live streaming 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.870
 official 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.970
 I must say that from the very first moments 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.510
 where I saw use this gun 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.700
 by pump 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.420
 no really left really 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.130
 impressed because it seemed to me 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.650
 formidable it really seemed I don't know 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.960
 I don't know if a fact I am is due 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.790
 very good the players here who have it 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.830
 used or simply because 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.950
 you haven't seen it since 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.330
 used in matches the year therefore the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.950
 local connection 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.450
 however, he really did 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.220
 a great impression on those 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.450
 information that you got that 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.700
 also a shotgun 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.010
 semi - automatic with a loader of eight 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.250
 shots reach 12 with magazine 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.630
 increased and in short we have also seen 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.180
 the use of these shotguns with 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.380
 the laser sight accessory 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.200
 that accessory if you don't remember is 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.790
 an accessory that will allow you to 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.870
 increase your accuracy when you 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.020
 shoot without aiming 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.390
 but before ending with this video 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.750
 there were still a couple of things 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.650
 that I wanted to tell you then first 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.500
 from the image you are seeing here at 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.570
 video can be seen precisely rifle a 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.280
 pump with three accessories this is one 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.100
 of the predefined classes that will be 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.930
 available almost immediately 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.180
 in these accessories we see a new one 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.460
 accessory that had never been seen for 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.650
 the least that I had not pointed out in 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.660
 video point on the accessories I had 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.460
 done on black ops 2 since they were those 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.160
 of the assault rifles 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.700
 this accessory is long burrell the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.100
 Lombard should replace the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.200
 capacity that you represent 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.540
 modern warfare 3 which means that 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.100
 thanks to the wild card that allows us to 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.200
 emit cloth accessories on your own 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.270
 tide I could have a gun a 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.430
 pump with these characteristics 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.110
 so with the ng burrell it will have more 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.660
 scope of normal and already this is 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.640
 great then with the laser sight we will have 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.560
 more precision when shooting without 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.000
 bet and you know when you use it 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.570
 a shotgun is almost impossible 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.370
 never tip 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.620
 already only these two accessories makes it 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.090
 a really formidable extra weapon 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.670
 we will have a third party at our disposal 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.410
 accessory perhaps to increase the strokes 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.340
 increase the number of known strokes la 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.120
 our disposition or perhaps for 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.470
 recharge faster then 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.540
 we will use fast mag 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.419
 are these three accessories selling the 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.960
 shotgun proceeds black ops 2 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.520
 a weapon that does not 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.680
 will probably be underestimated 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.270
 it will have much more importance and this 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.310
 makes me very happy not so much because 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.440
 they are a particular gun lover 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.449
 pump but because the thing that is me 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.490
 always liked a lot of call of duty e 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.800
 variability and if there is the possibility 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.360
 to play competitively with 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.710
 many different classes means that 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.270
 then I think there is even more 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.889
 fun and so this is a 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.130
 symptom of an excellent call of duty 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.880
 then if we really want to stand by and watch 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.039
 the hair in the egg 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.110
 we have admitted at this time 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.090
 all accessories we already have a rifle a 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.759
 pump that we all still have excellent 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.289
 because available and if we go to 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.610
 maybe take advantage of all because there 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.770
 maybe they allow you to run more 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.880
 quickly to peel more weapons 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.490
 quickly 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.470
 or to run longer 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.270
 well that means we would have then 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.820
 place a behrami class from 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.530
 rusher really really terrific e 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.380
 here you can go and do 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.340
 conjecture you can go to think not 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.650
 I really think big I think 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.819
 on this basis most likely black 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.530
 hole studio can really be 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.880
 really a great game though 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.280
 obviously I don't want to go overboard 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.770
 too early because we should anyway 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.840
 to see what we are in November 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.370
 will wait well guys this video is 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.810
 practically finished I invite you to 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.699
 like it if you liked the 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.889
 video content and if you want to see 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.650
 other videos on the weapons of black ops e 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.909
 if you want generate instead see others 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.330
 videos on black ops that you don't have yet 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.669
 seen 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.469
 you don't have to do anything but click 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.669
 in the image above left video 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:57.210
 the next appointment 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.210
 Hello
