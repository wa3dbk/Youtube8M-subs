00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.389
 let's just change the balloon and the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.839
 true colors and the monkey is here and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.430
 an apology for not uploading videos before 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.289

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.600
 coupling to new sites but now 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.660

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.429
 stay to see how it is done 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.230
 we are going to need paper in this case I 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.430
 I have Chinese paper 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.770
 coffee and black we will also occupy this 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.070
 Well, I'm going to put this paper that is 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.770
 metallic we are going to occupy the bar 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820
 I have this one that is special to do 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.410
 bows 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.620
 these are the tones that I am going to occupy 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.840
 a metallic balloon and good if you no longer 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.550
 you have inflated because you do not need a 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.670
 pump but if not a pump to inflate 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.190
 the sticks that are like for those who 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.519
 with which the four flags are pasted 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.860
 of the biggest you find a 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.310
 guacal is called this way this box that we 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.040
 will serve as a base scissors or something with 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.270
 to paste we are going to also occupy 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.670
 supposed silicone and a bear I have 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.710
 This is optional if you do not want to 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.920
 it is forced 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.920
 and a balloon of those that inflate 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.900
 metallic ones , preferably one that says 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.780
 something like graduation I did not find 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.080
 that's why I brought these two I'm going to occupy the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.550
 golden and then as I did not find I'm going to 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.200
 paste a remove me like these deformed 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.110
 we will start decorating in the part of 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.550
 down I'm going to set the bar here 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:52.420
 around around the three strips 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.300
 ok I have already lined the box so I stay and 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.039
 Now we are going to line the sticks of this 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.950
 shape I have put the two strips 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:05.710
 ok here I 've just stuck a little bit of 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.310
 ribbon on the two ends of the stick and 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.970
 Once I have it, I'm going to paste a 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.220
 little ribbon 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.240
 now I just have to go rolling 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.330
 all the stick with the ribbon so up 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.840
 that has all the stick and only on top 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.200
 with the same dynamic it puts a little bit of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.740
 curly golden in this case and there will be 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.120
 stayed and then I'm going to have to paste 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:38.319
 You are in the box that is the base 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.519
 with enough silicone 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.370
 ok here and now and I decorated my balloon will 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.120
 I put the doll that told them I already have 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.849
 like my base is decorated and now what 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.030
 next thing we 'll do then it's going to be 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:59.469
 place our balloon in this way and 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.829
 here with the sticks we are going to stick it and 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:05.969
 here we will put some bows and some 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.980
 lath dating hanging ok here I cut 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:14.750
 boxes of paper in each sheet by 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:18.230
 example I have 88 pieces of paper nothing more 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:24.010
 Now what we will do is to fold 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.010
 our paper this way in half 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.409
 then we are going to double it back here to 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.040
 half but here we will put a little 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:37.209
 of glue to be fixed and 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.209
 we will do the same with the other 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.019
 here 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:51.240
 and we put some glue in half 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:54.350
 Now what we will do is fold it here 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.860
 Halfway like this 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.860
 here 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.010
 and that's where we'll put glue 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.379
 and we're going to stick it in our box for 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.379
 example here I'm going to stick it 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.710
 and the next one I'll also put in 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.710
 this part 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.350
 it does not matter that it wrinkles 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.550
 and then he's going to take this form and 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.310
 so we will fill all around the edge 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.790
 ok has finished decorating already with paper and 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.730
 enough paper the middle part 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.550
 it is still hollow because there I am going to put 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.289
 the teddy bear now so you can not see it here 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.050
 empty placed paper inside 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.919
 black paper so you do not see this 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.129
 hollow way down there and now I 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.169
 place the teddy in this way now in 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:05.339
 the part of here in front of me I'm going to 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:08.249
 put a bow here and up here where 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:10.229
 I have the balloon stuck here here we have 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:12.139
 wear bows and they 're going to have a bit of 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.319
 curly hanging 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.939
 to do the back or of 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.819
 forward where the bows hang 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.979
 I have cut a bit of the ribbon and what 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.020
 I've folded in half, then I'm going 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.060
 Also put a curly bandage because 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.460
 I'm just going to take one of mine and I'm going to 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.169
 put some ribbon 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.210
 then I'm going to put it to paste it here and what 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.650
 next thing I 'll do is going to be cutting the 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.650
 ribbons in four parts 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.650
 and then I'll make some little steps with these 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.990
 tapes that are going to be hanging we will do 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.140
 the same and then we will place Carlos 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.970

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.270
 Carme a little so they can see it 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.950
