00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:10.400
 Hello everyone today in recycling orbits 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 creative I'm going to make this video for 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.419
 use simple jars of 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.480
 jam you told me you won't notice 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:22.170
 because the rules evaluate however it came 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.370
 an idea to be able to use them 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.530
 to decorate my room then how 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.099
 first thing since this body this 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:36.420
 jar to the frame think cover 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:41.420
 I'm going to cover the border with this one 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.790
 time is that an adhesive tape you see 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:51.680
 there is this part is removed and it is adhesive 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:54.030
 and this is precisely called walsh tape 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.070
 that is precisely it serves to go to 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.790
 decorate the various objects but I will make you a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.790
 video on purpose to see how you can 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.470
 use and now I'm going to get it I go to 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:12.299
 take I go to place it on the whole 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.650
 border of my jar then here 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.920
 then you see I put this in fact 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.890
 tape to cover the edge of the bar 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.780
 of the jar 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.000
 obviously this video and to give one 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.950
 cue to go and decorate the jars 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.740
 obviously you can decorate them as more 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.130
 I like to take this is a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 light blue colored sand 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 this is a scented sand this the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:48.270
 perfume of talc and I paid this 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 pack of 350 grams 99 cents a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:56.939
 maurice a store that is in 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.369
 close and I go to put the saviolina 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.630
 let's say it's about halfway through 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.780
 jar then once committed the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 saviolina on the sides of the jar 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.020
 inside of 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.430
 I'm going to put some shells that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.090
 I picked up yesterday just to put everyone 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.930
 around and then yours that he hired 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.630
 put my shells in the middle not 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.550
 admit a candle that has just 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.640
 coated with the same ours of the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.890
 color of the bordeaux of the jar 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.250
 this point once must be 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.520
 I continue to go and put mine 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.610
 taper 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:44.880
 inside is a first jar is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:49.100
 ready for the second jar from 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.110
 decorating I'm going to use these 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.260
 circles that I made with the help 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.230
 of the tissue paper I had purchased 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.080
 for some chores for school I have you 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.700
 chose Asti green colors though 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.450
 you can choose the color that most 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.070
 favorite 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.340
 then to go attack these 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.630
 circles we will need the glue 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.489
 spray 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:21.510
 this thing is very very good because it is 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.120
 a glue or removable so if for 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.860
 example we don't like the layout 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.100
 of the object we have attached 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.850
 we can remove it without any 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.930
 problem 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.560
 this spray glue allows you to glue 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.390
 many surfaces without exporting or e 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:46.440
 without direct now I go to the tour a 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:51.060
 moment my glue package itself 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:54.120
 so I go and spray it on the side 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.400
 of the jar then I wait 23 seconds e 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.400
 then they talk attacking my circles 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.230
 today 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.420
 this point once we have 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:24.730
 covered all learned with i 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.830
 circle with the help of spray glue 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.460
 in fact we are going to take ours again 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:35.420
 glue and let's go back to putting it back 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.000
 above don't worry if you notice some 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.550
 holes that have been covered 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.430
 because then inside the jar 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.460
 a candle will be put and then when 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.470
 will be lit by the light that precisely 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.710
 produces the spark plug from the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.330
 little holes I wanted to also say that if you do not 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.300
 you want to use a circular shape 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.850
 to cover the barter you can 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.150
 use any reform that that more 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:06.920
 you like best present now I go to 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:10.600
 spray to the astute meltdown over 74 years 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.600
 born of the jar 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.080
 at this point I let it dry in by a 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.470
 jar 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:30.160
 here our jar is ready 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:34.490
 now I'm going to put the henin inside 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:39.140
 third jar I will use 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:42.460
 just a jar and this is not 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:46.760
 this trimming is very beautiful 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.920
 pink with this beautiful decoration this 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.700
 my mom bought at the market and has it 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:58.550
 paid one euro per meter and then one 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:00.920
 candelina and finally the pink sabrina and then 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.900
 to go and attach the pasta 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.820
 I will go to 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:12.110
 use the hot glue here 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:18.900
 with the round hot now I go to 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:23.360
 nevada puts in a whirlwind of work to 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.360
 stick on the jar 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:38.310
 here it is now I do not admit know 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:40.910
 perina and finally the candle here now 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.910
 candle 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.000
 here is that three candle holders are 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:55.530
 ready now I'm going to light the candles 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:59.780
 what a winter rambler and with mine here 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:03.000
 three wear well are ready 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:06.060
 I think it's a simple and pretty idea 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.870
 fast enough to prepare and david 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:14.520
 she was also very very pretty to be able to 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:17.580
 give now I'm going to get them 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.590
 to arrange in my bedroom why 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.260
 I like them a lot 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:26.190
 I hope it is precisely these ideas that you 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:29.820
 I gave x to go and recycle gods 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:34.190
 vik jars liked it and nothing 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.190
 hello everyone and the next video
