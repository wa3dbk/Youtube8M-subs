quit<00:00:05.250> sugar<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.879> today<00:00:06.089> we're<00:00:06.270> talking<00:00:06.390> about

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
quit sugar and today we're talking about

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.589 
quit sugar and today we're talking about
how<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.379> quit<00:00:07.740> sugar<00:00:07.919> very<00:00:08.490> apropos<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.360> first

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
how to quit sugar very apropos so first

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.990 
how to quit sugar very apropos so first
of<00:00:09.719> all<00:00:09.809> why<00:00:10.110> should<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:11.070> aim<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.550> quit<00:00:11.790> sugar

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
of all why should we aim to quit sugar

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.270 
of all why should we aim to quit sugar
or<00:00:12.240> at<00:00:12.360> least<00:00:12.540> reduced<00:00:12.960> sugar<00:00:13.170> well<00:00:13.889> look<00:00:14.040> this

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
or at least reduced sugar well look this

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.189 
or at least reduced sugar well look this
a<00:00:14.490> whole<00:00:14.759> range<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.210> reasons<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.960> think

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
a whole range of reasons and I think

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.500 
a whole range of reasons and I think
most<00:00:16.410> people<00:00:16.770> intuitively<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.640> understand

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
most people intuitively do understand

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.679 
most people intuitively do understand
that<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.699> rate<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.730> which<00:00:21.090> we've<00:00:21.270> been<00:00:21.420> eating

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
that the rate of which we've been eating

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.080 
that the rate of which we've been eating
sugar<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.199> pretty<00:00:23.010> much<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.189> same<00:00:23.580> rate<00:00:23.850> as

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
sugar is pretty much the same rate as

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.300 
sugar is pretty much the same rate as
the<00:00:24.210> increase<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.080> metabolic<00:00:25.350> diseases<00:00:25.920> so

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
the increase in metabolic diseases so

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.620 
the increase in metabolic diseases so
where<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.640> begin<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.150> how<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> learn

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
where do you begin and how do you learn

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.230 
where do you begin and how do you learn
okay<00:00:28.470> well<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.800> guess<00:00:28.980> there's<00:00:29.189> two<00:00:29.369> things<00:00:29.519> if

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
okay well I guess there's two things if

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.030 
okay well I guess there's two things if
you<00:00:30.510> want<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> navigate<00:00:31.050> your<00:00:31.410> way<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:32.009> a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
and you can see there's often in a small

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.250 
and you can see there's often in a small
container<00:02:39.530> six<00:02:40.159> teaspoons<00:02:40.609> of<00:02:41.090> added<00:02:41.299> sugar<00:02:41.629> I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.710 
container six teaspoons of added sugar I
mean<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.069> phenomenal<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.939> that<00:02:43.970> with

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
mean it's phenomenal and is that with

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.569 
mean it's phenomenal and is that with
yogurts<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.409> have<00:02:45.560> fruit<00:02:45.859> at<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.250> or<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.549> it

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
yogurts that have fruit at it or is it

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.179 
yogurts that have fruit at it or is it
also<00:02:46.970> in<00:02:47.180> plain<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.840> Van<00:02:47.989> often<00:02:48.379> in<00:02:48.530> plain<00:02:48.829> and

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
also in plain and Van often in plain and

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.970 
also in plain and Van often in plain and
vanilla<00:02:49.459> as<00:02:49.700> well<00:02:49.939> yep<00:02:50.359> absolutely<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.829> best

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
vanilla as well yep absolutely the best

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.159 
vanilla as well yep absolutely the best
idea<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.909> choose<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.180> full<00:02:53.599> fat<00:02:53.930> version

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
idea is to choose the full fat version

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.709 
idea is to choose the full fat version
and<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.010> reason<00:02:55.370> being<00:02:55.549> is<00:02:55.909> that<00:02:55.970> with<00:02:56.569> the

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:56.719 
and the reason being is that with the

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.000 
and the reason being is that with the
low-fat<00:02:57.669> food<00:02:58.669> industry<00:02:59.530> manufacturers<00:03:00.530> when

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
low-fat food industry manufacturers when

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.559 
low-fat food industry manufacturers when
they<00:03:01.099> take<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> fat<00:03:01.669> out<00:03:01.700> they<00:03:02.209> left<00:03:02.389> with

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
they take the fat out they left with

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:03.220 
they take the fat out they left with
something<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.900> doesn't<00:03:03.200> taste

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
something that doesn't taste

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.500 
something that doesn't taste
particularly<00:03:04.040> good<00:03:04.280> at<00:03:04.549> in<00:03:04.730> flames<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:05.359> they

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
particularly good at in flames so they

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.929 
particularly good at in flames so they
add<00:03:05.719> in<00:03:06.019> sugar<00:03:06.409> to<00:03:06.980> provide<00:03:07.280> not<00:03:07.519> only<00:03:07.549> the

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
add in sugar to provide not only the

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.059 
add in sugar to provide not only the
flavor<00:03:08.239> but<00:03:08.510> also<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.959> consistency<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.889> way

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
flavor but also the consistency the way

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.849 
flavor but also the consistency the way
that<00:03:10.280> we<00:03:10.370> metabolize<00:03:10.760> fat<00:03:11.389> and<00:03:11.689> fructose<00:03:12.560> is

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
that we metabolize fat and fructose is

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.039 
that we metabolize fat and fructose is
so<00:03:13.129> different<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.849> we<00:03:14.269> end<00:03:14.510> up<00:03:14.780> actually

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
so different that we end up actually

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.740 
so different that we end up actually
getting<00:03:15.459> fatter<00:03:16.459> on<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:17.150> low-fat<00:03:17.479> version

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
getting fatter on the low-fat version

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.479 
getting fatter on the low-fat version
you<00:03:18.229> know<00:03:18.349> for<00:03:18.530> people<00:03:18.620> who<00:03:18.859> love<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.250> beg
