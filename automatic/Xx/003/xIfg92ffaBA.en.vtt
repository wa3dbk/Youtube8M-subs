00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
because all of the sweetness from the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.230 
because all of the sweetness from the
fruit<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.130> comes<00:01:08.460> out<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:09.090> we're

slightly<00:01:09.659> cooking<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.130> need<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
slightly cooking it and I don't need to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.990 
slightly cooking it and I don't need to
add<00:01:11.790> any<00:01:12.090> added<00:01:12.540> sugars<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.610> I'm<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> add

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
add any added sugars so I'm going to add
