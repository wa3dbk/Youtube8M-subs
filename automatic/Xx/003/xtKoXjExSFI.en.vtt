the book before
he<00:02:13.950> was<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> library<00:02:14.490> card<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.120> thought

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
he was like a library card I thought

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.780 
he was like a library card I thought
that<00:02:15.360> was<00:02:15.450> pretty<00:02:15.540> funny<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:17.130> don't<00:02:17.490> there's<00:02:17.730> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
that was pretty funny I don't there's a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.980 
that was pretty funny I don't there's a
lot<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.060> jokes<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.390> there<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.660> was<00:02:18.750> actually

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
lot of jokes in there that was actually

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.280 
lot of jokes in there that was actually
funny<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.550> terms<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.720> movie<00:02:22.200> an

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
funny but in terms of like a movie an

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.430 
funny but in terms of like a movie an
actual<00:02:22.740> full-scale<00:02:23.430> movie<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.900> was<00:02:25.050> pretty

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
actual full-scale movie it was pretty

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.950 
actual full-scale movie it was pretty
bad<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.880> honest<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.270> best<00:02:27.480> part<00:02:27.780> of

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
bad and to be honest the best part of

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.450 
bad and to be honest the best part of
the<00:02:28.260> movie<00:02:28.500> was<00:02:28.650> when<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:28.920> were<00:02:29.010> out<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
the movie was when they were out of the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.490 
the movie was when they were out of the
water<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:30.000> think<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.570> was<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.960> best<00:02:31.140> part<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
water I think that was the best part of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.410 
water I think that was the best part of
the<00:02:31.590> entire<00:02:31.650> movie<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.160> think<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
the entire movie I think that the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.810 
the entire movie I think that the
majority<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.140> good<00:02:34.320> jokes<00:02:34.560> were<00:02:34.820> when

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
majority of the good jokes were when

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.900 
majority of the good jokes were when
they<00:02:35.940> were<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.210> of<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> water<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.910> you

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
they were out of the water and you

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.610 
they were out of the water and you
couldn't<00:02:39.180> tell<00:02:39.330> from<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.600> trailer<00:02:40.020> but<00:02:40.470> from

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
couldn't tell from the trailer but from

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.940 
couldn't tell from the trailer but from
the<00:02:40.710> trailer<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.340> made<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.850> seem<00:02:42.000> like<00:02:42.950> you

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the trailer it made it seem like you

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.830 
the trailer it made it seem like you
know<00:02:44.040> they're<00:02:44.880> they're<00:02:45.240> under<00:02:45.510> water<00:02:45.720> for

know they're they're under water for

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.080 
know they're they're under water for
like<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.470> don't<00:02:46.860> know<00:02:46.920> 20<00:02:47.550> minutes<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.970> then

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
like I don't know 20 minutes and then

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.430 
like I don't know 20 minutes and then

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
of deal but yeah to be honest I thought

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.030 
of deal but yeah to be honest I thought
they<00:03:11.100> did<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> 3d<00:03:11.670> really<00:03:11.940> well<00:03:12.350> but<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.770> don't

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
they did the 3d really well but I don't

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.040 
they did the 3d really well but I don't
just<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.430> plot<00:03:14.670> made<00:03:14.940> no<00:03:15.209> sense<00:03:15.630> whatsoever

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
just the plot made no sense whatsoever

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.810 
just the plot made no sense whatsoever
just<00:03:16.560> didn't<00:03:16.740> make<00:03:16.830> sense<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.250> didn't<00:03:17.459> get<00:03:17.670> it

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
just didn't make sense I didn't get it

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.660 
just didn't make sense I didn't get it
it's<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.420> was<00:03:19.019> trying<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.230> figure<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.560> out

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
it's just I was trying to figure it out

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.430 
it's just I was trying to figure it out
it's<00:03:20.670> like<00:03:20.820> they<00:03:21.450> took<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.690> bunch<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.110> random

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
it's like they took a bunch of random

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.250 
it's like they took a bunch of random
funny<00:03:23.370> things<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.180> kind<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.480> smashed<00:03:25.019> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
funny things and just kind of smashed it

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
that's the problem that was the problem

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.219 
that's the problem that was the problem
see<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:03.580> thought<00:05:03.940> Stephen<00:05:04.450> Hillenburg<00:05:04.690> the

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
see I thought Stephen Hillenburg the

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.260
