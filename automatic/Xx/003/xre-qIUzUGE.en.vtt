00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.519
 when uric acid levels in the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.220
 blood are elevated could be formed 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:11.190
 crystals in the joints and cause 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.440
 the condition known as drop levels 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.390
 high uric acid could also 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.030
 cause kidney stones and 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.130
 kidney failure later 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.890
 we will be discussing various remedies 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.609
 homemade to reduce uric acid in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.500
 the blood that is the acid uric acid 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.270
 uric acid is a chemical that is produced 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.550
 by decomposing the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.440
 purines chemical substances that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.929
 they find in some foods like 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.329
 anchovies the herring the liver and 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.889
 sardines it should be noted that some 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.280
 vegetables and dairy products 

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:46.710
 they also contain purines however 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.319
 Studies have shown that this type of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.359
 purines act differently and for 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:54.389
 therefore they do not increase the risk of 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.219
 develop drop acid normally 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.379
 uric acid is a common product that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.629
 recycles when cells die and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.269
 serves to help protect our 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.700
 blood vessels damage the kidneys 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.080
 they filter out most of the uric acid 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.870
 in the blood 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.390
 of the body through small urine 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.060
 amounts of uric acid also come out 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.490
 of the body in the stool however 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.040
 when the body produces too much 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.710
 Uric acid or kidneys do not eliminate it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.510
 effectively uric acid starts to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.670
 accumulate in the tendons the 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.390
 joints the kidneys and others 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.640
 organs the elevated levels of acid 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.610
 uric acid play an important role in 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.950
 development of gout however not 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.160
 all people with high levels 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.960
 of uric acid will develop gout 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.450
 some people also develop 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.850
 high blood pressure diseases 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.650
 heart or chronic kidney disease but 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 it is unknown if this is a cause 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.470
 direct or simply an early signal 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.170
 of these diseases that causes the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.660
 high levels of uric acid one level 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.150
 Elevated uric acid can be caused 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.920
 by obesity obesity drink a lot 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.440
 alcohol or take a diet high in 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.200
 purines may also be due to 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.330
 medicines diuretics medicines 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.650
 immunosuppressive chemotherapy or 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.720
 radiotherapy 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.930
 some health problems like the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.159
 hypothyroidism psoriasis 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.220
 Kidney failure can also 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.650
 provoke this condition home remedies 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.470
 to reduce uric acid levels 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.720
 in the blood the food plays a 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.359
 important role in acid control 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.459
 uric below we will talk about 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:38.579
 meals that should be included and meals 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.549
 that food should be avoided 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.650
 potassium- rich potassium can help 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.989
 to prevent the formation of crystals 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.319
 uric acid since it assists the kidneys 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.760
 in the elimination of this chemical 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.290
 foods with high potassium content 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.159
 include green leafy green bananas

 cherries cherries are a remedy 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.150
 popular for the drop since they have 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.840
 anti-inflammatory substances that help 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.030
 to reduce uric acid levels 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.250
 consume complex carbohydrates the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.139

 an adult contains between 600 and 1,000 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.730
 milligrams of purines the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.620
 nutritionists recommend that a 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.310
 person suffering from gout attacks 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.549
 limit the purine consumption to 100 150 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.239
 milligrams daily food with levels 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:52.080

 is known that fructose increases the 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.090
 uric acid usually drinks 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.790
 sweetened with corn syrup high in 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.130

 they are the highest source of fructose in the 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.350
 diet you should avoid these drinks and 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.190
 choose juices that are 100% instead 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.770
 fruit juice drink enough water already 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.110
 that we are talking about drinks the water 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.200
 it is an excellent option to control 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.210
 the levels of uric acid in the blood 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.370
 the water helps the kidneys eliminate 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.220
 the impurities of the body and the excess of 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.110
 uric acid a good amount for 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.110
 Take about three liters of water 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.370
 during the day other drinks 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.669
 recommended are skim milk and

 proteins are very popular to lose 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.770
 weight however can cause the 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.900
 person produces too much uric acid 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.090

 Exercise besides him 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.949
 weight too fast can also cause 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.710
 accumulate uric acid vinegar from 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:45.229
 apple to reduce uric acid the 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.289
 apple cider vinegar lovers ensure 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.449
 that can reduce uric acid to weigh 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.159
 that there is no scientific evidence 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.919
 to prove that apple cider vinegar 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.080
 can reduce uric acid many 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.330
 enthusiasts say that their content in 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.849
 potassium and acetic acid make it a 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.620
 good option for this purpose 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.659
 the standard recipe is to take two 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.150
 tablespoons of vinegar mixed with a 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.280
 glass of water twice a day
