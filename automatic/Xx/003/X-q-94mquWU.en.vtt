 test drive day we have to drive 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.859
 just over 500 kilometers to journalists 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.779
 leading automotive media 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.449
 information provided an opportunity to 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.279
 feel all the benefits of a car 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.500
 with increased overall cross 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.020
 Kazakhstan steppes for this very 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 the perfect place at all was the route 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.100
 designed in such a way that half 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 the paths of the crews passed on the highway 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.590
 the second half of the steppe trails in the morning 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.450
 September 24 divided into crews 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 completing the necessary documents 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.370
 familiarizing with the route and getting 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.219
 the car we hit the road star 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.010
 gave in the city of Almaty in front of 1200 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.329
 must finish 25 kilometers 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.039
 September in Astana 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.629
 driving part of the way we decided 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.150
 stay at one of the many 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.860
 lakes to test the car in 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.020
 easy off-road conditions 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.240
 wet salt and sand mixture under 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.400
 wheels mixed with cobblestones for 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.040
 cross version of lada kalina was 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.229
 quite a simple test twisting 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.509
 pyataks because of the dust in the car body we 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.090
 went on seeing another 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.240
 Congress decided to turn off the highway and ask 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.220
 car suspension new task 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 deep track combined with lifting and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.479
 descents and even at high speeds 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.820
 should expose weaknesses 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.400
 car however and here viburnum cross 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.250
 showed excellent results but ahead 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.950
 one more test route extreme 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.689
 maneuvering on a salt lake by getting 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.759
 a series of instructions from the instructor and 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.390
 having familiarized with the route we leave on 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.920
 track 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 the bottom of the dry salt lake 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.590
 is an insidious mixture of sand 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.229
 salt stones and hidden beneath it all 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.270
 grooves however tempted to push 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.009
 accelerator pedal to the floor significantly 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.310
 prevails over fear of losing 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.140
 management and we could not resist increased 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.810
 vehicle clearance modified 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.510
 shock absorbers and wheels 15 radius 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.550
 cable gearbox in tandem with 8 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.410
 valve engine does not succumb to 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.349
 any difficulties of the machine really 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.090
 not afraid of off-road but of course in 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.739
 reasonable limits ethical made 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 rather complicated long route for 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.930
 so that journalists can fully 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.879
 enjoy the car and fully 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.379
 understand his chances 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.180
 can not understand that goal but pursuing 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.500
 when creating this car it 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.349
 the ability to operate the car 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.200
 not only us portal coverings but also on 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.550
 rough terrain and the very self 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.830
 the concept of viburnum cross 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.160
 it suggests the possibility of boldly 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.379
 travel outside the city â€‹â€‹to the lake 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.900
 on the first day the race overcame the order 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.700
 500 kilometers to give the event 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.040
 national Kazakh color 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.319
 the organizers decided to have an overnight stay in 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.900
 yurt you camp on the picturesque shore 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.970
 the lakes of the balkhash crew stretched across 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.580
 route for several kilometers therefore 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.269
 in the camp drove up late at night and 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.340
 the next morning again on the road to 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.560
 then the owner then the run also began 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.209
 in the early morning however from the day before 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.730
 he is different in the first place 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.580
 the route today we have to drive 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.090
 about 700 kilometers and finish in 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.909
 Astana 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.920
 overnight the organizers prepared 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.379
 cars tank filled with batteries 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.330
 navigation devices are charged and it gives 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.900
 I have every right to be sure 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.390
 what this journey we will end without 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.970
 problems taking into account the fact 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.860
 that route today at 200 kilometers 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.319
 longer we try to do less 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.629
 stops however at the entrance to 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.480
 will we run into a traffic jam ahead 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.180
 about 7 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.650
 You are kilometers repair work remembering 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.290
 what our car is able to overcome 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.629
 easy off-road move out into the steppe and 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.549
 bypass the cork side really 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.340
 managed to set up a subscription this way 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.120
 that the car behaves beautifully on 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.760
 track and cross country and and 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.010
 caleb on holds the road well and slows down 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.410
 this month almost all journalist 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.870
 journalists said it was the best that 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.880
 general suspension of business-something to you 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.270
 finish runs center other cars 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.130
 also drove up with a large interval 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.199
 tired but satisfied pilots car 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.440
 and shared impressions and told 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:32.110
 about their adventures on the route at all 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.100
 super I really liked tired 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.500
 unity and want to wash and car 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.610
 cool especially the suspension was a car 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.400
 we are not let down anywhere 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.590
 everywhere drove everywhere just great 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.479
 the car must be taken all the way listened 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.460
 songs from my phone via bluetooth 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.500
 but it is even the simplest tape recorder 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.419
 This function is very good 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.580
 I liked the improvements that you 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.700
 did draws on became less to buzz 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.130
 This box is clearly visible and I still 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.470
 impressed 80 700 strong motor because 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.510
 that I was a little afraid but there was 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.370
 a lot of overtaking in the end straight 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.960
 a series of overtaking for overtaking and its quite 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.849
 it was enough despite the fact that we have a full 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.560
 trunk of all 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.240
 customize road roll man 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.060
 A sleeve is generally very large car and 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.560
 we have enough motor completely that is us 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.300
 head walk was not scary but me 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.729
 it was comfortable that I didn't 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.169
 experienced no 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.849
 no discomfort while driving 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.180
 because the road was basically 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.319
 in some places mildly not very good 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.729
 car like a car 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:36.129
 worthy and i think he will find 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.849
 the demand of its buyer given price 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.270
 segment 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:44.559
 in hours 1800 local time our crew 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.599
 arrived at the finish point third I 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:49.659
 madly tired but the route is very us 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:53.139
 like the car we never failed 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:55.509
