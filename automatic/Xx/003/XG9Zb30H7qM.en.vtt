00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.510
 to 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.979
 hello good morning with this session 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.510
 we want to value some 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.370
 initiatives that teams of 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.290
 nursing have carried out in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.910
 coherence with strategic lines 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.780
 of the hospital and the six platforms 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.780
 thematic 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.140
 the idea of ​​the pallium is born of the need 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.910
 to bring security to the practice of 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.270
 Children to use as a toy 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.210
 scooter a clinical device as is 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.550
 a floor stick from a sketch 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.280
 on paper what followed was to form a 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.170
 working group with staff from 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.030
 hospital and from here it was manufactured 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.250
 a first prototype this first 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.910
 prototype represented in the school of 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.910
 design of Barcelona contributed an image 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.100
 warmer and more pediatric and that 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.260
 together with the financing of a 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.410
 company collaborates with the hospital allowed 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.910
 the manufacture of 20 units of the canopy 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.329
 that at this moment is circulating with 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.329
 Hospital 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.340
 We are Carmen and fine staff of the 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.830
 5th childhood plant we are going to present 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.330
 an idea for the safety and comfort of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.710
 patient units feature beds 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.130
 mostly with which we have to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.870
 adapt according to age and needs 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.770
 the space that exists between 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.200
 handrails creates a risk of falls 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.610
 in cases of baby and blows in patients 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.610
 who have no voluntary control 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.250
 the staff of the plant saw a possible 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.500
 solution cover the bars of the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.200
 handrails with churros to reduce the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.110
 space and avoid the blows with this 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.270
 protector we got to cross the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.310
 Room furniture and increase 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.090
 comfort and safety 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.760
 this idea was put into practice 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.680
 obtaining a very positive result 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.960
 hello, I'm alicia canaco, I'm an assistant 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.390
 infirmary of Ithaca and I am going to present you 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.160
 an initiative that I had the null idea 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.650
 Serrallonga as the children of the hospital 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.370
 vall in families looking at the ceiling and they are 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.800
 some white plaster plates I had the idea 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.110
 that with the children of Ithaca we could 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.910
 paint them in the art therapy activity 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.380
 with this one 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.090
 for this reason we get two 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:27.120
 objectives one that our children have 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.160
 imagination skill and other power 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.550
 collaborate in mediating the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.550
 hospital 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.230
 Hi, I'm the boss to represent the 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.969
 nurse direction in the framework of 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.939
 collaboration with the four hospitals 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.590
 tertiary of barcelona city appeared 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.650
 the need to be able to share 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.170
 experiences following these reflections 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.120
 the initiative of 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.579
 exchange of professionals between 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.189
 hospitals this program allows us 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.590
 know different realities 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.780
 we can share and learn what they do 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.940
 others in same situations 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.190
 Hi, I'm Luis, the disease of the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.830
 10 hospitalization floor where 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.720
 we find traumatology and surgery os 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.120
 I'm going to talk about hospital discharge 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.980
 the nurse the idea came from the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.550
 need to help speed up the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.470
 rainbow income circuit plant since 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.140
 the children entered and we did not have the 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.200
 prepared beds pathologies were chosen 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.390
 surgical where the teaching of 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.209
 home care were already part 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.010
 of the nurse the only thing that had to be 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.470
 to do was include in the plans 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.360
 care a section to be completed by 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.360
 the nurse of high criteria 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.709
 My name is white muñoz I am a disease 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.540
 and a cough from our care plan 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.190
 we include the environment since it is a 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.599
 contributing factor in the 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.270
 neurodevelopment of the newborn 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.239
 preterm is why, from the 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.400
 Engineering and innovation departments 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.260
 the new idea of ​​creating a 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.440
 sensor that gave us information 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.540
 continued the environment with the we are 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.640
 doing studies that will give us 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.610
 enough evidence to change 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.620
 the environment in this way the engine is born 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.229
 It is a small sensor 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.120
 economic and that has joined different 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.880
 disciplines in achieving a 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.950
 common goal that is to improve the quality 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.930
 of preterm care and increase 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.509
 your future quality of life 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.520
 Hi, I'm conch, Augustin, nurse, 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.770
 support unit a problem is detected 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.960
 that the healthcare nurse can not 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.210
 leave your job to 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.699
 receive training as an alternative to 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.380
 this problem appears the five program 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:47.630
 minutes where the nurse can 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.630
 be trained in the work unit
