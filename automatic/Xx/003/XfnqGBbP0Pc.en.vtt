out you know with like mock punch or
vacuum<00:02:39.879> wave<00:02:40.120> or<00:02:40.900> bullet<00:02:41.170> punch<00:02:41.379> stuff<00:02:41.920> like

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
vacuum wave or bullet punch stuff like

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.970 
vacuum wave or bullet punch stuff like
that<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:43.299> anyway<00:02:43.629> I<00:02:43.810> double<00:02:44.170> surf<00:02:44.379> I<00:02:44.590> healed<00:02:44.830> my

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
that so anyway I double surf I healed my

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.399 
that so anyway I double surf I healed my
own<00:02:45.129> guys<00:02:45.340> twice<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.090> they're<00:02:46.780> zangoose<00:02:47.170> goes

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
own guys twice and they're zangoose goes

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.000 
own guys twice and they're zangoose goes
down<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.980> we've<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.340> was<00:02:48.459> just<00:02:48.700> below<00:02:48.970> half<00:02:50.010> so

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
down and we've I was just below half so

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.559 
down and we've I was just below half so
now<00:02:51.130> we<00:02:51.190> wait<00:02:51.400> for<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.610> leftovers<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.300> be<00:02:52.390> done

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
now we wait for the leftovers to be done

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.140 
now we wait for the leftovers to be done
and<00:02:52.780> over<00:02:53.080> with<00:02:53.230> because<00:02:53.890> this<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.459> definitely

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
and over with because this is definitely

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.490 
and over with because this is definitely

sign this is the healing side of the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.530 
sign this is the healing side of the
past<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.840> they<00:02:59.470> said<00:02:59.650> another<00:02:59.770> rayquaza<00:03:00.540> now

then he goes for thunder on man tyne
which<00:03:31.090> was<00:03:31.300> great<00:03:31.720> because<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.200> need<00:03:32.380> the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
which was great because I need the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.590 
which was great because I need the
Lapras<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:33.040> stay<00:03:33.250> alive<00:03:33.489> because<00:03:33.790> he's

dealing<00:03:34.959> personal<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.320> this<00:03:35.350> past<00:03:35.680> ice<00:03:36.010> beam

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
dealing personal in this past ice beam

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.540 
dealing personal in this past ice beam
the<00:03:37.600> man<00:03:37.810> tyne<00:03:38.050> goes<00:03:38.230> down<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.620> thunder<00:03:39.100> not

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
the man tyne goes down to a thunder not

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.550 
the man tyne goes down to a thunder not
even<00:03:39.790> with<00:03:40.030> his<00:03:40.209> crazy<00:03:40.540> special<00:03:40.959> defense<00:03:41.320> he

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
even with his crazy special defense he

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.880 
even with his crazy special defense he
can't<00:03:41.800> survive<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:44.140> man<00:03:44.290> tyne<00:03:44.500> goes<00:03:44.680> down

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
can't survive that so man tyne goes down

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.100 
can't survive that so man tyne goes down
I<00:03:45.130> use<00:03:45.340> ice<00:03:45.550> beam<00:03:45.850> in<00:03:46.060> one<00:03:46.270> shot<00:03:46.570> wreck<00:03:46.840> wassa

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
I use ice beam in one shot wreck wassa

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.070 
I use ice beam in one shot wreck wassa
which<00:03:47.920> was<00:03:48.130> nice<00:03:48.280> because<00:03:48.390> with<00:03:49.390> thunder<00:03:50.050> I

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
which was nice because with thunder I

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.910 
which was nice because with thunder I
needed<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.590> die<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.810> rayquaza<00:03:53.260> starts<00:03:53.680> spin

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
needed to die so rayquaza starts spin

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.790 
needed to die so rayquaza starts spin
around<00:03:54.040> flying<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> moron<00:03:55.390> does<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.140> huge

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
around flying like a moron does a huge

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.509 
around flying like a moron does a huge
backflip<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:57.550> dice<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:59.070> wipers<00:04:00.070> heels<00:04:00.340> a

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
backflip and dice and wipers heels a

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.360 
backflip and dice and wipers heels a
little<00:04:00.610> bit<00:04:00.850> from<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.360> leftovers<00:04:01.989> so

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
little bit from the leftovers so

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.670 
little bit from the leftovers so
outcomes<00:04:03.370> electabuzz<00:04:03.970> that's<00:04:04.930> right<00:04:05.170> start

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
outcomes electabuzz that's right start

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.979 
outcomes electabuzz that's right start
picking<00:04:06.040> him<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.430> don't<00:04:07.420> really<00:04:07.540> know<00:04:07.780> why<00:04:07.959> I

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
picking him I don't really know why I

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:08.910 
picking him I don't really know why I
was<00:04:08.170> having<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.500> little<00:04:08.680> bit<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.799> trouble

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
was having a little bit of trouble

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.289 
was having a little bit of trouble
picking<00:04:09.340> him<00:04:09.610> right<00:04:09.790> then<00:04:09.970> maybe<00:04:10.209> just

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
picking him right then maybe just

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.390 
picking him right then maybe just
because<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.780> knew<00:04:10.989> he<00:04:11.140> had<00:04:11.260> brick<00:04:11.500> break<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:11.980> I

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
because I knew he had brick break and I

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.430 
because I knew he had brick break and I
didn't<00:04:12.610> want<00:04:12.790> him<00:04:12.940> to<00:04:13.090> just<00:04:13.120> once<00:04:13.540> one<00:04:14.140> shot

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
didn't want him to just once one shot

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.370 
didn't want him to just once one shot
cast<00:04:14.799> warm<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:16.390> outcomes<00:04:16.840> electabuzz<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
cast warm so outcomes electabuzz and

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.670 
cast warm so outcomes electabuzz and
starts<00:04:20.380> like<00:04:20.590> moves<00:04:20.979> again<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.580> go<00:04:21.970> for<00:04:22.680> ice

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
starts like moves again so I go for ice

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.400 
starts like moves again so I go for ice
beam<00:04:24.040> on<00:04:24.250> ABS<00:04:24.520> all<00:04:24.760> because<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.120> knew<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:25.780> needed

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
beam on ABS all because I knew I needed

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.070 
beam on ABS all because I knew I needed
the<00:04:26.680> stab<00:04:26.950> damage<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:28.240> right<00:04:28.510> here<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:28.780> thought

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
the stab damage and right here I thought

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.750 
the stab damage and right here I thought
I<00:04:29.320> like<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.740> was<00:04:29.890> could<00:04:30.250> have<00:04:30.400> been<00:04:30.520> faster

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
I like it was could have been faster

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.440 
I like it was could have been faster

mattered<00:05:11.919> either<00:05:12.400> way<00:05:12.669> because<00:05:13.000> i<00:05:13.030> have<00:05:13.270> a

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
mattered either way because i have a

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.070 
mattered either way because i have a
sash<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:14.190> he<00:05:15.190> gets<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.700> static<00:05:16.270> which<00:05:16.870> was

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
sash and he gets the static which was

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.220 
sash and he gets the static which was
nice<00:05:17.230> because<00:05:17.290> i<00:05:17.650> needed<00:05:17.950> that<00:05:18.130> happen<00:05:18.610> and

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
nice because i needed that happen and

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
nice because i needed that happen and
outcomes<00:05:20.230> cast<00:05:20.860> warm<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:22.260> so<00:05:23.260> now<00:05:23.710> it's<00:05:24.010> just

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250
