00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
much against it but it seems to me that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.990 
much against it but it seems to me that
to<00:01:17.970> actually<00:01:18.119> discriminate<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.020> way<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
to actually discriminate in that way is

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
to actually discriminate in that way is
really<00:01:21.000> crappy<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.960> how<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.350> seems<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
really crappy and it's how it seems to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.030 
really crappy and it's how it seems to
me<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:24.479> know<00:01:24.600> anti-muslim<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
me to be you know anti-muslim and of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
me to be you know anti-muslim and of
course<00:01:26.070> outwardly<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.180> seems<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.630> be

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
course outwardly it seems to be

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.789 
course outwardly it seems to be
anti-semitic<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.650> well<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> was

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
anti-semitic as well so you know I was

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.800 
anti-semitic as well so you know I was
really<00:01:31.979> put<00:01:32.220> off<00:01:32.340> by<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
really put off by that and you know I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.450 
really put off by that and you know I
asked<00:01:34.140> these<00:01:34.259> questions<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.189> said

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
asked these questions about it I said

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
asked these questions about it I said
you<00:01:35.640> know<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.119> seems<00:01:36.750> hypocritical<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.439> me

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you know it seems hypocritical of me

seem<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.610> awful<00:01:59.880> lot<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.119> judgment

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
seem to have an awful lot of judgment

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.060 
seem to have an awful lot of judgment
going<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:01.610> basically<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:02.850> you're
