all<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.589> queries<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:04.980> access<00:00:05.339> are<00:00:05.460> stored<00:00:05.640> in

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
all the queries in access are stored in

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.280 
all the queries in access are stored in
a<00:00:05.790> common<00:00:06.089> programming<00:00:06.600> language<00:00:06.930> called<00:00:07.080> SQL

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
a common programming language called SQL

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.440 
a common programming language called SQL
SQL<00:00:07.890> stands<00:00:08.580> for<00:00:08.670> structured<00:00:09.030> query<00:00:09.300> language

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
SQL stands for structured query language

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.180 
SQL stands for structured query language
and<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.170> could<00:00:10.260> be<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> pretty<00:00:10.620> powerful<00:00:10.800> way<00:00:11.070> to

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and it could be a pretty powerful way to

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.919 
and it could be a pretty powerful way to
create<00:00:11.550> queries<00:00:12.030> but<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.420> little<00:00:12.690> bit<00:00:12.809> daunting

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
create queries but a little bit daunting

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:13.759 
create queries but a little bit daunting
at<00:00:13.230> first

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
at first

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.829 
at first
so<00:00:14.070> access<00:00:14.670> actually<00:00:15.000> provides<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.389> second<00:00:15.719> way

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
so access actually provides a second way

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.150 
so access actually provides a second way
that<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.260> create<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.529> query<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.890> called<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
that we can create a query is called the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.820 
that we can create a query is called the
QBE<00:00:17.490> grid<00:00:18.000> or<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.420> query<00:00:18.750> by<00:00:18.930> example<00:00:18.960> I'm

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
QBE grid or the query by example I'm

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.050 
QBE grid or the query by example I'm
going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.039> go<00:00:20.130> ahead<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.430> open<00:00:20.490> up<00:00:20.760> one<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.939> the

going to go ahead and open up one of the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.250 
going to go ahead and open up one of the
queries<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.689> created<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
queries that we just created in the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.080 
queries that we just created in the
previous<00:00:22.410> movie<00:00:22.619> I'm<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.670> open<00:00:23.760> up<00:00:23.939> the

customer email query and if I double

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.140 
customer email query and if I double
click<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.550> you'll<00:00:26.670> see<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> query

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
click on it you'll see that the query

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.730 
click on it you'll see that the query
runs<00:00:27.420> again<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.260> pulling<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> first

out of our direct customers table now
there's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> couple<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.030> ways<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.360> can

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
there's a couple of ways that we can

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.020 
there's a couple of ways that we can
switch<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> QBE<00:00:34.290> environment<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
very top on the home tab we've got this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
very top on the home tab we've got this
icon<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.280> that's<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.820> triangle<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> pencil

from a couple additional views that we

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.720 
from a couple additional views that we
have<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.039> we've<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> datasheet<00:00:47.579> view

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
you'll see that they all get dropped

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.410 
you'll see that they all get dropped
down<00:05:03.500> into<00:05:03.800> our<00:05:03.890> query<00:05:04.040> environment<00:05:04.640> if<00:05:05.180> I<00:05:05.270> go

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
down into our query environment if I go

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.870 
down into our query environment if I go

ahead and say run or switch to datasheet
view<00:05:07.910> we'll<00:05:08.840> see<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.110> we<00:05:09.200> get<00:05:09.290> the<00:05:09.410> same

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
view we'll see that we get the same

view we'll see that we get the same
results<00:05:09.890> from<00:05:09.980> the<00:05:10.130> query<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.490> we<00:05:10.580> built

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
results from the query that we built

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.030 
results from the query that we built
using<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.510> wizard<00:05:11.810> in<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.020> last<00:05:12.170> movie<00:05:12.530> we've

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
using the wizard in the last movie we've

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.860 
using the wizard in the last movie we've
got<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.280> first<00:05:13.400> name<00:05:13.670> the<00:05:13.910> last<00:05:14.060> name<00:05:14.480> in<00:05:14.690> the

email address pulled from the direct
customers<00:05:16.610> table<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.240> we<00:05:17.360> just<00:05:17.480> created<00:05:17.750> a

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
customers table so we just created a

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.210 
customers table so we just created a
query<00:05:17.990> from<00:05:18.170> scratch<00:05:18.500> using<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.920> design

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
query from scratch using the design

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.400 
query from scratch using the design
environment<00:05:19.790> and<00:05:20.000> this<00:05:20.360> query<00:05:20.660> is<00:05:20.900> identical

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
environment and this query is identical

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.810 
environment and this query is identical
to<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.620> one<00:05:21.650> that<00:05:21.830> we<00:05:21.950> created<00:05:22.370> using<00:05:22.610> the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
to the one that we created using the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.430 
to the one that we created using the
wizard<00:05:22.970> in<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.870> next<00:05:24.080> chapter<00:05:24.320> we're<00:05:24.410> going

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
wizard in the next chapter we're going

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.690 
wizard in the next chapter we're going
to<00:05:24.560> take<00:05:24.740> a<00:05:24.770> look<00:05:24.950> at<00:05:25.040> how<00:05:25.130> we<00:05:25.190> can<00:05:25.370> use<00:05:25.550> the

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
to take a look at how we can use the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.280 
to take a look at how we can use the
design<00:05:25.970> environment<00:05:26.480> to<00:05:26.570> move<00:05:26.690> beyond<00:05:27.050> the

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
design environment to move beyond the

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.600 
design environment to move beyond the
options<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:27.770> are<00:05:27.920> available<00:05:27.950> within<00:05:28.430> the

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
options that are available within the
