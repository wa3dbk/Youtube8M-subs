00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 meanwhile we have seen the last round of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.210
 heating for our anna 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.309
 hats and luca lanotte beautiful the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 program that seven brides chose 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.240
 for seven brothers where the interview 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.280
 which then we will propose again because there 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.800
 sorry but in some parts of italy for 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.930
 problems obviously not wanted by 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.430
 we haven't seen a part of it 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.100
 of the interview then I had to repeat 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.840
 but with palatine of this race because 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.490
 they even explained that they have 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.289
 studied all the performance of the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
 musical of this race with paola 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.010
 sharecroppers have chosen to look at the costumes 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.899
 perfect and really a play in this 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.090
 their dance shows are gods 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 great interpreters both for what 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.100
 it's about their show dance either for 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 regarding obviously not embodies e 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.700
 now we let you follow in mind and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.989
 in silence 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.989
 anna cappellini luca lanotte 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.200
 perfect for seven anna cappellini luca 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.350
 lanotte two beautiful texts of Adam 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.720
 obviously drop the two characters of 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.430
 seven brides for seven brothers meanwhile 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.190
 we see others coming off filling 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.950
 the building the dance is always 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.870
 extraordinary and I have to say they are 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.700
 be awesome a little tense at the beginning 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.110
 they seemed to me because maybe the emotions 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.870
 but they were extraordinary 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.959
 no look, I test you with strong eyes 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.820
 aggressive at the right point not 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.310
 restrained at all beautiful fluids on 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.770
 expressive music in time 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.470
 I would say not skated to the fullest of 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.380
 as of how they know how to skate wires 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.850
 they seemed to me to be precise 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.310
 who can be more than satisfied and 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.370
 as always we say their faces already there 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.690
 tell him you will have 90 no at all 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:47.320
 let's see how they will be welcomed by 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:50.320
 stephen it seems to me that we seek 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.180
 always understand what you say when i 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.470
 boys come out of the ice race 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.470
 beautiful also luca 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.210
 these are the initial too easily there were 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.690
 a very light out of sync because 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.340
 true that it was different from anna but then 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.960
 they recovered it well anyway they have 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.680
 completed all rounds 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.150
 expected 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.030
 here the circle of wires means curves 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.870
 they seemed very clean to me 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.120
 precise quite deep also 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.270
 some more choreographic details is 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.120
 was also included by the other tests 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.250
 this is best experienced by grand prix 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.620
 program increasingly feel it 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.600
 according to me i was playing very well 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.910
 is not really for the other day goes the 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.950
 vergiatese said he had just streams 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.290
 worked some parts both for what 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.590
 regards it both as regards the 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:50.340
 from the pd to give you caution for 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.460
 give him more expressiveness no yes 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.830
 that's exactly what he has 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.290
 tried to emphasize paola in this 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.440
 last Victorian period and with facts 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.440
 unreleased 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.740
 they all say goodbye and say goodbye with 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.150
 obviously when he greets palermo already 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.169
 because when they are followed also by 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.979
 there postiva 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:19.169
 we see then had his 33 and 93 with 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:22.380
 32 and 18 66 and a gloss and what 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.990
 regards villafranca si bene dire dire 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:29.039
 absolutely in their average of 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.960
 performance in short and then for the race 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.910
 for the moment they can be considered more 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.310
 which satisfied binds to the bompard where 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.310
 they have set have developed 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.889
 just the best short program for 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.759
 dance had won 66 18 as you are and 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.759
 we are there
