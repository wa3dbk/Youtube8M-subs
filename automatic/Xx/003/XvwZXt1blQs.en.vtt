00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.410
 there I am male here in the backlands modes and 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.940
 I'll tell you both about 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.800
 Safety equipment 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.500
 I'll tell you about the warrior sculpture. 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.719
 common producers' knee joint with 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.340
 cultures and lay people there are some 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.590
 models like this one with the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.580
 risk it is made with the species 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.840
 seals where you really are and how 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.000
 the head works 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.519
 there is another market model for 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.080
 example with this one that is to wear with 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.350
 straps that also fastened the arm 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.880
 irrespective of the method of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.950
 body product 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.200
 the important thing is that it is really old 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.390
 very comfortable when 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.780
 use on a daily basis or in small 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.670
 the same road trip 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.629
 the other important side is the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.280
 knee pads 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.110
 then there is also a template 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.750
 different in the market this model is a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.690
 new model and will protect both the thigh 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.969
 with one knee with one leg and this 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.030
 model is fixed only by three 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.500
 belts that choice are well 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.060
 they accompany the movement to the leg 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.880
 folded leg 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.720
 they will actually follow up well and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.000
 protect the property with minor 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.060
 in my segment like this one 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.330
 The goal is to protect only the knee and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.700
 ground and also strapped through belts 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.729
 is a little smaller model but also goes 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.250
 actually do the pilot protection or 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.409
 there are still models like this here 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.030
 which are models of particulates where 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.040
 investment. 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.360
 very resistant and ejected material 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.520
 in plastic and these are those 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.610
 they have an interesting feature 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.470
 is that they follow the movement until 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.030
 so when the pilot if he really 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.579
 bend your leg 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.049
 he will keep track of how exactly this 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.439
 will give you more comfort and more mobility 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.130
 some also stuck only fixed 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.039
 through the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.229
 another very important element for 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.750
 we think are the column protectors 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.909
 I, for example, the model here 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.829
 this model is a model seven decades 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.890
 he observes three months in the region 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.580
 cervical region until the neighborhood 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.130
 will fix the entire structure of the column 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.160
 avoid Brazil and the sides and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.650
 small accident in the 500 largest and clear 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.349
 avoiding the column 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.930
 there are some models alone with this 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.480
 model so far seven meters 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.090
 it is a model that the injected material is 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.040
 high intensity foam and is also 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.349
 quite interesting from the point of view 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.200
 black contest to the body through 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:44.390
 two adjustable races like these that 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.830
 I have here in my chest destiny the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.160
 protector and obviously things 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.430
 have also dominated this other model is a 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.959
 Model of the model sw also seven vetoes is 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.140
 exactly the same as what I am 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.739
 using that there are still so-called 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.650
 only abdominal models or accused 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.880
 this model lumbar than a diet 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.120
 two children 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.760
 so there are only two goals or this 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.220
 I think she has exactly four 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.769
 decades 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.109
 regardless of your product 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.730
 Whatever your need is always 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.850
 It is interesting that the pilot is always 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.950
 protected in situations of 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.530
 accidents or small we are nations 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.079
 higher in regions that are subject to 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.720
 mapfre these products knee pads 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.579
 elbow and column producers 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.970
 different brands and with the variety is 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.870
 reasonable and can be found here in 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.870
 sert√£ and botos
