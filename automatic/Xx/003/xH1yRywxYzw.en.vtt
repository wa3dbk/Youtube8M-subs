 back when a certain consciousness 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.630
 Let's see who the utility we use 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.180
 here some problems who I was going to 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.190
 search available to destabilize for 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.390
 see how I can say stop working 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.360
 for a few moments

 to the game mode that this one is you 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.420
 can project you against the shift r tal 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.860
 decomposition change was to change everything 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.459
 the button made for example will get a 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.130
 ip that will be valid for the game mode and 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.489

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:53.590
 how to make the diagnosis on the computer 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.590
 the time here to be less time consuming 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.750
 back to iacc was a diagnosis to 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.670
 family do not compare when adjusting is for 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.439
 leave these problems here 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.920
 is for example what enables the option 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.620
 to view hidden files and folders 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.269
 there they work and only use 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.100
 that goes right to operate only for now 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:22.169
 problem to change or export 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.759
 Fragment you will experience a game 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.979
 program will only put those who 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:30.900
 defragment then come here you have not 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:33.150
 here without adding lighter soon 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.000
 he will see he will analyze one will see 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.889
 or a drive that is missing or needs to 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.960
 be updated in which I have here but I 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.849
 I have seen here in a little while you click 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.080
 download that it no longer goes straight to prove 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:53.520
 for all to do every year a year ago 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.680
 fps fsm in that numbers when you 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.360
 starts recording and is recorded indicates 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.360
 that you choose wherever you go. 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.280
 choose a right that he lost 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:10.979
 superior here to hidden ' view the fps 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.940
 that number is at risk where it is 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.880
 was approaching 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.300
 here is captain of land that is for school 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.460
 shock will be photo of you increase the 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.280
 offspring screen that squeeze sp 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.889
 he will capture the image here he will 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:32.220
 be saved and here is what for the format 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:37.889
 jpg png or bmp capture video to do 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:39.060
 recording on / off later when I 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.130
 I think she's going to start capturing the 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.690
 video when you 're against the team but 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.150

 for example point has already changed the tone 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.490
 f8 starts recording the video here where it 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.490
 will be saved 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:11.490
 the video resolution 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:13.650
 the video quality really good 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.340
 You can put on the loudest sound you have. 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:20.279
 that being cool the audio system here is 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.229
 to record them only the sound of the 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:24.090
 who will not record the sound of the 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.860
 microphone if you have if you want to 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.849
 take the microphone only in 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.279
 bottom 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:33.719
 it will record the sound of the game and the 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:35.669
 microphone after 18 and 1 starts 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.740
 to record and if you press here on the river 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.389

 Looks like you click play 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:50.820
 it will start to make the recording only 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:52.729
 this to show what in the other 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:58.490
