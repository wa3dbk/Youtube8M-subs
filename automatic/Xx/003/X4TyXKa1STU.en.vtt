00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
know I'm not waiting or if I - it's

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.710 
know I'm not waiting or if I - it's
awkward<00:04:27.090> cuz<00:04:27.600> it's<00:04:28.560> just<00:04:28.770> I'm<00:04:28.889> a<00:04:29.009> nothing<00:04:29.430> and

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
awkward cuz it's just I'm a nothing and

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.560 
awkward cuz it's just I'm a nothing and
I'm<00:04:30.720> never<00:04:30.900> going<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.229> sail<00:04:31.440> with<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.620> model<00:04:31.979> and

I'm never going to sail with a model and

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.090 
I'm never going to sail with a model and

smaller
the<00:05:04.110> only<00:05:04.530> difference<00:05:05.009> on<00:05:05.160> this<00:05:05.340> one<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.849> the

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
the only difference on this one is the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.719 
the only difference on this one is the
wheels<00:05:06.660> on<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.930> underside<00:05:07.410> not<00:05:08.340> just<00:05:08.520> one

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
wheels on the underside not just one

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.620 
wheels on the underside not just one
swords<00:05:09.330> wheel<00:05:10.259> I<00:05:10.550> think<00:05:11.550> in<00:05:11.940> real<00:05:12.060> life<00:05:12.300> they

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
swords wheel I think in real life they

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.580 
swords wheel I think in real life they
are<00:05:12.919> double<00:05:13.919> axle<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.669> those<00:05:14.820> two<00:05:15.440> afford<00:05:16.440> on

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
are double axle so those two afford on

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.800 
are double axle so those two afford on
each<00:05:16.710> axle<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:18.349> so<00:05:19.349> they<00:05:19.590> then<00:05:19.919> and<00:05:20.160> then<00:05:21.090> went

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
each axle and so they then and then went

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.439 
each axle and so they then and then went
back<00:05:21.870> that's<00:05:22.229> when<00:05:22.349> you<00:05:22.440> get<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.650> lakes<00:05:23.449> doing
