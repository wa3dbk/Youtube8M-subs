we start with a little bit of foliage
maybe<00:01:24.340> some<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:24.880> I'll<00:01:25.090> cut<00:01:25.899> it<00:01:25.929> down

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
maybe some so I'll cut it down

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.949 
maybe some so I'll cut it down
relatively<00:01:27.069> short<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:28.000> don't<00:01:28.270> want<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.810> be

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:28.959 
relatively short you don't want it to be

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.859 
relatively short you don't want it to be
too<00:01:28.990> long<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:30.009> just<00:01:30.130> Nestle<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.819> in<00:01:31.000> maybe<00:01:31.750> a
