00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
trouble strumming I'd showed him some

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.780 
trouble strumming I'd showed him some
chords<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.889> came<00:00:14.040> time<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> play<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
chords and it came time to play the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.700 
chords and it came time to play the
music<00:00:14.910> he<00:00:15.269> realized<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.780> he<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:16.410> feeling<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
music he realized that he was feeling a

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.800 
music he realized that he was feeling a
little<00:00:16.800> awkward<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:18.060> said<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.420> okay<00:00:18.449> Dan

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
little awkward and I said it's okay Dan

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.200 
little awkward and I said it's okay Dan
I<00:00:18.960> can<00:00:19.199> help<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.439> with<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> was

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
I can help you with that and so I was

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.700 
I can help you with that and so I was
going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.510> teach<00:00:21.689> him<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.960> scrubbing<00:00:22.289> pattern

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
going to teach him a scrubbing pattern

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.410 
going to teach him a scrubbing pattern
and<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.130> figured<00:00:23.430> when<00:00:23.580> I'm<00:00:23.699> teaching<00:00:23.850> him<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
and I figured when I'm teaching him I

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.050 
and I figured when I'm teaching him I
might<00:00:24.810> as<00:00:24.960> well<00:00:25.019> teach<00:00:25.439> everyone<00:00:25.949> else<00:00:26.099> too<00:00:26.369> so

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
might as well teach everyone else too so

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.790 
might as well teach everyone else too so
the<00:00:27.660> strumming<00:00:28.019> pattern<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.740> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the strumming pattern we're going to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.179 
the strumming pattern we're going to
learn<00:00:28.980> today<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.550> down<00:00:30.179> down<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:31.289> down<00:00:31.890> up

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
learn today is down down up up down up

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
learn today is down down up up down up
and<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.090> hand<00:00:33.329> moves<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> same<00:00:33.930> speed<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
and the hand moves the same speed is

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.130 
and the hand moves the same speed is
just<00:00:34.620> when<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.309> poke<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> strings<00:00:36.300> when<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
just when you poke the strings when you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.330 
just when you poke the strings when you
come<00:00:37.290> closer<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.739> hit<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> string<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.250> that's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
come closer to hit the string so that's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.830 
come closer to hit the string so that's
all<00:00:38.579> we're<00:00:38.790> doing<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.690> actually

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
all we're doing here and I actually

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
all we're doing here and I actually
created<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.590> song<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:41.820> we're

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
created a little song but for now we're

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.700 
created a little song but for now we're
to<00:00:42.390> learn<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> strumming<00:00:42.960> pattern<00:00:42.989> we're

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
to learn the strumming pattern we're

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.760 
to learn the strumming pattern we're
using<00:00:43.920> two<00:00:44.190> chords<00:00:44.640> G<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.440> cheater

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
using two chords G like this and cheater

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
using two chords G like this and cheater
C<00:00:47.010> because<00:00:47.340> well<00:00:48.059> we're<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.300> cheaters<00:00:48.539> but

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
C because well we're not cheaters but

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.779 
C because well we're not cheaters but
we're<00:00:48.930> clever<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.440> wise<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:50.579> just

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
we're clever and wise and that's just

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.160 
we're clever and wise and that's just
moving<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.149> two<00:00:51.300> fingers<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.809> because

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
moving these two fingers here because

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.299 
moving these two fingers here because
we're<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.559> wearing<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.100> we

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
we're not really wearing with that we

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.639 
we're not really wearing with that we
want<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> learn<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.940> strumming<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.530> it's

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
want to learn the strumming so what it's

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.779 
want to learn the strumming so what it's
going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> sound<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.160> I'll<00:00:56.370> play<00:00:56.489> through

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
going to sound like I'll play through

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.209
