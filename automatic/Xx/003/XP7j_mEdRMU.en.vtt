00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.830
 Sicilian 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.830
 in which a trap is produced 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.840
 the plates connect from 4 c 5 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.080
 efe four of six 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.270
 horse etc three horses of six 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.700
 at last four months 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.300
 horseback from 3 to 6 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.920
 to 4 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.000
 horse 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.000

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.710
 short castling 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.710
 so 7 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.890
 of 3 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.620
 gives more times 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:22.480
 white eagles advance the pawn efe 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.620
 trying to open lines 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.100
 Y 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.100
 Thank you 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.000
 if they advance the pawn 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.409
 what is 5 when it occurs 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.590
 is bald 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.590
 with horse jumping AG5 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.950
 and black 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.950
 if they play h 6 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:00.090
 7 efe horse because it is 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.770
 descended by the rise when advancing this 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.210
 worst salary I bring anything 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.750
 and there 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.929
 if black 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.040

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.819
 alright in the lady queen jump h 5 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.940
 and I could continue 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.740
 horse 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.159
 to 5 to try to get to this end 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.090
 although here already the whitest have taken 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:43.680
 totally advantage 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.819
 because with horse 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.620
 5 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.620
 checkmate of the king 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.460
 the king moves 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.520
 and the lady 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.040
 to efe 7 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.150
 not caring that the horse is 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.519
 threatened 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.519
 because they are threatening this bishop 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.400
 Black could at last 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.180
 and 8a 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.180
 in the next cell 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.350

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.280
 of 5 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.349
 and so 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.819
 the lady captures this horse that 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.600
 directly is defended by what 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.930

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.640
 and with the horse 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.110
 of 5 do a double queen king and the 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.010
 white 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.180
 they have their card 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.540
 it is carrying the word 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.630

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.020

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.650
