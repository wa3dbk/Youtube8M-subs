00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
do I stick a camera on that thing so I

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.400 
do I stick a camera on that thing so I
can<00:00:32.329> get<00:00:32.390> some<00:00:32.509> really<00:00:32.629> cool<00:00:32.809> flying<00:00:33.079> shots

well<00:00:34.219> as<00:00:34.339> it<00:00:34.460> turns<00:00:34.670> out<00:00:34.850> there<00:00:35.510> already<00:00:35.719> two

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
well as it turns out there already two

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.689 
well as it turns out there already two
cameras<00:00:36.350> built<00:00:36.530> into<00:00:36.649> it<00:00:36.920> now<00:00:37.190> those<00:00:37.339> cameras

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
cameras built into it now those cameras

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.579 
cameras built into it now those cameras
use<00:00:37.879> to<00:00:38.089> feed<00:00:38.239> live<00:00:38.510> video<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.109> to<00:00:39.230> help<00:00:39.440> with

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
use to feed live video and to help with

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.829 
use to feed live video and to help with
stabilization<00:00:39.920> and<00:00:40.280> such<00:00:40.429> but<00:00:41.149> but<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:41.659> think

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
stabilization and such but but I think

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.119 
stabilization and such but but I think
it<00:00:41.899> could<00:00:41.960> be<00:00:42.079> a<00:00:42.109> pretty<00:00:42.320> cool<00:00:42.499> filmmakers<00:00:42.980> toy

no way this thing was going to record
video<00:02:04.399> I'm<00:02:04.909> not<00:02:05.090> sure<00:02:05.149> why<00:02:05.450> maybe<00:02:05.689> was<00:02:05.869> a

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
video I'm not sure why maybe was a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.330 
video I'm not sure why maybe was a
privacy<00:02:06.409> issue<00:02:06.500> maybe<00:02:06.890> there's<00:02:07.099> you<00:02:07.220> know

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
privacy issue maybe there's you know

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.520 
privacy issue maybe there's you know
some<00:02:07.970> other<00:02:08.000> aspects<00:02:08.899> involved<00:02:09.049> at<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.259> wasn't

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
some other aspects involved at I wasn't

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.100 
some other aspects involved at I wasn't
really<00:02:09.679> aware<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.340> but<00:02:10.610> he<00:02:11.569> made<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.780> seem<00:02:12.049> like

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
really aware of but he made it seem like

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.330 
really aware of but he made it seem like
there's<00:02:12.470> just<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.830> it's<00:02:12.920> just<00:02:13.069> not<00:02:13.190> going<00:02:13.280> to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
there's just and it's just not going to

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
so who's to say really what what's going

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:22.780 
so who's to say really what what's going
to<00:02:21.829> be<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:21.920> case<00:02:22.130> once<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.489> project<00:02:22.670> is

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
to be the case once the project is

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.910 
to be the case once the project is
finally<00:02:22.970> released<00:02:23.410> but<00:02:24.410> at<00:02:24.500> least<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.739> has<00:02:24.829> the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
finally released but at least it has the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.530 
finally released but at least it has the
potential<00:02:25.250> recording<00:02:25.730> video<00:02:25.940> but<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.450> know

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
potential recording video but you know

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.690 
potential recording video but you know
here's<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> thing<00:02:27.019> i<00:02:27.230> saw<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.310> many<00:02:28.400> video

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
here's the thing i saw so many video

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.550 
here's the thing i saw so many video
cameras<00:02:29.060> at<00:02:29.180> CES<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.750> were<00:02:29.810> like<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.260> big

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
cameras at CES that were like this big

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.280 
cameras at CES that were like this big
and<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:31.579> we're<00:02:31.730> pretty<00:02:31.850> light<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.630> recorded

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
and and we're pretty light that recorded

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.259 
and and we're pretty light that recorded
directly<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.650> flash<00:02:33.859> memory<00:02:34.280> some<00:02:34.940> thinking

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
directly to flash memory some thinking

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.580 
directly to flash memory some thinking
well<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:36.019> really<00:02:36.200> going<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.380> make<00:02:36.500> that

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
well is it really going to make that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.720 
well is it really going to make that
much<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.950> difference<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.430> quadrocopter

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
much of a difference to the quadrocopter

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.280 
much of a difference to the quadrocopter
to<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:38.299> stick<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.690> little<00:02:38.930> one<00:02:39.109> of<00:02:39.200> these

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
to just stick a little one of these

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.319 
to just stick a little one of these
flash<00:02:39.530> cameras<00:02:39.920> in<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.069> front<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.489> suspect

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
flash cameras in the front I suspect

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.759 
flash cameras in the front I suspect
you'll<00:02:41.450> get<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.600> better<00:02:41.750> frame<00:02:42.109> rate<00:02:42.319> better

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
you'll get a better frame rate better

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.110 
you'll get a better frame rate better
quality<00:02:43.130> picture<00:02:43.430> using<00:02:43.579> one<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.790> these<00:02:43.880> tiny

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
quality picture using one of these tiny

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.819 
quality picture using one of these tiny
little<00:02:44.150> cameras<00:02:44.569> just<00:02:44.780> stuck<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.440> stuck

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
little cameras just stuck on the stuck

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.430 
little cameras just stuck on the stuck
on<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.069> nose<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.730> quadrocopter<00:02:47.440> who

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
on the nose of the quadrocopter who

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.080 
on the nose of the quadrocopter who
knows<00:02:48.590> we'll<00:02:48.859> see<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.400> broccoli<00:02:49.700> really<00:02:49.880> soon

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
knows we'll see the broccoli really soon

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.580 
knows we'll see the broccoli really soon
