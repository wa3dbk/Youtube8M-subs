tail lessness and the tail that lessness

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.370 
tail lessness and the tail that lessness
is<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.369> nature<00:00:23.580> gave<00:00:24.029> us<00:00:24.270> so<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.869> cats<00:00:25.170> on

Manx is hundreds of years old it's it's
it's<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.170> natural<00:00:31.619> mutation<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.340> they've<00:00:32.520> been

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it's a natural mutation so they've been

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.939 
it's a natural mutation so they've been
around<00:00:32.699> long<00:00:33.510> before<00:00:33.989> people<00:00:34.350> started

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
around long before people started

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.190 
around long before people started
breeding<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.210> noticing<00:00:36.720> these<00:00:36.840> different

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
breeding and noticing these different

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.319 
breeding and noticing these different
breeds<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.710> there's<00:00:38.399> dog<00:00:38.550> people<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.090> there's

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
breeds so there's dog people and there's

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.930 
breeds so there's dog people and there's
cat<00:00:39.570> people<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:41.190> each<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.610> our<00:00:41.790> own

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
cat people and we each like our own

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.060 
cat people and we each like our own
species<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.809> specific<00:00:43.260> reasons<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
species for specific reasons so the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.000 
species for specific reasons so the
banks<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.579> very<00:00:44.610> doglike<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.010> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
banks are very doglike and the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.430 
banks are very doglike and the
characteristics<00:00:47.790> which<00:00:48.120> would<00:00:48.440> associate

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
characteristics which would associate

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
characteristics which would associate
that<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.460> fact<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.820> their<00:00:51.149> companion

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that is the fact that their companion

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.720 
that is the fact that their companion
animals<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.980> tend<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> follow<00:00:53.520> you

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.809 
up on the chairs on the table when I'm
not<00:01:24.300> home<00:01:24.599> but<00:01:25.560> generally<00:01:26.220> speaking<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:26.759> do

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819

they exist in the lower part of the room

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990 
they exist in the lower part of the room
which<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.679> really<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.160> so<00:01:29.459> they're<00:01:29.819> good

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
which I really like so they're good

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.089 
which I really like so they're good
companion<00:01:30.569> animals<00:01:30.959> they<00:01:31.319> really<00:01:31.649> bond<00:01:31.890> with

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:32.099 
companion animals they really bond with

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:35.210 
companion animals they really bond with
their<00:01:32.399> family<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.440> so<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.679> means<00:01:34.979> when

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
their family and so that means when

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.980 
their family and so that means when
company<00:01:35.670> comes<00:01:35.849> over<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:36.539> you<00:01:36.660> want<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
company comes over or when you want to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
company comes over or when you want to
really<00:01:37.229> show<00:01:37.349> them<00:01:37.709> off<00:01:37.860> they're<00:01:38.130> nowhere<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
really show them off they're nowhere to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.580 
really show them off they're nowhere to
be<00:01:38.759> found

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
be found

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
be found
so<00:01:40.590> they're<00:01:40.770> definitely<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.429> bond<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.849> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
so they're definitely they bond with the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.400 
so they're definitely they bond with the
whole<00:01:42.119> family<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.660> they're<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:42.990> good<00:01:43.259> with

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
whole family and they're very good with

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.499
