00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
derailleur and when you do this this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.730 
derailleur and when you do this this
should<00:01:32.970> actually<00:01:33.150> drop<00:01:33.659> down<00:01:33.990> drop<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> chain

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
should actually drop down drop the chain

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
should actually drop down drop the chain
to<00:01:35.310> its<00:01:35.430> natural<00:01:35.850> starting<00:01:36.119> position<00:01:36.689> whether

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
to its natural starting position whether

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929 
to its natural starting position whether
it's<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.259> top<00:01:37.470> cog<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.159> lower<00:01:38.369> cog

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it's a top cog or the lower cog

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
am set up with the lower cog now when I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.430 
am set up with the lower cog now when I
come<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.030> peddle<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.540> my<00:02:40.960> chain<00:02:41.260> should

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
come to peddle it my chain should

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440 
come to peddle it my chain should
actually<00:02:41.620> drop<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.250> my<00:02:42.460> starting<00:02:42.880> position<00:02:43.060> my

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
actually drop to my starting position my

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.510 
actually drop to my starting position my
natural<00:02:43.840> starting<00:02:44.380> position<00:02:44.800> so<00:02:45.280> now<00:02:45.460> you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
natural starting position so now you

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.360 
natural starting position so now you
guys<00:02:45.880> can<00:02:45.940> see<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.840> now<00:02:47.500> we're<00:02:47.680> properly<00:02:47.920> set

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
up with our high limit to our lower cog

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.370 
up with our high limit to our lower cog
here<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:52.150> what<00:02:52.300> we're<00:02:52.420> going<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.570> do<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.990> we're

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
natural position that we need to start

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.270 
natural position that we need to start
so<00:03:30.780> I'm<00:03:30.990> going<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.170> pedal<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.740> now<00:03:31.890> I'm<00:03:32.130> going

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
to go through all the gears so I get up

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.950 
to go through all the gears so I get up
to<00:03:34.440> my<00:03:34.620> lower<00:03:34.860> limit<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:38.090> as<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.240> do<00:03:39.300> this<00:03:39.660> I'm

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
to my lower limit and as I do this I'm

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.200 
to my lower limit and as I do this I'm
going<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:41.310> dealing<00:03:41.670> with<00:03:41.700> barrel

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
going to be dealing with barrel

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.030 
going to be dealing with barrel
adjustment<00:03:42.720> like<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:43.080> talked<00:03:43.350> about<00:03:43.470> earlier

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
adjustment like we talked about earlier

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.340 
adjustment like we talked about earlier
in<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.400> tech<00:03:44.640> tip<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:45.060> barrel<00:03:45.660> adjustment<00:03:46.200> and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
in a tech tip of barrel adjustment and

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.880 
in a tech tip of barrel adjustment and
this<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.460> fine-tune<00:03:48.210> your<00:03:49.110> rear

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
this is to fine-tune your rear

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.040 
this is to fine-tune your rear
derailleur<00:03:50.220> I'm<00:03:51.180> going<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.390> go<00:03:51.480> up<00:03:51.570> one<00:03:51.780> here

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
derailleur I'm going to go up one here

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.740 
derailleur I'm going to go up one here
and<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.190> notice<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.790> hasn't<00:03:54.120> gone<00:03:54.210> up<00:03:54.450> so

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
I'm going to make that adjustment I'm

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.920 
I'm going to make that adjustment I'm
going<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.600> turn<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:59.570> until<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:00.630> gear

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
going to turn it in until that gear

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.080 
going to turn it in until that gear
moves<00:04:01.140> up<00:04:03.890> there<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.850> want<00:04:05.940> to

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
moves up there it is and you want to

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.970 
moves up there it is and you want to
hear<00:04:06.240> it<00:04:06.330> move<00:04:06.510> up<00:04:06.660> nice<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:06.930> clean<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.890> I'm

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
hear it move up nice and clean so I'm

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.980 
hear it move up nice and clean so I'm
going<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.130> back<00:04:08.310> down

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
going to back down
