00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.763
 (Safety first) 

00:00:00.798 --> 00:00:02.263
 This is the neutron cream 

00:00:02.298 --> 00:00:05.774
 It was made by our lovely makeup group members Debbie and Karen. 

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:07.609
 We lied to several actors 

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:10.846
 Say they have to apply a special cream when they want to enter this laser room. 

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:12.868
 Prevent neutrons... hurt... 

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:19.644
 Simon, this guy is annoying. He throws the neutron cream to Chris and asks him to paint. 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:20.784
 Chris said, "Hey?" 

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:24.907
 I started from Anton first, but Chuck was really deceived. 

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:27.771
 Neutron Frost~~~(Crash) 

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:29.538
 Then we went to Jolie 

00:00:29.573 --> 00:00:34.183
 I was adjusting a lens Roy at the time to ask me how some lines were expressed. 

00:00:34.218 --> 00:00:36.997
 a little bit of neutron cream on the face 

00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:39.828
 Simon is posing behind her face. 

00:00:39.763 --> 00:00:41.246
 Are we going to jump? 

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:42.655
 What to jump 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.821
 Because the ions in the air will stick to the body, so I jump every time... 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.887
 - Can help... - Hey, good. 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.517
 (First Assistant Director) Everyone jumps together to get rid of the ion 喔

00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:52.818
 You...it won't also... 

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:55.397
 Oh, no. 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.888
 Benny is now being deceived by us. 

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:01.499
 One point, two points, three points, four points 

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:02.635
 One on each of the two wrists 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.102
 The list I signed on reads: 

00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:09.224
 I signed this document and assumed the following legal responsibilities. 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.642
 StarCraft 2, produced by Paramount Pictures... 

00:01:12.677 --> 00:01:18.280
 Cognizing that this topical topical neutron cream does not exist...what?! 

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:23.143
 (wall crash) 

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:27.716
 This is... neutron cream? 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.176
 Is this okay? 

00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.364
 I have always been sympathetic to being played 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.175
 But seeing Benny, John and Carl were cheated like this 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.373
 Really... very cool 

00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:42.131
 - I am the actor Zhou John - and I am Carl Erben. 

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.661
 Here is the National Neutron Lighting Facility (NIF) 

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:48.414
 We are here to try to find ways to make nuclear fusion. 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.747
 - Goodbye, I wish you a happy time - you will have a good time in the future. 

00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:54.393
 - I am Zhou John - and I am Calhoun. 

00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:56.036
 We have been... 

00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:57.819
 Played 

00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:14.675
 That was the last day of shooting. I really don’t want it to end. 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.286
 That’s really the most hilarious thing I’ve seen in my life.
