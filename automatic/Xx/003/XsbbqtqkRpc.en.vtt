00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
well we're here at the circuit of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.830 
well we're here at the circuit of

1 car on the track it's not normal for

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.149 
1 car on the track it's not normal for
us<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.330> europe<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.659> be<00:01:47.780> driving<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:48.649> dirt<00:01:48.680> i

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
us and europe to be driving on dirt i

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.560 
us and europe to be driving on dirt i
know<00:01:49.460> there's<00:01:49.670> certain<00:01:49.790> american<00:01:50.390> race

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
know there's certain american race

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.109 
know there's certain american race
series<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:51.250> experience<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.430> but<00:01:52.700> i've<00:01:53.060> had

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
series that experience that but i've had

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.910 
series that experience that but i've had
a<00:01:53.180> couple<00:01:53.240> times<00:01:53.600> up<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:54.500> down<00:01:54.649> it's

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
a couple times up and down it's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.740 
a couple times up and down it's
certainly<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.909> circuit<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.330> drivers<00:01:56.659> are

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
certainly a circuit the drivers are

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.149 
certainly a circuit the drivers are
going<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.960> enjoy<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.170> lot<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.500> elevation<00:01:57.950> change

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
going to enjoy a lot of elevation change

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.429 
going to enjoy a lot of elevation change
here<00:01:58.570> well<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.600> think<00:01:59.659> that<00:01:59.960> one<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.289> big

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
here well I think that one of the big

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.050 
here well I think that one of the big
cells<00:02:00.649> here<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.159> one<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.399> big<00:02:01.520> ass<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.880> try

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
cells here and one of the big ass to try

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.429 
cells here and one of the big ass to try
make<00:02:02.210> formula<00:02:02.390> one<00:02:02.600> popular<00:02:02.899> America<00:02:03.289> is<00:02:03.380> that

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
make formula one popular America is that

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.990 
make formula one popular America is that
you've<00:02:03.710> got<00:02:03.799> some<00:02:03.950> great<00:02:04.130> racing<00:02:04.369> series<00:02:04.700> here

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
you've got some great racing series here

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.520 
you've got some great racing series here
already<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.450> know<00:02:05.479> Nazca<00:02:05.930> was<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.080> huge<00:02:06.259> see<00:02:06.470> it

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
already you know Nazca was a huge see it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.650 
already you know Nazca was a huge see it
is<00:02:06.649> IRL<00:02:07.490> if<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:07.700> want<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.909> watch<00:02:08.000> open<00:02:08.539> wheel

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
is IRL if you want to watch open wheel

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.779 
is IRL if you want to watch open wheel
racing<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:09.560> what<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:09.800> would<00:02:10.009> say<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.399> those<00:02:10.640> who

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
racing but what I would say to those who

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.100 
racing but what I would say to those who
don't<00:02:10.970> know<00:02:11.000> about<00:02:11.180> former<00:02:11.480> one<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.810> former

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
don't know about former one and former

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.990 
don't know about former one and former
one<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.560> fastest<00:02:13.040> car<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.459> goes<00:02:13.550> round<00:02:13.760> a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
one is the fastest car that goes round a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.940 
one is the fastest car that goes round a
road<00:02:14.450> course<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:15.260> know<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.440> may<00:02:15.560> not<00:02:15.590> do<00:02:15.830> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
road course you know it may not do the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.360 
road course you know it may not do the
top<00:02:16.069> speeds<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.640> NASCAR<00:02:17.510> or<00:02:17.540> IRL<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.739> could<00:02:19.160> if

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
top speeds of NASCAR or IRL it could if

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.740 
top speeds of NASCAR or IRL it could if
we<00:02:19.459> took<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.700> wings<00:02:19.970> off<00:02:20.150> but<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:20.660> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
we took the wings off but we have the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.150 
we took the wings off but we have the
wings<00:02:20.900> there<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.260> push<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.709> car<00:02:21.860> into<00:02:22.130> the

here

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.680 

he<00:03:25.980> tuned<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.459> about<00:03:26.970> four<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.510> half<00:03:27.540> days

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
he tuned to about four and a half days

00:03:27.690 --> 00:04:00.530 
he tuned to about four and a half days
we<00:03:28.620> had<00:03:28.769> 44<00:03:29.370> minutes

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:22.379 

Oh

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.330 

I<00:04:22.569> think<00:04:23.319> that<00:04:23.469> from<00:04:23.740> from<00:04:24.069> the<00:04:24.189> fan

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
I think that from from the fan

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.559 
I think that from from the fan
perspective<00:04:24.699> I<00:04:25.060> think<00:04:25.090> it's<00:04:25.360> going<00:04:25.449> to<00:04:25.509> be

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:25.569 
perspective I think it's going to be

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:26.999 
perspective I think it's going to be
something<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:25.900> American<00:04:26.439> fans<00:04:26.590> are<00:04:26.770> used<00:04:26.919> to

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
something that American fans are used to

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.700 
something that American fans are used to
you<00:04:27.189> know<00:04:27.310> we're<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> stadium<00:04:28.090> society<00:04:28.780> where

you know we're a stadium society where
you<00:04:29.830> can<00:04:29.979> see<00:04:30.129> most<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.490> playing<00:04:30.729> field

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:31.029 
you can see most the playing field

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:32.339 
you can see most the playing field
whether<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.389> be<00:04:31.509> football<00:04:31.900> baseball<00:04:32.110> or

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
whether it be football baseball or

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.309 
whether it be football baseball or
basketball<00:04:32.580> even<00:04:33.580> NASCAR<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.539> I<00:04:34.840> think<00:04:34.960> that

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
basketball even NASCAR so I think that

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.080 
basketball even NASCAR so I think that
this<00:04:35.469> track<00:04:35.770> with<00:04:36.009> the<00:04:36.249> east<00:04:36.610> side<00:04:36.849> of<00:04:36.909> the

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
this track with the east side of the

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.790 
this track with the east side of the
track<00:04:37.300> being<00:04:37.479> elevated<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.289> West<00:04:38.499> is

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
track being elevated to the West is

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.830 
track being elevated to the West is
going<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.430> be<00:04:39.759> one<00:04:39.969> of<00:04:39.999> the<00:04:40.120> few<00:04:40.270> road<00:04:40.509> courses

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
going to be one of the few road courses

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.510 
going to be one of the few road courses
in<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.169> world<00:04:41.199> where<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.650> can<00:04:41.800> see<00:04:41.949> multiple

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
in the world where you can see multiple

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.129 
in the world where you can see multiple
corners<00:04:42.909> that<00:04:43.210> I<00:04:43.270> think<00:04:43.569> fans<00:04:43.840> will<00:04:44.050> enjoy

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
corners that I think fans will enjoy

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.950

that<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:45.520> then<00:04:45.699> I<00:04:45.729> think<00:04:46.060> we're<00:04:46.389> going<00:04:46.719> to<00:04:46.840> be

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
that and then I think we're going to be

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.589 
that and then I think we're going to be
able<00:04:47.139> to<00:04:47.409> accomplish<00:04:47.680> building<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:49.060> closest
