compared<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.340> thing

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
compared to this thing

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.300 
compared to this thing
this<00:01:12.030> thing's<00:01:12.270> much<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:13.020> lighter<00:01:13.320> part<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
this thing's much much lighter part of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.440 
this thing's much much lighter part of
the<00:01:14.369> reason<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.760> they've<00:01:15.000> gotten<00:01:15.270> rid<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the reason is that they've gotten rid of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.230 
the reason is that they've gotten rid of
a<00:01:15.689> whole<00:01:15.840> bunch<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.229> nose<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.030> take

a whole bunch of nose on it in a take
you<00:01:18.360> know<00:01:18.450> by<00:01:18.570> taking<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.049> knows<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you know by taking out that knows it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.690 
you know by taking out that knows it
