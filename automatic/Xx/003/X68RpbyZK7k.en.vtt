totally like we guard that with the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.310 
totally like we guard that with the
laser<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.799> I'm<00:00:14.130> going<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.849> show<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.289> how<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
laser and I'm going to show you how I

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.939 
laser and I'm going to show you how I
rigged<00:00:16.710> my<00:00:16.920> boat<00:00:18.260> first<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.439> start<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
rigged my boat first we start with the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.090 
rigged my boat first we start with the
Cunningham<00:00:20.400> system<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:21.869> these<00:00:22.560> days<00:00:22.800> using

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
Cunningham system I'm these days using

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.230 
Cunningham system I'm these days using
the<00:00:23.340> Neo<00:00:23.580> release<00:00:23.939> from<00:00:24.210> Hawk<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> T<00:00:25.650> 18

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
the Neo release from Hawk and the T 18

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.260 
the Neo release from Hawk and the T 18
it's<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.420> small<00:00:29.210> small<00:00:30.210> piece<00:00:30.630> made<00:00:32.270> very

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it's a small small piece made very

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.319 
it's a small small piece made very
friction<00:00:33.809> free<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.550> use<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.180> it's

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
friction free so I use it because it's

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.040 
friction free so I use it because it's
very<00:00:36.390> light<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.079> very<00:00:38.040> very<00:00:38.850> good<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.719> trim

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
very light and very very good to trim

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.619 
very light and very very good to trim
and<00:00:40.290> ease<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.160> ropes<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.820> ropes<00:00:41.850> run<00:00:42.329> really

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and ease the ropes the ropes run really

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.580 
and ease the ropes the ropes run really
freely<00:00:42.899> through<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> blocks<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:45.840> bank<00:00:46.140> we

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
freely through the blocks the bank we

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.819 
freely through the blocks the bank we
have<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.039> harken<00:00:47.520> bank<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> laser<00:00:48.360> I

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
have the harken bank for the laser I

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.220 
have the harken bank for the laser I
actually<00:00:49.829> take<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.579> perches<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.629> use<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
actually take one perches out I use the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
actually take one perches out I use the
ten<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.070> some<00:00:53.640> people<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> use<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
ten to one some people you use the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.080 
ten to one some people you use the
twelve<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.309> but<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.730> good<00:00:56.850> thing

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
twelve to one but the really good thing

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.010 
twelve to one but the really good thing
is<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.539> very<00:00:57.719> easy<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.649> adjust<00:00:58.770> I<00:01:00.020> also

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
is that it's very easy to adjust I also

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.270 
is that it's very easy to adjust I also
use<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> T<00:01:01.680> 18<00:01:02.750> on<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> Otto<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
use the T 18 on the Otto and the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.060 
use the T 18 on the Otto and the
Cunningham<00:01:06.170> remember<00:01:07.170> when<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.830> that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
Cunningham remember when you do it that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.429 
Cunningham remember when you do it that
you<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.790> lace<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.270> using<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> small

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
you have to lace it with using the small

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.980 
you have to lace it with using the small
rope<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.860> comes<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> block<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.880> make

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
rope that comes with the block and make

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.030 
rope that comes with the block and make
the<00:01:12.990> tiny<00:01:14.000> knots<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> tip<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.720> avoid<00:01:16.049> them

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the tiny knots at the tip to avoid them

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.810 
the tiny knots at the tip to avoid them
to<00:01:17.220> come<00:01:17.430> off<00:01:18.740> coming<00:01:19.740> back<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> boat<00:01:20.610> I

Bo and the really good thing about it is
that<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.850> switch<00:02:00.299> swedish<00:02:01.110> switch<00:02:01.680> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that you can switch swedish switch it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.690 
that you can switch swedish switch it
off<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.159> on

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.370 

so<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.939> light<00:02:06.090> area<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.869> switch<00:02:07.200> it

so in the light area you can switch it

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.650 
so in the light area you can switch it
switches<00:02:07.799> off<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> downwind<00:02:09.090> legs<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
switches off for the downwind legs and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.229 
switches off for the downwind legs and
then<00:02:09.929> when<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.039> becomes<00:02:11.310> windy<00:02:11.700> again<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
then when it becomes windy again you

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.880 
then when it becomes windy again you
switch<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> ratchet<00:02:15.890> comes

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
switch it on and then the ratchet comes

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.220 
switch it on and then the ratchet comes
in<00:02:18.890> showing<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.450> mainsheet<00:02:21.450> blocks<00:02:21.930> the
