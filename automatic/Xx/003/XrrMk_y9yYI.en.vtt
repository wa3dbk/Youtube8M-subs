 recover abandoned objects 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.950
 but a few days from here I had heard of a tomb 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.780
 some time spent climbing another good listening 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.960
 is nothing but asina loaded with gold 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.330
 I could have loaded the 20 or 30 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.500
 if those parts were not ticked 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.460
 however - gone with so much of that stuff that I could live pleasantly for 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 a few years ruby ​​ruby ​​dead 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.340
 much easier than robbing idv 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.460
 why should I feel guilty 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.490
 okay i took a while do rome the owner had been dead for three centuries 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.150

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.770
 if to someone waiting for you 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.040
 a whole world of people 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.500

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.690

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.100

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.860

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.399
 the game would be easier if we follow the rules there are some 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.029
 rules 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.119

 here you can also breathe 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.929
