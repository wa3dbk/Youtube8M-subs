ventilation<00:01:23.229> this<00:01:24.229> shoe<00:01:24.410> like<00:01:24.650> takes<00:01:24.950> time<00:01:25.280> to

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
ventilation this shoe like takes time to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.710 
ventilation this shoe like takes time to
break<00:01:25.729> in<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:27.610> but<00:01:28.610> when<00:01:28.790> once<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.330> breaks<00:01:29.450> it

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
break in so but when once it breaks it

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.180 
break in so but when once it breaks it
like<00:01:29.869> you'll<00:01:30.140> see<00:01:30.320> how<00:01:30.470> flexible<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.970> is

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
like you'll see how flexible that it is

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.290 
like you'll see how flexible that it is
like<00:01:34.190> ours<00:01:34.670> like<00:01:34.880> i<00:01:34.910> mentioned<00:01:35.090> earlier

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
like ours like i mentioned earlier

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.950 
like ours like i mentioned earlier
ventilation<00:01:36.170> was<00:01:36.320> really<00:01:36.590> good<00:01:36.820> so<00:01:37.960> basically

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
ventilation was really good so basically

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.170 
ventilation was really good so basically
first<00:01:39.440> time<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:39.950> felt<00:01:40.190> like<00:01:40.340> on<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.759> tongue<00:01:41.000> I

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
first time I felt like on the tongue I

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.120 
first time I felt like on the tongue I
thought<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.479> was<00:01:41.600> kind<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:42.290> there's

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
thought it was kind and so I there's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.859 
thought it was kind and so I there's
blowing<00:01:43.550> air<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.860> could<00:01:45.860> feel<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.490> air

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
blowing air and I could feel the air

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.210 
blowing air and I could feel the air
going<00:01:47.869> other<00:01:48.110> side<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.470> know<00:01:48.650> that<00:01:48.860> he<00:01:49.009> is

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
going other side so you know that he is

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.999 
going other side so you know that he is
like<00:01:49.490> going<00:01:49.759> through<00:01:49.910> now<00:01:50.450> my<00:01:51.320> favorite<00:01:51.680> part

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
like going through now my favorite part

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.880 
like going through now my favorite part
of<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.550> shoe<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.060> say<00:01:53.300> we<00:01:53.450> pull<00:01:53.660> out<00:01:53.890> with

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
of the shoe and I say we pull out with

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.580 
of the shoe and I say we pull out with
the<00:01:55.070> adaptive<00:01:55.610> fit<00:01:56.020> first<00:01:57.020> time<00:01:57.230> I<00:01:57.320> saw<00:01:57.530> the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
the adaptive fit first time I saw the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.560 
the adaptive fit first time I saw the
adaptive<00:01:58.310> fit<00:01:58.460> outside<00:01:58.790> car<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.150> could<00:01:59.360> be

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
adaptive fit outside car it could be

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.850 
adaptive fit outside car it could be
another<00:01:59.960> gimmick<00:02:00.320> for<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:01.730> shoe<00:02:02.080> but<00:02:03.080> no<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:03.830> I

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
another gimmick for the shoe but no so I

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.070 
another gimmick for the shoe but no so I
took<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.370> liberty<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.790> take<00:02:05.180> out<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.510> out<00:02:05.690> the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
took the liberty to take out the out the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.609 
took the liberty to take out the out the
insole

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.229 

if<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.159> can<00:02:09.310> see<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.580> have<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.819> fit<00:02:10.030> it

if you can see that have to fit it

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.020 
if you can see that have to fit it
stitched<00:02:10.629> in<00:02:10.869> there<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.280> really<00:02:12.700> know<00:02:12.970> you

alright the cause of the shoe like I

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.480 
alright the cause of the shoe like I
mentioned<00:02:35.080> earlier<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.800> takes<00:02:36.160> time<00:02:36.340> to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
mentioned earlier this takes time to

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.600 
mentioned earlier this takes time to
break<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.590> really<00:02:38.890> hurt<00:02:39.160> my<00:02:39.190> feet

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
there you see easy where they're folded

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.620 
there you see easy where they're folded

like<00:02:46.660> squeezing<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:47.830> hurts<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.670> little

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
like squeezing and so it hurts a little

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.150 
like squeezing and so it hurts a little
bit<00:02:49.000> but<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.840> said<00:02:50.200> give<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.530> like<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:50.800> lot<00:02:51.040> of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
bit but I said give it like a lot of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.240 
bit but I said give it like a lot of
break<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.550> time<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.420> will<00:02:52.600> love<00:02:53.250> what's

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
in the shoe so this is the only part

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.830 
in the shoe so this is the only part
that<00:02:56.050> gave<00:02:56.440> me<00:02:56.470> problems<00:02:57.570> second<00:02:58.570> thing<00:02:58.720> is

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
that gave me problems second thing is

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.400 
that gave me problems second thing is
like<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.050> fit<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.530> shoe<00:02:59.940> I'm<00:03:01.410> usually

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
like the fit of the shoe I'm usually

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.100 
like the fit of the shoe I'm usually
size<00:03:02.830> 12<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.490> I<00:03:03.520> bought<00:03:03.820> this<00:03:04.000> in<00:03:04.180> size<00:03:04.360> 13<00:03:04.390> and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
size 12 so I bought this in size 13 and

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.710 
size 12 so I bought this in size 13 and
size<00:03:06.010> 13<00:03:06.430> where<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.700> made<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.060> feel<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.510> little

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
size 13 where it made it feel a little

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.050 
size 13 where it made it feel a little
bit<00:03:07.900> more<00:03:08.110> comfortable<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.640> fit<00:03:09.880> is

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
bit more comfortable so the fit is

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.640 
bit more comfortable so the fit is
narrowing<00:03:10.390> true<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.720> size<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.230> are<00:03:11.260> you

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
narrowing true to size so are you

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.790 
narrowing true to size so are you
usually<00:03:11.800> like<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:13.270> know<00:03:13.360> having<00:03:13.660> 1111<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> nap

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
usually like you know having 1111 a nap

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.560

or size 12 in my collection but never

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.190 
or size 12 in my collection but never
size<00:03:16.900> 13<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.670> had<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:18.910> reach<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.209> size<00:03:19.390> 13<00:03:19.900> for

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
size 13 so I had to reach a size 13 for

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.830 
size 13 so I had to reach a size 13 for
it<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.350> be<00:03:20.470> comfortable<00:03:21.300> now<00:03:22.300> another<00:03:22.690> thing
