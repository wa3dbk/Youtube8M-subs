we're<00:00:10.110> going<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.290> set<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.800> wheel

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
we're going to set the wheel

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.720 
we're going to set the wheel
circumference<00:00:11.960> the<00:00:12.960> exact<00:00:13.469> measurement<00:00:14.309> we

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
circumference the exact measurement we

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.670 
circumference the exact measurement we
just<00:00:14.969> measured<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> wheel<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.350> wrote<00:00:16.560> it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
just measured the wheel and we wrote it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.370 
just measured the wheel and we wrote it
down<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:17.940> got<00:00:19.460> 2187<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.609> millimeters<00:00:21.380> if

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
down and we got 2187 in millimeters if

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
down and we got 2187 in millimeters if
we<00:00:23.010> were<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.310> go<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.490> centimeters<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> would<00:00:24.630> be

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
we were to go to centimeters it would be

we were to go to centimeters it would be
219<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> take<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> seven<00:00:26.340> rounded<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:26.820> then<00:00:27.269> it

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
219 I take the seven rounded up then it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.570 
219 I take the seven rounded up then it
will<00:00:27.480> be<00:00:27.570> 219<00:00:28.140> 219<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.920> centimeters<00:00:29.279> okay

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
will be 219 219 and centimeters okay

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
so let's get to our clock distance

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.570 
so let's get to our clock distance
average<00:05:00.370> speed<00:05:00.730> maximum<00:05:01.480> speed<00:05:01.900> calorie<00:05:02.550> OD<00:05:03.550> o

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.120 
average speed maximum speed calorie OD o
clock<00:05:04.150> finally<00:05:05.080> we're<00:05:05.260> at<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.470> clock<00:05:05.680> okay<00:05:05.920> so

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
clock finally we're at the clock okay so

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.980 
clock finally we're at the clock okay so
now<00:05:06.400> we're<00:05:06.550> going<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.700> set<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.090> clock<00:05:07.240> first

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
now we're going to set the clock first

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.510 
now we're going to set the clock first
we<00:05:08.170> need<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.410> know<00:05:08.560> exactly<00:05:08.950> what<00:05:09.130> time<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.460> is

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
we need to know exactly what time it is

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.400 
we need to know exactly what time it is
right<00:05:09.580> now<00:05:09.730> I'm<00:05:10.330> guessing<00:05:10.750> it's<00:05:10.990> around<00:05:11.200> 4

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410
