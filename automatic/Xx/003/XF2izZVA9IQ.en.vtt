00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
load-bearing Ridge this is not

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.180 
load-bearing Ridge this is not
applicable<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.690> compression<00:01:01.140> roofs<00:01:01.559> where

applicable in compression roofs where
your<00:01:02.430> ridge<00:01:02.670> beam<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.500> load-bearing<00:01:05.510> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
your ridge beam is not load-bearing so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.880 
your ridge beam is not load-bearing so
just<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.840> aware<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.530> make<00:01:07.590> sure<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
just be aware of that and make sure that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.420 
just be aware of that and make sure that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you're sizing the structural member for

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
you're sizing the structural member for

different types of live load here you
can<00:01:44.670> set<00:01:44.909> these<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> default<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:47.329> we'll

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
can set these all as a default so we'll

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.530 
can set these all as a default so we'll

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
in this graphic here

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.789 
in this graphic here
you<00:02:27.099> only<00:02:27.310> need<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.670> input<00:02:28.079> three<00:02:29.079> of<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.530> four

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
you only need to input three of the four

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.479 
you only need to input three of the four
pieces<00:02:30.069> of<00:02:30.250> information<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:32.590> are<00:02:32.950> we<00:02:33.069> going<00:02:33.340> to

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
pieces of information so are we going to

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.830 
pieces of information so are we going to
have<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:34.030> roof<00:02:34.659> slope<00:02:35.280> for<00:02:36.280> one<00:02:36.459> side<00:02:36.730> say<00:02:37.450> both

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
have a roof slope for one side say both

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.160 
have a roof slope for one side say both
of<00:02:37.870> these<00:02:38.200> sides<00:02:38.920> are<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.879> same<00:02:39.909> it<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:41.049> be

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
of these sides are the same it can be

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.979 
of these sides are the same it can be
six<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.620> six<00:02:41.920> or<00:02:42.730> twelve<00:02:43.389> and<00:02:43.480> twelve<00:02:43.689> or

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
six and six or twelve and twelve or

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.809 
six and six or twelve and twelve or
whatever<00:02:44.349> slope<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.010> then<00:02:45.519> you're<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:45.760> to

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
whatever slope and then you're going to

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.809 
whatever slope and then you're going to
input<00:02:46.269> one<00:02:46.920> distance<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:48.250> accordance<00:02:48.790> with

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
input one distance in accordance with

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.809 
input one distance in accordance with
this<00:02:49.090> graphic<00:02:49.389> here<00:02:49.599> so<00:02:50.049> we'll<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:50.260> put<00:02:50.590> in

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
this graphic here so we'll just put in

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.770 
this graphic here so we'll just put in
thirteen<00:02:51.819> feet<00:02:52.889> and<00:02:54.239> you'll<00:02:55.239> notice<00:02:55.569> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
thirteen feet and you'll notice the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.259 
thirteen feet and you'll notice the
other<00:02:56.019> distance<00:02:56.590> fills<00:02:56.859> in<00:02:57.129> as<00:02:57.579> well<00:02:57.939> down<00:02:58.239> at

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
other distance fills in as well down at

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.319 
other distance fills in as well down at
the<00:02:58.480> bottom<00:02:58.599> of<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.870> screen<00:02:59.819> now<00:03:00.819> let's<00:03:01.030> say

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
the bottom of the screen now let's say

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.750 
the bottom of the screen now let's say
there's<00:03:01.989> an<00:03:02.230> adjustment<00:03:02.620> we're<00:03:03.579> going<00:03:03.700> to

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
there's an adjustment we're going to

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.309 
there's an adjustment we're going to
clear<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.299> out<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.930> was<00:03:05.049> from<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
clear this out that was from the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.809 
clear this out that was from the
right-click<00:03:05.500> menu<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:06.340> can<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.639> right

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
right-click menu you can just right

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.490 
right-click menu you can just right
click<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.090> clear<00:03:07.540> all<00:03:07.739> input<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:08.980> start<00:03:09.220> over

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
click and clear all input and start over

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.449 
click and clear all input and start over
so<00:03:11.500> we're<00:03:11.620> going<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.799> change<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.250> back<00:03:12.430> to

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
so we're going to change that back to

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.149 
so we're going to change that back to
bottom<00:03:13.019> let's<00:03:14.019> say<00:03:14.139> we<00:03:14.290> have<00:03:14.409> a<00:03:14.439> bastard<00:03:14.980> hip

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
bottom let's say we have a bastard hip

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.180 
bottom let's say we have a bastard hip
where<00:03:15.760> our<00:03:16.090> slopes<00:03:16.419> are<00:03:16.629> different<00:03:17.049> so<00:03:18.010> we

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
where our slopes are different so we

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.520 
where our slopes are different so we
could<00:03:18.370> have<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.609> twelve<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.720> twelve<00:03:19.930> slope<00:03:20.349> on

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
could have a twelve and twelve slope on

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.219 
could have a twelve and twelve slope on
this<00:03:20.739> plane<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:22.150> ten<00:03:22.359> and<00:03:22.479> twelve<00:03:22.720> slope<00:03:23.049> on

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
this plane and a ten and twelve slope on

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:25.649 
this plane and a ten and twelve slope on
this<00:03:23.470> plane<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.099> you<00:03:24.669> still<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.359> need<00:03:25.540> to

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
this plane and you still just need to

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.599 
this plane and you still just need to
put<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:25.959> one<00:03:26.319> distance<00:03:26.859> and<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.489> will

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
put in one distance and it will

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.449 
put in one distance and it will
calculate<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.299> other<00:03:28.419> for<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:29.069> so<00:03:30.069> if<00:03:30.159> we<00:03:30.250> say

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
calculate the other for you so if we say

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.839 
calculate the other for you so if we say
again<00:03:30.790> thirteen<00:03:31.419> feet<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:33.099> it<00:03:33.639> calculates

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
again thirteen feet and it calculates

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.399 
again thirteen feet and it calculates
the<00:03:34.329> distance<00:03:34.769> down<00:03:35.769> here<00:03:36.959> then<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.109> put<00:03:38.290> in

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
the distance down here then you put in

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:44.430 
the distance down here then you put in
your<00:03:38.440> overhang<00:03:41.669> and<00:03:42.669> it<00:03:43.299> calculates<00:03:43.840> again

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
your overhang and it calculates again

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.539 
your overhang and it calculates again
your<00:03:45.220> proper<00:03:45.549> overhang<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.659> other<00:03:46.780> side

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
your proper overhang on the other side

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.949 
your proper overhang on the other side
now<00:03:48.549> moving<00:03:48.760> across<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.180> bottom<00:03:49.540> we<00:03:49.870> have

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
now moving across the bottom we have

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.559 
now moving across the bottom we have
spans<00:03:50.349> and<00:03:50.560> supports<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:52.030> notice<00:03:52.419> our

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
spans and supports you notice our

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.710 
spans and supports you notice our
graphic<00:03:53.019> is<00:03:53.139> updated<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.419> most<00:03:55.419> of<00:03:55.569> our

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
graphic is updated and most of our

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.580 
graphic is updated and most of our
values<00:03:56.319> are<00:03:56.560> locked<00:03:56.919> down<00:03:57.419> it<00:03:58.419> also<00:03:58.689> figures

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
values are locked down it also figures

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.699 
values are locked down it also figures
out<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.919> slope<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.319> have<00:04:02.560> your

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
out the slope so you have your

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.800 
out the slope so you have your
horizontal<00:04:03.370> distances<00:04:03.909> as<00:04:04.150> well<00:04:04.419> as<00:04:04.599> your
