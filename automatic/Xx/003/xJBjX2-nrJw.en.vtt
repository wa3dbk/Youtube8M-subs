all right now the next thing often asked
by<00:00:03.000> students<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.720> how<00:00:03.929> do<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.110> duplicate<00:00:04.770> how

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
by students is how do you duplicate how

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.249 
by students is how do you duplicate how
do<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.279> move<00:00:05.430> how<00:00:05.940> do<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.120> join<00:00:06.359> well<00:00:06.990> not

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
do you move how do you join well not

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.839 
do you move how do you join well not
join<00:00:07.529> because<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.130> didn't<00:00:08.460> know<00:00:08.519> what<00:00:08.639> join

and you can imagine you can quickly

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.439 
and you can imagine you can quickly
build<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.750> wall<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.260> whatever<00:00:56.210> now<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.329> you

build up a wall or whatever now if you
want<00:00:57.660> these<00:00:57.840> objects<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.649> function<00:00:59.370> or<00:01:00.239> share

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
want these objects to function or share

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
want these objects to function or share
components<00:01:01.079> right<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> click<00:01:02.399> on

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489

each one and hit tab to get into the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.429 
each one and hit tab to get into the
components<00:01:05.040> also<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.689> look<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:06.930> here

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
components also you can look over here

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.520 
components also you can look over here
and<00:01:07.590> you'll<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.180> fact

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
and you'll see that the are in fact

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.789 
and you'll see that the are in fact
separated<00:01:10.530> there's<00:01:10.920> six<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.670> altogether

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.640 

if<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.979> hold<00:01:17.280> shift<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.150> highlight<00:01:19.020> each<00:01:19.200> one

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
if I hold shift and highlight each one

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950 
if I hold shift and highlight each one
all<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.790> way<00:01:20.880> across<00:01:21.119> notice<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
all the way across notice that the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.100 
all the way across notice that the
circle<00:01:22.890> turns<00:01:23.130> orange<00:01:23.430> over<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:25.020> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
circle turns orange over here and then I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.969 
circle turns orange over here and then I
can<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> object<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.280> join<00:01:26.790> them<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.979> now

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
can go to object and join them I now

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.249 
can go to object and join them I now
have<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:30.630> underneath<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:33.259> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
have one and underneath that I have the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.710 
have one and underneath that I have the
vertex<00:01:34.650> group<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.340> material<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.540> can

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
vertex group and the material but I can

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.929 
vertex group and the material but I can
never<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> each<00:01:37.530> individual<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.670> in

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
never get to the each individual one in

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120 
never get to the each individual one in
object<00:01:39.360> mode<00:01:39.420> now<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:40.650> an<00:01:40.770> advocate

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
object mode now so if I'm an advocate

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.840 
object mode now so if I'm an advocate
this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.030> an<00:01:42.180> object<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.810> can't<00:01:43.680> separate<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.549> in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this is an object I can't separate it in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.929 
this is an object I can't separate it in
object<00:01:45.329> mode<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:46.040> edit<00:01:47.040> mode<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.369> however

object mode in edit mode I can however

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.480 
object mode in edit mode I can however
if<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.450> hit<00:01:48.600> tab<00:01:48.630> again<00:01:48.930> let's<00:01:49.770> say<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.979> want<00:01:50.250> this

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
if I hit tab again let's say I want this

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.810 
if I hit tab again let's say I want this
cube<00:01:51.470> if<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.680> hover<00:01:52.979> over<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> top<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
cube if I hover over the top of it and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.289 
cube if I hover over the top of it and
hit<00:01:54.210> L<00:01:54.770> I'll<00:01:55.770> highlight<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> entire<00:01:56.610> object

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
hit L I'll highlight the entire object

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.069 
hit L I'll highlight the entire object
as<00:01:58.140> long<00:01:58.290> as<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.829> separated<00:01:59.549> via<00:02:00.420> component

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
as long as it's separated via component

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.800 
as long as it's separated via component
in<00:02:01.890> other<00:02:01.979> words<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.579> had<00:02:02.790> two<00:02:03.119> vertices

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
in other words if I had two vertices

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.539 
in other words if I had two vertices
that<00:02:03.990> were<00:02:04.290> touching<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.040> joined<00:02:05.340> together

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that were touching and joined together

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.360 
that were touching and joined together
this<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:06.750> not<00:02:06.990> work<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> L<00:02:10.039> allows<00:02:11.039> me<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
this would not work so L allows me to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.890 
this would not work so L allows me to
highlight<00:02:11.580> object

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
highlight object

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.559 
highlight object
off<00:02:13.680> clicking<00:02:14.310> allows<00:02:14.640> me<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.909> deselect<00:02:15.269> them

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
off clicking allows me to deselect them

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.369 
off clicking allows me to deselect them
if<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.769> want<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.189> one<00:02:17.400> separated<00:02:18.209> now<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.629> have

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
if I want this one separated now I have

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.410 
if I want this one separated now I have
to<00:02:19.500> go<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.799> this<00:02:20.329> l<00:02:21.329> over<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.810> top<00:02:22.049> of<00:02:22.230> it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
to go like this l over the top of it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.089 
to go like this l over the top of it
mesh<00:02:24.950> vertices<00:02:26.810> separate<00:02:28.069> selection<00:02:30.829> now<00:02:31.829> if

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
mesh vertices separate selection now if

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.880 
mesh vertices separate selection now if
you<00:02:32.280> hit<00:02:32.519> tab<00:02:32.819> again<00:02:33.060> you'll<00:02:33.810> find<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.319> in

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
you hit tab again you'll find that in

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.149 
you hit tab again you'll find that in
object<00:02:35.340> mode<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:36.540> now<00:02:37.200> two<00:02:37.260> cubes

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
object mode you have now two cubes

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.750 
object mode you have now two cubes
well<00:02:39.060> these<00:02:39.629> cubes<00:02:40.109> which<00:02:41.010> are<00:02:41.189> joined<00:02:41.519> in

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
well these cubes which are joined in

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.110 
well these cubes which are joined in
this<00:02:42.150> cube<00:02:42.420> separated<00:02:43.400> but<00:02:44.400> if<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:44.640> look<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
this cube separated but if you look the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.619 
this cube separated but if you look the
point<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.349> over<00:02:47.069> here<00:02:47.280> now<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.940> center<00:02:48.389> point

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
point is over here now the center point

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.619 
point is over here now the center point
so<00:02:49.310> immediately<00:02:50.310> after<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.940> unjoin

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
so immediately after you unjoin

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.930 
so immediately after you unjoin
something<00:02:52.139> you<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.920> go<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.129> transform

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
something you have to go to transform

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.379 
something you have to go to transform
and<00:02:54.180> say<00:02:54.810> origin<00:02:55.409> to<00:02:55.680> geometry<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:57.239> will

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
and say origin to geometry this will

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.089 
and say origin to geometry this will
place<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.599> origin<00:02:57.959> point<00:02:58.109> back<00:02:58.590> into<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
place the origin point back into the

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.979 
place the origin point back into the
middle<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.489> geometry<00:03:00.060> where<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.870> now

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
middle of the geometry where you can now

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.410 
middle of the geometry where you can now
move<00:03:01.230> rotate<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.250> scale<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.730> from<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.120> center

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
move rotate and scale it from the center

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.050 
move rotate and scale it from the center
of<00:03:03.659> that<00:03:03.780> object<00:03:06.829> okay<00:03:07.829> so<00:03:07.889> that<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.310> joining

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
of that object okay so that is joining

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.390 
of that object okay so that is joining
and<00:03:09.470> separating<00:03:10.819> in<00:03:11.819> itself<00:03:12.359> done<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.950> often

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
and separating in itself done so often

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.900 
and separating in itself done so often
it's<00:03:14.639> pathetic<00:03:14.849> so<00:03:15.389> please<00:03:16.109> take<00:03:16.409> time<00:03:16.910> before

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
it's pathetic so please take time before

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.869 
it's pathetic so please take time before
you<00:03:18.000> go<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:19.019> try<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.500> out<00:03:19.530> join<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.519> couple

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
you go on to try that out join a couple

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.150 
you go on to try that out join a couple
objects<00:03:21.209> together<00:03:21.530> separate<00:03:22.530> them<00:03:22.739> out<00:03:22.859> and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
objects together separate them out and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.840 
objects together separate them out and
then<00:03:23.970> meet<00:03:24.120> me<00:03:24.239> in<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.359> next<00:03:24.510> video
