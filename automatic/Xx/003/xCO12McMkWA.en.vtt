the<00:01:28.549> DNR<00:01:28.850> might<00:01:29.030> come<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.330> put<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.479> bullet<00:01:29.600> in

the DNR might come and put a bullet in
my<00:01:30.020> head<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:31.130> behavior<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.960> DNR<00:01:33.409> in<00:01:33.650> this

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
my head the behavior of the DNR in this

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.750 
my head the behavior of the DNR in this
instance<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.810> chlorophyll<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.640> that

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
instance is the chlorophyll and that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.670 
instance is the chlorophyll and that
behavior<00:01:38.420> needs<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.690> be<00:01:38.750> weeded<00:01:39.080> out<00:01:39.200> we're

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
behavior needs to be weeded out we're

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.140 
behavior needs to be weeded out we're
not<00:01:39.770> putting<00:01:39.979> up<00:01:40.159> with<00:01:40.220> this<00:01:40.369> we<00:01:40.970> have

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
not putting up with this we have

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.810 
not putting up with this we have
authority<00:01:41.869> as<00:01:41.990> American<00:01:42.470> citizens<00:01:42.820> basically

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
authority as American citizens basically

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.560 
authority as American citizens basically
I<00:01:43.850> think<00:01:44.060> what<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.240> DNR<00:01:44.540> wanted<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:44.930> do<00:01:45.250> was

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
I think what the DNR wanted to do was

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.280 
I think what the DNR wanted to do was
stomp<00:01:47.570> their<00:01:47.750> feet<00:01:47.780> tell<00:01:48.710> everybody<00:01:49.010> that<00:01:50.290> you

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
stomp their feet tell everybody that you

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.570 
stomp their feet tell everybody that you
got<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.560> be<00:01:51.650> able<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.920> business<00:01:52.159> career<00:01:52.460> your

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
got to be able to business career your

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.500 
got to be able to business career your
figure<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:52.909> throw<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.299> in<00:01:53.450> jail

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
figure and throw you in jail

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.530 
figure and throw you in jail
and<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.500> figured<00:01:55.770> everybody<00:01:56.040> would<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.370> it

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
and they figured everybody would do it

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.370 
and they figured everybody would do it
but<00:01:57.540> now<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.910> Christian<00:02:00.020> quite<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.050> few<00:02:01.230> ways

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
but now that Christian quite a few ways

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.320 
but now that Christian quite a few ways
that<00:02:01.440> aren't<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.980> do<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.430> don't<00:02:03.180> think

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
that aren't going to do it I don't think

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.750 
that aren't going to do it I don't think
they'd<00:02:03.420> agree<00:02:03.720> know<00:02:03.870> what<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.050> do<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:05.040> know<00:02:05.280> who

they'd agree know what to do we know who

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.690 
they'd agree know what to do we know who
