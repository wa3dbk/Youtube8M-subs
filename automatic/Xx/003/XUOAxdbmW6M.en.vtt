00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.910
 it was another option after him an eternal dilemma 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.550
 that we are not going to solve now 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.730
 all its depth but yes we are going to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.200
 I can give some tips to see which 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.870
 is the problem of each of them 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.600
 in both cases if we get more 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.700
 speed of the appropriate to the input of 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.460
 the grave the two have the same 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.190
 behavior and will continue to see what 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.160
 normally we would call his strip 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.250
 if we enter sighing in a curve not 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.410
 there is no driving technique that what 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.879
 can remedy only serves lose 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.180
 speed 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.430
 that means having some patience if it's 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.950
 necessary to brake slightly so that the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.920
 front axle regain grip and 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.990
 introduce us to the trajectory of the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.180
 basic differences between a traction 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.720
 rear and a front- wheel drive car 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.990
 they occur mostly from half 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.940
 of curve and particularly when 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.850
 we initiate the exit acceleration of the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.250
 same especially in low conditions 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.679
 grip or in enough cars 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.600
 horses with a traction vehicle 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:40.550
 forward if we wait in the curve 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.060
 accelerating will always have a tendency 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.159
 naturally understeering so the nose 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.280
 will try to go outside the 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.640
 curve to avoid understeer 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.670
 power at the exit of the curve 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.880
 as at the entrance it will be necessary to lose 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.130
 speed therefore the first thing will be 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.450
 slow down keeping the turn of 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.700
 steering wheel 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.209
 in the case of a traction vehicle 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.399
 back if we accelerate more to the exit 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.550
 of the curve or half of curve and there 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.099
 little grip on the whole car 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.769
 will have a natural tendency to leave 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.700
 the back correct a 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:25.220
 oversteer involves two maneuvers one 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.769
 lift your foot off the accelerator and two 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.220
 do the maneuver known as against 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.220
 steering wheel 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.019
 we have seen the natural tendency of 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.030
 two types of traction but that does not want 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.180
 say that in particular conditions 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.000
 with front- wheel drive do not go to 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.230
 RWD survive a no 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.900
 I can sigh 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.900
 in any case and as always the most 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.290
 important is the driver's prudence 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.720
 and of course the state of the vehicle 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.850
 especially of the tires that are the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.420
 that have us subject to the asphalt 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.420
