00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.740
 Last Friday, the lights of his headlamps confidently 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.740
 cut the mist of the late evening in 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.380

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.590
 braking breathable novelty heat salon 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 we were one of the first to evaluate 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.279

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.529

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.000
 he works since 1980 began to drive 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.760
 Lasik recently traveled to the Aurora 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.100
 and looking back at your experience speaks in 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.590
 Such a bus will be comfortable for everyone and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.820
 passengers and driver to 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.969
 additionally verify justice 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.329
 words of a seasoned chauffeur we went to and 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.210
 etc. 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.730
 already in the light of day during our 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.149
 Arrival bus prepared to exit 1 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.120
 flight 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.280
 but despite this the companyâ€™s employees 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.180
 taking the time to talk about the new product 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.180
 your fleet 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.409
 observation 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.330
 when a passenger comes in from here to see you 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.400
 the driver did not enter the passenger 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.970
 but on camera creative supervision 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.159
 the doors also closes on them 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.340
 air conditioning and cold air have 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.860
 climate control 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.680
 stands here for each for each 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.439
 passengers somehow like so in themselves 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.060
 the installer had to be invited 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.520
 hand to a new bus somewhere something 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.290
 take nothing and still come 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.490
 what hand to apply here and everything is already 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.460
 provided in car dealerships 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.890
 if everything is already provided by them and where 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.890
 I want to offer oh behind the wheel 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.110
 obvious such a bus drove feeling 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.660
 Vladimir Ponomarev is not difficult to understand 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.060
 even if you do not particularly understand the technical 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.010
 characteristics and yet note for 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.300
 professionals 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.340
 adapted to the South Ural climate 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.060
 highgear powered by cummins engines 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.550
 340 horsepower car 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.820
 environmental class euro 5 goes to 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.410
 diesel fuel with the use of urea 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.810
 the bus is equipped with air suspension 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.630
 which guarantees smoothness and comfort 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.820
 transportations rich salon equipment and 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.370
 presentable appearance successfully 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.560
 complement the overall picture of the giant weight in 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.250
 14 tons picture 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.780
 worth more than five million but can 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.790
 be given our budget deficit 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.280
 it would be more profitable to buy something 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.840
 easier with this question we are directly 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.060
 addressed the head of the district 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.130
 Yes, I agree maybe it would be easier 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.790
 let's take 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.250
 two mercedes sprinter yes 2 200 500 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.010
 assembly or cattle method 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.200
 central Russia are going on but 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.610
 long distance is it them there that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.220
 the car will be comparable to the conditions 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.980
 this car that is due to the long 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.780
 bases we have comfort that is 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.440
 practically keeps the car 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.930
 road transport 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.400
 well on the cable road as we sit 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.440
 rail calmly 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.660
 We can read anything you want it and whether 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.350
 this base is short respectively all these 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.190
 movements below are tiresome after all three with 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.400
 half an hour 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.989
 you will go not to run therefore there 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.650
 where you can pull this off you feet 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.930
 live and lay back what is impossible 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.150
 little bus we understand that 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.280
 our 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.840
 intracity inter - settlement not 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.940
 unprofitable that is, we willy-nilly need 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.160
 let's say master the market that 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.860
 allowed the enterprise to be profitable 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.019
 work up lucky we are now there 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.200
 a blizzard is under construction 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.360
 there are orders there are ordinary orders but maybe 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.790
 it will not happen there in a year 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.250
 these orders and that we will go there again 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.600
 where shall we go that no accordingly we 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.799
 should 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.290
 let's say so redistribute our 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.330
 financial flows so that there is not one 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.010
 planned movement namely multifaceted 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.750
 if there was no other place 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.180
 we got that is that's why this and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.860
 decision is made, that is, they are also urban 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.860
 shipments were not always arrived
