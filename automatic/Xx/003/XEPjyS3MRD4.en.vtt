overdrive<00:01:00.830> pedal<00:01:01.130> really<00:01:02.059> kind<00:01:02.360> of<00:01:02.390> has

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
overdrive pedal really kind of has

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.500 
overdrive pedal really kind of has
transparent<00:01:03.260> carrot<00:01:04.059> characteristics<00:01:05.059> but

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
transparent carrot characteristics but

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.170 
transparent carrot characteristics but
as<00:01:05.630> well<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.260> also<00:01:06.550> can<00:01:07.550> get<00:01:07.729> pretty<00:01:07.910> gritty

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
as well it is also can get pretty gritty

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.390 
as well it is also can get pretty gritty
so<00:01:08.510> let<00:01:09.440> me<00:01:09.530> explain<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.890> controls<00:01:10.130> on<00:01:10.369> it

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
so let me explain the controls on it

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.080 
so let me explain the controls on it
very<00:01:10.670> quickly<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:12.080> is<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.830> gain<00:01:13.070> knob<00:01:13.280> this

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
very quickly this is the gain knob this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.940 
very quickly this is the gain knob this
is<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.390> volume<00:01:14.540> knob<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:15.260> is<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.530> tone<00:01:15.740> knob

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
is the volume knob this is the tone knob

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.010 
is the volume knob this is the tone knob
and<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:16.640> here<00:01:16.910> is<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.090> clipping<00:01:17.540> switch<00:01:17.750> just

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
and this here is a clipping switch just

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.510 
and this here is a clipping switch just
to<00:01:18.140> give<00:01:18.259> you<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.410> little<00:01:18.890> bit<00:01:19.009> of<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.190> different

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
to give you a little bit of a different

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.590 
to give you a little bit of a different
option<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:19.940> when<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:20.240> in<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.420> down<00:01:20.570> position

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
option so when it's in the down position

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.290 
option so when it's in the down position
its<00:01:21.560> clipping<00:01:22.100> more<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.940> circuit<00:01:23.270> and

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
its clipping more of the circuit and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.790 
its clipping more of the circuit and
therefore<00:01:23.570> gets<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.960> little<00:01:24.200> bit<00:01:24.290> quieter<00:01:24.619> but

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
therefore gets a little bit quieter but

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.350 
therefore gets a little bit quieter but
you<00:01:24.890> can<00:01:25.009> just<00:01:25.190> boost<00:01:25.580> it<00:01:25.820> with<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.060> volume

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
you can just boost it with the volume

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.020 
you can just boost it with the volume
here<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.040> really<00:01:28.040> really<00:01:28.580> cool

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
here so really really cool

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.760 
here so really really cool
I<00:01:29.060> want<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.570> show<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.869> little<00:01:30.170> bit<00:01:30.289> of<00:01:30.410> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
I want to show you a little bit of the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.800 
I want to show you a little bit of the
tone<00:01:31.070> control<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.640> we'll<00:01:31.759> start<00:01:32.180> that<00:01:32.450> at

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
tone control so we'll start that at

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.350 
tone control so we'll start that at
about<00:01:33.259> 12<00:01:33.920> o'clock<00:01:34.810> right<00:01:35.810> about<00:01:36.110> here<00:01:36.560> and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
about 12 o'clock right about here and

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.340 
about 12 o'clock right about here and
then<00:01:38.360> I'll<00:01:38.539> show<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:38.840> little<00:01:38.960> bit<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.259> the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
then I'll show you a little bit to the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.840 
then I'll show you a little bit to the
right<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.649> little<00:01:39.770> bit<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.190> left<00:01:40.399> and<00:01:40.610> just

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
right a little bit to the left and just

00:01:40.850 --> 00:02:27.620 
right a little bit to the left and just
give<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.390> little<00:01:41.690> bit<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.899> its<00:01:42.200> range

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.270 

so<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.930> total<00:02:29.080> control<00:02:29.470> really<00:02:29.800> has<00:02:29.950> quite<00:02:30.190> a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
so the total control really has quite a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.160 
so the total control really has quite a
range<00:02:30.520> can<00:02:30.760> kind<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.000> get<00:02:31.150> really<00:02:31.780> kind<00:02:32.050> of

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
range can kind of get really kind of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.380 
range can kind of get really kind of
bright<00:02:33.010> as<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.400> get<00:02:33.520> over<00:02:33.730> here<00:02:33.940> around<00:02:34.209> three

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
bright as we get over here around three

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.520 
bright as we get over here around three
o'clock

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
o'clock

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.559 
o'clock
really<00:02:35.920> high-end<00:02:36.430> kind<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.849> brilliance<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.450> it

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
really high-end kind of brilliance to it

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.240 
really high-end kind of brilliance to it
and<00:02:38.140> really<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.530> able<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.800> cut<00:02:38.980> through<00:02:39.130> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and really be able to cut through the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.710 
and really be able to cut through the
mix<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.640> then<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:39.880> can<00:02:40.030> kind<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.239> smooth<00:02:40.569> it

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
mix and then we can kind of smooth it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.990 
mix and then we can kind of smooth it
out<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.170> go<00:02:41.290> back<00:02:41.410> here<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.400> left<00:02:42.670> so

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
out as we go back here to the left so

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.820 
out as we go back here to the left so
I'm<00:02:43.600> gonna<00:02:43.750> put<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.050> back<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.380> about<00:02:44.620> ten

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
I'm gonna put it back to about ten

00:02:44.830 --> 00:03:59.270 
I'm gonna put it back to about ten
o'clock<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.489> just<00:02:46.390> let<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.630> listen<00:02:46.780> again

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.430 

so<00:04:00.280> what<00:04:00.640> we<00:04:00.760> have<00:04:00.970> when<00:04:01.150> we<00:04:01.240> Dow<00:04:01.630> down<00:04:02.200> the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
so what we have when we Dow down the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.560 
so what we have when we Dow down the
game<00:04:02.680> there<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.490> really<00:04:03.880> kind<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.180> light

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
game there is a really kind of light

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.270 
game there is a really kind of light
kind<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:04.990> transparent<00:04:05.650> sounding<00:04:05.890> overdrive

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
kind of transparent sounding overdrive

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.450 
kind of transparent sounding overdrive
and<00:04:07.210> it<00:04:07.450> really<00:04:08.040> responds<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.160> your<00:04:09.220> pick

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
and it really responds to your pick

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.280 
and it really responds to your pick
attack<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:09.970> when<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.180> play<00:04:10.390> lightly<00:04:10.780> it

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
attack so when you play lightly it

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.620
