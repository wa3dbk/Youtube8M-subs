okay<00:00:07.290> so<00:00:07.350> what<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:07.710> think<00:00:07.830> space<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.000> think<00:00:09.030> zero

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
okay so what I think space I think zero

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.240 
okay so what I think space I think zero
gravity<00:00:09.809> but<00:00:10.139> then<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.469> kind<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.740> totally

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
gravity but then that kind of totally

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.190 
gravity but then that kind of totally
diffuses<00:00:11.910> build<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.540> battle<00:00:12.840> how<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.019> you

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
diffuses build in battle how do you

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.620 
diffuses build in battle how do you
build<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.679> space<00:00:13.980> right<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.820> what<00:00:15.480> we've<00:00:15.599> got

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
build in space right so what we've got

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.230 
build in space right so what we've got
is<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.920> massive<00:00:17.250> space<00:00:17.430> environment<00:00:17.850> so

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
is it's a massive space environment so

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.060 
is it's a massive space environment so
there's<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.539> huge<00:00:18.930> planet<00:00:19.380> beneath<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
there's this huge planet beneath you

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.800 
there's this huge planet beneath you
it's<00:00:20.550> actually<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.970> big<00:00:21.119> planet<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.600> dust

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
it's actually the big planet of dust

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.070 
it's actually the big planet of dust
which<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.260> Emmett's<00:00:22.890> homeworld<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.760> then<00:00:24.720> in

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
which is Emmett's homeworld and then in

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.009 
which is Emmett's homeworld and then in
orbit<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:25.980> these<00:00:26.189> large<00:00:27.029> space<00:00:27.630> stations

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
orbit are these large space stations

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.169 
orbit are these large space stations
they<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.320> grabbed<00:00:28.650> generators<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
they have grabbed generators and so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.030 
they have grabbed generators and so
players<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.599> still<00:00:30.990> run<00:00:31.289> around<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.769> drive

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
players can still run around and drive

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.160 
players can still run around and drive
around<00:00:32.250> their<00:00:33.000> ground<00:00:33.239> vehicles<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.930> build

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
around their ground vehicles do build

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870 
around their ground vehicles do build
and<00:00:34.320> battle<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.590> those<00:00:34.739> space<00:00:34.950> stations<00:00:35.340> but

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and battle on those space stations but

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.280 
and battle on those space stations but
yet<00:00:36.030> some<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> space<00:00:36.660> stations<00:00:37.079> are

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
yet some of the space stations are

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.650 
yet some of the space stations are
hovering<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.219> floating<00:00:38.700> away<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:39.570> each

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
hovering and floating away from each

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.690 
hovering and floating away from each
other<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.350> some<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.620> them<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.309> require

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
other so some of them you know require

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.060 
other so some of them you know require
you<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.940> fly<00:00:42.239> over<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.660> them<00:00:43.110> or<00:00:43.530> whatever<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you to fly over to them or whatever and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
you to fly over to them or whatever and
it<00:00:44.489> sort<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.120> its<00:00:45.480> kind<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.690> core

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
it sort it at its kind of core

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
it sort it at its kind of core
mechanical<00:00:46.530> level<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.219> plays<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> lot<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
mechanical level it plays a lot like a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.690 
mechanical level it plays a lot like a
collection<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.690> islands<00:00:49.230> um<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.550> got

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
collection of islands um but it's got

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.000 
collection of islands um but it's got
awesome<00:00:51.120> stuff<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> miss

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
awesome stuff like if you if you miss

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
awesome stuff like if you if you miss
jump<00:00:53.370> or<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.090> drive<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> vehicle<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
jump or you know you drive a vehicle you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.500 
jump or you know you drive a vehicle you
know<00:00:55.620> off<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.860> edge<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.090> get<00:00:57.239> pulled

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
know off the edge you see it get pulled

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.150 
know off the edge you see it get pulled
in<00:00:57.660> by<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> gravity<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.620> pulled<00:00:58.859> towards

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
in by the gravity and get pulled towards

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.920 
in by the gravity and get pulled towards
dust<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.579> catches<00:00:59.879> fire<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.300> burns<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.750> it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
dust and catches fire and burns up it's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.270 
dust and catches fire and burns up it's
just<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.350> awesome<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.070> killed

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
just a really awesome way to get killed

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.979 
just a really awesome way to get killed
that's<00:01:02.730> fun<00:01:02.910> back<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that's fun back in back in the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719 
that's fun back in back in the
pre-production<00:01:04.320> days<00:01:04.710> back<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.430> Santa<00:01:05.700> Monica

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
pre-production days back in Santa Monica

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.700 
pre-production days back in Santa Monica
what<00:01:06.330> came<00:01:06.510> first<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.810> space<00:01:07.080> battles<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
what came first to space battles or the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.350 
what came first to space battles or the
terrain<00:01:07.950> battles<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:09.119> when<00:01:09.270> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
terrain battles like what what when you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.460 
terrain battles like what what when you
shop<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> stars<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.200> did<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.380> guys

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
shop for the stars what did you guys

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
shop for the stars what did you guys
want<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.740> accomplish<00:01:10.890> off<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> game<00:01:11.490> um<00:01:11.700> well

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
want to accomplish off the game um well

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.060 
want to accomplish off the game um well
we<00:01:12.090> knew<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.360> wanted<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.869> space<00:01:13.650> battles

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
we knew we wanted to do space battles

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.060 
we knew we wanted to do space battles
because<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.340> think<00:01:14.490> there's<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.830> really<00:01:16.830> great

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
because I think there's a really great

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
because I think there's a really great
opportunity<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.670> us<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> stand<00:01:18.570> out<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.990> like

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
opportunity for us to stand out and like

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
opportunity for us to stand out and like
I've<00:01:19.259> said<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.950> marketing<00:01:20.400> blabber<00:01:20.759> we

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
I've said in all my marketing blabber we

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050 
I've said in all my marketing blabber we
did<00:01:21.750> really<00:01:21.990> want<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> stand<00:01:22.560> out<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.759> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
did really want to stand out and so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.420 
did really want to stand out and so
doing<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.930> great<00:01:25.140> space<00:01:25.500> battles<00:01:25.920> was<00:01:26.159> key

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
doing really great space battles was key

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.950 
doing really great space battles was key
but<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.939> did<00:01:27.119> actually<00:01:27.299> start<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
but we did actually start with the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080 
but we did actually start with the
terrain<00:01:28.140> stuff<00:01:28.470> first<00:01:28.799> because<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.610> actually

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
terrain stuff first because we actually

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.499 
terrain stuff first because we actually
had<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:31.700> refine<00:01:32.700> our<00:01:32.759> process<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
had to really refine our process to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.340 
had to really refine our process to
build<00:01:33.869> these<00:01:34.250> they<00:01:35.250> are<00:01:35.600> enormous<00:01:36.600> hand<00:01:37.079> built

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
build these they are enormous hand built

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.020 
build these they are enormous hand built
structures<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.520> rolling<00:01:38.850> terrain

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
structures it's not just rolling terrain

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.580 
structures it's not just rolling terrain
that<00:01:39.210> stuff<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> great<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.110> beautiful<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that stuff is great and beautiful and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.440 
that stuff is great and beautiful and
players<00:01:40.799> love<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:42.000> when<00:01:42.150> you're<00:01:42.270> flying

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
players love it but when you're flying

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
players love it but when you're flying
around<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.869> space<00:01:43.020> you've<00:01:43.409> got<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.070> know

miles of hand built mechanical structure

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.210 
miles of hand built mechanical structure
so<00:01:47.759> getting<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:49.470> perform<00:01:49.979> right
