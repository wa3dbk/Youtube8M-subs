otherwise<00:01:17.369> works<00:01:18.330> well<00:01:18.570> now<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.950> way<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.250> wired

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
otherwise works well now the way I wired

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.539 
otherwise works well now the way I wired
this<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.750> actually<00:01:21.900> used<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.680> security

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
this up is I actually used a security

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.749 
this up is I actually used a security
wire<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:25.200> took<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.560> power<00:01:25.740> off<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> back

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
wire and I took the power off the back

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.700 
wire and I took the power off the back
of<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.060> unit<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> did<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:30.290> took<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
of this unit and what I did is I took a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.920 
of this unit and what I did is I took a
wire<00:01:31.979> from<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> back<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> unit<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
wire from the back of the unit and I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
wire from the back of the unit and I
went<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.530> through<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> glove<00:01:35.340> compartment

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
went to through the glove compartment

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.899 
went to through the glove compartment
and<00:01:36.740> inside<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> gulf<00:01:38.070> compartment<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> can

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and inside the gulf compartment you can

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.929 
and inside the gulf compartment you can
basically<00:01:39.150> there's<00:01:39.540> there's<00:01:40.310> there's<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.430> hole

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
basically there's there's there's a hole

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.120 
basically there's there's there's a hole
in<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.960> pull<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> wire<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
in here so you can pull the wire out and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.429 
in here so you can pull the wire out and
then<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.790> pass<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> wire<00:01:45.299> again<00:01:45.689> through

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
then you can pass the wire again through

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.370 
then you can pass the wire again through
the<00:01:46.619> next<00:01:47.040> hole<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.579> then<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.479> basically

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.569 
the next hole and then you can basically
remove<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.909> part<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:53.070> part<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.520> the

the<00:01:56.549> bottom<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.530> run<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> wire

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009

basically<00:02:02.579> put<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> wire<00:02:03.689> underneath<00:02:04.439> this

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
basically put the wire underneath this

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.350 
basically put the wire underneath this
ledge<00:02:06.290> then<00:02:07.290> let's<00:02:07.469> see<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.649> back<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> car

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
ledge then let's see the back of the car

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.530 
ledge then let's see the back of the car
so<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.380> I<00:02:10.410> did<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.890> ran<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.540> underneath

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so what I did is I ran it underneath

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.010 
so what I did is I ran it underneath
here<00:02:13.110> continued<00:02:14.180> underneath<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.360> piece<00:02:15.630> and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
here continued underneath this piece and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.860 
here continued underneath this piece and
then<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.040> if<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.730> pull<00:02:18.030> down<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.300> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
then if you if you pull down the the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.270 
then if you if you pull down the the
rear<00:02:19.770> seat<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.760> actually<00:02:21.120> pretty<00:02:21.870> easily

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
rear seat you can actually pretty easily

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.170 
rear seat you can actually pretty easily
run<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> wire<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.900> trunk<00:02:25.380> here<00:02:25.680> and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
run the wire to the trunk here and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.700 
run the wire to the trunk here and
there's<00:02:27.180> no<00:02:27.330> way<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.600> can<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.410> like

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
there's no way you can see it it's like

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.420 
there's no way you can see it it's like
completely<00:02:29.310> hidden<00:02:29.490> now<00:02:30.360> let's<00:02:30.660> see<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.800> want

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
completely hidden now let's see I want

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.310 
completely hidden now let's see I want
to<00:02:32.520> take<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> look<00:02:32.880> at<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> trunk<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.140> I'm<00:02:34.200> gonna

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
to take a look at the trunk so I'm gonna

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.590 
to take a look at the trunk so I'm gonna
go<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.650> get<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.700> keys<00:02:38.030> those<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.360> then

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
go and get the the keys those and then

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.910 
go and get the the keys those and then
we'll<00:02:39.750> take<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> look<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> camera<00:02:40.740> on<00:02:40.830> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
we'll take a look at the camera on the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.760 
we'll take a look at the camera on the
back<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.700> camera<00:02:45.380> it's<00:02:46.380> just<00:02:46.620> on

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
back so this is the camera it's just on

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.430 
back so this is the camera it's just on
my<00:02:47.430> case<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.850> just<00:02:48.120> underneath<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.660> license

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
my case is just underneath the license

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.490 
my case is just underneath the license
plate<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:52.520> what<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.550> have<00:02:54.000> here<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.140> trunk

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
plate and what I have here in the trunk

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.730 
plate and what I have here in the trunk
is<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.930> right<00:02:57.930> over<00:02:58.320> there<00:02:58.500> there's

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
is that in the right over there there's

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.890 
is that in the right over there there's
the<00:02:59.220> key<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.640> see<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.880> cable<00:03:00.240> it's<00:03:00.660> easy

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
the key you can see the cable it's easy

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.320 
the key you can see the cable it's easy
to<00:03:01.110> run<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> cable<00:03:01.650> underneath<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.330> spare

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
to run the cable underneath the spare

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.810 
to run the cable underneath the spare
tire<00:03:03.600> well<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.110> then<00:03:04.770> temporarily<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.550> just

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
tire well and then temporarily I just

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.600 
tire well and then temporarily I just
put<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> cable<00:03:06.680> coming<00:03:07.680> up<00:03:07.800> here<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.250> I'll

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
put the cable coming up here and I'll

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.810 
put the cable coming up here and I'll
run<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:08.970> ran<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.170> it's<00:03:11.070> hard<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.430> see<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.760> I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
run it ran it and it's hard to see but I

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.050 
run it ran it and it's hard to see but I
ran<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.180> through<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.810> hole<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:14.060> just

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
ran it through a hole and just

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.000 
ran it through a hole and just
temporarily<00:03:15.420> can<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.780> left<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.170> cable<00:03:16.500> around

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
temporarily can I left the cable around

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.449 
temporarily can I left the cable around
and<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.239> goes<00:03:18.450> around<00:03:19.320> here<00:03:20.000> they're<00:03:21.000> just

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
and it goes around here they're just

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.500 
and it goes around here they're just
just<00:03:23.459> around<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.530> notch<00:03:25.530> here<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:27.330> can

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
just around this notch here and you can

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.350 
just around this notch here and you can
see<00:03:27.830> goes<00:03:28.830> behind<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.280> license<00:03:29.640> plate<00:03:29.850> into

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
see goes behind the license plate into

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.780 
see goes behind the license plate into
the<00:03:30.480> camera<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:31.709> not<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.610> not<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
the camera so it's not it's not the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.120 
the camera so it's not it's not the
ideal<00:03:33.269> situation<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:34.380> course<00:03:34.590> ideally<00:03:35.010> I

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
ideal situation of course ideally I

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.580 
ideal situation of course ideally I
would<00:03:35.310> want<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.580> run<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.910> inside<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.410> does

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
would want to run it inside but it does

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.330 
would want to run it inside but it does
work<00:03:37.739> okay<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.360> as<00:03:39.360> far<00:03:39.600> as<00:03:40.190> look<00:03:41.190> is

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
work okay and as far as look is

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.940 
work okay and as far as look is
concerned<00:03:41.760> it's<00:03:42.450> not<00:03:42.540> too<00:03:42.720> bad<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.110> kinda

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
concerned it's not too bad it kinda

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.370 
concerned it's not too bad it kinda
shows<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> little<00:03:44.519> bit<00:03:44.640> but<00:03:44.820> not<00:03:44.940> too<00:03:45.000> much

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
shows a little bit but not too much

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.530 
shows a little bit but not too much
anyway<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.950> my<00:03:46.980> rear<00:03:47.850> view<00:03:47.880> camera

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
anyway this is my rear view camera

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.120 
anyway this is my rear view camera
