high school that you get to be a big

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.460 
high school that you get to be a big
part<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.360> their<00:02:26.480> life<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.959> in<00:02:27.110> sports

part of their life and in sports

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.990 
part of their life and in sports
obviously<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.100> me<00:02:28.190> was<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> big<00:02:28.489> part<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.940> it

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
obviously for me was a big part and it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.420 
obviously for me was a big part and it
certainly<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.420> now<00:02:29.600> for<00:02:30.170> my<00:02:30.290> kids<00:02:30.319> too<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:30.890> I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
certainly is now for my kids too so I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.050 
certainly is now for my kids too so I
think<00:02:31.810> kids<00:02:32.810> sports<00:02:33.319> correo<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.520> all<00:02:34.730> kind<00:02:34.970> of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
think kids sports correo it all kind of

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.610 
think kids sports correo it all kind of
goes<00:02:35.209> hand<00:02:35.239> in<00:02:35.630> hand<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.110> for<00:02:36.319> me<00:02:36.440> that's

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
goes hand in hand and for me that's

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.110 
goes hand in hand and for me that's
that's<00:02:37.100> another<00:02:37.340> big<00:02:37.550> reason<00:02:37.730> why<00:02:37.880> I'm

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
that's another big reason why I'm

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.390 
that's another big reason why I'm
involved
