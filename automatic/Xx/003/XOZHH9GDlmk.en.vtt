you're<00:01:15.270> curious<00:01:15.450> i'll<00:01:15.780> show<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.020> those<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.439> uh

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you're curious i'll show you those as uh

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.380 
you're curious i'll show you those as uh
as<00:01:17.009> those<00:01:17.250> kick<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.990> ok<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.119> got<00:01:21.240> in

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
as those kick on ok so we just got in

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.570 
as those kick on ok so we just got in
our<00:01:21.509> car<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:22.380> started<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.220> nice<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
our car we started it up it's nice and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.539 
our car we started it up it's nice and
cool<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.930> sensor<00:01:25.290> sitting<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:25.740> 5<00:01:26.100> volts

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
cool the sensor sitting at about 5 volts

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.569 
cool the sensor sitting at about 5 volts
but<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.930> coolant<00:01:28.200> temperature<00:01:28.409> rises<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
but as the coolant temperature rises the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.929 
but as the coolant temperature rises the
voltage<00:01:29.939> drop<00:01:29.970> goes<00:01:30.420> down<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:34.939> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
voltage drop goes down and that the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.280 
voltage drop goes down and that the
electric<00:01:36.270> fan<00:01:36.710> low-speed<00:01:37.710> kicks<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
electric fan low-speed kicks on so the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.039 
electric fan low-speed kicks on so the
car<00:01:40.439> warms<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:41.009> over<00:01:41.250> time<00:01:41.509> keeps<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
car warms up over time keeps going and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.560 
car warms up over time keeps going and
keeps<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.649> temperature<00:01:43.979> rises<00:01:44.570> keeps

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
keeps going the temperature rises keeps

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.380 
keeps going the temperature rises keeps
going<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.049> keeps<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.680> about<00:01:46.950> 3<00:01:47.369> volts

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
going and keeps going in about 3 volts

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.500 
going and keeps going in about 3 volts
I<00:01:50.340> don't<00:01:51.340> know<00:01:51.400> if<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.580> heard<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.909> speed

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
I don't know if you heard the speed

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.830 
I don't know if you heard the speed
change<00:01:52.720> go<00:01:52.990> everybody<00:01:53.350> kicks<00:01:53.590> on<00:01:53.770> high<00:01:53.950> speed

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
change go everybody kicks on high speed

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.260 
change go everybody kicks on high speed
and<00:01:55.840> everything<00:01:56.350> after<00:01:56.560> 3<00:01:57.100> volts<00:01:57.430> it's<00:01:58.150> the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
and everything after 3 volts it's the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.710 
and everything after 3 volts it's the
same<00:01:58.479> speed<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.740> again<00:02:00.040> we<00:02:01.000> shut<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.330> car<00:02:01.510> down

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
same speed so again we shut the car down

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.560 
same speed so again we shut the car down
or<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:03.159> know<00:02:03.280> maybe<00:02:03.550> we're<00:02:04.180> driving<00:02:04.479> along

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
or you know maybe we're driving along

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.800 
or you know maybe we're driving along
the<00:02:04.690> highway<00:02:04.810> or<00:02:05.229> whatever<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.479> coolant

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
and get up to 3 volts you can hear a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.460 
and get up to 3 volts you can hear a
kick<00:02:16.570> down<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.840> low<00:02:16.959> speed<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.480> shut<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.290> car

if<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.239> want<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.420> see<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.630> gate<00:02:25.780> voltages<00:02:30.000> see

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
if you want to see the gate voltages see

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.550 
if you want to see the gate voltages see
how<00:02:31.060> they<00:02:31.180> flip-flop

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.120 

oh<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:36.270> in<00:02:36.480> case<00:02:36.540> you're<00:02:36.750> wondering<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.380> used

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
oh and in case you're wondering I used

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.860 
oh and in case you're wondering I used
the<00:02:38.459> development<00:02:39.120> kit<00:02:39.330> provided<00:02:39.810> by

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
the development kit provided by

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.830 
the development kit provided by
microchip<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.620> program<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.220> 16<00:02:41.819> f<00:02:41.910> 690<00:02:42.480> came

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
microchip to program the 16 f 690 came

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.870 
microchip to program the 16 f 690 came
with<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.020> dongle<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.650> came<00:02:43.800> with<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.160> interface

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
with a dongle it came with the interface

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.059 
with a dongle it came with the interface
board<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.050> came<00:02:46.170> with<00:02:46.380> empty<00:02:46.920> lab

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
board and it came with empty lab

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.970 
board and it came with empty lab
software<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:48.239> as<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:49.050> see<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.800> all

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
software and as you can see it's all

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.360 
software and as you can see it's all
written<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.250> C<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.849> it's<00:02:51.780> probably<00:02:52.260> 41<00:02:53.190> to

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
written in C and it's probably 41 to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.790 
written in C and it's probably 41 to
coat<00:02:53.580> well<00:02:53.959> there's<00:02:54.959> some<00:02:55.080> stuff<00:02:55.260> commented

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
coat well there's some stuff commented

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.740 
coat well there's some stuff commented
out<00:02:55.890> here<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> bottom<00:02:56.700> that's<00:02:57.450> probably

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
out here the bottom that's probably

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.809 
out here the bottom that's probably
about<00:02:57.870> 30<00:02:58.200> lines<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.530> code<00:02:58.709> other<00:02:59.489> than<00:02:59.760> that

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
about 30 lines of code other than that

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.380 
about 30 lines of code other than that
that's<00:03:00.360> that's<00:03:01.080> it
