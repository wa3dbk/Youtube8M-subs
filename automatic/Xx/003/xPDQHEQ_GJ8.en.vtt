good<00:00:04.290> morning<00:00:04.560> I've<00:00:04.680> got<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.950> talk<00:00:05.130> for<00:00:05.310> a

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
good morning I've got to talk for a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.980 
good morning I've got to talk for a
couple<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.700> minutes<00:00:06.000> about<00:00:06.149> machining<00:00:06.779> some

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
couple of minutes about machining some

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.799 
couple of minutes about machining some
curves<00:00:07.290> on<00:00:07.650> the<00:00:07.770> lathe<00:00:08.180> machine<00:00:09.180> curves<00:00:09.570> on

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
curves on the lathe machine curves on

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.560 
curves on the lathe machine curves on
manual<00:00:10.230> they<00:00:10.350> can<00:00:10.680> be<00:00:10.770> quite<00:00:11.010> difficult<00:00:11.570> if

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
manual they can be quite difficult if

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.779 
manual they can be quite difficult if
you<00:00:12.629> want<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.900> make<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> small<00:00:13.440> radius<00:00:13.860> like

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:14.789 
you want to make a small radius like

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.700 
you want to make a small radius like
this<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.240> example

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.880 

then<00:00:19.280> he<00:00:19.430> could<00:00:19.640> make<00:00:19.820> reform<00:00:20.210> talk<00:00:20.890> they

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
then he could make reform talk they

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.470 
then he could make reform talk they
would<00:00:22.040> need<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.340> make<00:00:22.520> a<00:00:22.550> different<00:00:22.970> form<00:00:23.240> tool

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
would need to make a different form tool

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
going to do it in 18 cut that will give

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.870 
going to do it in 18 cut that will give
us<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.289> fairly<00:02:10.500> coarse<00:02:10.830> finish<00:02:11.250> let's<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.760> do

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
us a fairly coarse finish let's just do

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.380 
us a fairly coarse finish let's just do
that<00:02:11.910> calculation<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.870> now<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.940> let's<00:02:15.150> save

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that calculation for now so let's save

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.380 
that calculation for now so let's save
the<00:02:15.780> coordinates<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> file<00:02:19.970> change<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.209> to

the coordinates to a file change that to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.500 
the coordinates to a file change that to
36<00:02:24.319> do<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.440> again

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
36 do it again

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:50.670 
36 do it again

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.930 

gives<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.510> step<00:03:13.780> number<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:15.100> start<00:03:15.430> X<00:03:15.730> is

gives you the step number the start X is

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.730 
gives you the step number the start X is
obviously<00:03:16.300> always<00:03:16.540> starting<00:03:17.200> from<00:03:17.410> zero

which<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.630> cross<00:03:32.050> live<00:03:32.320> in<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.620> light<00:03:36.150> so

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
which is the cross live in the light so

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.880 
which is the cross live in the light so
we<00:03:37.180> simply<00:03:37.600> take<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.990> file<00:03:38.230> off<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.620> the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
we simply take that file off to the

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.949 
we simply take that file off to the
lathe<00:03:39.420> make<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.450> series<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:40.900> cuts<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.790> we<00:03:43.780> end

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
lathe make a series of cuts and we end

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:58.280 
lathe make a series of cuts and we end
up<00:03:44.110> with<00:03:44.440> our<00:03:45.690> radius

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.960 

we<00:03:58.799> can<00:03:58.980> make<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.159> cosine<00:03:59.700> cup<00:04:00.060> which<00:04:00.330> is

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
we can make a cosine cup which is

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.880 
we can make a cosine cup which is
slightly<00:04:03.260> gentler<00:04:04.260> slope<00:04:06.110> this<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.319> cosine

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
slightly gentler slope this is a cosine

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.899 
slightly gentler slope this is a cosine
cut<00:04:09.049> I've<00:04:10.049> deliberately<00:04:10.470> left<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:11.010> course<00:04:11.340> so

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
cut I've deliberately left it course so

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.940 
cut I've deliberately left it course so
that<00:04:11.939> you<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.360> see<00:04:12.569> how<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.840> Tool<00:04:13.260> Works<00:04:13.560> it

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
that you can see how the Tool Works it

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.039 
that you can see how the Tool Works it
iterates<00:04:14.370> my<00:04:14.790> series<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.269> cuts<00:04:15.629> cutting

they're<00:04:16.260> gradually<00:04:17.130> getting<00:04:17.400> closer<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:18.060> the

they're gradually getting closer to the
center<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:19.609> adjusting<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.760> distance<00:04:20.970> that

you<00:04:21.510> cut<00:04:22.380> down<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.669> get<00:04:23.820> series<00:04:24.180> of

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
you cut down to so you get series of

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.480 
you cut down to so you get series of
iterations<00:04:24.960> if<00:04:25.440> this<00:04:25.620> is<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.800> coarse<00:04:26.070> cut<00:04:26.310> you

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
iterations if this is a coarse cut you

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.810 
iterations if this is a coarse cut you
can<00:04:26.610> see<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.410> small<00:04:31.410> steps<00:04:31.820> they

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
can see that it's in small steps they

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.840 
can see that it's in small steps they
then<00:04:33.090> do<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> finer<00:04:33.570> cut<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.139> smooth<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.919> up<00:04:35.039> and

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
then do a finer cut to smooth it up and

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.820 
then do a finer cut to smooth it up and
you<00:04:35.970> can<00:04:36.120> finish<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.570> with<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.750> piece<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:37.169> Emery

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
you can finish it with a piece of Emery

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.610 
you can finish it with a piece of Emery
paper<00:04:38.190> or<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.580> wire<00:04:38.789> wall<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.330> polish<00:04:40.289> it<00:04:40.440> right
