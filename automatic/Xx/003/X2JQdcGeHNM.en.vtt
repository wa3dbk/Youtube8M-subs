way he uses volume knob in the wagon bar

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.539 
way he uses volume knob in the wagon bar
what<00:02:25.540> he<00:02:25.629> does<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.140> instead<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:27.129> hitting<00:02:27.489> a

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
what he does is instead of hitting a

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.089 
what he does is instead of hitting a
note<00:02:28.170> full-on<00:02:29.170> he<00:02:29.379> doesn't<00:02:29.680> do<00:02:29.739> that<00:02:29.799> much

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
note full-on he doesn't do that much

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.650 
note full-on he doesn't do that much
he'll<00:02:30.280> go<00:02:30.989> he'll<00:02:31.989> go<00:02:33.209> that's<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.420> great

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
he'll go he'll go that's a great

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.080 
he'll go he'll go that's a great

technique in you also you can start a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.980 
technique in you also you can start a

in the right spot and just start the
note<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.739> then<00:03:09.040> play<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.069> one-handed<00:03:20.319> right

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.960 

and<00:03:29.620> it's<00:03:30.620> much<00:03:30.859> better<00:03:31.099> than<00:03:31.489> having<00:03:31.700> a

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
and it's much better than having a

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.110 
and it's much better than having a
volume<00:03:32.209> pedal<00:03:32.569> because<00:03:34.120> everything's

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
volume pedal because everything's

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.319 
volume pedal because everything's
involved<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:37.310> volume<00:03:37.669> pedal<00:03:37.849> tends<00:03:38.180> to

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
involved and the volume pedal tends to

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.099 
involved and the volume pedal tends to
take<00:03:38.510> away<00:03:38.720> a<00:03:38.750> lot<00:03:38.989> of<00:03:39.139> signal<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:41.810> don't<00:03:42.019> get

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
take away a lot of signal you don't get

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:49.210
