electrolytic<00:00:08.010> difference<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:09.269> well<00:00:09.570> that's

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
electrolytic difference is well that's

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.280 
electrolytic difference is well that's
all<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.040> good<00:00:11.219> things<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.910> life<00:00:12.269> get<00:00:12.900> into

all the good things of life get into

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.570 
all the good things of life get into
yourself<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.750> hole<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.960> rest<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.590> the

cellular metabolic waste get out of the
cell<00:00:21.000> he<00:00:21.720> does<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.320> because<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
cell he does that because of the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:43.910 
cell he does that because of the
difference<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:27.650> charge<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.410> what<00:00:43.620> makes

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
difference in charge and so what makes

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:56.700 
difference in charge and so what makes
the<00:00:47.270> potential

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.619 

potential<00:00:57.710> being

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.030 

if<00:01:03.199> sodium<00:01:03.680> goes<00:01:04.089> into<00:01:05.089> yourself<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:06.409> pumped

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
if sodium goes into yourself is pumped

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.140 
if sodium goes into yourself is pumped
back<00:01:07.400> out<00:01:08.320> this<00:01:09.320> is<00:01:09.439> called<00:01:09.650> sodium<00:01:09.950> month

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.120 

then<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:14.180> can<00:01:14.330> lose<00:01:15.549> sodium<00:01:17.680> from<00:01:18.680> outside

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
then you can lose sodium from outside

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.190 
then you can lose sodium from outside

what<00:01:36.440> we<00:01:36.470> see<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:39.140> proper<00:01:39.649> funk<00:01:40.300> but<00:01:41.300> when<00:01:41.479> the

what we see is proper funk but when the

couple ways to do this primarily the way
to<00:02:47.780> do<00:02:47.990> this<00:02:48.140> we're<00:02:48.380> talking<00:02:48.740> about<00:02:50.440> I'm

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
to do this we're talking about I'm

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.890 
to do this we're talking about I'm
rather<00:02:51.590> than<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.920> way<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.070> do<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:53.540> to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
rather than the way to do this is to

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.030 
rather than the way to do this is to
have<00:02:53.930> incapacitated<00:02:55.450> your<00:02:56.500> adrenal<00:02:57.500> glands

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
have incapacitated your adrenal glands

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.750 
have incapacitated your adrenal glands
in<00:02:58.700> their<00:02:59.600> production<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:01.310> hormone<00:03:01.550> called

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
in their production of a hormone called

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.010 
in their production of a hormone called
aldosterone<00:03:02.570> which<00:03:03.580> allows<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.120> hold<00:03:05.570> on

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
aldosterone which allows you to hold on

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.600 
aldosterone which allows you to hold on
to<00:03:06.440> your<00:03:07.190> sewing<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:09.560> do<00:03:09.740> this<00:03:09.950> by<00:03:10.220> eating

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
to your sewing you do this by eating

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.920 
to your sewing you do this by eating
salt<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.610> eat<00:03:13.880> salt

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
salt if you eat salt

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.970 
salt if you eat salt
you<00:03:15.890> can<00:03:16.100> quickly<00:03:17.080> overload<00:03:18.080> your<00:03:18.410> body<00:03:18.650> on

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
you can quickly overload your body on

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.920 
you can quickly overload your body on
solar<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.780> your<00:03:20.990> body<00:03:21.250> responds<00:03:22.250> by

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
solar and so your body responds by

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.840 
solar and so your body responds by
reducing<00:03:23.930> our<00:03:24.230> last<00:03:24.560> drug<00:03:24.830> production<00:03:25.160> in

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
reducing our last drug production in

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.890 
reducing our last drug production in
order<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.330> enable<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.930> lose<00:03:27.550> sodium<00:03:28.550> and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
order to enable you to lose sodium and

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.870 
order to enable you to lose sodium and
where<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.170> might<00:03:30.440> lose<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.400> believe<00:03:31.700> the

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
where you might lose and I believe the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.750 
where you might lose and I believe the
number<00:03:32.240> that<00:03:32.420> has<00:03:32.600> no<00:03:32.840> unit<00:03:33.260> where<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.250> might

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
number that has no unit where you might

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.420 
number that has no unit where you might
lose<00:03:35.090> one<00:03:36.280> sodium<00:03:37.280> per<00:03:37.880> day<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.860> never

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
lose one sodium per day if you never

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.980 
lose one sodium per day if you never
ever<00:03:40.730> ever<00:03:41.300> eat<00:03:41.840> salt<00:03:43.060> if<00:03:44.060> you<00:03:44.120> sometimes<00:03:44.690> eat

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
ever ever eat salt if you sometimes eat

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
ever ever eat salt if you sometimes eat
salt<00:03:45.350> you<00:03:46.070> can<00:03:46.280> improve<00:03:46.790> your<00:03:47.120> sodium<00:03:48.080> losses

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
salt you can improve your sodium losses

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.080 
salt you can improve your sodium losses
up<00:03:49.820> to<00:03:50.270> two<00:03:50.570> per<00:03:51.380> day<00:03:51.640> so<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.730> could<00:03:52.850> lose

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
up to two per day so you could lose

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.360 
up to two per day so you could lose
twice<00:03:53.390> as<00:03:53.570> much<00:03:53.720> sodium<00:03:54.050> in<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.470> day<00:03:54.880> by

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
twice as much sodium in a day by

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.240 
twice as much sodium in a day by
reducing<00:03:58.370> your<00:03:58.990> elastin<00:03:59.990> production<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:01.100> this

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
reducing your elastin production so this

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.630 
reducing your elastin production so this
is<00:04:01.400> our<00:04:01.550> range<00:04:02.350> I'm<00:04:03.350> kind<00:04:03.710> of<00:04:03.740> like<00:04:03.920> how<00:04:04.370> much

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
is our range I'm kind of like how much

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.720 
is our range I'm kind of like how much
Sun<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:05.390> can<00:04:05.780> lose<00:04:06.260> at<00:04:06.470> an<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:07.220> rooms<00:04:07.400> got<00:04:07.550> a

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
Sun you can lose at an the rooms got a

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.470 
Sun you can lose at an the rooms got a
really<00:04:07.970> ten<00:04:08.390> you've<00:04:08.620> got<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.740> pea

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
really ten you've got a pea

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.190 
really ten you've got a pea
and<00:04:12.340> so<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.400> kind<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.060> laugh<00:04:14.299> at<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.659> Sun<00:04:14.930> now

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
and so you kind of laugh at the Sun now

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.729 
and so you kind of laugh at the Sun now
right<00:04:15.470> cuz<00:04:15.739> it's<00:04:15.920> not<00:04:16.100> strong<00:04:17.259> but<00:04:18.259> how<00:04:18.560> about

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
right cuz it's not strong but how about

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.340 
right cuz it's not strong but how about
if<00:04:18.829> we<00:04:19.039> go<00:04:19.789> maybe<00:04:20.060> like<00:04:22.780> 20<00:04:23.780> million<00:04:24.020> miles

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
if we go maybe like 20 million miles

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.020 
if we go maybe like 20 million miles
closer<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.340> side

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.690 

then<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:28.990> just<00:04:29.170> turn<00:04:29.650> into<00:04:29.950> cinder<00:04:32.700> paper

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
then you just turn into cinder paper

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.129 
then you just turn into cinder paper
eyes<00:04:35.550> there's<00:04:36.550> no<00:04:36.700> limit<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.270> how<00:04:37.720> much<00:04:37.930> we<00:04:38.110> can

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
eyes there's no limit of how much we can

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:45.000 
eyes there's no limit of how much we can
adapt<00:04:38.970> even<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.330> Sun<00:04:43.500> fit<00:04:44.500> people<00:04:44.740> can

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
adapt even to the Sun fit people can

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.890 
adapt even to the Sun fit people can
exercise<00:04:45.250> more<00:04:45.790> than<00:04:45.820> less<00:04:46.150> than<00:04:46.180> people<00:04:46.720> but

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
exercise more than less than people but

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.190 
exercise more than less than people but
they<00:04:47.020> can't<00:04:47.290> they<00:04:48.600> can't<00:04:49.600> run<00:04:49.780> like<00:04:49.810> what<00:04:50.110> we

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
they can't they can't run like what we

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.590 
they can't they can't run like what we
see<00:04:50.380> in<00:04:50.530> movies<00:04:50.710> that's<00:04:51.340> only<00:04:51.669> in<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.000> movies

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.909 

aldosterone<00:04:55.600> production<00:04:56.320> can<00:04:56.470> make<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.770> so

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
aldosterone production can make it so

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.370 
aldosterone production can make it so
that<00:04:56.950> a<00:04:57.370> person<00:04:57.790> who<00:04:58.270> never<00:04:58.450> ever<00:04:58.870> ever<00:04:59.169> ever
