00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.069
 hi gentlemen, I want to do this 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.070
 road note yes you see in traffic 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.519
 stand well now something else is not less 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.699
 We went well in general was worse and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.470
 my will continue to be worse again here I am 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.130
 what I wanted to notice yes you see here 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.519
 this shoulder here this here and here in the mirror 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.220
 and you see you see no one goes there 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.149
 what do you understand the most interesting 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.780
 No, I do not want to say that no one goes 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.610
 very rarely some goat will pass but 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.180
 very rarely even here beside 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.510
 new york 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.350
 but basically you see a roadside empty 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.280
 no one in her brazen does not overtake all 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.500
 does not go round here but still want this 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.010
 about say dear especially 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.010
 Muscovites 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:03.260
 until you yourself take your life 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.260
 do it better for you no one will do 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.040
 because here every time I went 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.950
 Moscow yes we were in traffic jams there with 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.430
 I was picked up at the airport and every time 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.750
 I've seen in a traffic jam on the sidelines as the still 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.710
 even in two rows 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.659
 go still people go still cars overtake 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.950
 all this article on the side got up 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.960
 broke probably here and even two broke 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.860
 maybe the accident here I do not know but in the process 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.610
 an accident about exactly an accident and here we go 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.430
 Well, in short, the curb is empty yet 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.450
 everyone doesn't start making the world better 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.500
 and no one will do it for you here 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.000
 Here is such a small road note 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.750
 Counting on the other side are we now 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 go 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.380
 what's lucky we wear okay food 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.229
 farther 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.229
 all happy and good roads to you
