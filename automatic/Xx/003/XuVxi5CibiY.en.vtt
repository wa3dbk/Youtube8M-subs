hello<00:00:01.089> youtube<00:00:01.540> this<00:00:01.569> minecraft<00:00:02.050> unleash<00:00:02.649> one

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:02.919 
hello youtube this minecraft unleash one

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.190 
hello youtube this minecraft unleash one
and<00:00:03.219> today<00:00:03.580> I'm<00:00:03.789> going<00:00:03.969> to<00:00:04.029> show<00:00:04.240> you<00:00:04.270> how<00:00:05.169> to

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.200 
and today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.780 
and today I'm going to show you how to
make<00:00:05.470> a<00:00:05.500> really<00:00:06.040> slow<00:00:08.130> minecraft<00:00:09.130> redstone

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
make a really slow minecraft redstone

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.770 
make a really slow minecraft redstone
charge<00:00:10.450> like<00:00:10.810> that<00:00:11.440> slow<00:00:11.800> so<00:00:12.130> you<00:00:12.160> can<00:00:12.280> make

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
charge like that slow so you can make

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.750 
charge like that slow so you can make
stuff<00:00:13.780> like<00:00:14.050> that<00:00:14.350> and<00:00:14.590> it's<00:00:15.190> going<00:00:15.430> to<00:00:15.490> be<00:00:15.610> the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
stuff like that and it's going to be the

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.550 
stuff like that and it's going to be the
difference<00:00:16.180> between<00:00:16.420> that<00:00:16.990> and<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:20.320> really

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
difference between that and a really

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.910 
difference between that and a really
fast<00:00:20.800> one<00:00:21.250> like<00:00:21.760> that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
fast one like that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.550 
fast one like that
so<00:00:23.920> if<00:00:24.039> I<00:00:24.160> said<00:00:24.460> it<00:00:24.550> gets<00:00:24.789> go<00:00:25.210> glitchy<00:00:26.190> so<00:00:27.190> I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
so if I said it gets go glitchy so I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.419 
so if I said it gets go glitchy so I
want<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.650> go<00:00:29.770> over<00:00:30.190> to<00:00:31.259> here<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:34.319> so<00:00:35.319> this<00:00:36.190> is<00:00:36.399> a

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:36.429 
want to go over to here and so this is a

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.270 
want to go over to here and so this is a
fast<00:00:36.879> charge<00:00:37.329> and<00:00:37.979> basically<00:00:38.979> the<00:00:39.249> only

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
fast charge and basically the only

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.209 
fast charge and basically the only
difference<00:00:39.879> is<00:00:40.030> how<00:00:40.269> many<00:00:40.510> repeaters<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
difference is how many repeaters the

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.500 
difference is how many repeaters the
faster<00:00:42.729> it<00:00:42.819> is<00:00:43.440> built<00:00:44.440> less<00:00:45.309> repeaters<00:00:46.239> there

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
faster it is built less repeaters there

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.959 
faster it is built less repeaters there
are<00:00:46.659> like<00:00:47.350> there<00:00:47.920> are<00:00:48.010> only<00:00:48.039> three<00:00:48.579> right<00:00:49.030> here

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
are like there are only three right here

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.899 
are like there are only three right here
and<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:54.190> going<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.670> be<00:00:54.789> pretty<00:00:55.089> fast<00:00:55.420> like

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
and it's going to be pretty fast like

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.799 
and it's going to be pretty fast like
that<00:00:57.909> fast<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.620> to<00:01:00.549> make<00:01:00.729> a<00:01:00.760> slow<00:01:01.120> charge<00:01:01.479> all

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
that fast but to make a slow charge all

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.859 
that fast but to make a slow charge all
you<00:01:02.019> need<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.260> do<00:01:02.469> is<00:01:02.620> get<00:01:03.579> like<00:01:03.609> seven<00:01:04.479> maybe

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
you need to do is get like seven maybe

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.959 
you need to do is get like seven maybe
and<00:01:05.259> then<00:01:05.469> you<00:01:05.560> put<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.890> charge<00:01:06.219> like<00:01:06.549> that<00:01:07.450> hi

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
and then you put the charge like that hi

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:15.060 
and then you put the charge like that hi
so<00:01:10.619> here's<00:01:11.619> how<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:11.920> do<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:14.229> skip<00:01:14.649> blocks

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
so here's how you do it you skip blocks

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.849 
so here's how you do it you skip blocks
1<00:01:15.670> 2<00:01:15.939> 3<00:01:16.329> 4<00:01:17.049> 5<00:01:18.479> 6<00:01:19.479> hole<00:01:20.109> do<00:01:20.229> em<00:01:21.750> 6x6<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:23.560> we've<00:01:23.710> got

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
1 2 3 4 5 6 hole do em 6x6 so we've got

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:31.740 
1 2 3 4 5 6 hole do em 6x6 so we've got
12<00:01:24.310> repeaters<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:30.149> you<00:01:31.149> want<00:01:31.359> to<00:01:31.450> put<00:01:31.600> them

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
12 repeaters and you want to put them

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:46.200 
12 repeaters and you want to put them
all<00:01:31.960> on<00:01:33.090> 4<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.380> then<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:45.280> want<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.880> connect

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
all on 4 and then you want to connect

00:01:46.210 --> 00:02:00.389 
all on 4 and then you want to connect
them<00:01:46.859> it's<00:01:47.859> Ridge<00:01:48.429> down<00:01:57.659> okay<00:01:58.659> on<00:01:59.409> by<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.159> way

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
them it's Ridge down okay on by the way

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.510 
them it's Ridge down okay on by the way

account so got this
you<00:02:13.750> just<00:02:13.930> lay<00:02:14.110> down<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.349> torch<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.950> quickly

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you just lay down a torch and quickly

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.440 
you just lay down a torch and quickly
our<00:02:16.720> way<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.290> very<00:02:20.769> slow<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:22.150> if<00:02:22.299> you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
our way and so it's very slow but if you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.860 
our way and so it's very slow but if you
want<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.530> be<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.950> most<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.489> time<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.120> have

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
want it to be on most the time and have

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.160 
want it to be on most the time and have
it<00:02:25.989> off<00:02:26.980> ah<00:02:28.110> only<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.500> little<00:02:29.980> bit<00:02:30.750> all<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:32.049> have

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
it off ah only a little bit all you have

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.680 
it off ah only a little bit all you have
to<00:02:32.290> do<00:02:32.409> is<00:02:32.560> place<00:02:32.799> a<00:02:32.829> block<00:02:33.480> place<00:02:34.480> your

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
to do is place a block place your

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.890 
to do is place a block place your
redstone<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.530> then<00:02:35.709> place<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:35.980> torch<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.720> it's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
redstone and then place a torch so it's

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.819 
redstone and then place a torch so it's
on<00:02:38.519> for<00:02:39.519> most<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.849> time<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:43.079> so<00:02:44.079> with<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.349> really

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
on for most the time so so with a really

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.940 
on for most the time so so with a really
slow<00:02:45.099> one<00:02:45.340> will<00:02:46.030> kind<00:02:46.299> of<00:02:46.359> be<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:49.950> so

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
slow one will kind of be like that so

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.659 
slow one will kind of be like that so
