00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.899
 that is my name is guillermo 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.989
 of dissident lime whiskey 7 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.140
 in fania 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.439
 bossio had japan 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.960
 and in this little baby 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.679
 explain how to achieve 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.689
 the points 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 of a parable 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.290
 jack to be able 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.440
 an antenita uefa today 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.730
 or to place a constituents 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.180
 to build 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.180
 a recording microphone addicted 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.660
 he commented 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 although this calculation serves 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.480
 as well as the managerial people and they are higher than before 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.850
 with many times 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 oo - more than optimal results 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.630
 that this parable 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.600
 has done the drawing with scale 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.410
 to total meter 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.590
 approximately 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.710
 my life 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.310
 the other value we need to know her central depression that is the depth 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.560
 in the center of the parabola 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.150
 that in this case 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.820
 60 thousand 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.140
 I repeat 300 millimeters of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 60 deep depth with that we started 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.580
 the first thing we put 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.790
 meters per day meter in this case 300 by 300 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.190
 that value that does not 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.190
 divided 10 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.710
 central in this case 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 it's a constant number 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.550
 I feel that for three 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.550
 eric all in 90 thousand 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.140
 s with a simple 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.140
 that is the final result 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.699
 with 75 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.809
 93 with 75 is the exact point from the bottom of the parabola forward 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.069
 they concentrate 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.510
 there yes it was not the point of concentration dehesa for mouth point 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.439
 I repeat 93 points 75 the dot 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.609
 where will we have to put 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.609
 our before my account for our micro 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.879
 I hope this has served you 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.599
 it gave me excellent results I repeat several times 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.689
 Any little thing, go to my website 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.009
 that together we can solve 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.009
 the problems that present a strong hug 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.039
 and at any time
