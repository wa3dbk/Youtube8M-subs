00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.089
 Hidden menu on the smartphone for this 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.030

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.150
 called adjustments and you place the option 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.850

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.940

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.010

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.400
 of message indicating t that you are already 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.450

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.560
 way that the left hand can 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.240

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.220

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.320
 you have turned on your phone you 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.750
 we recommend that you do not play with them 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.790
 without being well aware what they are for 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.610
 because they can alter the normal 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.830
 operation of your good device already 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.880
