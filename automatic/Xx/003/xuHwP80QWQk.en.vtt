00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
just seem to pop up a lot and that's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.899 
just seem to pop up a lot and that's
kind<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> frustrating<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.640> here

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
kind of frustrating so you can see here

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.120 
kind of frustrating so you can see here
there's<00:01:15.119> three<00:01:15.479> different<00:01:15.570> chapters<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
there's three different chapters and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
there's three different chapters and
then<00:01:17.430> there's<00:01:17.670> about<00:01:17.939> 10<00:01:18.240> missions<00:01:18.630> per

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
then there's about 10 missions per

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.719 
then there's about 10 missions per

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
chapter so you get about 30 levels in

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.420 
chapter so you get about 30 levels in
the<00:01:20.880> game<00:01:21.229> which<00:01:22.229> isn't<00:01:22.590> bad<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.250> price

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the game which isn't bad for the price

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.940 
the game which isn't bad for the price
it's<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> in-app<00:01:24.960> purchases<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.770> kind

I have discovered so far and you kind of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.210 
I have discovered so far and you kind of
fine<00:01:48.090> metals<00:01:48.479> throughout<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.220> throughout

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
fine metals throughout the throughout

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.940 
fine metals throughout the throughout
the<00:01:50.310> levels<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.560> kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the levels and so it's kind of a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.740 
the levels and so it's kind of a
free-roaming<00:01:53.430> game<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.149> explore<00:01:54.540> each

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
free-roaming game you can explore each

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
free-roaming game you can explore each
of<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> maps<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> map<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
of the maps as you see the map here and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.850 
of the maps as you see the map here and
then<00:01:57.240> there's<00:01:57.450> different<00:01:58.020> objectives<00:01:58.680> to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
then there's different objectives to

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.319 
then there's different objectives to
complete<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.369> map<00:01:59.549> as<00:01:59.729> well<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.149> gotta

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
complete the map as well so you gotta

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.920 
complete the map as well so you gotta
kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.930> balance<00:02:01.409> both<00:02:01.560> exploring<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
kind of balance both exploring and

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.060 
kind of balance both exploring and
completing<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> objective<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:05.009> example

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
completing the objective so for example

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.180 
completing the objective so for example
this<00:02:05.549> objective<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> UAB<00:02:06.899> has<00:02:07.680> located

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
this objective is that a UAB has located

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.150 
this objective is that a UAB has located

see me bouncing back and forth here if I
want<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.710> do<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.860> one<00:02:27.130> start<00:02:27.430> difficulty<00:02:27.940> which

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
want to do a one start difficulty which

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.240 
want to do a one start difficulty which
also<00:02:28.690> equals<00:02:28.960> how<00:02:29.440> many<00:02:29.470> command<00:02:30.040> points

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
also equals how many command points

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.520 
also equals how many command points
you'll<00:02:30.550> get<00:02:30.760> at<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.600> end<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.110> harder<00:02:32.410> you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
you'll get at the end so the harder you

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.100 
you'll get at the end so the harder you
play<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.920> more<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.310> earn<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.390> let's<00:02:34.900> just

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
play the more you earn so let's just

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.080 
play the more you earn so let's just
plan<00:02:35.290> easy<00:02:35.650> for<00:02:35.980> now<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.250> advance<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.940> then

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
plan easy for now in advance and then

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.960 
plan easy for now in advance and then
now<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.930> can<00:02:38.110> do<00:02:38.380> each<00:02:38.680> mission<00:02:39.130> has<00:02:39.550> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
now you can do each mission has the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.410 
now you can do each mission has the
option<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.510> go<00:02:41.050> ahead<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:43.000> some<00:02:43.210> upgrades

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
option to go ahead and do some upgrades

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.510 
option to go ahead and do some upgrades
before<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.170> mission<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.500> only<00:02:44.830> apply<00:02:45.280> for

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
before the mission that only apply for

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.100 
before the mission that only apply for
that<00:02:45.610> mission<00:02:45.820> so<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.150> can<00:02:46.360> increase<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.780> range

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that mission so I can increase the range

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.170 
that mission so I can increase the range
of<00:02:47.350> fire<00:02:47.560> during<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.070> duration<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.850> next

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
of fire during the duration of the next

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.310 
of fire during the duration of the next
mission<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:49.660> I'm<00:02:49.720> going<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.900> go<00:02:49.990> ahead<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.170> buy

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
mission so I'm going to go ahead and buy

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.650 
mission so I'm going to go ahead and buy
that<00:02:50.680> I'm<00:02:51.220> also<00:02:51.370> going<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.670> buy<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.850> light<00:02:52.210> armor

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
that I'm also going to buy a light armor

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.870 
that I'm also going to buy a light armor
during<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.080> mission<00:02:53.350> as<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:54.400> see<00:02:54.610> here<00:02:54.850> I

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
during this mission as you see here I

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.730 
during this mission as you see here I
