00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
it that much and this kind of gets in

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.910 
it that much and this kind of gets in
the<00:00:46.590> way<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.430> take<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.270> off<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.890> go<00:00:49.890> ahead

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the way you can take it off and go ahead

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.139

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and unscrew it it's a little bit more

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.979 
and unscrew it it's a little bit more
difficult<00:00:54.600> than<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> looks<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.710> uh<00:00:56.899> there<00:00:57.899> we

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
difficult than it looks but uh there we

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:58.459 
difficult than it looks but uh there we
go

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
go

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.200 
go
take<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> off<00:00:59.520> screw<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> cap<00:01:00.780> back<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
there you go your stylus is a complete

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.600 
there you go your stylus is a complete
pencil<00:01:06.000> nail<00:01:06.180> anyway<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> tip

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
pencil nail anyway so we have the tip

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.850 
pencil nail anyway so we have the tip
here<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.240> tip<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> lot<00:01:10.290> smaller<00:01:10.740> than

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
here the tip is a lot smaller than

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.830 
here the tip is a lot smaller than
almost<00:01:11.850> every<00:01:12.180> single<00:01:12.360> stell<00:01:12.630> that's<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
almost every single stell that's that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.780 
almost every single stell that's that
I've<00:01:12.930> seen<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.250> refined<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
I've seen this as a more refined and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.010 
I've seen this as a more refined and
defined<00:01:14.970> look<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.170> well<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.979> more

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
defined look to it as well as a more

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
defined look to it as well as a more
defined<00:01:19.020> way<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.619> using<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.729> like

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
defined way of using it I actually like

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.249 
defined way of using it I actually like
it<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.600> doesn't<00:01:21.630> feel<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.020> I'm

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it because it doesn't feel like I'm

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
it because it doesn't feel like I'm
dragging<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.830> across<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.280> screen<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.759> feels

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
dragging it across the screen it feels

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
dragging it across the screen it feels
more<00:01:24.210> actually<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> define<00:01:25.020> pen<00:01:25.530> or

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
so refined and it's absolutely a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.719 
so refined and it's absolutely a
pleasure<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:37.320> balanced<00:01:38.040> perfectly

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the tip of it doesn't feel like it's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.280 
the tip of it doesn't feel like it's
dragging<00:01:47.970> across<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.720> actually<00:01:49.020> feels<00:01:49.229> like

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
dragging across it actually feels like

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.730 
dragging across it actually feels like
it's<00:01:49.470> gliding<00:01:49.829> across<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:51.409> it's<00:01:52.409> absolutely
