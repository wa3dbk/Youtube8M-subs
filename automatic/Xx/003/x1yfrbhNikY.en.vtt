00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
was it like around 2000 it was like

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.290 
was it like around 2000 it was like
somewhere<00:03:31.100> around<00:03:31.220> there<00:03:31.550> right<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:32.000> was<00:03:32.150> like

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
somewhere around there right it was like

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.990 
somewhere around there right it was like
the<00:03:32.390> beginning<00:03:32.570> of<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.430> for<00:03:34.430> me<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.610> the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
the beginning of the for me the the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.340 
the beginning of the for me the the
video<00:03:35.630> games<00:03:35.900> cinematic<00:03:37.959> evolution<00:03:38.959> for<00:03:39.170> lack

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
video games cinematic evolution for lack

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.500 
video games cinematic evolution for lack
of<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.560> better<00:03:39.709> term<00:03:40.120> especially<00:03:41.120> when<00:03:41.390> it

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
of a better term especially when it

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.390 
of a better term especially when it
comes<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.989> voice<00:03:42.260> acting<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.830> really<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.340> a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
comes to voice acting I really have a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.620 
comes to voice acting I really have a
problem<00:03:43.730> with<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:43.880> voice<00:03:44.030> acting<00:03:44.420> in<00:03:44.510> that

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
problem with the voice acting in that

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.780 
problem with the voice acting in that
game<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:45.830> not<00:03:45.980> really<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:46.430> much<00:03:46.489> the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
game and it's not really so much the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.940 
game and it's not really so much the
voice<00:03:47.030> actors<00:03:47.630> themselves<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.560> thought<00:03:48.799> the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
voice actors themselves I thought the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.620 
voice actors themselves I thought the
script<00:03:49.190> was<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.459> little<00:03:49.730> weak<00:03:49.910> especially<00:03:50.360> in

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
script was a little weak especially in

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.390 
script was a little weak especially in
the<00:03:50.690> beginning<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.320> more<00:03:51.560> more<00:03:51.920> importantly

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the beginning but more more importantly

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.860 
the beginning but more more importantly
like<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.820> thing<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.120> was<00:03:53.209> so<00:03:53.330> problematic

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
like the thing that was so problematic

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.170 
like the thing that was so problematic
in<00:03:54.200> Final<00:03:54.620> Fantasy<00:03:54.920> 10<00:03:55.130> from<00:03:55.850> what<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.090> remember

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
in Final Fantasy 10 from what I remember

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.479 
in Final Fantasy 10 from what I remember
and<00:03:56.840> they<00:03:57.080> didn't<00:03:57.290> change<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:57.709> in<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.980> ps3

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
and they didn't change that in the ps3

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.360 
and they didn't change that in the ps3
remaster<00:03:59.060> version<00:03:59.450> is<00:03:59.680> like<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.830> characters

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370
