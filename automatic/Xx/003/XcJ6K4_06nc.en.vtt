00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
a major scale starting on any note let's

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.240 
a major scale starting on any note let's
try<00:04:34.729> see<00:04:35.060> down<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.229> third<00:04:36.440> fret<00:04:38.530> if<00:04:39.530> you

try see down to the third fret if you

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.129 
try see down to the third fret if you
move<00:04:40.460> up<00:04:40.729> using<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.240> whole<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.690> half<00:04:41.720> step

move up using the whole and half step
major<00:04:42.410> scale<00:04:42.770> formula<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.850> get<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> C<00:04:44.270> major

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419
