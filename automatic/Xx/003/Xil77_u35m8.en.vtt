00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.909
 I'm going to cancel because I have it 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.859

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.830

 gta san andrés ruiz and gta san andreas 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.340
 portable here you selecting it not 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.340

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.800
 It is very fast in the installation as you see 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.340
 we just give it in finish and already this 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.439
 If you want, you can erase it 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.689
 and as you can see, what remained would be san 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.760
 Andrés multiplayer in version 0.3 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.410
 it's installed 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.420
 It is worth mentioning that it is not necessary 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.700
 uninstall if you had the version 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.210
 0.3 x will not have to uninstall or anything 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.010

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.850
 ready 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.260
