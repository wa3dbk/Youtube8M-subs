 electric guitar and acoustic guitar 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.419

 But then comes also move 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.779
 the guitars amp 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:11.349
 Philipp Dahm is a broad chest 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.869

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:16.869
 a 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.549

 at the n 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.569
 Caracas, maybe we will be very beautiful and simple 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.800
 both problems completely 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.449
 as usual 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.999

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.020
 in Oberrieden the tactician 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.849
 nevertheless that means 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.249
 Franconia 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.050

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 I 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.770
 one 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.870
 One is the location is serious but it is not power 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.449
 both spend 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.169

 as soon as you get in and out again 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.919

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.419
 between August the stage 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:54.169
 which one is the right one 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.439

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:31.999
 optimal combination of third easily convertible and acoustic guitars 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:33.029
