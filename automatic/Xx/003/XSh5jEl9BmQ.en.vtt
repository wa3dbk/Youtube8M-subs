 rivera 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.679
 An area 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.150
 basically 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.990
 the village by people 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.200
 believe they are going to work in this area

 about this helicopter that has fallen 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.700
 in this area 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.630
 from new york we think that he put it well also immersing himself for 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.400

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.080
 to people who are trapped in a helicopter only those

 inside 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.730
 and what we are observing 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.969
 measured according to the images that we can 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.040
 that we can see is the aria list where all the people are 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.609
 it seems that the helicopter was there 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.989
 if that place were given, lifted flight 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.040
