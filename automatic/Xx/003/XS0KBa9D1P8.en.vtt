there so you want to get your fingers
keep<00:06:11.009> them<00:06:11.159> moving<00:06:11.189> so<00:06:11.789> after<00:06:12.089> you<00:06:12.239> hit<00:06:12.329> that

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
keep them moving so after you hit that

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.819 
keep them moving so after you hit that
you're<00:06:12.599> going<00:06:12.719> to<00:06:12.779> pick<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.289> first<00:06:13.679> string

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:13.829 
you're going to pick the first string

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:15.679 
you're going to pick the first string
open

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
open

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.399 
open
so<00:06:16.589> that<00:06:16.830> think<00:06:17.219> of<00:06:17.309> that<00:06:17.459> last<00:06:17.729> note<00:06:17.969> that<00:06:18.409> as

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
so that think of that last note that as

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.619 
so that think of that last note that as
the<00:06:19.679> beginning<00:06:20.129> of<00:06:20.279> the<00:06:20.489> the<00:06:21.119> riff<00:06:21.360> right

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:21.629 
the beginning of the the riff right

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.869 
the beginning of the the riff right
after<00:06:21.839> that<00:06:21.959> you<00:06:22.019> monitor<00:06:22.169> if<00:06:22.469> okay<00:06:22.879> because

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
after that you monitor if okay because

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:28.219 
after that you monitor if okay because
that's<00:06:23.999> basically<00:06:24.059> what<00:06:24.449> it<00:06:24.479> is<00:06:27.139> that's<00:06:28.139> the

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
that's basically what it is that's the

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.079 
that's basically what it is that's the
riff<00:06:28.379> we<00:06:28.499> learned<00:06:28.679> after<00:06:28.949> the<00:06:29.039> E<00:06:29.069> minor<00:06:29.249> so<00:06:29.999> the

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
riff we learned after the E minor so the

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:41.719 
riff we learned after the E minor so the
way<00:06:30.209> this<00:06:30.360> works<00:06:30.419> is<00:06:30.809> it<00:06:31.110> goes<00:06:40.549> see<00:06:41.549> where<00:06:41.699> it

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
way this works is it goes see where it

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.749 
way this works is it goes see where it
is<00:06:42.139> if<00:06:43.139> you<00:06:43.289> can't<00:06:43.529> just<00:06:43.739> go<00:06:44.039> and<00:06:44.249> stop<00:06:44.579> buying

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
is if you can't just go and stop buying

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.350 
is if you can't just go and stop buying
like<00:06:44.909> the<00:06:44.939> tab<00:06:45.409> so<00:06:46.409> then<00:06:46.529> after<00:06:46.649> you<00:06:46.829> do<00:06:46.949> that

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
like the tab so then after you do that

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.509 
like the tab so then after you do that
the<00:06:48.360> last<00:06:48.569> part<00:06:48.749> is<00:06:48.929> just<00:06:49.199> you<00:06:49.919> just<00:06:50.159> pick<00:06:50.369> the

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:50.519 
the last part is just you just pick the

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:54.679 
the last part is just you just pick the
second<00:06:50.939> string<00:06:51.149> open<00:06:53.119> and<00:06:54.119> then<00:06:54.269> it<00:06:54.389> ties<00:06:54.509> it

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:54.689 
second string open and then it ties it

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:56.899 
second string open and then it ties it
all<00:06:54.749> together<00:06:54.869> right<00:06:55.349> so<00:06:56.099> once<00:06:56.489> again<00:06:56.610> the

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:56.909 
all together right so once again the

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:04.430 
all together right so once again the
very<00:06:57.149> last<00:06:57.389> parts<00:06:57.749> and<00:06:57.869> like<00:06:57.989> this

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.390
