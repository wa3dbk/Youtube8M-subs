00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
and buttons that are used in the arcade

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.310 
and buttons that are used in the arcade
systems<00:00:35.920> for<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.040> actual<00:00:37.280> games<00:00:37.550> there's<00:00:38.090> a

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
systems for the actual games there's a

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.729 
systems for the actual games there's a
one-set<00:00:39.320> called<00:00:39.620> Sunhwa<00:00:41.380> parts<00:00:42.380> that<00:00:42.620> are

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
one-set called Sunhwa parts that are

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.870 
one-set called Sunhwa parts that are
very<00:00:43.100> common<00:00:43.550> in<00:00:43.610> most<00:00:44.480> arcade<00:00:45.290> machines<00:00:45.880> in

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
very common in most arcade machines in

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.000 
very common in most arcade machines in
Japan<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.989> reason<00:00:48.320> that's<00:00:48.440> important<00:00:48.920> is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
Japan and the reason that's important is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.860 
Japan and the reason that's important is
because<00:00:49.070> they're<00:00:49.489> very<00:00:49.760> very<00:00:50.090> different<00:00:50.780> than

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
because they're very very different than

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.740 
because they're very very different than
like<00:00:51.200> american-style<00:00:51.950> sticks<00:00:52.520> or<00:00:52.850> just<00:00:53.600> about

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
like american-style sticks or just about

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.250 
like american-style sticks or just about
any<00:00:53.960> other<00:00:55.300> arcade<00:00:56.300> fighting<00:00:56.600> stick<00:00:56.930> that<00:00:57.050> you

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
any other arcade fighting stick that you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.930 
any other arcade fighting stick that you
would<00:00:57.440> buy<00:00:57.620> for<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:58.100> reasonable<00:00:58.610> amount<00:00:58.790> of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
would buy for a reasonable amount of

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.630 
would buy for a reasonable amount of
money<00:00:59.000> and<00:01:00.100> that's<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.250> big<00:01:01.460> difference

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
money and that's a big difference

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.370 
money and that's a big difference
whenever<00:01:02.180> that's<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:02.690> mean<00:01:02.840> that's<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.050> big<00:01:03.230> deal

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
whenever that's I mean that's a big deal

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.600 
whenever that's I mean that's a big deal
when<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:03.590> go<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.829> arcade<00:01:04.159> if<00:01:04.430> I've<00:01:04.519> been

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
when I go to the arcade if I've been

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.530 
when I go to the arcade if I've been
playing<00:01:04.850> on<00:01:04.970> something<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.330> feels

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
playing on something that feels

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.910 
playing on something that feels
completely<00:01:06.020> different<00:01:06.110> when<00:01:06.650> you're<00:01:06.770> trying

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
completely different when you're trying

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.789 
completely different when you're trying
to<00:01:07.010> pull<00:01:07.220> off<00:01:07.370> certain<00:01:08.000> moves<00:01:08.470> especially<00:01:09.470> in

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
to pull off certain moves especially in

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.260 
to pull off certain moves especially in
Street<00:01:10.040> Fighter<00:01:10.070> where<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:10.549> have<00:01:10.700> the

Street Fighter where you have the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.810 
Street Fighter where you have the

quarter circle and dragon punch type

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.030 
quarter circle and dragon punch type
motions<00:01:14.330> which<00:01:15.200> are<00:01:15.320> kind<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.530> weird<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:15.979> you

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
motions which are kind of weird so you

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.800 
motions which are kind of weird so you
really<00:01:16.280> need<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.490> get<00:01:16.580> used<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.210> controls

the<00:02:05.750> joystick<00:02:06.229> you'll<00:02:06.380> see<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.650> second<00:02:07.040> a

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
the joystick you'll see in a second a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.960 
the joystick you'll see in a second a
joystick<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.440> six<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.800> like<00:02:10.369> punching<00:02:10.759> kick

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
joystick and six of like punching kick

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.150 
joystick and six of like punching kick
buttons<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.660> then<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.989> start<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:12.950> split

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
buttons and then to start and split

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
buttons and then to start and split
button<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.489> don't<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:13.760> that

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
button I don't have that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.869 
button I don't have that
all<00:02:14.959> right<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:15.680> bought<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.129> joystick

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
all right so I just bought the joystick

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.860 
all right so I just bought the joystick
and<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.209> buttons<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.730> then<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
and the buttons and so then the the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.020 
and the buttons and so then the the
problem<00:02:21.379> was<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.620> was<00:02:22.010> like<00:02:22.129> well<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.459> have<00:02:22.790> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
problem was I was like well I have to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.319 
problem was I was like well I have to
get<00:02:23.569> this<00:02:23.720> thing<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:24.110> interface<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.920> that's

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
get this thing to interface and that's

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.550 
get this thing to interface and that's
what<00:02:26.329> you're<00:02:26.510> really<00:02:26.750> paying<00:02:27.079> for<00:02:27.349> when<00:02:27.439> you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
what you're really paying for when you

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.640 
what you're really paying for when you
buy<00:02:27.590> an<00:02:27.890> arcade<00:02:28.280> stick<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.939> the<00:02:29.650> electronics

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
buy an arcade stick is the electronics

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.500 
buy an arcade stick is the electronics
board<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.280> allows<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.730> interface<00:02:32.269> with

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
board that allows it to interface with

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.179 
board that allows it to interface with
the<00:02:32.629> computer<00:02:32.750> or<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.409> game<00:02:33.620> system<00:02:34.069> or

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
the computer or the game system or

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.460 
the computer or the game system or
whatever<00:02:34.489> so<00:02:35.359> then<00:02:35.540> what<00:02:35.659> I<00:02:35.689> did<00:02:35.959> i<00:02:36.140> scrounged

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
whatever so then what I did i scrounged

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.130 
whatever so then what I did i scrounged
around<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:37.549> some<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.329> other<00:02:38.480> stores<00:02:38.840> and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
around and some of the other stores and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.170 
around and some of the other stores and
I<00:02:39.200> found<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.709> really<00:02:40.040> cute<00:02:40.280> five<00:02:40.730> dollar

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
I found this really cute five dollar

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.819 
I found this really cute five dollar

into<00:02:51.500> your<00:02:51.650> computer<00:02:52.159> you<00:02:52.340> know<00:02:52.819> six<00:02:53.150> button

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
into your computer you know six button

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.970 
into your computer you know six button
will<00:02:53.750> actually<00:02:54.079> had<00:02:54.200> trigger<00:02:54.440> buttons<00:02:54.829> and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
will actually had trigger buttons and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.069 
will actually had trigger buttons and
then<00:02:55.069> select<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.790> store<00:02:56.569> it<00:02:56.750> or<00:02:56.900> whatever

then select and store it or whatever

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.030 
then select and store it or whatever
these<00:02:57.829> extra<00:02:58.159> buttons<00:02:58.430> here<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.959> what<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.680> did<00:03:00.799> I

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
these extra buttons here so what I did I

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.559 
these extra buttons here so what I did I
got<00:03:01.310> my<00:03:02.260> multimeter<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:05.120> went<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.389> work

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
got my multimeter and I went to work

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.210 
got my multimeter and I went to work
find<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:05.989> out<00:03:06.109> what<00:03:06.439> all<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.709> connections

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
find it out what all the connections

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.000 
find it out what all the connections
were<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.260> know<00:03:09.379> after<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.620> tore<00:03:09.859> it<00:03:09.889> apart

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
were so you know after I tore it apart

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.520 
were so you know after I tore it apart
and<00:03:10.430> got<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.670> board<00:03:10.970> out<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.900> as<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.379> can

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
and got the board out of it as you can

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.830 
and got the board out of it as you can
see<00:03:12.680> it's<00:03:12.859> just<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.220> got<00:03:13.459> taped<00:03:13.849> up<00:03:14.060> here<00:03:14.329> so

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
see it's just I got taped up here so

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.699 
see it's just I got taped up here so
what<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:14.989> did<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.849> checked<00:03:16.849> everything<00:03:17.150> out<00:03:17.709> to

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
what I did I checked everything out to

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.259 
what I did I checked everything out to
find<00:03:18.949> where<00:03:19.099> all<00:03:19.129> the<00:03:19.340> connections<00:03:19.790> were<00:03:19.970> and

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
find where all the connections were and

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.300 
find where all the connections were and
the<00:03:20.780> great<00:03:20.959> thing<00:03:21.139> about<00:03:21.169> this<00:03:21.500> board<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:22.069> it's

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
the great thing about this board is it's

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.009 
the great thing about this board is it's
everything<00:03:22.699> is<00:03:22.879> a<00:03:22.940> common<00:03:23.359> ground<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.870> goes

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
everything is a common ground it goes

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.039 
everything is a common ground it goes
all<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.530> one<00:03:24.739> ground<00:03:25.099> so<00:03:26.090> it's<00:03:26.389> actually<00:03:26.810> very

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
all to one ground so it's actually very

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.509 
all to one ground so it's actually very
simple<00:03:27.530> especially<00:03:27.799> if<00:03:28.129> I<00:03:28.190> knew<00:03:28.340> how<00:03:28.459> to

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
simple especially if I knew how to

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.689 
simple especially if I knew how to
solder<00:03:28.849> what<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.480> worth<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.169> crap<00:03:30.440> my<00:03:31.400> hands

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:31.699 
solder what the worth a crap my hands

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.849 
solder what the worth a crap my hands
are<00:03:31.849> so<00:03:31.970> unsteady<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.750> what<00:03:33.349> you<00:03:33.680> should

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
are so unsteady and what you should

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:34.839 
are so unsteady and what you should
really<00:03:34.010> do<00:03:34.250> on<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.459> board

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
really do on this board

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.080 
really do on this board
if<00:03:35.299> I<00:03:35.769> go<00:03:36.769> back<00:03:36.980> which<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.519> probably<00:03:37.669> will<00:03:37.909> is

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
if I go back which I probably will is

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.899 
if I go back which I probably will is
you<00:03:38.239> can<00:03:38.389> think<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.049> could<00:03:39.199> drill<00:03:39.470> through<00:03:39.829> it

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
you can think you could drill through it

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.729 
you can think you could drill through it
so<00:03:40.909> you<00:03:40.940> could<00:03:41.120> come<00:03:41.329> out<00:03:41.359> and<00:03:42.230> then<00:03:42.409> just<00:03:42.440> kind

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
so you could come out and then just kind

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.289 
so you could come out and then just kind
of<00:03:42.769> hook<00:03:42.979> your<00:03:43.190> wire<00:03:43.370> over<00:03:43.669> because<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.090> needed

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
of hook your wire over because I needed

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.939 
of hook your wire over because I needed
really<00:03:44.599> three<00:03:44.930> hands<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.379> be<00:03:45.500> doing<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:45.859> but

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
really three hands to be doing this but

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.439 
really three hands to be doing this but
anyway<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.849> wired<00:03:47.479> in<00:03:48.220> all<00:03:49.220> my<00:03:49.549> switches<00:03:49.879> all

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
anyway so I wired in all my switches all

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.569 
anyway so I wired in all my switches all
my<00:03:50.629> controller

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
my controller

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.920 
my controller
pieces<00:03:53.169> to<00:03:54.169> this<00:03:54.949> board<00:03:55.370> after<00:03:56.359> I've<00:03:56.479> taken<00:03:56.720> it

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
pieces to this board after I've taken it

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.369 
pieces to this board after I've taken it
apart<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:58.549> know<00:03:58.750> figured<00:03:59.750> out<00:03:59.900> all<00:04:00.109> the

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
apart and you know figured out all the

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.319 
apart and you know figured out all the
circuitry<00:04:01.099> and<00:04:01.370> what<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.909> did<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.919> so<00:04:03.919> now
