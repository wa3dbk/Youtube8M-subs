00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 la s 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.909
 we are both a discussion about actually not knowing which system 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.189
 and i can with the out to the cable you are then you are experts 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.910
 that could ensure that children do not use fuel 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.670
 day 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.500
 the third time they worked together, which is close to the turk next week 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.390
 chapter for the civil orders chapter for the civil orders that is earlier 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.710
 company of five people bid that proposal 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.710
 assessed 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.560
 in hand 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.320
 orange was correct because there are more people who thought of it 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.900
 someone needs a ribbon because you have to come up with it yourself and you don't have to do it yourself 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.450
 think of something else that should think of jan hof 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.820
 your full 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.860
 yes I have myself I already have good seats 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.010
 that is certainly my mine 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.210
 major damage to the perpetrators that he suddenly thought I wanted to walk or not 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.939
 to forget 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.310
 but he would have been bullied what a win at the first game for 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.969
 a ribbon 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.109
 To go with that they need a good example of that 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 an absolute van to be busy with the songs for next year 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.920
 they must be everything that you drove over the bandwidth or over the woman 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.600
 must represent 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.699
 and what does that have to do to emphasize 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.709
 the emphasis is entirely on exceptional earnings already next year 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.709
 old paper 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.950
 the mayor that group 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.099
 first start by asking the from 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.450
 so let's take a look 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.450
 standing, the lion sometimes concludes in the police registers 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.509
 thus explains 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.509
 it would be so much more 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.269
 although the royal procession with the day tomorrow we must always have a contract 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.099
 I made sure that if you get a ribbon 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.099
 otherwise walk anyway 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.919
 good morning Netherlands 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.509
 it's not day today 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:23.679
 in space 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.679
 that is a formality but not resumed 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.499
 it has its majesty king the hook the royal honor 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.959
 employee 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.959
 it is where I expect to take away a victory 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.109
 I am now going to be on the rear wheels 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.109
 and now I may have to put on a different suit 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.359
 junkie xl 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.029
 but unfortunately can expect 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.109
 at fc twente but got very hot 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.620
 know the marriage through e-mail 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.689
 what 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:20.840
 children 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.639
 beyond
