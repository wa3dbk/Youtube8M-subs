 the map is lumsa and attentive because it has 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.360
 that centex that will give you a triple 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.950
 low and tuned through smoke kills 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.390

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.650
 the right shoots without finding without giving 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.290
 to his goal and he takes out high school and 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.060
 kills the first target first blood 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.960
 look to the left you will find that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.760

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.590
 get anywhere 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.569
 David enters the kitchen and does not 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.819
 precisely to catch a box of 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.159
 milk fails the first shot but the 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.170

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.780
 a hunch has that feeling of 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.189
 that shooting through the wall is 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.049
 will effectively make a collateral 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.409
 which are going through the wall 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.359
