 Y 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.480

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.400
 geoff taylor and good guys surely 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.250
 you're wondering what happened is living 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.930
 you had already done this because we 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.029
 We had presented in the museum of your 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.050
 consoles or the consoles collection of 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.510
 atari but not guys this is something a 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.660
 how can you give everyone a gift 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.720
 those of us who like retro games and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.690
 atari company obviously took out a 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.970
 classic atari consoles collection 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 made 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.640
 and adapted for the new televisions 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.860
 in a series called atari flashback and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 good what you have on screen 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.150
 is a very powerful atari flashback 2 and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.740
 what a difference it had from 1 very good 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.590
 the original task because practically 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.570
 the 2 the 3 and the 4 are practically what 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.210
 same they change nothing more some games 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.630
 good as you will know the console 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.840
 original was launched in 1977 but 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.210
 obviously for the current consoles already 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
 it can not be used and besides that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.710
 of the cartridges and find them is in 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.320
 Chinese unless you're a fanatic and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.119
 the beeches preserved since the 80s 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.180
 it's like a server but no no no no 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.150
 gather a lot about 3 4 or 5 at the most 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.940
 then guys the atari flashback is a 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.550
 paquetazo that includes the best of the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.229
 retro games of those years but now 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.140
 come integrated into a kind of 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.420
 chipset that this judge brings this 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.900
 Replica of the atari because it really is 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.870
 much smaller 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.650
 than its original predecessor that was the 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.750
 tie and manufactured in 1977 and brings everything very 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.480
 adapted with buttons very much in style 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.570
 retro keeping that first 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.030
 atari edition where was the edition 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.350
 I voted the wood edition and brought nothing 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.720
 more already included 40 games but 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.510
 practically the best classics 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.790
 that existed at that time and that 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.190
 they were releasing them gradually to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.070
 Through different editions this 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.340
 flash console pack 2 was released in the 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.350
 year 2005 does not have much that was released 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.870
 if you do not think it's a console 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.920
 very old is not a console that came out in 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.170
 limited 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.450
 amounts for the general public 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.570
 I think I would like to buy it and have a 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.030
 atari console and play pretty much like 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.459
 was played in the 80s well then 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.220
 atari flashback was the solution the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.680
 Unlike the old console this one already 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.360
 it included the two controls as 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.040
 can see here already brought included the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.340
 two controls and the console is 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.890
 extremely small in addition to 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.769
 the original atari controls 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.530
 they come as the first edition and 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.590
 they practically come sculpted and the and 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.099
 carved like that legendary edition 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.470
 from the 70s practically a gem 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.870
 this coast is this atari flashback 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.690
 here you see here is engraved atari 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.030
 flashback and had the audio cables and 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.280
 normal videos the analogs in that what 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.980
 you can connect to any television and 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.530
 gives you the possibility gives you the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.299
 possibility of playing them in color and in 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.250
 black and white because it has a small 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.079
 switch that tells you to see you want to apply 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.390
 the color or you want to apply the white and 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.430
 black to remember your times is 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.049
 christus and you have children and you say look 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.530
 these little games are the ones that played and 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.959
 good includes 40 games of the best 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.000
 that there was in those then and most 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.069
 parents that good comes adapted 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.530
 adapts to some type of televisions and 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.510
 good comes something very very retro but 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.099
 obviously very adapted these times 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.099
 see the controls are original 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:03.580
 carved by atari and it really feels 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.980
 you have the feeling of being playing 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.290
 and original because that was the idea of ​​the 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.910
 beautiful controls are really that 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.830
 this is a jewel and veins there is my hand 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.110
 pinchito yesterday the hand is of the tiger 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.380
 so they can see just how small it is 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.900
 the atari flashback compared in 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.640
 comparison of the original task that 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.110
 practically the size of the finished 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.300
 and I'm going to give you control so that 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.780
 you see the size of atari 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.280
 flashback is a miniature is a baby 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.890
 practically part of me 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.480
 collection and has the buttons this the 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.190
 levers are connected here so 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.930
 analogous as always here costs me a 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.220
 little bit of work because recording and doing 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.760
 with a real hand it's pretty 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.530
 quite tedious and good at what he achieved 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.480
 remove here they see that they stick has the 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.890
 reset button the typical buttons 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.020
 they serve there has the kind of television 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.420
 black and white and color this was not 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.090
 necessary but good is a is a geek 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.040
 it's a retro gag do not see here it's already coming out 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.860
 the cable and here is gentlemen check 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.710
 manufactured by atari by the company 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.350
 original atari is not a clone is something 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.720
 original binding and a beautiful thing 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.730
 gentlemen in addition already brings the cables see 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.290
 the video and one audio because no 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.600
 you need two audio channels, nothing more 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.050
 has one with one is more than enough 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.060
 and has the power reset buttons 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.890
 difficulty and one to change the games 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.710
 and good among the games that brings brings
