00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello good girls and boys today 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.320
 I bring how to fix this disaster of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.620
 plastic boats I imagine that all in 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 their house happens to them this good I tell them 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.310
 something me this that I'm going to show you what 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.470
 I have to do more or less every 15 days 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.260
 because I have a night that helps me and what 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.050
 what it does is literally throw me all 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.590
 the boats in here do not organize them 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.870
 by no means then first thing 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.510
 what we have to do is take everything 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.510
 selecting the way that if they are 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.380
 square by round is like me what 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.250
 I select soil and the covers placed them 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.470
 all to one side that I'll be back with the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.930
 selection and well I tell you more or less 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.700
 what I did this was really quickie 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.739
 not more than two minutes to get the 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.150
 things and have this as it is right now 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.960
 I have a little boat that not only there 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.350
 placed all covers the bottom and the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.490
 sides placed the covers here I have the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.259
 bigger little boats that I have 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.229
 rectangular that there are other covers 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.720
 that are very big shots and dacs that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.130
 let's take a look now that I show you 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.229
 I have the ones that are rectangular 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.990
 I have others try to put it in ones 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.390
 two others in the best way they can 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.560
 that all fit here are all the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.370
 circular and here are more caps 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.990
 now what do we do 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.990
 what happened 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.820
 they touch 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:53.260
 This large circular stood me 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:55.590
 we're going to do down here and this this 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.590
 here 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.100
 there are times that inevitably the only 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.560
 of baby cites but they will tend 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.950
 minimize them because that's when they come 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.950
 the problems 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.290
 I can not 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.290
 here that I stay a space 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.040
 endesa 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.100
 little pots of food is fine if half 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:35.240
 two 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.240
 these little ones now that back 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.540
 and this is my baby's food 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.260
 come difference how long we take 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.810
 I could tell you that 5 minutes can 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.849
 have a little more organized this that if 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.870
 they try to make 10 people what they 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.359
 organize the plastic questions because 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.340
 if they are not going to be in the disaster that 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.470
 was at first good I hope you 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.140
