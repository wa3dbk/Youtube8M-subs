00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.820
 Good morning I'm in bed if you 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.809
 You can see that you see my comforter and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.369
 I am sunday today 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.859
 and yes, I then look still the same 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.660
 youtube videos and have it somebody's breakfast 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.730
 and that's just how I am 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.070
 oat bran as storage manager with 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.779
 oat bran for me, that's all 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.199
 actually has to do with oatmeal 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.030
 porridge and what's just soaked 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.149
 and then I have apples over it 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.230
 done and still a bit and honey 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.690
 is still in there because i really like it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.430
 not if that tastes so bland and yes 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 I still think it's better than that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.840
 crunchy mussli what I usually eat 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 or I eat the finished porridge that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.360
 It's not that healthy , either 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.239
 I think in the morning it is not quite so 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.250
 bad and yes I have already 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.600
 pancakes or something done and it is not 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.550
 Problem if you are once a week 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 or it is really no 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.379
 problem and yes that will be a kilo again 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.590
 taken off only as times as an update full 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.590
 cool and today there is one 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.150
 sugar beet and leek and I believe 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.119
 this is pretty stars and I will 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.549
 now eat and try 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.470
 today there are spelled noodles and 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.420
 then homemade tomato sauce 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.880
 with a bit of paprika and a 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.030
 bit of cheese over it 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.220
 and yes it was then again 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.710
 Today there is a field salad and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.630
 green peppers and a little bit more 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.590

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.549
 tortellini are quite normal from aldi 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.399
 and then I have one more here 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 pack quattro formats I know that it 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.460
 but not as healthy as I am today 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 learned all day and it is 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.020
 are actually alright known 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.210
 The ingredients just are not that good 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.399
 and then I train him now 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.500
 is what I thought when I look 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.060
 that time and as I said once a week 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.750
 You can definitely sin that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.960
 no problem 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.360
 and yes, there's one tonight 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.670
 porridge with a bit of apple and a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.500
 little cinnamon today, there are two 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.739
 oven potatoes with a bit of quark 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.040
 and in quark is also burke in it 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.120
 and hold a few spices and then 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.250
 I just have a cucumber salad 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.690
 but cases still tops the image 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.290
 but somehow we do not have any here 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.390
 that's why it's now in the evening 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.480

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.940
 play and a bit certain and still 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.400
 There is a green tea for lunch today 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.189
 once 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.349
 spelled noodles and a bit of broccoli 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:49.430
 that's left over from yesterday 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.420
 that's why it 's frozen and the whole thing 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.700
 I have a bit more protection then 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.640
 and is almost a student today now 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.000
 once a salad with paprika and with 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:05.109
 scampis a roommate just has one 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.900
 heidelberg steam linked baked 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:12.470
 No idea steamed everything 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.940
 looks extremely good and yes if it does 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.750
 then at the plate is then I show you 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.909

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.889
 turned upside down it was just overthrown 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.650
 and that's what the thing looks like and me 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.450
 I think it will taste very good 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.239
 and yes the little ones are in the evening so it 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.030
 is not necessarily healthy do not be surprised 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:40.000
 but oh my god 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.170
 so you can do what on 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.519
 Today there's a small cut court 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.519

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.019
 then there are some spices 30 again 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.799

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.459
 his taken 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.880
 how bad but general it is 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.550
 actually quite healthy and yes I think so 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.020
 it tastes that way too 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.810

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.919
 I'm so crisp there, I know 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.710
 not if I crumble now and 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.539
 just a cloth or if I simply 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.659
 a tank still because that is still left 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.510

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:47.110
 equal so that I may in the car is on 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.110
