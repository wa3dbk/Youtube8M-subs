to do like I call it a flower girl look

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.550 
to do like I call it a flower girl look
makes<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.059> easier<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.420> girls<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.080> sit<00:00:16.289> still

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
makes it easier for girls to sit still

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.510 
makes it easier for girls to sit still
when<00:00:16.770> they<00:00:16.890> think<00:00:16.949> they're<00:00:17.279> getting<00:00:17.369> their

hair done like a flower girl

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.090 
hair done like a flower girl
so<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.039> either<00:00:20.250> look<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.240> little<00:00:21.660> girls<00:00:22.100> or

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
so it's either look for little girls or

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.029 
so it's either look for little girls or
you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.150> yourself<00:00:24.539> -<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.650> loopy

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you can do it on yourself - it's a loopy

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.630 
you can do it on yourself - it's a loopy
reverse<00:00:26.960> side<00:00:27.960> braid<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> side<00:00:29.250> ponytail

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
reverse side braid with a side ponytail

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.470 
reverse side braid with a side ponytail
so<00:00:30.570> you'll<00:00:30.779> need<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.920> comb<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.969> section<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
so you'll need a comb to section the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.830 
so you'll need a comb to section the
hair<00:00:33.510> an<00:00:34.110> elastic<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.570> two<00:00:36.570> clear<00:00:36.989> elastics

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
hair an elastic and two clear elastics

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
hair an elastic and two clear elastics
so<00:00:39.840> you'll<00:00:40.020> start<00:00:40.559> by<00:00:41.040> sectioning<00:00:41.850> off<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so you'll start by sectioning off the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.279 
so you'll start by sectioning off the
hair<00:00:42.860> diagonally<00:00:43.860> from<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> hairline<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
hair diagonally from the hairline and

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.529 
hair diagonally from the hairline and
diagonal<00:00:46.289> across<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.890> head<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.270> way<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
diagonal across the head all the way to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.740 
diagonal across the head all the way to
the<00:00:48.960> back<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.280> neck<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.079> then<00:00:53.270> just<00:00:54.270> put

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the back of the neck and then just put

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.240 
the back of the neck and then just put
the<00:00:54.989> bottom<00:00:55.800> section<00:00:57.050> in<00:00:58.050> an<00:00:58.379> elastic<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:59.129> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:10.219 
the bottom section in an elastic just to
get<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:08.689> we've<00:01:09.689> showed<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
reverse french braid in a previous

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.370 
reverse french braid in a previous
tutorial<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.909> need<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.150> look<00:01:15.930> back<00:01:15.990> at

tutorial so if you need to look back at
that<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.189> how<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.460> done<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.970> can

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that one to see how it's done you can

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.450 
that one to see how it's done you can
look<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.619> gonna<00:01:20.009> start

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
look at that but we're just gonna start

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460 
look at that but we're just gonna start
right<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:20.970> top<00:01:21.299> section<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> hair<00:01:22.320> off

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
right at the top section the hair off

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.219 
right at the top section the hair off
into<00:01:22.890> three<00:01:23.130> pieces<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.900> start<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.049> our

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
into three pieces and start with our

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:39.190 
into three pieces and start with our
reverse<00:01:25.560> french<00:01:26.250> braid

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.630 

and<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.560> secure<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.550> an<00:01:41.730> elastic

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
and you can secure that with an elastic

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.030 
and you can secure that with an elastic
so<00:01:44.640> after<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.330> elastic<00:01:45.510> in<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.860> can

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
so after you put the elastic in you can

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.040 
so after you put the elastic in you can
start<00:01:47.340> pulling<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.240> sides<00:01:48.510> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> braid

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
start pulling the sides of the braid

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.370 
start pulling the sides of the braid
just<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> make<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.860> look<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:51.420> wide<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
just to make it look more wide and a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.050 
just to make it look more wide and a
little<00:01:53.040> bit<00:01:53.160> loopy<00:01:54.920> just<00:01:55.920> keep<00:01:56.130> working<00:01:56.880> at<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
little bit loopy just keep working at it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.260 
little bit loopy just keep working at it
from<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.570> bottom<00:01:57.900> up<00:02:00.770> until<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:03.060> right

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
from the bottom up until it's the right

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.270 
from the bottom up until it's the right
width<00:02:03.720> they<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.550> be<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:10.380> then

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
width they you want it to be and then

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.260 
width they you want it to be and then
you<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.730> take<00:02:12.120> out<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> other<00:02:12.630> section<00:02:14.270> so

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
you can take out the other section so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.600 
you can take out the other section so
just<00:02:15.540> bring<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.900> over<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.160> all<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
just bring it over to so that all the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.960 
just bring it over to so that all the
hair<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.240> side<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.800> then<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.820> can

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
hair is at the side and then you can

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.220 
hair is at the side and then you can
take<00:02:21.120> another<00:02:21.300> clear<00:02:21.840> elastic<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:24.390> put<00:02:24.990> all

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
take another clear elastic and put all

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:40.220 
take another clear elastic and put all
the<00:02:25.440> hair<00:02:25.620> together

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.880 

so<00:02:41.230> that's<00:02:41.440> it

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
so that's it

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.550 
so that's it
that's<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.370> loopy<00:02:43.030> reverse<00:02:43.480> side<00:02:44.170> braid

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
that's a loopy reverse side braid

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.580 
that's a loopy reverse side braid
