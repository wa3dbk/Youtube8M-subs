00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.970
 salt mezzanine today was ice cream day 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.400
 made a lot of cakes and pastries from 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.680
 him up to a variety of sorbets during 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.809
 I had two preparations 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.849
 crash the first is runaway milk 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:35.000
 who escaped within a radius of 1 meter from 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.739
 pots were cleaned by the whole group and the second 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.040
 The accident happened when I downloaded my 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.559
 Malibu sorbet in a cooking machine 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.210
 Sheksna's ice cream was a wrap tap I 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.579
 not checked and as a result when we 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.430
 half the sorbet came to their senses was on the floor 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.280
 but all this is minor trouble despite 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.579
 on them the day was very interesting and 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.920
 positive and start putting down again 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.079
 all the ingredients in order in separate 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.629
 containers so then the process goes 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.640
 faster and more organized first thing 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.229
 started cooking french meringue for 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.420
 then to use it in 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.670
 other recipes and also for serving 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.530
 it is prepared from sugar which 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.899
 whipped with proteins in equal proportions 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.119
 then the same part is added there 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.950
 powdered sugar from meringue and made 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.780
 small bars in order to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.239
 them then make bumpers for the cake 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.640
 ice cream and cakes for not important 

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:27.739
 sprinkled with pink about Lenin for beauty 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.450
 and taste and moreover from meringue did 

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:31.849
 other blanks that will be needed 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.459
 later then it all goes to 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:37.640
 oven and dried on temperature 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.140
 90 degrees are also prepared in advance 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.479
 caramel elements for serving 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.000
 made balls of thin caramel 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.759
 threads a variety of funny graphic 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.530
 elements and almonds in caramel for this 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.780
 peeled nuts are placed on 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.090
 a toothpick dipped in thick caramel 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.110
 and are hung so that the caramel 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.360
 flowed down 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.940
 ready-made desserts look very 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.729

 melts it heats up to very 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.959
 high temperature and then im 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.150
 almonds are poured 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.069
 the frozen mass must be ground and 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.230

 into spherical shapes 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.370
 above we cover everything in small circles 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.160
 already ready meringues they are as a result 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.110

 vanilla is not raspberry with basil 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.140
 by the way is very tasty and in itself for 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.270
 making ice cream at the institute we 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.610
 used a special big very 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.160
 expensive car for home of course there is 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.650
 gadgets are much smaller then layers 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.480
 ice cream alternate layers of cakes from 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.970
 finished meringue all is well 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.700
 freezes neatly removed from 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.360
 shape and decorated with meringue with pink 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.060

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.030
 and whipped cream turns out very 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.770
 beautiful cake which is especially spectacular 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.630
 looks at the cut 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.400
 In addition, caramel cooked 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.920
 ice cream sundae 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.780
 bulan pains on mango sorbet 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.940
 even with a little love for ice cream 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.280
 hold on and not try all this 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.290
 beauty is simply impossible of course 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.630
 preparing ice cream at home 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.220
 not an easy job to cook 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.950
 the mixture is simple but to freeze 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.080
 need either special fixtures 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.810
 cars or nozzles or freezing it 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.220
 in the refrigerator you need as often as possible 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.900
 stir to make it more 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.790
 tender and not turned to stone 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.100
 despite the fact that I am not big 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.470
 I have a huge fan of ice cream 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.300
 desire to repeat a lot of what u 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.700
 we were taught the truth today 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.880
 experiment without the most powerful 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.440
 ice cream making machines 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.410
 which we used today in the kitchen 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.090
 Well, let's see what happens 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.190
 it seems the daughter begins to run bye 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.360
