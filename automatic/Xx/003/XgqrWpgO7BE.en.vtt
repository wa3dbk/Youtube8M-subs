that<00:01:33.119> they<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.750> lack<00:01:34.049> creativity<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that they they lack creativity in the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.649 
that they they lack creativity in the
middle<00:01:35.189> they<00:01:35.640> still<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.390> silly

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
mistakes in the defense though and I

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.819 
mistakes in the defense though and I
think<00:01:38.340> Jamaica<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.909> gonna<00:01:39.060> punish<00:01:39.299> them

think Jamaica is gonna punish them

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.260 
think Jamaica is gonna punish them
because<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> these<00:01:41.040> things<00:01:41.189> mm-hmm<00:01:41.909> all<00:01:42.060> right
