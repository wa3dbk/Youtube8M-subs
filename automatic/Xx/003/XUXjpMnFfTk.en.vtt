he's a bastard but uh yeah sub-zero is
like<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.790> think<00:00:32.880> he's<00:00:33.149> pretty<00:00:33.570> much<00:00:33.690> scorpions

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140

like I think he's pretty much scorpions
rival<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:34.620> nemesis<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.489> think<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> back<00:00:36.120> story

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
rival or nemesis I think the back story

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.350 
rival or nemesis I think the back story
is<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.510> he<00:00:37.410> killed<00:00:37.649> scorpions<00:00:38.640> family<00:00:39.120> or

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
is that he killed scorpions family or

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.200 
is that he killed scorpions family or
his<00:00:39.480> clan

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.639 
I play against sub-zero I always get
frozen<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.350> really<00:00:46.800> pissed<00:00:47.039> me<00:00:47.190> off<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:51.649> the
