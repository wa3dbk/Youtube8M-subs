thud<00:00:35.530> is<00:00:36.040> this<00:00:36.430> CNC<00:00:36.940> machined<00:00:37.710> aluminum<00:00:38.710> clamp

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
thud is this CNC machined aluminum clamp

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.950 
thud is this CNC machined aluminum clamp
you'll<00:00:39.940> notice<00:00:40.180> there's<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.480> two<00:00:40.630> different

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
you'll notice there's the two different

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.380 
you'll notice there's the two different
linked<00:00:41.140> thumb<00:00:41.440> screws<00:00:41.829> and<00:00:42.640> that<00:00:43.120> they're<00:00:43.300> all

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
linked thumb screws and that they're all

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.510 
linked thumb screws and that they're all
spring-loaded<00:00:43.960> so<00:00:44.320> this<00:00:44.500> makes<00:00:44.739> its<00:00:44.980> with<00:00:45.399> the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
spring-loaded so this makes its with the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.590 
spring-loaded so this makes its with the
two<00:00:45.640> different<00:00:45.879> links<00:00:46.030> that<00:00:46.180> this<00:00:46.420> will<00:00:46.570> work

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
two different links that this will work

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600 
two different links that this will work
on<00:00:46.870> just<00:00:47.080> about<00:00:47.200> anything<00:00:47.560> so<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:48.340> can<00:00:48.460> take

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
on just about anything so you can take

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.080 
on just about anything so you can take
this<00:00:48.760> plastic<00:00:49.000> one<00:00:49.980> throw<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.100> away<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.580> go

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
this plastic one throw it away and go

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.060 
this plastic one throw it away and go
for<00:00:52.300> this<00:00:52.420> aluminum<00:00:52.870> one<00:00:53.020> instead<00:00:53.380> so<00:00:53.950> we're

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
for this aluminum one instead so we're

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.830 
for this aluminum one instead so we're
gonna<00:00:54.160> show<00:00:54.400> this<00:00:54.610> thing<00:00:54.850> just<00:00:55.090> quickly<00:00:55.750> and

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
gonna show this thing just quickly and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.060 
gonna show this thing just quickly and
easily<00:00:55.930> how<00:00:56.200> you<00:00:56.260> would<00:00:56.470> install<00:00:56.829> it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
easily how you would install it

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.760 
easily how you would install it
basically<00:00:57.730> put<00:00:58.240> the<00:00:58.360> spring<00:00:58.690> on<00:00:59.410> whichever

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
basically put the spring on whichever

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.680 
basically put the spring on whichever
screw<00:01:00.070> you're<00:01:00.250> going<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.430> use<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:01.150> longer<00:01:01.510> one

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
screw you're going to use the longer one

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.900 
screw you're going to use the longer one
is<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.440> screw<00:01:02.710> we<00:01:02.829> need<00:01:02.980> for<00:01:03.220> this<00:01:03.370> particular

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
is the screw we need for this particular

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.690 
is the screw we need for this particular
rack<00:01:04.150> on<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:04.960> Vespa<00:01:05.320> s<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:06.040> shorter<00:01:06.430> screw

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
rack on this Vespa s the shorter screw

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.880 
rack on this Vespa s the shorter screw
is<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.970> one<00:01:07.119> that<00:01:07.270> would<00:01:07.390> use<00:01:07.659> on<00:01:08.079> all<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.439> GTS

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
is the one that would use on all the GTS

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.950 
is the one that would use on all the GTS
applications<00:01:09.640> but<00:01:10.180> this<00:01:10.360> will<00:01:10.540> work<00:01:10.659> on<00:01:10.840> the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
applications but this will work on the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.380 
applications but this will work on the
front<00:01:11.170> rack<00:01:11.439> rear<00:01:11.829> rack<00:01:12.040> any<00:01:12.369> fold<00:01:12.939> down<00:01:13.149> rack

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
front rack rear rack any fold down rack

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.660 
front rack rear rack any fold down rack
for<00:01:13.689> virtually<00:01:14.200> any<00:01:14.470> Vespas<00:01:15.369> it's<00:01:15.579> an

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
for virtually any Vespas it's an

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.929 
for virtually any Vespas it's an
extremely<00:01:16.320> Universal<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.680> versatile<00:01:18.640> little

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
extremely Universal and versatile little

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.760 
extremely Universal and versatile little
clamp<00:01:19.299> so<00:01:20.079> we're<00:01:20.229> familiar<00:01:20.319> with<00:01:20.679> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
clamp so we're familiar with the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.099 
clamp so we're familiar with the
spring-loaded<00:01:21.219> racks<00:01:21.659> basically<00:01:22.659> push<00:01:22.929> the

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
spring-loaded racks basically push the

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.770 
spring-loaded racks basically push the
rack<00:01:23.259> down<00:01:24.359> before<00:01:25.359> you<00:01:25.420> do<00:01:25.539> that<00:01:25.689> you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
rack down before you do that you

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.760 
rack down before you do that you
actually<00:01:25.810> go<00:01:26.079> ahead<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.289> get<00:01:26.380> this<00:01:26.530> started

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
actually go ahead and get this started

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.010 
actually go ahead and get this started
so<00:01:27.009> you'll<00:01:27.249> start<00:01:27.549> threading<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.240> thumb

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
so you'll start threading the thumb

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.559 
so you'll start threading the thumb
screw<00:01:29.319> in<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:29.560> clamp<00:01:30.030> again<00:01:31.030> we're<00:01:31.299> not<00:01:31.420> going

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
screw in the clamp again we're not going

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:32.879 
screw in the clamp again we're not going
to<00:01:31.600> use<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:31.840> shorter<00:01:32.139> screw<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.619> fold

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:32.889 
to use the shorter screw so you fold

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:37.370 
to use the shorter screw so you fold
this<00:01:32.979> thing<00:01:33.039> down<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:35.159> hooks<00:01:36.159> around<00:01:36.459> the<00:01:36.609> rack

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
this thing down it hooks around the rack

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.349 
this thing down it hooks around the rack
like<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:38.679> you<00:01:38.740> hold<00:01:39.159> it<00:01:39.369> tight<00:01:39.579> and<00:01:39.850> you

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
like so you hold it tight and you

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:45.090 
like so you hold it tight and you
tighten<00:01:40.780> that<00:01:40.929> thumb<00:01:41.200> screw<00:01:43.709> this<00:01:44.709> is<00:01:44.859> a<00:01:44.889> nice

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
tighten that thumb screw this is a nice

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.340 
tighten that thumb screw this is a nice
alternative<00:01:45.310> definite<00:01:45.969> carry<00:01:46.179> zip-ties<00:01:46.659> it's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
alternative definite carry zip-ties it's
