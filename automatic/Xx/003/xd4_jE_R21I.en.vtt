what<00:00:05.460> kind<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.790> competition<00:00:06.120> do<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.629> see

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
what kind of competition do you see

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.660 
what kind of competition do you see
between<00:00:07.379> dota<00:00:07.830> 2<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.429> Lego<00:00:08.880> legends<00:00:09.210> um<00:00:10.429> the<00:00:11.429> I

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
between dota 2 and Lego legends um the I

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.039 
between dota 2 and Lego legends um the I
think<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:11.969> player<00:00:12.210> base<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.570> very<00:00:12.809> different

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
think that player base is very different

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.079 
think that player base is very different
because<00:00:13.250> dota<00:00:14.250> has<00:00:14.400> always<00:00:14.610> been<00:00:14.730> there<00:00:14.940> and

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
because dota has always been there and

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.580 
because dota has always been there and
has<00:00:15.599> always<00:00:15.839> appeal<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> different

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
has always appeal to a different

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.720 
has always appeal to a different
audience<00:00:16.880> I<00:00:17.880> think<00:00:18.300> DOTA<00:00:18.480> DOTA<00:00:19.490> dota<00:00:20.490> would

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
audience I think DOTA DOTA dota would

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.509 
audience I think DOTA DOTA dota would
dota<00:00:21.539> like<00:00:21.960> people<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:22.980> always<00:00:23.130> played<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
dota like people have always played it

dota like people have always played it
like<00:00:23.640> they<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.210> seven<00:00:24.660> million

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
think dota is this different in terms of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.630 
think dota is this different in terms of
gameplay<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> look<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.160> legalizes

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
gameplay like if you look at legalizes

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.639 
gameplay like if you look at legalizes
game<00:00:32.880> rate<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.690> very<00:00:33.899> fast<00:00:34.110> pace<00:00:34.320> it's

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
game rate it's it's very fast pace it's

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.220 
game rate it's it's very fast pace it's
30<00:00:35.280> minutes<00:00:35.640> long<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.059> 34<00:00:36.690> minutes<00:00:36.719> long<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
30 minutes long and 34 minutes long and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.420 
30 minutes long and 34 minutes long and
dota<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.950> around<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:39.090> 60<00:00:39.600> minute<00:00:39.719> game<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
dota is around a 60 minute game and it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.400 
dota is around a 60 minute game and it
really<00:00:42.120> appeals<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> different<00:00:43.170> audience

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
really appeals to different audience

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.130 
really appeals to different audience
like<00:00:43.590> League<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.219> Legends<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
like League of Legends is it's more I

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.740 
like League of Legends is it's more I
wouldn't<00:00:46.559> say<00:00:46.620> friendly<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.460> think<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.570> lot

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
wouldn't say friendly I think it's a lot

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.470 
wouldn't say friendly I think it's a lot
more<00:00:48.780> friendly<00:00:49.140> than<00:00:49.469> dota<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:50.789> she's

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
more friendly than dota because she's

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
more friendly than dota because she's
based<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> interface<00:00:52.140> alone<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.800> very

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
based on the interface alone it's very

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.229 
based on the interface alone it's very
simple<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> lot<00:00:53.699> easier<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.059> learn

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
simple it's a lot easier to learn

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.630 
simple it's a lot easier to learn
there's<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.680> many<00:00:56.160> things<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
there's not as many things you have to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
there's not as many things you have to
learn<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:56.910> when<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> play<00:00:57.329> dota<00:00:57.539> there's<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
learn but when you play dota there's a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
learn but when you play dota there's a
lot<00:00:58.199> more<00:00:58.379> youth<00:00:58.739> alone<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
lot more youth alone and I think that

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
lot more youth alone and I think that
DOTA<00:01:00.780> dota<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.590> appeals<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> different

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
tracking the same audience the same

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.639 
tracking the same audience the same
people<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.630> are<00:01:45.840> watching<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.170> legends<00:01:46.530> now

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
people that are watching the legends now

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.260 
people that are watching the legends now
are<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> sell<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:47.909> watching<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
are going to sell be watching the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.030 
are going to sell be watching the
legends<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> people<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.710> don't<00:01:49.890> play

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
legends and the people that don't play

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.740 
legends and the people that don't play
the<00:01:50.189> game<00:01:50.220> will<00:01:50.880> probably<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.240> put<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.540> game

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the game will probably not put the game

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.780 
the game will probably not put the game
I<00:01:51.990> mean<00:01:52.530> we'll<00:01:52.649> probably<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:53.040> watch<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
I mean we'll probably not watch it and I

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.670 
I mean we'll probably not watch it and I
stay<00:01:53.939> play<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> game<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> only

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
stay play the game so I think the only

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.620 
stay play the game so I think the only
good<00:01:56.430> thing<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.969> come<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> bring<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
good thing that can come out of bring it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
good thing that can come out of bring it
to<00:01:57.840> television<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.829> more<00:01:59.009> exposure<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
to television is more exposure to the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639 
to television is more exposure to the
game<00:01:59.850> which<00:02:00.479> means<00:02:00.810> getting<00:02:01.200> more<00:02:01.409> people<00:02:01.530> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
game which means getting more people to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.770 
game which means getting more people to
play<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> game<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:03.329> don't<00:02:03.479> need<00:02:03.600> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
play the game but I really don't need I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.819 
play the game but I really don't need I
really<00:02:04.170> don't<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.469> step<00:02:04.710> is

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
really don't think that step is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.139 
really don't think that step is
necessary<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.729> long<00:02:06.570> as<00:02:06.750> um<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.229> long<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
necessary as long as um as long as the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.190 
necessary as long as um as long as the
game<00:02:09.330> console<00:02:09.780> improves<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
game console improves and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.170 
game console improves and
people<00:02:11.530> still<00:02:12.340> see<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.670> may<00:02:12.970> be<00:02:13.030> because

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
people still see it may be because

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.630 
people still see it may be because
league<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.170> legends<00:02:14.379> has<00:02:14.620> never<00:02:14.830> needed
