00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.690 

I<00:01:59.240> all<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.630> them<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.370> place<00:02:02.370> where<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I all of them have the place where you

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.660 
I all of them have the place where you
put<00:02:02.910> your<00:02:03.180> chain<00:02:04.170> through<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:07.280> think<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.460> one

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
put your chain through I think this one

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.320 
put your chain through I think this one
is<00:02:08.700> my<00:02:09.090> favorite<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:10.470> because<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.330> sheer

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
is my favorite just because of the sheer

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.350 
is my favorite just because of the sheer
simplicity<00:02:12.570> of<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.530> mean<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.670> doesn't<00:02:15.240> have

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
simplicity of it I mean it doesn't have

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.540 
simplicity of it I mean it doesn't have
a<00:02:15.390> lot<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.660> crystals<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.890> what<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.370> does

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
a lot of crystals on it but what it does

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:49.270 
a lot of crystals on it but what it does
have<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.360> shiny

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.510 

I've<00:02:49.910> changed<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.290> paint<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:51.920> use<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
I've changed the the paint that I use to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.490 
I've changed the the paint that I use to
do<00:02:52.700> my<00:02:52.970> Neptune<00:02:53.240> stuff<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:56.170> got<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.200> lot<00:02:57.440> of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
do my Neptune stuff it's got a lot of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.230 
do my Neptune stuff it's got a lot of
silver<00:02:58.040> shimmer<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.819> it

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.690 

I<00:03:04.420> don't<00:03:05.230> know<00:03:05.320> how<00:03:05.500> well<00:03:05.650> my<00:03:05.800> camera<00:03:06.250> picks<00:03:06.520> it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
I don't know how well my camera picks it

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:18.370 
I don't know how well my camera picks it
up

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.680 

and<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:19.190> Pluto<00:03:19.490> can<00:03:19.700> come<00:03:19.880> in<00:03:20.000> silver<00:03:20.390> too

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
and the Pluto can come in silver too
