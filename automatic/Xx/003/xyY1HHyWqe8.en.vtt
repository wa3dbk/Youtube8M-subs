up<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.390> year<00:01:50.480> that's<00:01:50.570> been<00:01:51.010> well<00:01:52.010> it's<00:01:52.130> been<00:01:52.280> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
up the year that's been well it's been a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.220 
up the year that's been well it's been a
huge<00:01:52.580> challenge<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.480> huge<00:01:53.720> effort<00:01:53.900> from<00:01:54.200> the

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
huge challenge in a huge effort from the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.230 
huge challenge in a huge effort from the
guys<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.920> get<00:01:55.220> through<00:01:55.490> our<00:01:55.520> very<00:01:55.730> first<00:01:56.000> year

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
guys to get through our very first year

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.270 
guys to get through our very first year
with<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.390> new<00:01:56.480> manufacturer<00:01:57.070> it's<00:01:58.070> gone<00:01:58.250> pretty

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
with a new manufacturer it's gone pretty

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.399 
with a new manufacturer it's gone pretty
quick<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:58.909> when<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.180> look<00:01:59.330> back<00:01:59.360> it<00:02:00.080> seems

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
quick and when you look back it seems

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.410 
quick and when you look back it seems
like<00:02:00.530> only<00:02:00.830> yesterday<00:02:00.980> that<00:02:01.640> we're<00:02:02.210> at

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
like only yesterday that we're at

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.450 
like only yesterday that we're at
clipsal<00:02:02.870> and<00:02:03.230> we<00:02:03.350> only<00:02:03.470> just<00:02:03.590> made<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.340> with

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
clipsal and we only just made it with

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.550 
clipsal and we only just made it with
enough<00:02:04.700> engines<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.480> cars<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:05.900> parts<00:02:06.230> to

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
enough engines and cars and parts to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.469 
enough engines and cars and parts to
actually<00:02:06.830> go<00:02:06.980> racing<00:02:07.400> after<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.300> whole

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
actually go racing after the whole

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.630 
actually go racing after the whole
design<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.110> production<00:02:09.229> of<00:02:09.739> everything

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
design and production of everything

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.589 
design and production of everything
that's<00:02:10.819> in<00:02:11.659> and<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.230> under<00:02:12.319> these<00:02:12.590> cars<00:02:12.920> so

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
that's in and on and under these cars so

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.380 
that's in and on and under these cars so
to<00:02:14.599> sum<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.650> think<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.010> been<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.390> an

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
to sum it up I think it's been a an

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.240 
to sum it up I think it's been a an
outstanding<00:02:17.659> year<00:02:18.230> for<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.470> first-year<00:02:18.920> given

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
outstanding year for a first-year given

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.949 
outstanding year for a first-year given
that<00:02:19.370> everything<00:02:19.760> was<00:02:19.879> new<00:02:20.329> and<00:02:20.480> mostly

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
that everything was new and mostly

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.050 
that everything was new and mostly
designed<00:02:21.349> in-house<00:02:21.799> we've<00:02:22.609> had<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> few

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
designed in-house we've had a few

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.699 
designed in-house we've had a few
failures<00:02:23.569> along<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.049> way<00:02:24.170> which<00:02:24.409> we've

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
failures along the way which we've

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.010 
failures along the way which we've
addressed<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.249> improved

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
addressed and improved

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.480 
addressed and improved
reliabilities<00:02:27.020> outstanding<00:02:27.920> at<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.100> moment

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
reliabilities outstanding at the moment

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.490 
reliabilities outstanding at the moment
and<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.480> cars<00:02:29.720> are<00:02:29.870> getting<00:02:29.930> quicker<00:02:30.290> and

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
and the cars are getting quicker and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000 
and the cars are getting quicker and
quicker<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.430> our<00:02:31.550> first<00:02:31.820> year<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:33.230> top<00:02:33.860> that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
quicker so in our first year to top that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.250 
quicker so in our first year to top that
off<00:02:34.070> with<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.400> front<00:02:35.210> row<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.570> win<00:02:35.750> at<00:02:35.900> winton

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
off with a front row and a win at winton

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.920 
off with a front row and a win at winton
with<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.500> guys<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:38.060> probably<00:02:38.570> more<00:02:38.780> than

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
with the guys is is probably more than

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.780 
with the guys is is probably more than
we<00:02:39.050> could<00:02:39.260> have<00:02:39.350> expected<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:40.070> next<00:02:40.610> year's

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
we could have expected and next year's

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.120 
we could have expected and next year's
going<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.000> be<00:02:41.090> bigger<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.420> better<00:02:41.540> for<00:02:41.840> us

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
going to be bigger and better for us

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.080 
going to be bigger and better for us
it's<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.160> lot<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.400> talk<00:02:43.550> through<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.880> early

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
it's a lot of talk through the early

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.610 
it's a lot of talk through the early
phase<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.450> year<00:02:44.720> about<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.080> engine<00:02:45.470> and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
phase of the year about the engine and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.290 
phase of the year about the engine and
then<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.010> lot<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.400> attention<00:02:46.820> at<00:02:46.940> least<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.240> the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
then a lot of attention at least in the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.420 
then a lot of attention at least in the
media<00:02:47.570> switch<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.990> arrow<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:48.470> guess<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.250> crux

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
media switch to arrow I guess the crux

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.800 
media switch to arrow I guess the crux
of<00:02:49.550> it<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:50.030> need<00:02:50.060> everything<00:02:50.480> right

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
of it is that you need everything right

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.150 
of it is that you need everything right
in<00:02:50.960> this<00:02:51.080> game<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.560> right<00:02:51.830> up<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:51.980> front

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
in this game to be right up the front

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.400 
in this game to be right up the front
yeah<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.390> certainly<00:02:53.570> do<00:02:53.900> need<00:02:54.140> everything

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
yeah you certainly do need everything

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.470 
yeah you certainly do need everything
spot-on<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.100> i<00:02:55.610> would<00:02:56.060> say<00:02:56.240> we're<00:02:56.420> probably

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
spot-on and i would say we're probably

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.330 
spot-on and i would say we're probably
about<00:02:56.840> eighty<00:02:57.200> percent<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.920> way<00:02:58.040> there

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
about eighty percent of the way there

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.610 
about eighty percent of the way there
with<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.850> engine<00:02:59.120> now<00:02:59.300> and<00:02:59.960> we've<00:03:00.110> got<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.320> few

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
with the engine now and we've got a few

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.760 
with the engine now and we've got a few
improvements<00:03:01.490> which<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:02.150> expect<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.540> see

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
improvements which we expect to see

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.170 
improvements which we expect to see
early<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.950> mid<00:03:04.100> next<00:03:04.430> year<00:03:04.640> which<00:03:04.880> will<00:03:05.030> have

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
early to mid next year which will have

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.870 
early to mid next year which will have
us<00:03:05.330> hopefully<00:03:06.140> right<00:03:06.290> on<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.560> money<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.950> on

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
us hopefully right on the money and on

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.110 
us hopefully right on the money and on
the<00:03:08.060> arrow<00:03:08.210> side<00:03:08.540> we're<00:03:08.810> hoping<00:03:09.290> for<00:03:09.500> some

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the arrow side we're hoping for some

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.070 
the arrow side we're hoping for some
modifications<00:03:11.120> for<00:03:11.270> next<00:03:11.480> year<00:03:11.630> as<00:03:11.750> well<00:03:11.900> and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
modifications for next year as well and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.380 
modifications for next year as well and
if<00:03:12.140> both<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.350> those<00:03:12.620> things<00:03:12.680> come<00:03:13.160> off<00:03:13.390> the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
if both of those things come off the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.810 
if both of those things come off the
cars<00:03:14.660> are<00:03:15.050> good<00:03:15.650> around<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.010> corners<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.580> you

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
cars are good around the corners and you

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.130 
cars are good around the corners and you
know<00:03:16.910> they<00:03:17.060> handle<00:03:17.420> well<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.720> if<00:03:17.810> we<00:03:17.930> tune

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
know they handle well and if we tune

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.740 
know they handle well and if we tune
them<00:03:18.320> right<00:03:18.500> we<00:03:19.310> get<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.030> good<00:03:20.240> result<00:03:20.360> out<00:03:20.720> of

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
them right we get a good result out of

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.630 
them right we get a good result out of
them<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.170> if<00:03:21.650> we<00:03:21.830> can<00:03:21.950> get<00:03:22.040> those<00:03:22.190> two<00:03:22.430> things

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
them so if we can get those two things

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.240 
them so if we can get those two things

manufacturer and things are extremely

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.260 
manufacturer and things are extremely
hard<00:03:42.830> when<00:03:43.070> you're<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> pioneer<00:03:43.520> of<00:03:43.760> something

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
hard when you're a pioneer of something

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.800 
hard when you're a pioneer of something
and<00:03:44.930> we<00:03:45.710> did<00:03:46.250> bite<00:03:46.460> off<00:03:46.640> quite<00:03:47.300> a<00:03:47.330> bit<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.690> try

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
and we did bite off quite a bit to try

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.960 
and we did bite off quite a bit to try
and<00:03:48.050> chew<00:03:48.200> with<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.440> completely<00:03:49.430> new<00:03:49.610> engine

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
and chew with a completely new engine

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.330 
and chew with a completely new engine
developed<00:03:50.390> in-house<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.870> had<00:03:50.960> never<00:03:51.080> been

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
developed in-house it had never been

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.850 
developed in-house it had never been
running<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.430> series<00:03:52.790> like<00:03:52.820> this<00:03:53.000> before<00:03:53.510> so

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
running a series like this before so

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.520 
running a series like this before so
huge<00:03:54.860> challenge<00:03:55.370> but<00:03:55.960> you<00:03:56.960> know<00:03:57.080> it's<00:03:57.320> one<00:03:57.500> of

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
huge challenge but you know it's one of

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.990 
huge challenge but you know it's one of
those<00:03:57.710> things<00:03:57.770> you<00:03:58.130> need<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.610> get<00:03:58.700> out<00:03:58.850> there

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
those things you need to get out there

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.850 
those things you need to get out there
and<00:03:59.120> have<00:03:59.240> a<00:03:59.300> crack<00:03:59.600> and<00:03:59.780> I<00:04:00.020> think<00:04:00.560> we've<00:04:00.680> gone

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
and have a crack and I think we've gone

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.130 
and have a crack and I think we've gone
through<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.280> hard<00:04:01.490> part<00:04:02.060> now<00:04:02.150> for<00:04:02.630> sure<00:04:02.810> and

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
through the hard part now for sure and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.480 
through the hard part now for sure and
it's<00:04:03.320> just<00:04:03.440> going<00:04:03.740> to<00:04:03.770> get<00:04:03.920> easier<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.400> easier

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
it's just going to get easier and easier

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.210 
it's just going to get easier and easier
and<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.420> bulk<00:04:05.630> of<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.680> works<00:04:06.890> been<00:04:07.190> done

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
and the bulk of the the works been done

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.490 
and the bulk of the the works been done
so<00:04:07.670> it's<00:04:08.420> only<00:04:08.570> that<00:04:08.780> last<00:04:09.020> few<00:04:09.260> little<00:04:09.470> things

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
so it's only that last few little things

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.590 
so it's only that last few little things
that<00:04:09.770> we<00:04:09.950> need<00:04:10.100> now<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.340> these<00:04:11.210> cars<00:04:11.540> are

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
that we need now and these cars are

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.870 
that we need now and these cars are
