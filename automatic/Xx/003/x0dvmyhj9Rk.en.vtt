feel he was a tad one-dimensional but

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.750 
feel he was a tad one-dimensional but
that<00:02:46.260> could<00:02:46.410> be<00:02:46.440> because<00:02:46.950> he<00:02:47.310> was<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> robot

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760

that could be because he was a robot

obviously<00:06:29.450> a<00:06:29.570> must<00:06:29.930> but

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
obviously a must but

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.430 
obviously a must but
what<00:06:31.970> I<00:06:32.000> see<00:06:32.389> it<00:06:32.509> in<00:06:32.629> theaters<00:06:32.990> again<00:06:33.259> and

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
what I see it in theaters again and

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.830 
what I see it in theaters again and
again<00:06:33.650> like<00:06:33.889> I<00:06:34.069> did<00:06:34.099> with<00:06:34.669> Avengers<00:06:35.270> 1<00:06:35.509> or

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
again like I did with Avengers 1 or

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
guardians of the galaxy probably not I
