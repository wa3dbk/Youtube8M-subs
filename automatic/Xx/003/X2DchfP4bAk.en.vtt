of<00:00:42.510> moving<00:00:42.960> parts<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.860> huge<00:00:44.480> look

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
of moving parts and it's just huge look

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.920 
of moving parts and it's just huge look
at<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.870> you've<00:00:46.110> got<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> big<00:00:46.890> piece<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.210> just

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
at that you've got a big piece of just

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.189 
at that you've got a big piece of just
white<00:00:49.260> there<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.010> pieces<00:00:50.989> but<00:00:51.989> it

white there it is two pieces but it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.069 
white there it is two pieces but it
molds<00:00:52.710> together<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.399> nicely<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.329> get

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
molds together really nicely I think get

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.729 
molds together really nicely I think get
a<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:59.570> separation<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.780> but

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
a little bit of the separation there but

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.390 
a little bit of the separation there but
all<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.760> noticeable<00:01:04.400> so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
all in all it's not that noticeable so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.920 
all in all it's not that noticeable so
basically<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.119> gonna<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.510> is

basically what you're gonna do is

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.929 
basically what you're gonna do is

grades<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.300> think<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.900> that's<00:04:29.050> hand

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
grades but I think that that's hand

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.379 
grades but I think that that's hand
works<00:04:30.010> just<00:04:30.340> fine<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.700> holding<00:04:31.000> it<00:04:31.090> because

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
most of the weight is held on by that

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.180 
most of the weight is held on by that
peg<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.880> is<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.090> surprisingly<00:04:34.840> good<00:04:34.960> peg<00:04:35.410> so<00:04:36.040> why

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
peg it is a surprisingly good peg so why

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.620

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
articulation and of course clip these GN

00:04:43.419 --> 00:05:00.320 
articulation and of course clip these GN
drives<00:04:43.780> up<00:04:47.370> whoops<00:04:48.370> don't<00:04:48.729> fall<00:04:49.060> over<00:04:49.389> on<00:04:49.419> me

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.740 

you<00:05:00.870> gotta<00:05:01.110> be<00:05:01.319> careful<00:05:01.500> on<00:05:01.919> this<00:05:02.220> guy

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
you gotta be careful on this guy

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.300 
you gotta be careful on this guy
sometimes<00:05:03.750> some<00:05:04.139> of<00:05:04.169> his<00:05:04.409> pieces<00:05:04.620> fall<00:05:05.159> out

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
sometimes some of his pieces fall out

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.980 
sometimes some of his pieces fall out
when<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.520> try<00:05:05.729> and<00:05:05.849> pose<00:05:06.120> him<00:05:06.330> like<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.659> arms

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
when you try and pose him like the arms

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.080 
when you try and pose him like the arms
but<00:05:07.590> anyways<00:05:07.979> we're<00:05:08.189> gonna<00:05:08.280> try<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.729> get<00:05:08.849> him

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
but anyways we're gonna try and get him

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.379 
but anyways we're gonna try and get him
in<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.419> good<00:05:09.449> pose<00:05:10.139> here<00:05:10.500> whoops<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:12.090> sword

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
in a good pose here whoops the sword

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.939 
in a good pose here whoops the sword
fell<00:05:12.599> out<00:05:12.780> that's<00:05:13.139> never<00:05:13.379> happened<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:13.889> me

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
fell out that's never happened to me

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.499 
fell out that's never happened to me
before<00:05:16.280> this<00:05:17.280> guy<00:05:17.610> is<00:05:17.669> really<00:05:18.180> good<00:05:18.360> at

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
before this guy is really good at

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.270 
before this guy is really good at
staying<00:05:18.750> in<00:05:18.960> there<00:05:19.139> I<00:05:19.259> don't<00:05:19.349> know<00:05:19.530> why<00:05:19.800> he's

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
staying in there I don't know why he's

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.770 
staying in there I don't know why he's
not<00:05:20.310> now<00:05:25.400> but<00:05:26.400> anyways<00:05:26.789> this<00:05:27.120> is<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.509> post

not now but anyways this is the post

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.450 
not now but anyways this is the post
that<00:05:27.930> I'd<00:05:28.050> love<00:05:28.289> to<00:05:28.469> have<00:05:28.680> him<00:05:28.830> displayed<00:05:29.250> in

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
that I'd love to have him displayed in

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.249 
that I'd love to have him displayed in
of<00:05:30.180> course<00:05:30.539> there's<00:05:30.780> gonna<00:05:30.900> be<00:05:31.080> some

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
of course there's gonna be some

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.830 
of course there's gonna be some
fine-tuning<00:05:31.500> after<00:05:32.250> it<00:05:32.310> but<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.120> have<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.569> nice

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
fine-tuning after it but you have a nice

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.110 
fine-tuning after it but you have a nice
thing<00:05:34.229> here<00:05:34.560> with<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.919> shield<00:05:35.219> he's<00:05:35.699> looking

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
thing here with the shield he's looking

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.379 
thing here with the shield he's looking
at<00:05:36.270> an<00:05:36.389> attack<00:05:36.719> coming<00:05:37.050> on<00:05:37.639> to<00:05:38.639> his<00:05:38.789> shield<00:05:39.090> and

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
at an attack coming on to his shield and

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.719 
at an attack coming on to his shield and
then<00:05:39.509> he's<00:05:39.719> got<00:05:39.960> his<00:05:40.259> little<00:05:40.919> whip<00:05:41.250> blade

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
then he's got his little whip blade

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.969 
then he's got his little whip blade
thing<00:05:42.120> here<00:05:42.629> defending<00:05:43.319> against<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:43.800> of

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
thing here defending against it of

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.129 
thing here defending against it of
course<00:05:44.610> with<00:05:44.879> all<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.150> other<00:05:45.270> weapons<00:05:45.690> in<00:05:45.870> tow

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
course with all the other weapons in tow

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.119 
course with all the other weapons in tow
I<00:05:47.750> don't<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:48.960> would<00:05:49.229> compare<00:05:49.650> him<00:05:49.889> to<00:05:49.919> the

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
I don't I would compare him to the

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:51.920 
I don't I would compare him to the
double-o<00:05:50.490> quanto<00:05:50.940> right<00:05:51.240> now<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.419> double-o

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
double-o quanto right now the double-o

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:03.050 
double-o quanto right now the double-o
quante<00:05:52.409> is<00:05:53.779> in<00:05:54.779> pieces<00:06:00.500> because<00:06:01.759> he's<00:06:02.759> about

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
quante is in pieces because he's about

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:13.390 
quante is in pieces because he's about
to<00:06:03.360> be<00:06:03.479> painted

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.810 

so<00:06:14.000> there's<00:06:14.180> a<00:06:14.240> little<00:06:14.449> bit<00:06:14.540> of<00:06:14.630> a<00:06:14.690> comparison

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
so there's a little bit of a comparison

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.070 
so there's a little bit of a comparison
but<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:16.940> double-a<00:06:17.270> quant<00:06:17.479> is<00:06:17.600> about<00:06:17.870> to<00:06:17.960> be

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
but the double-a quant is about to be

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.460 
but the double-a quant is about to be
painted<00:06:18.889> and<00:06:19.540> from<00:06:20.540> all<00:06:20.720> the<00:06:20.810> pieces<00:06:21.050> that<00:06:21.320> we

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
painted and from all the pieces that we

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.980 
painted and from all the pieces that we
have<00:06:21.650> out<00:06:21.889> you<00:06:22.639> can<00:06:22.790> easily<00:06:23.120> tell<00:06:23.300> how<00:06:23.720> he's

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
have out you can easily tell how he's

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.080 
have out you can easily tell how he's
going<00:06:24.260> to<00:06:24.350> be<00:06:24.440> painted<00:06:24.830> yes<00:06:25.070> I'm<00:06:25.370> going<00:06:25.669> to<00:06:25.760> try

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
going to be painted yes I'm going to try

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.030 
going to be painted yes I'm going to try
and<00:06:26.210> replicate<00:06:26.389> the<00:06:26.750> quantum<00:06:27.169> burst<00:06:27.440> colors

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
and replicate the quantum burst colors

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.219 
and replicate the quantum burst colors
instead<00:06:28.790> of<00:06:28.910> the<00:06:29.000> quantum<00:06:29.389> first<00:06:29.600> mode<00:06:29.990> which

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
instead of the quantum first mode which

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.950 
instead of the quantum first mode which
he's<00:06:30.380> already<00:06:30.620> in<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.520> be<00:06:31.940> looking<00:06:32.090> for<00:06:32.330> that

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
he's already in so be looking for that

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.219 
he's already in so be looking for that
