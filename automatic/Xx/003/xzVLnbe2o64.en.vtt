major

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.280 

now<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:18.430> idea<00:01:18.790> behind<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.300> scale<00:01:19.690> fingering

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
now the idea behind that scale fingering

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.130 
now the idea behind that scale fingering
is<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:21.310> improve<00:01:21.910> your<00:01:22.060> shifting<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:23.020> your

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
is to improve your shifting and your

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.770 
is to improve your shifting and your
facility<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.090> teach<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.420> different

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
facility and teach you the different

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.390 
facility and teach you the different
positions<00:01:26.230> on<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.470> instrument<00:01:27.040> which<00:01:27.220> are

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
positions on the instrument which are

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.740 
positions on the instrument which are
all<00:01:27.610> very<00:01:27.970> valuable<00:01:28.350> however<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.750> fingering

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
all very valuable however that fingering

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.350 
all very valuable however that fingering
is<00:01:32.160> extremely<00:01:33.160> ineffective<00:01:33.820> when<00:01:34.210> we're

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
is extremely ineffective when we're

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.560 
is extremely ineffective when we're
working<00:01:34.750> on<00:01:34.960> improvisation<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.970> makes<00:01:37.270> my

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
working on improvisation what makes my

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.530 
working on improvisation what makes my
book<00:01:38.430> fundamentally<00:01:39.430> different<00:01:39.850> is<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.180> we

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
book fundamentally different is that we

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.530 
book fundamentally different is that we
focus<00:01:40.750> on<00:01:41.070> formula<00:01:42.070> based<00:01:42.280> planning<00:01:42.670> which

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
focus on formula based planning which

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.410 
focus on formula based planning which
will<00:01:43.720> allow<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.260> use<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.880> or<00:01:46.240> two

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
will allow you to use one or two

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.700 
will allow you to use one or two
fingerings<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.500> play<00:01:47.740> every<00:01:48.369> key<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.500> let's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
fingerings to play every key so let's

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.219 
fingerings to play every key so let's
talk<00:01:53.920> about<00:01:53.979> pentatonic<00:01:54.940> scales<00:01:55.210> today<00:01:55.630> the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
systems for pentatonic scales to help

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.910 
systems for pentatonic scales to help
you<00:02:00.729> move<00:02:01.540> even<00:02:01.899> less<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.440> be<00:02:02.560> more<00:02:02.740> flexible

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
you move even less and be more flexible

talk about the movable pentatonic scale

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.600 
talk about the movable pentatonic scale
let's<00:02:07.420> give<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.690> try
