00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
to get started by adding some hot water

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.070 
to get started by adding some hot water
to<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> heat<00:00:29.220> proof<00:00:29.519> glass<00:00:29.880> container<00:00:30.480> it's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to a heat proof glass container it's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.630 
to a heat proof glass container it's
really<00:00:31.380> important<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> use<00:00:31.980> heat<00:00:32.250> proof<00:00:32.460> glass

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
really important to use heat proof glass

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.250 
really important to use heat proof glass
for<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.059> because<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.480> don't<00:00:33.750> want<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.110> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
for this because you don't want it to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260 
for this because you don't want it to
shatter<00:00:34.500> when<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.860> add<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.250> hot<00:00:35.399> water<00:00:35.430> you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
shatter when you add the hot water you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090 
shatter when you add the hot water you
could<00:00:36.420> also<00:00:36.600> use<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> teapot<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.829> if

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
could also use a teapot for this if

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.010 
could also use a teapot for this if
that's<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:38.910> hand<00:00:38.940> no<00:00:39.600> problem

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
