00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.470
 ah 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.680
 what it means for you to have reached the 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.680
 200 chapters in aída 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:20.120
 it's a whole life supposed to have been 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 nine years of great experience to all 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.860
 levels no longer just because it 's a comedy 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.140
 that has lasted 200 chapters that now 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.350
 that has lasted not that it is lasting and we 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.850
 we have until 219 but it has long 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.220
 life because he was in the best moment 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.430
 now or at least to me is what I 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.780
 I think good looks and all 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.420
 we have all grown up the screenwriters 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.129
 and us and regarding the personal 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.010
 imagine you have had everything we have had 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.290
 children we have married we have 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.320
 separately we see each other and that has been there 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.769
 with which is for me is a is a point 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.850
 of reference and a pillar where where 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:01.219
 sustain me too we are not family anymore 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.530
 the scriptwriters of aida always we 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.119
 they surprise with surrealistic plots that 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.570
 will happen to your character in this 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.570
 new season 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.140
 My character I think is one of the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.190
 that have the horizontal plots 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.030
 throughout the series 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.040
 the relationship with Luis and he will have 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.810
 a lot of surprise because to start 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.590
 remove the mask and prude is no longer going to 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.220
 continue to be so you will have to leave 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.220
 preparing 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.630
 We will also see your character by 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.470
 Africa tell us how it was filming 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.470
 of that plot 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.420
 If we do not go to Africa 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.580
 well, we're going with raquel sanchez 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.740
 silva to how would be lost in the tribe 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.890
 We're leaving mom Mosa Marisol Ayuso 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.159
 eugenia maría de mauricio he jonathan and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.830
 I pretend to be family and we 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.750
 we go there and it's a plot 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.820
 Hilarious is very good and I see 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.759
 some or some of the lost in the tribe 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.000
 suddenly not or you want to marry me 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.459
 son or something of these and overcome 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.819
 but clearly fiction is with 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.030
 you 're not happening to us 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.950
 we are basing look at that they are not very 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.500
 funny are very comedy st 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.330
 if you look at those realities 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.230
 they look for you this type of turns so 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.230
 convoluted 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.700
 It seems great to me, it seems very good 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.799
 it seems to me that comedy has to be taken out 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.019
 from wherever life has to be 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.700
 comedy because if we do not shoot ourselves 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.900
 and especially from the moment in which 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.360
 we're 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.689
 as you remember the first chapter of 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.689
 aida 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.209
 perfectly I had a terrible time very badly 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.830
 I was three weeks with very bad 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.080
 great because I was so nervous that 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.670
 I squeezed to work if we pass it 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.819
 and marion had never done comedy or not 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.540
 sitcom of course the 5 - that is not 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.690
 study in a school that you learn 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.060
 why are you working 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.460
 or because you have a natural talent and I 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.390
 I had not learned it easy to do 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.620
 comedy do you know then good good cost 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.110
 at the beginning a lot 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.760
 it costs you to put on paper later 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.760
 totally dramatic 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.830
 for nothing that goes on all these 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.440
 nine years I was doing interpreting 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.580
 very different characters and drama the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.960
 mostly because they are the ones that 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.120
 I want to do after all year 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.920
 doing comedy and I do not feel 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.320
 strange for nothing I feel is not that 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.820
 what makes the difference is more the things you are 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.170
 you us the actors what 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.150
 we want is to work and between our 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.320
 There are several work there are several branches 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.320
 you know then after 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.740
 I like drama a lot too 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.220
 what would you say to the faithful followers 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.220
 of the series 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.610
 Well, you have to see there from the chapter 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.650
 200 albán sing 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.650
