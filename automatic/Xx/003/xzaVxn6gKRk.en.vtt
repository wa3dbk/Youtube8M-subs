homework

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.100 
homework
there<00:01:13.770> could<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:13.979> either<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.640> cyber<00:01:15.479> component

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
there could be either a cyber component

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.070 
there could be either a cyber component
or<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:17.460> could<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.640> SBA<00:01:18.090> standard<00:01:18.840> more

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
or they could be SBA standard more

traditional<00:01:19.909> reports<00:01:20.909> type<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.299> homework<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
traditional reports type of homework and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.590 
traditional reports type of homework and
I<00:01:22.530> find<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:24.090> homeworks

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
I find that the homeworks

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780 
I find that the homeworks
that<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.409> signed<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that are signed because they have that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.780 
that are signed because they have that
extra<00:01:27.240> day<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.600> between<00:01:27.900> classes<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:29.549> gives

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
extra day in between classes that gives

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.149 
extra day in between classes that gives
the<00:01:29.970> teachers<00:01:30.329> flexibility<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> assign<00:01:31.860> them

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the teachers flexibility to assign them

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.249 
the teachers flexibility to assign them
I<00:01:32.430> would<00:01:32.850> call<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> sort<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> higher<00:01:33.869> level

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I would call it a sort of higher level

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.319 
I would call it a sort of higher level
thinking<00:01:34.530> homework<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.759> other<00:01:35.939> words<00:01:36.119> they

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
half and it didn't really work for them

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.100 
half and it didn't really work for them
they<00:02:12.780> were<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.800> bored<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.420> distracted

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
they were so bored and so distracted

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.170 
they were so bored and so distracted
that<00:02:16.380> they<00:02:17.220> were<00:02:17.340> beginning<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.790> show<00:02:17.970> other

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
behavioral problems and at that time

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.690

they<00:02:22.230> were<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.560> second<00:02:22.920> grade<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.340> program

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
they were in second grade the program

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.720 
they were in second grade the program

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
was not available so he took them and

are the right level of material for
example<00:02:58.280> with<00:02:59.280> my<00:02:59.489> kids<00:02:59.760> there<00:03:00.090> they're<00:03:00.390> doing

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
example with my kids there they're doing

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.170 
example with my kids there they're doing
a<00:03:00.780> traditional<00:03:00.989> fifth<00:03:01.620> grade<00:03:01.860> math<00:03:02.070> but<00:03:03.060> they

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
a traditional fifth grade math but they

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.570 
a traditional fifth grade math but they
know<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.810> humanities<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.580> language

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.120 
arts
they<00:03:06.660> are<00:03:06.720> far<00:03:07.020> ahead<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.320> their<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.950> their

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
they are far ahead of their of their

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.160 
they are far ahead of their of their
grade<00:03:08.340> level<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.760> reading<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.510> writing

grade level in reading and writing

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.740 
grade level in reading and writing
ability<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.640> program<00:03:11.970> can<00:03:12.000> accommodate

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
ability so the program can accommodate

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.280 
ability so the program can accommodate
that<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:14.040> type<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.459> difference<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.870> it's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
that that type of difference so it's

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.840 
that that type of difference so it's
great<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.980> sense<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.670> don't

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
great in a sense that you don't

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.300 
great in a sense that you don't
necessarily<00:03:17.970> ask<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.750> child<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.590> slow<00:03:20.070> down

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
necessarily ask the child to slow down

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.410 
necessarily ask the child to slow down
or<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:21.690> run<00:03:22.049> ahead<00:03:22.310> it's<00:03:23.310> really<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.970> program

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
or to run ahead it's really a program

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.990 
or to run ahead it's really a program
that<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.870> tailored<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.549> children

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that is tailored to to the children

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.539 
that is tailored to to the children
themselves<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.980> there's<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.220> lot<00:03:29.430> of

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
themselves so there's a lot of

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.770 
themselves so there's a lot of
flexibility<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.390> terms<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.610> teachers

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
flexibility in terms of the teachers

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.590 
flexibility in terms of the teachers
understanding<00:03:33.780> where<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.470> kids<00:03:35.220> are<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.760> a

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
understanding where the kids are and a

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600 
understanding where the kids are and a
level<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.049> will<00:03:37.230> will<00:03:37.739> challenge<00:03:38.220> them<00:03:38.400> but

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
level that will will challenge them but

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.940 
level that will will challenge them but
will<00:03:38.850> not<00:03:39.030> overwhelm<00:03:39.390> them<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.049> at<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.860> same

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
will not overwhelm them and at the same

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.670 
will not overwhelm them and at the same
time<00:03:41.280> won't<00:03:41.549> bore<00:03:41.790> them<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.480> my<00:03:43.200> kids<00:03:43.440> love<00:03:43.650> it

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680
