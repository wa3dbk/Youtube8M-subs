whole blade and the leading edge right
there<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:19.850> missing<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.580> that's<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.880> worst

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

damage<00:01:26.509> yeah<00:01:29.240> view<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> trike<00:01:30.720> here

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.480 

so<00:01:36.870> and<00:01:37.870> also<00:01:38.080> for<00:01:38.680> those<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.280> have<00:01:39.400> been

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
so and also for those of you have been

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.270 
so and also for those of you have been
talking<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.800> see<00:01:43.650> thrust<00:01:44.650> thrust

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
talking to you can see thrust thrust

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.430 
talking to you can see thrust thrust
point<00:01:46.980> Hank<00:01:47.980> points<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:48.850> these<00:01:49.810> need<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.290> be

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
point Hank points so these need to be

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.290 
point Hank points so these need to be
raised<00:01:50.740> up<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.280> about<00:01:51.550> here<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:53.590> little<00:01:53.890> higher

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
raised up to about here or little higher

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.960 
raised up to about here or little higher
so<00:01:55.300> I've<00:01:56.020> got<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.710> do<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:59.310> this<00:02:00.310> repair

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
so I've got that to do and this repair

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.140 
so I've got that to do and this repair
on<00:02:01.270> my<00:02:02.430> prop<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.720> other<00:02:04.870> small<00:02:05.320> ones<00:02:05.560> if<00:02:05.800> I

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
on my prop and the other small ones if I

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.280 
on my prop and the other small ones if I
showed<00:02:08.610> I've<00:02:09.610> also<00:02:09.820> got<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:12.750> redesign<00:02:13.750> my<00:02:13.959> cage

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
showed I've also got to redesign my cage

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.520 
showed I've also got to redesign my cage
so<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.340> add<00:02:15.550> extra<00:02:15.910> protection<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:17.140> guess

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
so just add extra protection so I guess

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.920 
so just add extra protection so I guess
that's<00:02:17.770> it
