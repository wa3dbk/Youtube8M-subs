00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
here is connected by a HDMI port I'm

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.429 
here is connected by a HDMI port I'm
using<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.159> display<00:02:45.489> for<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.760> HDMI<00:02:46.269> adapter<00:02:46.810> and

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
using a display for the HDMI adapter and

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.580 
using a display for the HDMI adapter and
it<00:02:47.560> also<00:02:47.799> has<00:02:48.189> a<00:02:48.220> USB<00:02:48.519> upstream<00:02:49.299> cable<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
it also has a USB upstream cable the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.809 
it also has a USB upstream cable the

classes through the USB input and the
touch<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.329> that<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.799> essentially<00:02:57.370> you're

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
touch is that so essentially you're

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.100 
touch is that so essentially you're
using<00:02:58.030> place<00:02:58.480> when<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.870> is

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.800 

do<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:06.980> one<00:03:07.069> more<00:03:07.219> time<00:03:07.879> suck<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:08.569> play

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
do that one more time suck this play

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.850 
do that one more time suck this play
they<00:03:09.620> get<00:03:09.769> in<00:03:09.860> both<00:03:10.010> all<00:03:10.280> right

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.370 

so<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:14.550> test<00:03:14.790> click<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.570> button<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:16.110> can

so we test click of a button you can

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:28.270 
so we test click of a button you can
switch<00:03:16.890> between
