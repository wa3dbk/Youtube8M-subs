brake<00:03:14.200> switch<00:03:14.680> itself<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.519> does<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:15.970> red

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
brake switch itself it does have a red

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.340 
brake switch itself it does have a red
collar<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.900> want<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.110> slide<00:03:17.319> that

collar on it so you want to slide that
forward<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.519> then<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:19.330> brake<00:03:19.630> switch<00:03:19.750> pulls

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
forward and then this brake switch pulls

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
all the way back now in order to remove

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.580 
all the way back now in order to remove
the<00:03:22.090> switch<00:03:22.329> alright<00:03:23.079> first<00:03:23.290> what<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.470> have

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
the switch alright first what you have

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.470 
the switch alright first what you have
to<00:03:23.709> do<00:03:23.799> here<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.220> basically<00:03:24.400> how<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.209> works

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
to do here is basically how this works

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.630 
to do here is basically how this works
is<00:03:25.660> this<00:03:26.560> little<00:03:26.890> red<00:03:27.040> skirt<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.519> goes

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
is this little red skirt that goes

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.780 
is this little red skirt that goes
around<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.000> outside<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.630> can<00:03:28.750> see<00:03:28.780> here<00:03:29.790> it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
around the outside you can see here it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.370 
around the outside you can see here it
does<00:03:30.850> move<00:03:31.209> in<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.630> out<00:03:31.720> what<00:03:32.019> happens<00:03:32.290> when

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
does move in and out what happens when

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.280 
does move in and out what happens when
it<00:03:32.470> does<00:03:32.620> move<00:03:32.860> in<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.670> expands<00:03:34.390> these<00:03:34.630> tabs<00:03:34.930> on

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
it does move in it expands these tabs on

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.410 
it does move in it expands these tabs on
each<00:03:35.890> side<00:03:36.160> here<00:03:36.370> now<00:03:36.519> there's<00:03:36.820> only<00:03:36.910> two<00:03:37.180> tabs

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
each side here now there's only two tabs

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.069 
each side here now there's only two tabs
and<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.739> only<00:03:38.860> extends<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.549> far<00:03:39.610> as<00:03:40.480> toward<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
and it only extends so far as toward the

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.650 
and it only extends so far as toward the
the<00:03:41.620> plungers<00:03:42.010> at<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.280> end<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.660> switch

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
the plungers at the end of the switch

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.960 
the plungers at the end of the switch
which<00:03:43.840> touches<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.530> little<00:03:45.489> tab<00:03:45.670> on<00:03:45.880> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
which touches the little tab on the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.310 
which touches the little tab on the
brake<00:03:46.410> brake<00:03:47.410> pedal<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:49.750> unfortunately<00:03:50.019> this

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
brake brake pedal now unfortunately this

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.190 
brake brake pedal now unfortunately this
is<00:03:50.470> fairly<00:03:51.280> hard<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.820> do<00:03:51.970> because<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.900> was

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
is fairly hard to do because I was

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.479 
is fairly hard to do because I was
trying<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.470> fill<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.680> with<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.920> myself<00:03:54.040> here

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
trying to fill it with it myself here

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.890 
trying to fill it with it myself here
and<00:03:54.579> putting<00:03:54.850> one<00:03:55.000> foot<00:03:55.239> on<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.420> brake<00:03:55.720> pedal

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
and putting one foot on the brake pedal

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.300 
and putting one foot on the brake pedal
then<00:03:56.140> reaching<00:03:56.410> under<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.680> dash<00:03:56.859> and<00:03:57.100> I<00:03:57.190> had<00:03:57.280> a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
then reaching under the dash and I had a

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.380 
then reaching under the dash and I had a
mirror<00:03:57.670> here<00:03:57.820> just<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.060> look<00:03:58.180> around

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
mirror here just to look around

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.170 
mirror here just to look around
underneath<00:03:59.190> just<00:04:00.190> trying<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:00.970> slide<00:04:01.120> this

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
underneath just trying to slide this

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.150 
underneath just trying to slide this
forward<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.570> pull<00:04:01.750> back<00:04:01.959> isn't<00:04:02.200> enough<00:04:02.560> so

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
forward and pull back isn't enough so

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.099 
forward and pull back isn't enough so
basically<00:04:03.489> instead<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.880> doing<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.540> wasn't

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
basically instead of doing this I wasn't

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.199 
basically instead of doing this I wasn't
able<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.920> show<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.250> on<00:04:06.340> camera<00:04:06.609> unfortunately

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
able to show it on camera unfortunately

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.030 
able to show it on camera unfortunately
but<00:04:07.359> I'll<00:04:07.480> just<00:04:07.510> just<00:04:08.170> explain<00:04:08.560> how<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.709> did<00:04:08.950> it

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
but I'll just just explain how I did it

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.240 
but I'll just just explain how I did it
here<00:04:11.100> series<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.190> one<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.400> actually<00:04:12.579> broke<00:04:12.910> out

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
here series the one I actually broke out

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.620 
here series the one I actually broke out
basically<00:04:15.250> what<00:04:15.459> I've<00:04:15.549> done<00:04:15.730> here<00:04:15.970> is<00:04:16.090> using<00:04:16.419> a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
basically what I've done here is using a

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.469 
basically what I've done here is using a
pair<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.019> locking<00:04:17.709> needlenose<00:04:18.700> pliers<00:04:19.180> here

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
pair of locking needlenose pliers here

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.529 
pair of locking needlenose pliers here
just<00:04:20.220> was<00:04:21.220> just<00:04:21.250> enough<00:04:21.850> room<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.120> fit<00:04:22.270> in

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
just was just enough room to fit in

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.380 
just was just enough room to fit in
there<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:23.260> get<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:23.470> on<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.650> tip<00:04:23.800> here<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:25.330> I

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
there to get it on the tip here and I

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.390 
there to get it on the tip here and I
broke<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.659> tip<00:04:25.780> off<00:04:26.169> then<00:04:26.919> I<00:04:27.010> was<00:04:27.130> able<00:04:27.250> to

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
broke the tip off then I was able to

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.010 
broke the tip off then I was able to
slide<00:04:27.640> this<00:04:27.760> all<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.120> way<00:04:28.240> for<00:04:28.570> when<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:28.810> had

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
slide this all the way for when I had

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.669 
slide this all the way for when I had
the

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:29.679 
the

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:31.469 
the
a<00:04:29.709> brake<00:04:30.189> pedal<00:04:30.369> depress<00:04:30.819> by<00:04:30.999> my<00:04:31.179> foot<00:04:31.449> just

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
a brake pedal depress by my foot just

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.119 
a brake pedal depress by my foot just
reaching<00:04:31.959> to<00:04:32.019> the<00:04:32.139> dash<00:04:32.319> using<00:04:32.769> the<00:04:32.859> mirror<00:04:33.069> to

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
reaching to the dash using the mirror to

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.159 
reaching to the dash using the mirror to
find<00:04:33.339> my<00:04:33.459> way<00:04:33.609> around<00:04:33.639> is<00:04:34.479> able<00:04:34.779> to<00:04:34.869> move<00:04:35.019> it

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
find my way around is able to move it

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.319 
find my way around is able to move it
almost<00:04:35.649> all<00:04:35.859> the<00:04:36.159> way<00:04:36.279> out<00:04:36.459> and<00:04:36.699> then

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:37.329 
almost all the way out and then

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:39.809 
almost all the way out and then
basically<00:04:37.719> pop<00:04:38.019> a<00:04:38.049> switch<00:04:38.609> just<00:04:39.609> from<00:04:39.729> the

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
basically pop a switch just from the

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.209 
basically pop a switch just from the
back<00:04:39.969> of<00:04:40.239> the<00:04:40.679> bracket<00:04:41.679> which<00:04:41.769> holds<00:04:42.039> it<00:04:42.129> in

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
back of the bracket which holds it in

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.299 
back of the bracket which holds it in
place<00:04:42.339> now<00:04:43.059> when<00:04:43.239> reinstalling<00:04:43.269> a<00:04:43.749> new<00:04:43.869> switch

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:44.309 
place now when reinstalling a new switch

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:46.619 
place now when reinstalling a new switch
basically<00:04:45.309> when<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.669> bought<00:04:45.909> this<00:04:46.089> switch<00:04:46.359> here

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
basically when I bought this switch here

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.689 
basically when I bought this switch here
it<00:04:46.899> does<00:04:47.139> only<00:04:47.289> come<00:04:47.529> out<00:04:47.559> so<00:04:47.889> far<00:04:48.159> the<00:04:48.309> plunger

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
it does only come out so far the plunger

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.149 
it does only come out so far the plunger
here<00:04:48.879> along<00:04:49.779> with<00:04:49.809> the<00:04:50.049> red<00:04:50.289> sleeve<00:04:50.589> now<00:04:51.099> you

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
here along with the red sleeve now you

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.339 
here along with the red sleeve now you
do<00:04:51.819> have<00:04:51.849> to<00:04:52.059> pull<00:04:52.329> it<00:04:52.419> out<00:04:52.509> even<00:04:52.899> further<00:04:53.079> and

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
do have to pull it out even further and

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.749 
do have to pull it out even further and
does<00:04:53.499> I<00:04:53.709> take<00:04:53.889> a<00:04:53.919> fair<00:04:54.159> amount<00:04:54.189> of<00:04:54.399> pressure<00:04:54.549> to

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
does I take a fair amount of pressure to

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.819 
does I take a fair amount of pressure to
do<00:04:54.999> so<00:04:55.239> so<00:04:55.929> once<00:04:56.079> you<00:04:56.139> start<00:04:56.319> pulling<00:04:56.529> this<00:04:56.649> all

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:56.829 
do so so once you start pulling this all

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.649 
do so so once you start pulling this all
the<00:04:56.919> way<00:04:57.039> out<00:04:57.069> I<00:04:57.489> basically<00:04:58.059> want<00:04:58.299> to<00:04:58.389> pull<00:04:58.539> to

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
the way out I basically want to pull to

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.989 
the way out I basically want to pull to
the<00:04:58.749> point<00:04:59.019> where<00:04:59.229> these<00:04:59.459> tabs<00:05:00.459> on<00:05:00.669> each<00:05:00.789> side

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:00.999 
the point where these tabs on each side
