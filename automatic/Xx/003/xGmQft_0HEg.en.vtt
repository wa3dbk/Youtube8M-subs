 little afternoon opening dedicated to 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.960
 summary of yesterday's evening of 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.000
 champions league 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.890
 important debut of juventus who 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.660
 captures a precious London draw 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.700
 against the chelsea and ends at 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.800
 stanford bridge for 2 to 2 see then 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.660
 all the results then we will go with i 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.240
 our commentators to comment 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.340
 the excellent performance of the juve who has 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.080
 equalized in comeback shakhtar donetsk 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.690
 don not ceylan 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.300
 in the group f 2 0 for the team of a 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.610
 cesco the juventus equalized the bill later 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.089
 the double advantage of chelsea by work 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.220
 of oscar vidal and quagliarella give 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.370
 the draw for the bianconeri 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.620
 group f the bat and bari suffers the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.809
 victory of the Belarusian training in 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.320
 transfer is perhaps one of the results more 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.600
 surprising of this second group of 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.489
 matches of the first day of 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.199
 champions league 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.180
 always in the group f the bayern monaco 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.080
 liquid and valencia with the score of 2 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.299
 1 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.670
 in group g instead the is exalted 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.430
 barcelona in comeback just like the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.550
 real madrid who had won against the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.740
 city ​​here barcelona suffers on 1 to 2 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.510
 manages to place two goals 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.050
 very important in the last quarter of an hour 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.690
 with leo messi leo messi inspired 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.930
 especially from the very young you me 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.230
 author of the first goal of barcelona 3 a 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.310
 2 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.710
 ends at the camp nou celtic benfica 0 to 0 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.010
 therefore the challenge between the Scots without nets 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.650
 and Portuguese to get to the last 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.540
 neither day nor yesterday manchester united e 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.910
 karatas to rai one to zero and march will be 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.700
 however suffered excellent performance of the 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.350
 Turkish terim team with felipe melo 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.590
 three best in the field 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.560
 braga crusi 02 other result a 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.500
 surprise with the champions of romania who 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.830
 win in portugal just with the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.170
 team that had eliminated the Udinese 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.170
 in the preliminary of the champions league e 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.150
 now we will see the picture of the matches 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.220
 so many of the europa league that there 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.720
 wait for this evening we go to 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.810
 arona that strength of the new 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.730
 chelsea of 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.860
 of matteo a team that has been renewed 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.720
 and is perhaps even stronger than the year 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.940
 last we want sa of the same opinion 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.830
 neighbor's Christian connected with us 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.810
 that serve as cosimo of rds ci 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.430
 we welcome hello trio bobo 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.310
 merit to all of us found then 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.739
 we first underline the great one 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.480
 Juventus personality is not easy 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.370
 play on a pitch like that of 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.840
 chelsea that is true has been beaten 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.090
 clearly in the last final of 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.769
 however, the European Super Cup is first 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.580
 deservedly right now in 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.400
 premier league 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.660
 they are at the bottom of the European champions and 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.150
 it is reinforced with the arrival of 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.580
 oscar jewel and this hazard that 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.220
 in short, all the throats are really tempting 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.900
 European clubs 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.450
 this is the premise for my question 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.599
 indeed really earned just that 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.940
 it does more than moral at home 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.620
 Juventus 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.450
 I think the point is the least 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.160
 important of this game giulio 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.830
 because this is the game that shows 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.080
 that juventus is a big one again for 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.910
 the character for the buffon personality 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.890
 before the battle he said stay there 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.900
 makes us very proud because 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.340
 evidently also their own that a 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.590
 player like buffon he saw 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.739
 the negative evolution in positive 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.510
 of juventus in the last decade 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.519
 we can say that we see clearly 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.440
 in the players' awareness of 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.450
 what they write in the field that there is a 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.700
 another level of strength ie the thing 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.500
 important in yesterday's game and that 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.750
 under two to zero that way 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.639
 a deadly two in that stadium 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.739
 with the current champions because the 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.810
 chelsea is the team holding the 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.940
 champions league the good is good 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.870
 remember juve did a great one 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.670
 test of character 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.680
 but with great racing great competitive spirit but 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.489
 above all great quality has arrived in 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.530
 leads to scoring two goals and risked 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.269
 to do a legendary business 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.280
 he risked with quagliarella with the 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.930
 quagliarella cross to win 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.769
 blatantly 3 to 2 and then the side 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.289
 Most important of this game is that 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.479
 juventus has proven to be one 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.109
 great level has returned a great one 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:25.080
 buffon said we come right after 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.940
 three four teams in europe is 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.510
 surely he is right that is surely 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.160
 this 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.530
 level of juve maybe to get to 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.030
 that level is missing a big bomber 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.970
 because this is what we have seen is 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.700
 an attack not always incisive not 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.380
 always the doors, this is the term 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.320
 suitable however from the point of view of the 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.240
 mindfulness awareness la 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.280
 juventus let me say that he did 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.920
 a great leap in quality you feel 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.240
 who are the English accuse the 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.640
 juventus and above all the press 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.500
 British from sun to daily mail 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.920
 in short, they are all a bit juventus 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.890
 to have played too hard you are 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.720
 referred to the intervention of 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.280
 bonucci su oscar is that contact 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.960
 asar jokes in the juventus area 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.820
 in the second half the second half 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.370
 when juventus pushed 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.710
 on the accelerator to reassemble the 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.340
 score and what you think 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:23.280
 go by the reason of matteo I respect 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.390
 of what he basically told the TV 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.570
 Italian 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.220
 actually then if a little vented at home 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.870
 her 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.060
 emphasizing that prudence should 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.620
 extract the red for bonucci e 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.960
 grant the penalty kick for 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.670
 the intervention of his will barzagli me 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.380
 personally the intervention of jokes 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.820
 its hazard seemed to me so 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.550
 there was a slightest contact 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.910
 this is true, but will be accentuated 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.340
 falling into the air was very fast 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.520
 the Belgian tip and if even maybe 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.190
 unbalanced I do not think they were there 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.660
 the extremes for the penalty and claimed 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.630
 by the blues technician 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.520
 in short, English complaining of a 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.290
 I play a little too much English of 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.210
 an Italian is one thing 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.550
 singular the two interventions that you have 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.400
 quoted that we can discuss however 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.230
 they do not seem so and so striking 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.590
 that is, you can make mistakes or you can give or not 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.700
 give that rigor so I don't think so 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.680
 are interventions are not situations that 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.690
 on which we can say that the referee has 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.660
 wrong they are in football 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.070
 the other is a little mafia game 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.730
 of Juventus is a very team 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:34.910
 muscle this year with the addition of 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:37.490
 isla and asamoah so it's a team that 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.010
 play that you will find so but there are not 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.260
 according to me the i have not been exceeded 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.540
 limits of correctness and criticism 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.520
 come from the English press all along 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.870
 we know the english game or a game 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.210
 in which the referee leaves a lot to run 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.790
 these contacts are on the order of 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.410
 day this makes me think that a little 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.320
 later Europeans have a little 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:00.050
 put in the crosshairs regarding 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.410
 instead the European panorama of this one 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.410
 evening
