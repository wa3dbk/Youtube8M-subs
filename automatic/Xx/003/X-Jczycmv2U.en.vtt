are the faring now the CBR 600 is the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.220 
are the faring now the CBR 600 is the
buttons<00:00:19.830> been<00:00:19.980> made<00:00:20.220> four<00:00:21.050> years

buttons been made four years
I<00:00:22.410> think<00:00:23.869> 1986<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:25.080> surfing<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:25.800> ones

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
I think 1986 or surfing the first ones

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.220 
I think 1986 or surfing the first ones
came<00:00:26.189> out<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.330> you've<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> very<00:00:27.689> well

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
came out so you've got a very well

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.120 
came out so you've got a very well
proven<00:00:28.710> bike<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:30.140> what<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.289> will<00:00:31.410> find<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
proven bike and what you will find is it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
proven bike and what you will find is it
these<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:32.460> similar<00:00:32.850> sort<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.149> thing<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> uzuki

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
these are similar sort of thing to uzuki

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.350 
these are similar sort of thing to uzuki
bandit<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:35.489> one<00:00:35.700> or<00:00:35.790> two<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> others<00:00:36.210> but

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
bandit now one or two the others but

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.060 
bandit now one or two the others but
this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> liquid<00:00:37.140> cooled<00:00:37.440> engine<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
this is a liquid cooled engine it's a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.310 
this is a liquid cooled engine it's a
more<00:00:38.250> sophisticated<00:00:38.579> engine<00:00:39.210> than<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
more sophisticated engine than the the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
more sophisticated engine than the the
band<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> band<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> only<00:00:41.430> they<00:00:42.300> called

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
band that the band is only they called

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.299 
band that the band is only they called
oil<00:00:42.719> Corbett<00:00:43.200> release<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.800> an<00:00:43.980> air-cooled

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
oil Corbett release it's an air-cooled

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.240 
oil Corbett release it's an air-cooled
engine<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> larger<00:00:45.210> oil<00:00:45.390> cooler<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.250> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
engine with a larger oil cooler so the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
engine with a larger oil cooler so the
band<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.760> more<00:00:47.879> basic<00:00:48.120> bike<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:51.890> honda<00:00:52.890> of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
band is a more basic bike and honda of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.619 
band is a more basic bike and honda of
sold<00:00:53.219> thousands<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> these<00:00:53.940> things<00:00:54.180> over<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
sold thousands of these things over the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.900 
sold thousands of these things over the
years<00:00:56.899> well<00:00:57.899> there's<00:00:58.050> no<00:00:58.260> trouble<00:00:58.620> buying

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910

riding position there's nothing
difficult<00:01:22.399> about<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:23.229> but<00:01:24.229> handlebars<00:01:24.770> are

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
difficult about it but handlebars are

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.319 
difficult about it but handlebars are
sort<00:01:25.219> of<00:01:26.049> up<00:01:27.049> a<00:01:27.259> little<00:01:27.469> bit<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.579> your<00:01:29.179> foot

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
sort of up a little bit and your foot

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.949 
sort of up a little bit and your foot
pegs<00:01:29.659> are<00:01:29.869> on<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.049> nice<00:01:30.200> position<00:01:30.439> whereby<00:01:31.959> you

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
pegs are on a nice position whereby you

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.179 
pegs are on a nice position whereby you
hit<00:01:33.079> any<00:01:33.229> bumps<00:01:33.439> you<00:01:33.649> can<00:01:33.740> just<00:01:33.890> sort<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:34.039> put<00:01:34.159> a

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
hit any bumps you can just sort of put a

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.679 
hit any bumps you can just sort of put a
bit<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.399> pressure<00:01:34.640> on<00:01:34.880> lift<00:01:35.060> yourself<00:01:35.359> up<00:01:35.479> over

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
bit of pressure on lift yourself up over

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.339 
bit of pressure on lift yourself up over
the<00:01:36.130> bombs<00:01:37.130> there<00:01:37.899> generally<00:01:38.899> speaking<00:01:39.170> I

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:39.349 
the bombs there generally speaking I

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.589 
the bombs there generally speaking I
like<00:01:39.590> these<00:01:39.799> they're<00:01:40.099> a<00:01:40.130> good<00:01:40.310> bike<00:01:40.579> I<00:01:40.880> knew

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
like these they're a good bike I knew

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.630 
like these they're a good bike I knew
something<00:01:41.810> used<00:01:41.989> to<00:01:42.079> race<00:01:42.289> run<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.369> do<00:01:43.459> quite

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
something used to race run and do quite

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.779 
something used to race run and do quite
well<00:01:43.700> with<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.209> so<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:44.420> know<00:01:44.569> those<00:01:44.719> engines<00:01:45.110> are

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
well with it so I know those engines are

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.740 
well with it so I know those engines are
quite<00:01:46.789> powerful<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.950> think<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.599> tuning<00:01:50.599> on

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
quite powerful I think the tuning on

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.529 
quite powerful I think the tuning on
these<00:01:50.989> is<00:01:51.409> slightly<00:01:52.069> different<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.549> CBR<00:01:52.879> 600

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
these is slightly different the CBR 600

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:54.940 
these is slightly different the CBR 600
I<00:01:53.599> think<00:01:53.899> you've<00:01:54.049> probably<00:01:54.259> find<00:01:54.679> out<00:01:54.799> the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
I think you've probably find out the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.440 
I think you've probably find out the
cams<00:01:55.250> have<00:01:55.459> been<00:01:55.640> changed<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.149> little<00:01:56.239> bit

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
cams have been changed a little bit

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.770 
cams have been changed a little bit
think<00:01:57.349> of<00:01:57.439> it<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> little<00:01:57.770> bit<00:01:57.950> more<00:01:58.129> bottom<00:01:58.610> in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
think of it a little bit more bottom in

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.999 
think of it a little bit more bottom in
let<00:01:59.780> stopping<00:02:00.229> just<00:02:00.439> make<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.709> a<00:02:00.770> bit<00:02:00.890> more

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
let stopping just make it a bit more

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.959 
let stopping just make it a bit more
usable<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:03.890> know<00:02:04.009> if<00:02:04.129> you've<00:02:04.250> not<00:02:04.340> been<00:02:04.610> on

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
usable you know if you've not been on

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.100 
usable you know if you've not been on
the<00:02:05.000> horn<00:02:05.179> before<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.599> hope<00:02:05.689> this<00:02:05.840> sort<00:02:06.049> of

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the horn before I hope this sort of

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.149 
the horn before I hope this sort of
shows<00:02:06.289> you<00:02:06.349> a<00:02:06.439> little<00:02:06.590> bit<00:02:06.679> what<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.920> might<00:02:07.039> be

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
shows you a little bit what it might be

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.709 
shows you a little bit what it might be
like<00:02:08.049> that's<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.200> review<00:02:09.380> done
