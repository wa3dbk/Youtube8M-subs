00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.800
 Is that of Lou smap the shaver 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.840
 a 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.220
 Bought unusual 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.380
 Today is vertical a 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.830
 We would like to announce 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.060
 The director 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.560
 Why 152cm 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.560
 Though it is small 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.420
 I think that I want to take out employment from inside 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.930
 Hakodate 2 years old stakes forecast 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.570
 I hope to do it 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:51.160
 First we will announce my video 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.160
 Yes i feel like that 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.450
 Burren is a box 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.339
 8 choices were 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.030
 It is Mishima +1 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.450
 First of all, how to cool firefly fire 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.020
 Calbee 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.070
 Though I do not 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.550
 is not it 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.510
 It is a race where the race mare is very successful 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.510
 In the last 5 years 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.590
 4 and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.590
 God-fearing 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.130
 It would have been noticed outside by mare 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.630
 Ambulical 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.280
 Come 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.430
 Sultana tears 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.670
 Airizu area 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.810
 It is marked 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.420
 I think it is possible to win ahead of the previous run in this 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.730
 Certainly to rice planting angry car 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.650
 I think it is strong from so much 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.370
 This time the horse fleeing the chains 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:04.480
 Because there are too many 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:07.980
 As I thought that there is a high possibility of not being able to carry the race at my own pace 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.980
 I removed it 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.840
 Mineel Espace 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.720
 Woman Torture 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.400
 It feels much better 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.190
 The magazine 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.020
 Echo was written a little 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.750
 Anyway, the time of the low rank new horse game is very excellent 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.710
 was 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.819
 At that time , I ran away to home 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:38.950
 Because there is also a story that does not stick to Hana this time 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:43.080
 A game of running away horses 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.170
 By the way 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.420
 I was I thought the Fu of the other material Kana 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.890
 If the No. 2 popular if less after the hand 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.500
 Win 10 games 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.830
 I think it seems like ant 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.470
 Next is Makoto Dassault 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:08.069
 It was very good to train this horse too 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:15.530
 So I thought I would like to buy it 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.530
 The run was the main horse's battle with the Yasuda Memorial 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.200
 That's only Tough Baba 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.430
 Through the inside 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.000
 Fuchu long straight line 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.150
 Whether it had Nigeki' 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.010
 It was a surprise 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.910
 Its stamina 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.670
 Of fermentation-denominated 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.970
 Yoshiba 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.900
 I thought I would live 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.900
 I chose by 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.640
 later 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:49.400
 Since the point is to Rento I if the race if 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.880
 Active by thread into this box 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.000
 I think I want to add 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.740
 Unexpectedly, we throw this race in a row 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.350
 The solid solidarity 5 that came out in the Uman renminbi 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.590
 It looks very good 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.990
 Popular this time house 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.400
 I want to pay attention 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.439
 So echo 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.439
 Would you like a box ? 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.319
 Three or six ? 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:29.310
 I'm short but I have never felt too low myself 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.020
 Certainly the train is already crowded 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.620
 It is serious to be crushed 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.500
 that's all 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.490
 eat 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.750
 As it has become hotter 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.930
 Let's work hard this week to take water firm 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.930
 Thank you very much 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.930
 Yup
