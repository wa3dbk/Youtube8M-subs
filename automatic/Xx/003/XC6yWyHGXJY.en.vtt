of<00:02:36.450> cleaning<00:02:36.989> up<00:02:37.170> fashion<00:02:38.129> is<00:02:38.519> definitely<00:02:39.060> a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
of cleaning up fashion is definitely a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.059 
of cleaning up fashion is definitely a
place<00:02:39.389> where<00:02:39.659> they<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:39.930> digest<00:02:40.590> concepts

really<00:02:41.370> quickly<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.969> think<00:02:42.659> that's<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
really quickly I think that's the

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.170 
really quickly I think that's the
challenge<00:02:43.439> isn't<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.829> for<00:02:44.129> designers<00:02:44.669> to<00:02:44.700> make

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
challenge isn't it for designers to make

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.750 
challenge isn't it for designers to make
something<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.169> a<00:02:46.560> concept<00:02:47.189> in<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.489> belief

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
something and have a concept in a belief

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.149 
something and have a concept in a belief
and<00:02:48.090> have<00:02:48.329> it<00:02:48.540> driven<00:02:48.989> by<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.530> rather<00:02:49.950> than

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
and have it driven by that rather than

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.399 
and have it driven by that rather than
driven<00:02:50.969> by<00:02:51.120> trying<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.599> cash<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:52.109> really

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
driven by trying to cash in really

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.349 
driven by trying to cash in really
quickly<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.829> get<00:02:53.010> out<00:02:53.189> the<00:02:53.609> bar<00:02:53.819> has<00:02:54.120> somehow

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
quickly and get out the bar has somehow

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.720 
quickly and get out the bar has somehow
been<00:02:54.659> raised<00:02:54.959> here<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.469> Paris<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.609> these
