keep<00:00:20.760> pain<00:00:21.000> points<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:21.869> i<00:00:21.900> call

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
keep pain points and this is what i call

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.820 
keep pain points and this is what i call
simple<00:00:22.529> complexity<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:23.910> came<00:00:24.240> from<00:00:24.830> very

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
simple complexity so we came from very

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.429 
simple complexity so we came from very
simply<00:00:26.220> everything<00:00:26.490> was<00:00:26.820> done<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.090> Excel<00:00:27.439> we

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
simply everything was done in Excel we

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.179 
simply everything was done in Excel we
had<00:00:28.650> historically<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.640> had<00:00:30.050> a<00:00:31.050> legacy<00:00:31.800> system

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
had historically we had a legacy system

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250 
had historically we had a legacy system
and<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:32.489> converted<00:00:32.699> half<00:00:33.180> our<00:00:33.390> entities<00:00:33.750> or<00:00:33.930> us

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and we converted half our entities or us

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.490 
and we converted half our entities or us
entities<00:00:34.559> into<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.070> new<00:00:35.850> ERP<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.200> we're<00:00:37.320> using

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
entities into a new ERP so we're using

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.920 
entities into a new ERP so we're using
legacy<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.160> Canada<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.760> our<00:00:39.120> new<00:00:39.239> ERP<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
legacy in Canada and our new ERP in the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.400 
legacy in Canada and our new ERP in the
US<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.760> we<00:00:41.760> had<00:00:41.880> to<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.180> both<00:00:42.780> data<00:00:43.079> sources

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
US and we had to get both data sources

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.770 
US and we had to get both data sources
into<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.800> central<00:00:44.340> repository<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.510> will<00:00:45.660> so

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
into a central repository if you will so

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.660 
into a central repository if you will so
we<00:00:45.870> could<00:00:45.989> report<00:00:46.380> into<00:00:47.010> budgeting<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.579> so

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
we could report into budgeting and so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.150 
we could report into budgeting and so
forth<00:00:48.320> reports<00:00:49.320> were<00:00:49.440> manually<00:00:49.739> refreshed

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
forth reports were manually refreshed

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.910 
forth reports were manually refreshed
there<00:00:50.910> was<00:00:51.000> always<00:00:51.180> constant<00:00:51.899> cross<00:00:52.590> checks

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
there was always constant cross checks

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.060 
there was always constant cross checks
and<00:00:53.129> checks<00:00:53.539> and<00:00:54.539> new<00:00:54.719> reports<00:00:55.170> were<00:00:55.710> required

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and checks and new reports were required

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.760 
and checks and new reports were required
to<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.280> built<00:00:56.460> every<00:00:56.730> single<00:00:57.620> for<00:00:58.620> every

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to be built every single for every

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.770 
to be built every single for every
single<00:00:58.980> budget<00:00:59.340> cycle<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.180> had<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> separate

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
single budget cycle so we had a separate

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
single budget cycle so we had a separate
we<00:01:01.379> had<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> reporting<00:01:01.980> database<00:01:02.160> which<00:01:02.550> we

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
we had the reporting database which we

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.889 
we had the reporting database which we
would<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:02.910> all<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.329> we'd<00:01:03.449> had<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
would do all that and we'd had this a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.119 
would do all that and we'd had this a
similar<00:01:04.229> database<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:04.949> use<00:01:05.100> for

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
similar database which would use for

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.120 
similar database which would use for
budgeting<00:01:05.700> because<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.810> required<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.920> just

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
budgeting because that required not just

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.879 
budgeting because that required not just
getting<00:01:08.310> data<00:01:08.579> from<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.569> the<00:01:09.929> systems<00:01:10.319> but

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:10.889 
getting data from the the systems but

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:12.830 
getting data from the the systems but
also<00:01:10.950> input<00:01:11.549> data<00:01:11.999> so<00:01:12.420> all<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.630> submissions

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
also input data so all the submissions

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.319 
also input data so all the submissions
from<00:01:13.139> all<00:01:13.289> the<00:01:13.380> people<00:01:13.649> we<00:01:13.829> had<00:01:14.819> multiple

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
from all the people we had multiple

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.179 
from all the people we had multiple
locations<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:16.109> our<00:01:16.170> reporting<00:01:16.740> hierarchies

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
locations for our reporting hierarchies

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.279 
locations for our reporting hierarchies
so<00:01:17.999> in<00:01:18.119> order<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.359> do<00:01:18.569> our<00:01:18.689> reporting<00:01:19.109> we

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
so in order to do our reporting we

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.510 
so in order to do our reporting we
report<00:01:19.649> by<00:01:19.770> country<00:01:20.249> by<00:01:20.909> entity<00:01:21.329> by<00:01:21.569> platform

same-store sales or comparable non
comparable<00:01:29.849> so<00:01:30.299> specifically<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.020> budgeting

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
comparable so specifically on budgeting

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.309 
comparable so specifically on budgeting
we<00:01:32.609> had<00:01:32.759> large<00:01:33.060> spreadsheets<00:01:33.810> which<00:01:33.959> I<00:01:34.079> called

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
we had large spreadsheets which I called

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.349 
we had large spreadsheets which I called
spread<00:01:34.619> warehouses<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.279> spread<00:01:35.490> martes<00:01:35.759> with

spread warehouses or spread martes with

spread warehouses or spread martes with
very<00:01:36.569> slow<00:01:36.840> processing<00:01:37.319> capabilities<00:01:37.919> it<00:01:38.819> was

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:39.029 
very slow processing capabilities it was

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:42.709 
very slow processing capabilities it was
manual<00:01:39.419> calculations<00:01:40.109> and<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.159> even<00:01:41.719> because

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
manual calculations and we even because

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.649 
manual calculations and we even because
of<00:01:42.810> our<00:01:42.899> forecasting<00:01:43.529> we<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.889> do<00:01:44.659> because

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
of our forecasting we have to do because

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.300 
of our forecasting we have to do because
of<00:01:45.840> our<00:01:45.959> ones<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.529> our<00:01:46.590> 80s<00:01:46.889> we<00:01:47.039> have<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.219> do

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
of our ones and our 80s we have to do

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.370 
of our ones and our 80s we have to do
forecasting<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.599> we<00:01:48.749> would<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
forecasting so we would have to do this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.139 
forecasting so we would have to do this
manually<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.099> had<00:01:50.219> some<00:01:50.340> very<00:01:50.909> powerful

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
manually so we had some very powerful

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.179 
manually so we had some very powerful
formulas<00:01:51.959> that<00:01:51.989> were<00:01:52.259> residing<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.859> Excel

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
formulas that were residing in Excel

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.309 
formulas that were residing in Excel
which<00:01:53.849> they<00:01:54.450> would<00:01:54.599> run<00:01:54.779> but<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.079> would<00:01:55.200> run

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
which they would run but they would run

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.830 
which they would run but they would run
very<00:01:55.529> slowly<00:01:55.739> they'd<00:01:56.700> also<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.509> susceptible

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
very slowly they'd also be susceptible

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.510 
very slowly they'd also be susceptible
to<00:01:58.139> error<00:01:58.349> if<00:01:58.559> anybody<00:01:58.919> were<00:01:59.039> override

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to error if anybody were override

errors and so forth and I come in and I

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.979 
errors and so forth and I come in and I
say<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.790> want<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.090> change<00:02:25.270> or<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.510> president

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
and it was very difficult to do so this

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.740 
and it was very difficult to do so this
is<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.519> where<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.819> came<00:02:31.000> from<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.480> these

is this is where we came from and these

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.240 
is this is where we came from and these
were<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.989> reasons<00:02:32.319> why<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:32.620> wanted<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.980> have<00:02:33.220> a

were the reasons why we wanted to have a

this we were able to leverage the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.610 
this we were able to leverage the
monthly<00:04:25.240> reporting<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.440> has

from the rewarding standpoint this was
immediately<00:04:51.370> leveraged<00:04:51.850> so<00:04:52.270> we<00:04:52.389> did<00:04:52.539> our<00:04:52.660> a

the<00:05:00.789> tool<00:05:01.000> can<00:05:01.270> do<00:05:01.449> many<00:05:01.570> things<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:02.260> it's

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
the tool can do many things and it's

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.800 
the tool can do many things and it's
great<00:05:02.889> it's<00:05:03.250> worth<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.520> investment<00:05:03.760> but<00:05:04.720> you

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
great it's worth the investment but you

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.210 
great it's worth the investment but you
do<00:05:04.930> need<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.169> nurture<00:05:05.350> it<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.800> know<00:05:05.949> come<00:05:06.100> up

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
do need to nurture it you know come up

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.390 
do need to nurture it you know come up
with<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.430> right<00:05:06.550> ideas<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:09.010> know<00:05:09.039> get<00:05:09.250> them

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
with the right ideas you know get them

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.279 
with the right ideas you know get them
documented<00:05:10.000> set<00:05:10.210> them<00:05:10.330> up<00:05:10.449> properly<00:05:10.630> test<00:05:11.110> it

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
documented set them up properly test it

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.570 
documented set them up properly test it
and<00:05:11.440> then<00:05:11.560> start<00:05:11.770> using<00:05:11.949> it<00:05:12.599> so<00:05:13.599> overall<00:05:14.580> we

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
and then start using it so overall we

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.040 
and then start using it so overall we
went<00:05:15.760> from<00:05:15.849> simple<00:05:16.240> complexity<00:05:16.840> which

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
went from simple complexity which

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.870 
went from simple complexity which
required<00:05:17.440> massive<00:05:18.400> spreadsheet<00:05:18.849> that

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
required massive spreadsheet that

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.580 
required massive spreadsheet that
sometimes<00:05:19.449> caused<00:05:19.720> our<00:05:19.900> computers<00:05:20.289> to<00:05:20.410> blow

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
sometimes caused our computers to blow

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.730 
sometimes caused our computers to blow
up<00:05:20.759> to<00:05:21.759> sophisticated<00:05:22.380> simplicity<00:05:23.380> and<00:05:23.590> this

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
up to sophisticated simplicity and this

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.000 
up to sophisticated simplicity and this
happened<00:05:24.070> in<00:05:24.160> less<00:05:24.310> than<00:05:24.460> nine<00:05:24.639> months
