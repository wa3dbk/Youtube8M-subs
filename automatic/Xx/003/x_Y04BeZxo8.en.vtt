firstly<00:00:30.550> with<00:00:30.759> the<00:00:30.849> background<00:00:31.300> fabric<00:00:31.570> you

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
firstly with the background fabric you

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.689 
firstly with the background fabric you
would<00:00:32.200> normally<00:00:32.590> cut<00:00:32.800> out<00:00:32.920> your<00:00:33.220> background

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
would normally cut out your background

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.600 
would normally cut out your background
square<00:00:34.150> if<00:00:34.420> it's<00:00:34.629> a<00:00:34.750> square<00:00:35.050> block<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.590> half<00:00:36.430> an

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
square if it's a square block a half an

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.970 
square if it's a square block a half an
inch<00:00:36.699> larger<00:00:36.970> than<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.420> finished<00:00:37.780> size<00:00:38.110> for

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
inch larger than the finished size for

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.530 
inch larger than the finished size for
example<00:00:39.430> if<00:00:39.580> it's<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.820> five<00:00:40.059> inch<00:00:40.300> finished

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
example if it's a five inch finished

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.270 
example if it's a five inch finished
block<00:00:40.900> you'd<00:00:41.110> normally<00:00:41.470> cut<00:00:41.620> it<00:00:41.739> out<00:00:41.830> five<00:00:42.100> and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
block you'd normally cut it out five and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.729 
block you'd normally cut it out five and
a<00:00:42.309> half<00:00:42.489> inches<00:00:42.879> but<00:00:43.480> with<00:00:43.660> applique<00:00:44.260> it's<00:00:44.589> a

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
a half inches but with applique it's a

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.490 
a half inches but with applique it's a
good<00:00:44.949> idea<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.910> add<00:00:46.059> an<00:00:46.239> extra<00:00:46.690> quarter<00:00:47.350> inch

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
good idea to add an extra quarter inch

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.410 
good idea to add an extra quarter inch
again<00:00:47.830> so<00:00:48.309> if<00:00:48.400> it's<00:00:48.580> a<00:00:48.699> five<00:00:48.970> inch<00:00:49.180> finished

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
again so if it's a five inch finished

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.110 
again so if it's a five inch finished
block<00:00:49.809> it<00:00:50.379> ends<00:00:50.739> up<00:00:50.800> being<00:00:51.039> six<00:00:51.430> inches<00:00:51.820> cut

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
block it ends up being six inches cut

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.900 
block it ends up being six inches cut
because<00:00:52.960> as<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:53.770> applique<00:00:54.340> if<00:00:54.579> there<00:00:54.760> are<00:00:54.850> a

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
because as you applique if there are a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.060 
because as you applique if there are a
lot<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.180> pieces<00:00:55.449> being<00:00:55.870> stitched<00:00:56.260> it<00:00:56.860> will

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
lot of pieces being stitched it will

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.889 
lot of pieces being stitched it will
take<00:00:57.370> up<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.760> background<00:00:58.210> fabric<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:58.809> you

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
take up the background fabric and you

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.720 
take up the background fabric and you
may<00:00:59.110> end<00:00:59.320> up<00:00:59.440> with<00:00:59.949> a<00:01:00.010> block<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.309> little<00:01:00.610> bit

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
may end up with a block a little bit

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.540 
may end up with a block a little bit
smaller<00:01:01.090> than<00:01:01.270> what<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:01.600> actually<00:01:02.079> wanted

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
smaller than what you actually wanted

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.700 
smaller than what you actually wanted
secondly<00:01:03.550> when<00:01:04.300> you<00:01:04.449> trace<00:01:04.750> your<00:01:04.960> design<00:01:05.020> on

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
secondly when you trace your design on

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.630 
secondly when you trace your design on
the<00:01:06.250> background<00:01:06.670> fabric<00:01:07.149> it's<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:08.080> good<00:01:08.259> idea

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the background fabric it's a good idea

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.370 
the background fabric it's a good idea
to<00:01:09.640> not<00:01:09.820> necessarily<00:01:09.970> draw<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.810> entire

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
to not necessarily draw the entire

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.180 
to not necessarily draw the entire
design<00:01:12.100> but<00:01:12.880> simply<00:01:13.360> draw<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.810> little<00:01:14.050> bit<00:01:14.350> such

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
design but simply draw a little bit such

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.169 
design but simply draw a little bit such
as<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.380> outer<00:01:17.590> points<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.970> inner

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
as the the outer points and the inner

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.749 
as the the outer points and the inner
points<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.929> the<00:01:20.770> outer<00:01:20.979> edges<00:01:21.310> of<00:01:21.520> the

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
points and the outer edges of the

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.330 
points and the outer edges of the
application<00:01:22.570> just<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.350> give<00:01:23.500> an<00:01:23.650> idea<00:01:23.770> of

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
application just to give an idea of

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.950 
application just to give an idea of
where<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.700> shape<00:01:24.939> actually<00:01:25.150> sits<00:01:25.659> on<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
where the shape actually sits on the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.399 
where the shape actually sits on the
background<00:01:26.409> fabric<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.909> applique<00:01:28.450> fusible

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
background fabric with applique fusible

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.380 
background fabric with applique fusible
webbing<00:01:29.590> applique<00:01:30.220> is<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.520> really<00:01:30.939> handy<00:01:31.360> way

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
webbing applique is a really handy way

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.950 
webbing applique is a really handy way
to<00:01:32.229> make<00:01:32.409> a<00:01:32.439> block<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:32.979> it's<00:01:33.189> portable<00:01:33.520> too<00:01:33.970> so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
to make a block and it's portable too so

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.800 
to make a block and it's portable too so
the<00:01:35.140> way<00:01:35.290> to<00:01:35.320> use<00:01:35.680> fusible<00:01:36.430> webbing<00:01:36.640> is<00:01:36.970> simply

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
the way to use fusible webbing is simply

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.929 
the way to use fusible webbing is simply
to<00:01:38.110> take<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:39.180> piece<00:01:40.180> of<00:01:40.210> webbing<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.820> the

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
to take a piece of webbing with the

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.569 
to take a piece of webbing with the
paper<00:01:43.150> side<00:01:43.540> up<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.950> trace<00:01:44.950> around<00:01:45.159> your

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
paper side up and trace around your

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.780 
paper side up and trace around your
shape<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:47.290> pencil<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:50.100> these<00:01:51.100> templates<00:01:51.610> are

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
shape in pencil and these templates are

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.130 
shape in pencil and these templates are
perfect<00:01:52.270> for<00:01:52.420> this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.100 

and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.970> just<00:01:57.210> cut<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.660> shape<00:01:57.930> out

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
and then you just cut the shape out

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.240 
and then you just cut the shape out
roughly<00:01:58.620> and<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.840> fuse<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.440> with<00:02:01.470> an<00:02:01.740> iron<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
roughly and then fuse it with an iron a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.000 
roughly and then fuse it with an iron a
hot<00:02:02.790> dry<00:02:03.060> iron<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> wrong<00:02:04.230> side<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
hot dry iron to the wrong side of the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.280 
hot dry iron to the wrong side of the
fabric<00:02:05.250> being<00:02:05.610> appliquéd<00:02:08.780> then<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.930> let<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
fabric being appliquéd then you let that

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.430 
fabric being appliquéd then you let that
cool<00:02:11.240> when<00:02:12.240> it's<00:02:12.390> cool<00:02:12.690> that's<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.200> time<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
cool when it's cool that's the time to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.370 
cool when it's cool that's the time to
cut<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:13.980> accurately<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.000> drawn<00:02:15.240> line

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.960 

then<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.950> take<00:02:23.220> away<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:24.390> paper<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:26.070> with

turn applique is to cut this shape out

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.380 
turn applique is to cut this shape out
accurately<00:03:12.170> before<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:14.340> fuse<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.269> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
accurately before you fuse it to the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.360 
accurately before you fuse it to the
wrong<00:03:15.600> side<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.560> fabric<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.190> you're

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
wrong side of the fabric that you're

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.759 
wrong side of the fabric that you're
using<00:03:19.790> then<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.420> trick<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.870> instead<00:03:22.709> of

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
using then the trick is instead of

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.650 
using then the trick is instead of
cutting<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.310> out<00:03:23.400> accurately<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.450> line

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
cutting it out accurately on the line

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.110 
cutting it out accurately on the line
you<00:03:25.019> cut<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.350> out<00:03:25.470> with<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> quarter<00:03:26.640> inch<00:03:26.670> seam

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
you cut it out with a quarter inch seam

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.330 
you cut it out with a quarter inch seam
allowance<00:03:27.150> all<00:03:27.690> around<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.670> then<00:03:34.190> peel<00:03:35.190> away

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
allowance all around and then peel away

allowance all around and then peel away
the<00:03:35.489> paper<00:03:36.200> like<00:03:37.200> we<00:03:37.230> did<00:03:37.500> before<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.840> here's

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
the paper like we did before and here's

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.320 
the paper like we did before and here's
the<00:03:40.019> trick<00:03:42.080> then<00:03:43.080> we<00:03:43.260> want<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.650> turn<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:45.150> edge

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
the trick then we want to turn the edge

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.960 
the trick then we want to turn the edge
over<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.590> with<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.890> tip<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.459> iron<00:03:47.610> only

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
over and with the tip of the iron only

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.300 
over and with the tip of the iron only
just<00:03:50.970> press<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.450> seam<00:03:52.170> allowance<00:03:52.200> down<00:03:52.950> so

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
just press that seam allowance down so

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.000 
just press that seam allowance down so
that<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.580> sticks<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.180> fusible<00:03:54.690> webbing

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
that it sticks to the fusible webbing
