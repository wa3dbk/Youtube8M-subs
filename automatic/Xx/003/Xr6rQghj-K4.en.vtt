roast it at 275 Fahrenheit 135 degrees
Celsius<00:03:03.670> for<00:03:03.970> 20<00:03:04.810> minutes<00:03:05.350> after<00:03:06.040> 10<00:03:06.850> minutes

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
Celsius for 20 minutes after 10 minutes

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.270 
Celsius for 20 minutes after 10 minutes
you'll<00:03:07.600> want<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.960> stir<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:08.470> making<00:03:08.860> sure<00:03:08.890> that

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
you'll want to stir it making sure that

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.410 
you'll want to stir it making sure that
you<00:03:09.340> get<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.550> stuff<00:03:09.850> that's<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.300> middle

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
you get the stuff that's in the middle

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.660 
you get the stuff that's in the middle
flipped<00:03:11.230> over<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.590> on<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.950> edge<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.400> pan

flipped over and on the edge of the pan

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.830 
flipped over and on the edge of the pan
