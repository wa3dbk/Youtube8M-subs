00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
about a hundred block of c4 to explode

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
about a hundred block of c4 to explode
so<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.360> are<00:01:36.540> playing<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> coil<00:01:37.380> game<00:01:37.710> 4

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so if you are playing in the coil game 4

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.730 
so if you are playing in the coil game 4
and<00:01:38.490> 4<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:38.909> tree<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.240> tree<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.560> an

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
and 4 or tree on tree this is an

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.249 
and 4 or tree on tree this is an
incredibly<00:01:41.340> good<00:01:41.460> way<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> level<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.689> fast<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
incredibly good way to level up fast and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.889 
incredibly good way to level up fast and
I<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.070> could<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.460> classes<00:01:45.000> boost<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.689> but

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
I know it could be classes boost and but

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.469 
I know it could be classes boost and but
what<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.729> my<00:01:47.909> fault<00:01:47.970> I'm

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
what can you do it's not my fault I'm

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.719 
what can you do it's not my fault I'm
just<00:01:48.750> gonna<00:01:48.869> take<00:01:49.110> advantage<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.770> now<00:01:50.520> what

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
just gonna take advantage of it now what

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.249 
just gonna take advantage of it now what
you<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.270> careful<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you have to be careful of is that you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.469 
you have to be careful of is that you
don't<00:01:52.439> blow<00:01:52.920> yourself<00:01:53.070> up<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.180> very

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
don't blow yourself up as it is very

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.899 
don't blow yourself up as it is very
easy<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> would<00:01:56.130> recommend<00:01:56.460> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
easy to do and what I would recommend is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.880 
easy to do and what I would recommend is
that<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.060> put<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.659> increased<00:01:58.110> explosive

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that you put on the increased explosive

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.880 
that you put on the increased explosive
damage<00:01:59.070> per<00:01:59.520> causal<00:02:00.210> next<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> 40

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890

too<00:02:16.150> bad<00:02:16.360> at<00:02:16.510> all<00:02:16.599> like<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.840> range<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.379> fairly

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
too bad at all like the range is fairly

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.619 
too bad at all like the range is fairly
decent<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.250> if<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.430> put<00:02:18.610> on<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.849> shotgun<00:02:19.299> or

ain't<00:02:20.290> here<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.470> parkside<00:02:21.099> say<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.400> would<00:02:21.519> be

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
ain't here to parkside say it would be

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.539 
ain't here to parkside say it would be
pretty<00:02:21.970> beastly<00:02:22.840> gun<00:02:23.170> but<00:02:23.799> anyway<00:02:24.099> there<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
pretty beastly gun but anyway there it

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.420 
pretty beastly gun but anyway there it
is<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:25.480> thought<00:02:25.690> I'd<00:02:25.900> shorten<00:02:26.440> next<00:02:27.069> up<00:02:27.250> we

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430

enemy spawn points for the vehicles and

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.410 
enemy spawn points for the vehicles and
in<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:32.920> case<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.519> spawn<00:02:33.910> trapping<00:02:34.239> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
in this case and spawn trapping the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.589 
in this case and spawn trapping the
helicopter<00:02:35.110> though<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.760> greatest<00:02:37.390> thing

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
helicopter though the greatest thing

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.420 
helicopter though the greatest thing
about<00:02:37.629> this<00:02:38.079> is<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.560> can<00:02:38.590> either<00:02:38.860> do<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.129> two

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
about this is you can either do it two

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.640 
about this is you can either do it two
ways<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.700> can<00:02:39.940> spawn<00:02:40.450> like<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.290> can<00:02:41.440> show<00:02:41.590> it

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
ways you can spawn like you can show it

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.250 
ways you can spawn like you can show it
on<00:02:41.709> your<00:02:41.890> c4<00:02:42.129> on<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.760> spawn<00:02:43.030> point<00:02:43.299> itself<00:02:43.629> or

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
on your c4 on the spawn point itself or

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.960 
on your c4 on the spawn point itself or
you<00:02:44.440> can<00:02:44.590> stick<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.160> Seaforth<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.879> the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
you can stick the Seaforth to the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.479 
you can stick the Seaforth to the
helicopter<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:47.049> I'd<00:02:47.230> done<00:02:47.319> there<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.950> you

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
can wait for the driveway and blow it up

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.319 
can wait for the driveway and blow it up
in<00:02:50.769> midair<00:02:51.069> or<00:02:51.310> blow<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.700> up<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:51.910> are<00:02:52.060> getting
