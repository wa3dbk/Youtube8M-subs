00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.490
Got an AC not cooling.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.490
Check it out here.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.490
See what's going on.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.490
Haven't pulled the disconnect yet.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:37.920
Go ahead and pull the cover off.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.120
Take a look here.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.720
It's actually a little bit cooler today.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.120
A little overcast.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.320
Contactor is sucked in, compressor is not
too hot.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.979
It's got an original contactor.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.100
Looks like it's still alive.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.890
Hard to say.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.141
Maybe it just blew the fuses.

00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:14.141
Check the wiring.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:18.830
Go ahead and pull the disconnect.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:30.030
Discharge the capacitor.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:40.970
Points look pretty good on the contactor,
being original.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.770
I went ahead and discharged the capacitor
by bridging the leads.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.399
All our wiring looks OK up there.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.329
Check the compressor wiring here.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:04.880
Everything looks OK there.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.619
Huh.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.890
Gonna start with the fuses.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.660
Go from there.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:32.290
Compressor is a little warm.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.670
I can take these back and test them with a
multimeter.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.570
I checked the breaker inside already and it
looked OK.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:57.300
Nothing funny going on there.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.870
It's actually a little bit cooler today.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.320
A little overcast in Palm Springs.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:18.180
Which is good, because it's been hot, to say
the least.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.180
OK.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.480
Our fuses are nice and tight there.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.360
Go ahead and plug the disconnect in and take
a look here.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.760
Right here, I'm just going to move this [INAUDIBLE]
here.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.770
[INAUDIBLE] It survived this long.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.770
OK.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:53.790
I'm gonna plug it in and see what happens.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:04.430
OK it's kind of what I thought.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.570
Fan motor didn't kick on.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.301
And I was able to kick start it will my pen.

00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:13.301
So to get away easy, I brought a new capacitor
with me, because I thought that's what it

00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.301
might be.

00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:15.301
The line is nice and chilly, nice and cold,
so that's good.

00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:16.301
I'm going to change out the capacitor here.

00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:17.301
So pull the disconnect again.

00:04:17.301 --> 00:04:39.949
And then we'll have to re-discharge the capacitor.

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.340
The capacitor holds a charge even after the
power is disconnected.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.919
So I'm taking my screwdriver, holding the
insulated handle, to bridge the leads.

00:04:51.919 --> 00:05:02.639
And this one has this little five microfarad
capacitor right here.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:20.409
And that's what we'll be replacing.

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:32.249
Tape that pretty good.

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:43.160
See the capacitor is all bulged out.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.370
That's a goner.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.580
There's that side.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.789
There's that side.

00:05:52.789 --> 00:06:01.360
Able to kind of reuse this electrical tape.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.639
That's pretty good there.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.710
OK.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.590
Now we'll plug it back in, make sure our fan
starts up like it should.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:28.110
Take a look here, Beautiful.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:35.020
Another air conditioner, good to go.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.449
A nice Palm Springs day, a little bit cooler.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.909
Muggy, but a little cooler.

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.449
There's another shot of that blown out cap.
