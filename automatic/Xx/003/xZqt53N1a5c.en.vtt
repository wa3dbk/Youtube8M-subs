driver should simply lift right off of
the<00:01:38.640> top<00:01:38.820> plate<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> magnet<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.530> okay

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the top plate of the magnet like so okay

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.420 
the top plate of the magnet like so okay
at<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> point<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.659> six<00:01:42.899> screws

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
at this point you have the six screws

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.399 
at this point you have the six screws
still<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.240> driver<00:01:45.540> cap<00:01:45.869> from<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> old

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
to the diaphragm itself this is a very

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.949 
to the diaphragm itself this is a very
common<00:02:09.149> problem<00:02:09.330> you'll<00:02:09.569> see<00:02:09.750> when<00:02:09.869> these

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
common problem you'll see when these

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.330 
common problem you'll see when these
units<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.319> been<00:02:10.379> over<00:02:10.649> driven<00:02:11.009> or<00:02:11.129> over

that causes failure to the diaphragm in

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.809 
that causes failure to the diaphragm in
which<00:02:14.989> case<00:02:15.230> we're<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.829> replace<00:02:16.189> so

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
which case we're going to replace so

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.369 
which case we're going to replace so
we'll<00:02:16.939> set<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.209> bad<00:02:17.359> diaphragm<00:02:17.870> aside<00:02:18.140> for

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
we'll set the bad diaphragm aside for

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:26.800 
we'll set the bad diaphragm aside for
now<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:23.799> the<00:02:24.799> new<00:02:24.920> diaphragm<00:02:25.280> comes<00:02:26.180> box<00:02:26.510> just

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
now and the new diaphragm comes box just

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.199
