00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.950
 For me to illustrate is to give a vision and then 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.740
 You will our imaginary your 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.680
 Stumbling understanding the subtext its 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.279
 interpretation and will create a second 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.830
 with a second way of seeing that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.330
 of the text besides that of the thing that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.359
 original is helping the other 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.270
 interpretation in form of shape form 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.630
 photo collage depending on the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.630
 person 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.620
 another text then illustrated 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.920
 very large possibility so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.410
 to acquire one with a meaning 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.340
 totally different from the view of the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.860
 illustrator 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.480
 so you have two visions there like that and 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.469
 there the third vision that will be of the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.149
 reader 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.160
 so he's going to have one more thing 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.649
 broadly so in my opinion so if the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.989
 illustrator do thing if it's good 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.539
 if he does the right thing to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.090
 possibility and thus increase the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.890
 business is so great the the text 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.890
 will gain much of the meaning 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.650
 creative process to take the illustration 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.890
 first thing law and then looked at 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.619
 with another against the personal vision in 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.799
 image terms you're going to testify 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.159
 so the thing until it comes out like a draft 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.810
 If it's going to be read or read 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.650
 times one stretch and goes on doing 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.410
 draft by the family usually goes from there 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.550
 The 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.250
 I think the experience of the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.370
 illustrations on the sound and I tried a lot 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.640
 bring some elements that have in each 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.340
 content and bring it to a 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.110
 Yes, indeed 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.230
 transforming the transformation of 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.940
 a much more radical form so then 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.730
 some things kind of was that I did 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.190
 here's a little in the text I did that 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.190
 not so much a thing of subtext for 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.369
 intensify the feelings so then 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.790
 intensified the feeling of emptiness of 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.550
 loss of doubt I like it when I read 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.200
 a book that has 960 people who know 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.240
 I would like to see you 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.540
 so I wanted so here is a 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.080
 intensification of sensation 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.330
 with the images use the first work 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.070
 that I do illustration that wants to see with 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.380
 What I do with my work now yes 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.750
 but it is not non-commercial in the sense 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.840
 to testify because I have the tendency to be 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.950
 somewhat limited because that 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.500
 very much too much dark is too much and the sound 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.230
 It's a story that she's meant to be. 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.489
 for me it was very good at doing the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.200
 Sound was good from goods I would say until 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.570
 because I really liked the text and I 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.180
 I thought it had a lot to do with me. 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.760
 with the things that I think paulo 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.540
 so it was kind of that at the right time 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.930
 so that was a good thing, a great thing, I 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.930
 would say
