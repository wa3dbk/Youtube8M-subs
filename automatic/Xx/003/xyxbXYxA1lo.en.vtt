principle<00:02:37.440> there<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:37.980> getting<00:02:38.400> them<00:02:38.760> started

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
principle there in getting them started

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.000 
principle there in getting them started
is<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.220> make<00:02:41.400> sure<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.760> start<00:02:42.060> them<00:02:42.329> in<00:02:43.010> nice

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
is to make sure you start them in nice

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.270 
is to make sure you start them in nice
healthy<00:02:44.609> soil<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.590> they<00:02:46.590> need<00:02:46.799> plenty<00:02:47.069> of

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
healthy soil and they need plenty of

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.539 
healthy soil and they need plenty of
moisture<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:48.060> get<00:02:48.209> moving<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.370> was

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
moisture to get moving and that was

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.160 
moisture to get moving and that was
through<00:02:50.819> our<00:02:51.000> wet<00:02:51.239> season<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:51.989> you're

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
through our wet season so if you're

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.780 
through our wet season so if you're
going<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.350> plant<00:02:52.650> them<00:02:52.890> make<00:02:53.160> sure<00:02:53.430> there's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
going to plant them make sure there's

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.720 
going to plant them make sure there's
good<00:02:53.970> moisture<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.530> subtropical<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
good moisture in the subtropical and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.759 
good moisture in the subtropical and
tropical<00:02:57.500> climates<00:02:58.500> not<00:02:58.859> a<00:02:58.889> problem<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.609> the

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
tropical climates not a problem in the

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.729 
tropical climates not a problem in the
temperate<00:03:01.769> climates<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.489> your<00:03:02.639> hot<00:03:02.850> season

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
temperate climates in your hot season

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.559 
temperate climates in your hot season
that's<00:03:04.739> usually<00:03:05.280> dry<00:03:05.579> so<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.239> you're<00:03:06.389> going<00:03:06.510> to

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
that's usually dry so if you're going to

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.400 
that's usually dry so if you're going to
plant<00:03:07.700> rosales<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.060> temperate<00:03:09.480> climate

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
plant rosales in a temperate climate

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.250 
plant rosales in a temperate climate
sure<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.740> give<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.100> bottle<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.970> they'll<00:03:15.900> grow

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
sure you give the bottle so they'll grow

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.010 
sure you give the bottle so they'll grow
progressively<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:17.490> then<00:03:17.700> they<00:03:17.850> produce<00:03:18.090> an

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
progressively and then they produce an

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.520 
progressively and then they produce an
amazing<00:03:20.010> amount<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.490> flowers<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.240> mean<00:03:21.450> out<00:03:22.170> of

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
amazing amount of flowers I mean out of

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.700 
amazing amount of flowers I mean out of
this<00:03:22.710> one<00:03:23.040> bush<00:03:23.340> here<00:03:23.700> we<00:03:24.030> would<00:03:24.270> have

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
this one bush here we would have

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.350 
this one bush here we would have
harvested<00:03:25.710> kilos<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.520> kilos<00:03:26.610> of<00:03:27.150> these

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
harvested kilos and kilos of these

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.100 
harvested kilos and kilos of these
flowers<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.990> we<00:03:28.350> have<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.950> think<00:03:29.460> about<00:03:29.960> 20<00:03:30.960> to

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
flowers and we have I think about 20 to

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.820 
flowers and we have I think about 20 to
30<00:03:31.380> bushes<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.250> our<00:03:32.790> garden<00:03:33.330> here<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.050> we

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
30 bushes in our garden here and we

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.100 
30 bushes in our garden here and we
would<00:03:35.070> have<00:03:35.190> harvested<00:03:35.760> perhaps<00:03:36.180> 30<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.720> 40

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
would have harvested perhaps 30 to 40

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.080 
would have harvested perhaps 30 to 40
kilos<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:39.180> these<00:03:40.070> flowers<00:03:41.070> which<00:03:41.310> hey<00:03:41.790> one

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
kilos of of these flowers which hey one

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.200 
kilos of of these flowers which hey one
flower<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.960> a<00:03:43.740> couple<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.340> grams<00:03:44.550> or<00:03:44.910> maybe

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
flower is a couple of grams or maybe

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.080 
flower is a couple of grams or maybe
five<00:03:46.200> or<00:03:46.230> six<00:03:46.380> grams<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.280> can<00:03:47.430> imagine<00:03:47.880> how

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
five or six grams so you can imagine how

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.930 
five or six grams so you can imagine how
many<00:03:48.180> flowers<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:50.160> we<00:03:50.340> produced<00:03:50.790> a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
many flowers that is so we produced a

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.010 
many flowers that is so we produced a
lot<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.120> jam<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:54.090> lots<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.600> people<00:03:54.780> have

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
lot of jam and and lots of people have

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.700 
lot of jam and and lots of people have
bought<00:03:55.200> these<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.830> bags<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.640> eat<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.710> quite

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
bought these in bags to eat so quite

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.610 
bought these in bags to eat so quite
easy<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.160> grow<00:03:59.550> not<00:03:59.940> much<00:04:00.150> attacks<00:04:00.600> them<00:04:00.900> these

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
easy to grow not much attacks them these

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.150 
easy to grow not much attacks them these
leaves<00:04:02.070> here<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:03.930> know<00:04:04.050> these<00:04:04.560> plants<00:04:05.040> are

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
leaves here you know these plants are

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.740 
leaves here you know these plants are
getting<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.430> little<00:04:05.580> bit<00:04:05.790> old<00:04:06.000> now<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:06.300> we're

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
getting a little bit old now and we're

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.770 
getting a little bit old now and we're
going<00:04:06.960> to<00:04:07.080> be<00:04:07.670> harvesting<00:04:08.670> off<00:04:08.880> these<00:04:09.210> plants

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
going to be harvesting off these plants

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.410 
going to be harvesting off these plants
shortly<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.500> most<00:04:11.490> of<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.760> flowers<00:04:12.090> are

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
shortly and most of the flowers are

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.440 
shortly and most of the flowers are
quite<00:04:12.630> big<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:14.160> when<00:04:14.730> they're<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.090> kind<00:04:15.390> of

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
quite big and when they're this kind of

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.770 
quite big and when they're this kind of
size<00:04:15.720> they're<00:04:16.109> ready<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.410> harvest<00:04:17.660> when<00:04:18.660> you

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
size they're ready to harvest when you

size they're ready to harvest when you
harvest<00:04:19.109> them<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.799> it's<00:04:20.130> often<00:04:20.520> good<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.820> use

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
harvest them you it's often good to use

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.290 
harvest them you it's often good to use
a<00:04:21.270> pair<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.720> scissors<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:22.470> cut<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:23.090> fruit<00:04:24.090> off

a pair of scissors to cut the fruit off

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.960 
a pair of scissors to cut the fruit off
so<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.870> don't<00:04:25.080> actually<00:04:25.350> damage<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.400> need

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
so that you don't actually damage I need

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.690 
so that you don't actually damage I need
some<00:04:27.210> scissors<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.740> you<00:04:28.800> don't<00:04:29.010> damage

some scissors so that you don't damage
these<00:04:30.180> slender<00:04:32.120> stalks<00:04:33.120> see<00:04:34.080> here's<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.440> small

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
these slender stalks see here's a small

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.700 
these slender stalks see here's a small
one<00:04:35.210> coming<00:04:36.210> on<00:04:36.330> there<00:04:36.600> so<00:04:36.960> that's<00:04:37.200> still<00:04:37.500> got

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
one coming on there so that's still got

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.490 
one coming on there so that's still got
to<00:04:37.890> grow<00:04:38.130> whereas<00:04:38.700> these<00:04:39.419> ones<00:04:39.840> are<00:04:40.020> all<00:04:40.169> ready

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
to grow whereas these ones are all ready

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.340 
to grow whereas these ones are all ready
to<00:04:40.620> harvest<00:04:41.390> so<00:04:42.390> we'll<00:04:42.630> be<00:04:42.750> having<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:43.140> big

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
to harvest so we'll be having a big

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.710 
to harvest so we'll be having a big
harvest<00:04:43.800> of<00:04:44.010> these<00:04:44.190> plants<00:04:44.820> in<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.450> next

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
harvest of these plants in the next

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.990 
harvest of these plants in the next
couple<00:04:46.020> of<00:04:46.080> days

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
couple of days

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.050 
couple of days
to<00:04:47.300> make<00:04:47.480> them<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.860> spacing<00:04:52.520> around<00:04:52.610> these

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
to make them the spacing around these

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.350 
to make them the spacing around these
plants<00:04:53.630> should<00:04:53.840> be<00:04:53.900> around<00:04:54.700> me<00:04:55.700> up<00:04:55.970> as<00:04:56.210> they

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
plants should be around me up as they

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.870 
plants should be around me up as they
grow<00:04:56.660> quite<00:04:57.170> being<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:58.460> could<00:04:58.730> be

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
grow quite being and you could be
