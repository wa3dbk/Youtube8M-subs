and bluehost is good but at the same

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.430 
and bluehost is good but at the same
time<00:00:42.710> it's<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.340> more<00:00:44.940> expensive<00:00:45.450> host<00:00:46.050> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440

hosts<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.820> kind<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.539> same<00:00:55.500> host<00:00:55.890> but

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
hosts are kind of the same host but

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.380 
hosts are kind of the same host but
Hostgator<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
