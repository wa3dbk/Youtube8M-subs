all the time helping players from all
around<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.220> world<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.790> look<00:02:30.270> forward<00:02:30.600> to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
around the world I look forward to

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.870 
around the world I look forward to
continuing<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.440> learn<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.400> think<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.730> is

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
continuing to learn and I think this is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.080 
continuing to learn and I think this is
this<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.510> me<00:02:33.660> was<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> learning<00:02:34.110> process<00:02:34.230> and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
this to me was a learning process and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.910 
this to me was a learning process and
the<00:02:36.090> recognition<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.750> important<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.770> most

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the recognition is important but most

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.350 
the recognition is important but most
importantly<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.490> think<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:38.700> recognizing

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
importantly I think it's recognizing

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.060 
importantly I think it's recognizing
that<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.750> will<00:02:39.870> continue<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.410> grow<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:40.890> learn

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
that you will continue to grow and learn

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.550
