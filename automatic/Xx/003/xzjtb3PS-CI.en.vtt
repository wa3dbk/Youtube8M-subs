based on maybe pictures or small visits
you've<00:00:28.879> had<00:00:29.149> I<00:00:29.300> think<00:00:29.419> that<00:00:29.599> was<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:30.140> toughest

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
you've had I think that was the toughest

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.979 
you've had I think that was the toughest
thing<00:00:30.590> for<00:00:30.800> me<00:00:30.980> is<00:00:31.040> shaking<00:00:31.489> that<00:00:31.669> off

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
thing for me is shaking that off

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.459 
thing for me is shaking that off
completely<00:00:33.670> zeroing<00:00:34.670> your<00:00:35.270> mind<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:36.110> guess

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
completely zeroing your mind and I guess

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.799 
completely zeroing your mind and I guess
I've<00:00:36.770> had<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.100> luxury<00:00:37.280> of<00:00:37.489> being<00:00:37.789> able<00:00:37.879> over

I've had the luxury of being able over

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.299 
I've had the luxury of being able over
the<00:00:38.960> past<00:00:39.140> ten<00:00:39.379> years<00:00:39.410> though<00:00:39.739> just<00:00:39.950> to<00:00:40.010> feel

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
the past ten years though just to feel

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.799 
the past ten years though just to feel
compelled<00:00:40.700> to<00:00:40.820> make<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:41.090> body<00:00:41.360> of<00:00:41.480> work<00:00:41.570> and

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
compelled to make a body of work and

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.169 
compelled to make a body of work and
make<00:00:41.899> but<00:00:42.199> this<00:00:42.350> was<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:43.039> make<00:00:43.159> body<00:00:43.909> of<00:00:44.059> work

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:44.179 
make but this was to make body of work

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.090 
make but this was to make body of work
in<00:00:44.329> a<00:00:44.420> certain<00:00:44.629> place<00:00:44.899> within<00:00:45.379> a<00:00:45.530> certain<00:00:45.739> time

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:49.069 
and parameters for the people of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:50.979 
and parameters for the people of
Brighton<00:00:49.489> made<00:00:49.699> in<00:00:49.879> brighter<00:00:50.089> so<00:00:50.300> at<00:00:50.659> first<00:00:50.899> I

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
Brighton made in brighter so at first I

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.840 
Brighton made in brighter so at first I
was<00:00:51.109> thinking<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.530> lot<00:00:51.620> about<00:00:51.679> that<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.280> they

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
was thinking a lot about that and they

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.369 
was thinking a lot about that and they
were<00:00:52.909> all<00:00:53.030> quite<00:00:53.210> detached<00:00:53.629> ideas<00:00:54.140> because<00:00:54.350> I

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
were all quite detached ideas because I

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.799 
were all quite detached ideas because I
don't<00:00:54.559> know<00:00:54.769> Brighton<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.550> don't<00:00:55.729> really<00:00:56.120> know

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
don't know Brighton I don't really know

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.899 
don't know Brighton I don't really know
many<00:00:56.960> people<00:00:57.530> here<00:00:57.769> so<00:00:57.979> I<00:00:58.399> didn't<00:00:58.760> want

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
many people here so I didn't want

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.819 
many people here so I didn't want
definitely<00:00:59.780> didn't<00:01:00.050> want<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.260> come<00:01:00.499> and<00:01:00.620> do<00:01:00.800> a

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
definitely didn't want to come and do a

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.919 
definitely didn't want to come and do a
body<00:01:01.039> of<00:01:01.190> work<00:01:01.370> that<00:01:01.399> said<00:01:01.909> this<00:01:02.510> is<00:01:02.569> bright

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
body of work that said this is bright

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.259 
body of work that said this is bright
and<00:01:03.229> I<00:01:03.530> think<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.370> just<00:01:04.519> simply<00:01:05.030> wouldn't<00:01:05.120> be

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
and I think I just simply wouldn't be

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.940 
and I think I just simply wouldn't be
able<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.479> leave<00:01:05.659> that<00:01:05.690> because<00:01:06.080> I<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.770> I

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
able to leave that because I so it I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.160 
able to leave that because I so it I
have<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:07.610> knew<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.060> was<00:01:08.240> going<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.600> be<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.780> series

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
have I knew it was going to be a series

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.740 
have I knew it was going to be a series
where<00:01:09.320> I<00:01:09.380> was<00:01:09.500> stepping<00:01:09.770> back<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.700> trying<00:01:11.479> to

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
where I was stepping back and trying to

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.190 
where I was stepping back and trying to
be<00:01:11.870> steered<00:01:12.290> by<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.920> place<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.550> some<00:01:13.790> way<00:01:14.200> so

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
be steered by the place in some way so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.690 
be steered by the place in some way so
this<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.350> bit<00:01:15.470> about<00:01:15.650> this<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.280> talk<00:01:16.460> about<00:01:16.550> the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
this a bit about this you talk about the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.700 
this a bit about this you talk about the
baggage<00:01:16.940> of<00:01:17.360> your<00:01:17.570> previous<00:01:17.960> knowledge<00:01:17.990> yeah

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
baggage of your previous knowledge yeah

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.290 
baggage of your previous knowledge yeah
can<00:01:19.040> you<00:01:19.070> just<00:01:19.430> talk<00:01:19.610> about<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:19.910> well<00:01:20.060> I

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
can you just talk about that well I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.400 
can you just talk about that well I
think<00:01:20.390> there<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.810> national<00:01:21.230> and<00:01:21.910> regional

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
think there is national and regional

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.310 
think there is national and regional
visual<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.880> place<00:01:26.120> places<00:01:26.480> that<00:01:26.720> visually

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
visual the place places that visually

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.960 
visual the place places that visually
represented<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.040> I<00:01:28.100> think<00:01:28.340> often<00:01:28.850> these

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
represented and I think often these

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.300 
represented and I think often these
things<00:01:29.270> are<00:01:29.810> inherited<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.560> carry<00:01:30.800> over<00:01:30.920> for

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
things are inherited and carry over for

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.340 
things are inherited and carry over for
years<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:31.880> years<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.150> years<00:01:32.510> doesn't

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
years and years and years doesn't

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.250 
years and years and years doesn't
necessarily<00:01:33.920> mean<00:01:34.220> that<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:35.050> Mary's<00:01:36.050> with<00:01:36.230> a

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
necessarily mean that is Mary's with a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.290 
necessarily mean that is Mary's with a
place<00:01:36.530> at<00:01:36.710> all<00:01:36.950> sometimes<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.820> think<00:01:38.060> these

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
place at all sometimes I think these

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.390 
place at all sometimes I think these
things<00:01:38.510> are<00:01:38.720> in<00:01:38.810> place<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.740> give<00:01:39.890> echoes<00:01:40.370> of

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
things are in place to give echoes of

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.820 
things are in place to give echoes of
the<00:01:40.670> past<00:01:40.910> but<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.300> doesn't<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:42.410> often<00:01:42.650> I<00:01:42.800> think

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
the past but it doesn't so often I think

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.120 
the past but it doesn't so often I think
we<00:01:43.070> can<00:01:44.000> look<00:01:44.240> for<00:01:44.600> how<00:01:44.930> we<00:01:44.990> imagine<00:01:45.530> places<00:01:45.950> to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
we can look for how we imagine places to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.360 
we can look for how we imagine places to
be<00:01:46.460> versus<00:01:47.420> how<00:01:47.660> they<00:01:47.900> are<00:01:48.080> sort<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:49.280> know

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
be versus how they are sort of you know

so<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.810> in-between<00:04:36.350> frames<00:04:36.620> you'd<00:04:36.980> sort<00:04:37.190> of

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
so and in-between frames you'd sort of

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.580 
so and in-between frames you'd sort of
rock<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.639> camera<00:04:38.030> if<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.570> shake<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.110> quite

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
rock the camera if it and shake it quite

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.190 
rock the camera if it and shake it quite
hard<00:04:39.860> if<00:04:40.130> there's<00:04:40.340> no<00:04:40.669> living<00:04:41.080> creatures<00:04:42.080> in

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.110 
hard if there's no living creatures in
there<00:04:42.440> there<00:04:42.830> was<00:04:42.919> even<00:04:43.280> one<00:04:43.310> occasion<00:04:43.910> where

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
there there was even one occasion where

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.870 
there there was even one occasion where
I<00:04:44.570> had<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.260> camera<00:04:45.650> back<00:04:45.919> open<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.340> was<00:04:46.460> loading

I had the camera back open I was loading
the<00:04:47.060> camera<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:48.050> fly<00:04:48.290> actually<00:04:48.860> flew<00:04:49.280> into

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
the camera and a fly actually flew into

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.480 
the camera and a fly actually flew into
the<00:04:50.000> camera<00:04:50.530> which<00:04:51.530> was<00:04:51.710> probably<00:04:52.190> one<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.400> the

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
the camera which was probably one of the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.030 
the camera which was probably one of the
most<00:04:52.580> exciting<00:04:53.240> parts<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:53.720> Syria<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:54.950> it

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
most exciting parts of Syria so that it

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.680 
most exciting parts of Syria so that it
felt<00:04:55.340> like<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.639> word<00:04:55.820> have<00:04:56.060> got<00:04:56.210> around<00:04:56.510> in

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
felt like the word have got around in

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.930 
felt like the word have got around in
the<00:04:56.810> insect<00:04:57.139> world<00:04:57.430> you<00:04:58.430> have<00:04:58.700> to<00:04:58.790> remember

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
the insect world you have to remember

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.879 
the insect world you have to remember
because<00:04:59.180> when<00:04:59.330> you're<00:04:59.450> adding<00:05:00.050> things<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.620> the

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
because when you're adding things to the

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.060 
because when you're adding things to the
camera<00:05:01.310> you're<00:05:02.260> obscuring<00:05:03.260> as<00:05:03.410> much<00:05:03.680> as<00:05:03.919> you

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
camera you're obscuring as much as you

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.840 
camera you're obscuring as much as you
are<00:05:04.150> adding<00:05:05.150> so<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:06.460> mentally<00:05:07.460> you're<00:05:07.610> sort

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850

camera so what I did in order to do that

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.140 
camera so what I did in order to do that
is<00:05:54.430> start<00:05:55.430> working<00:05:55.550> on<00:05:55.820> e6<00:05:56.330> slide<00:05:57.320> film

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150

photographing things and subjects that I
was<00:06:02.419> interested<00:06:02.750> but<00:06:03.260> couldn't<00:06:03.740> squeeze<00:06:03.979> in

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
was interested but couldn't squeeze in

the<00:06:04.400> camera<00:06:04.760> process<00:06:05.450> the<00:06:05.600> film<00:06:05.840> cut<00:06:06.050> them<00:06:06.260> out

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
the camera process the film cut them out

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.510 
the camera process the film cut them out
so<00:06:07.130> they<00:06:07.340> too<00:06:08.020> so<00:06:09.020> bigger<00:06:09.350> objects<00:06:10.010> could<00:06:10.280> find

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
so they too so bigger objects could find

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.190 
so they too so bigger objects could find

about<00:06:30.680> Brighton<00:06:31.160> this<00:06:31.370> time<00:06:31.639> I<00:06:31.820> think<00:06:31.940> the

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
about Brighton this time I think the

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.610 
about Brighton this time I think the
things<00:06:32.539> that<00:06:32.720> I've<00:06:32.780> noticed<00:06:32.990> they're<00:06:33.410> silly

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
things that I've noticed they're silly

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.580 
things that I've noticed they're silly
things<00:06:33.919> like<00:06:34.450> there's<00:06:35.450> enormous<00:06:35.900> amounts<00:06:36.470> of

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
things like there's enormous amounts of

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.440 
things like there's enormous amounts of
tattoos<00:06:37.070> in<00:06:37.400> Brighton<00:06:37.940> and<00:06:38.150> some

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
tattoos in Brighton and some

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.180 
tattoos in Brighton and some
particularly<00:06:38.900> good<00:06:39.080> ones<00:06:39.350> I<00:06:39.650> think<00:06:39.919> that's

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
particularly good ones I think that's

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.740 
particularly good ones I think that's
why<00:06:40.909> I<00:06:40.940> noticed<00:06:41.360> but<00:06:41.450> that's<00:06:41.630> probably

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
why I noticed but that's probably

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.360 
why I noticed but that's probably
because<00:06:41.960> I<00:06:42.140> was<00:06:42.229> photographing<00:06:42.380> during<00:06:43.250> the

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:47.170 
summer months
pink<00:06:45.289> is<00:06:45.560> probably<00:06:46.130> one<00:06:46.460> of<00:06:46.490> the<00:06:46.580> favorite

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
pink is probably one of the favorite

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.330 
pink is probably one of the favorite
colors<00:06:47.870> or<00:06:48.050> color<00:06:48.349> that<00:06:48.530> over<00:06:48.710> to<00:06:48.830> associate
