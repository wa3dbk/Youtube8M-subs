piece<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.190> 24<00:00:30.030> gauge<00:00:30.240> wire<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.500> slides

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
piece of 24 gauge wire so it slides

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.549 
piece of 24 gauge wire so it slides
right<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.340> wire<00:00:32.489> nicely<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.780> 24<00:00:34.230> days<00:00:34.379> is

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
right on the wire nicely to 24 days is

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.599 
right on the wire nicely to 24 days is
just<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.129> a<00:00:35.399> really<00:00:35.489> good<00:00:36.000> size<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.420> use

just a really a really good size to use
you<00:00:38.609> put<00:00:38.819> it<00:00:38.909> in<00:00:38.999> the<00:00:39.089> middle<00:00:39.649> you're<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
you put it in the middle you're going to

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.439 
you put it in the middle you're going to
take<00:00:41.069> your<00:00:41.100> pliers<00:00:41.460> while<00:00:41.940> you're<00:00:42.059> holding<00:00:42.239> it

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
take your pliers while you're holding it

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.669 
take your pliers while you're holding it
with<00:00:42.569> a<00:00:42.629> pin<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.409> just<00:00:44.629> turn<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.199> 90

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
with a pin and just turn it up at a 90

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.340 
with a pin and just turn it up at a 90
degree<00:00:46.710> angle<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.929> I've<00:00:48.929> switched<00:00:49.109> it<00:00:49.260> over

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
degree angle and I've switched it over

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.590 
degree angle and I've switched it over
to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.679> stand<00:00:49.949> so<00:00:50.159> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.429> hold<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.819> securely

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to the stand so you can hold it securely

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.939 
to the stand so you can hold it securely
and<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.589> the<00:00:52.739> same<00:00:52.949> thing<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:54.179> side<00:00:54.949> now

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and do the same thing on this side now

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.379 
and do the same thing on this side now
you<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.579> give<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.909> little<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.269> of

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:57.389 
you want it to give it a little bit of

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:00.950 
you want it to give it a little bit of
room<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:58.049> move<00:00:58.079> around<00:00:58.639> and<00:00:59.639> so<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> usually

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
room to move around and so I usually

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.889 
room to move around and so I usually
supplied<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.409> pendant<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.569> it's<00:01:03.690> secure

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
supplied the pendant so that it's secure

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.360 
supplied the pendant so that it's secure
if<00:01:04.199> against<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.739> wire

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
if against that wire

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.470 
if against that wire
and<00:01:05.490> then<00:01:05.700> leave<00:01:05.940> about<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.020> much<00:01:07.200> room<00:01:08.480> and

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
and then leave about that much room and

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.660 
and then leave about that much room and
then<00:01:09.810> I've<00:01:09.930> been<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.410> up<00:01:10.590> at<00:01:11.160> a<00:01:11.310> 90<00:01:11.640> degree

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
then I've been that up at a 90 degree

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.010 
then I've been that up at a 90 degree
angle<00:01:11.940> to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
angle to

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.490 
angle to
so<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:14.770> can<00:01:14.920> see<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.399> Wiggles<00:01:15.789> around<00:01:16.500> but

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
so you can see it Wiggles around but

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.270 
so you can see it Wiggles around but
it's<00:01:17.649> still<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:19.090> too<00:01:19.149> much<00:01:19.539> room<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.409> then

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
it's still not too much room and then

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.720 
it's still not too much room and then
you're<00:01:21.460> just<00:01:21.490> going<00:01:21.789> to<00:01:21.939> squeeze<00:01:22.179> it

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.490 

just<00:01:26.420> kind<00:01:26.660> of<00:01:26.690> pull<00:01:26.990> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
just kind of pull it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.680 
just kind of pull it
takes<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.670> practice

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.530 

until<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.170> wires<00:01:33.380> are<00:01:33.590> overlapping<00:01:34.480> at<00:01:35.480> a

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
until the wires are overlapping at a

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.720 
until the wires are overlapping at a
good<00:01:35.750> spot

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.310 

then<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> hold<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> together<00:01:39.870> with<00:01:40.140> your

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
then you hold it together with your

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.280 
then you hold it together with your
pliers<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.860> pick<00:01:41.160> rack<00:01:41.630> take<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.750> second<00:01:43.140> pair

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
pliers to pick rack take a second pair

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.820 
pliers to pick rack take a second pair
of<00:01:43.350> pliers<00:01:44.990> one<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> wires<00:01:46.350> you're<00:01:46.680> going

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
of pliers one of the wires you're going

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.790 
of pliers one of the wires you're going
to<00:01:46.890> bend<00:01:47.070> down<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.670> doesn't<00:01:47.970> matter<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.240> one

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
to bend down it doesn't matter which one

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.770 
to bend down it doesn't matter which one
and<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.920> other<00:01:49.950> wire<00:01:50.400> are<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.480> up

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and the other wire are going to this up

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.330 
and the other wire are going to this up
like<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.950 

we're<00:01:57.880> going<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.090> take<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.329> wire<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:58.780> you've

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
we're going to take the wire that you've

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.060 
we're going to take the wire that you've
been<00:01:59.130> ended<00:02:00.130> down<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.579> one<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.950> you're

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
been ended down this one and you're

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.209 
been ended down this one and you're
going<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.310> wrap<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.549> let's<00:02:04.390> cover<00:02:04.600> up<00:02:04.780> things

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
going to wrap it let's cover up things

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.440 
going to wrap it let's cover up things
around<00:02:06.219> the<00:02:06.759> other<00:02:06.909> wire<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:09.179> wrap<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.209> around

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
around the other wire I wrap it around

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.059 
around the other wire I wrap it around
three<00:02:10.989> times<00:02:11.170> just<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:13.030> secure<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.010> you

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
three times just so secure and so you

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.729 
three times just so secure and so you
leave<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.459> wire<00:02:15.640> at<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.910> back<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.470> you

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
leave the wire at the back so that you

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.030 
leave the wire at the back so that you
can<00:02:19.110> flip<00:02:20.110> off<00:02:20.319> extra<00:02:21.599> all<00:02:22.599> right<00:02:22.920> you're<00:02:23.920> not

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040
