focusing here you're going to put this
in<00:01:01.980> between<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:04.820> band<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.299> watch<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.760> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
in between the band of your watch and a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810 
in between the band of your watch and a
tiny<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.360> piece<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.979> metal<00:01:11.400> down<00:01:11.549> there

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
tiny little piece of metal down there

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
tiny little piece of metal down there
that's<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.119> bar<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:13.080> spring

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that's a bar it's like a little spring

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.649 
that's a bar it's like a little spring
compression<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.409> can

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
compression so I'm going to see if I can

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.170 
compression so I'm going to see if I can
set<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.689> my<00:01:18.810> camera<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> show<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.860> how<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> do

out in about half a second after trying

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.160 
out in about half a second after trying
with<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.990> little<00:01:28.290> crappy<00:01:29.009> tool<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
set up and we'll see if we can't try to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.469 
set up and we'll see if we can't try to
pull<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.840> off<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> here

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
pull this off of here

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.899

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
alright so we're back and I'm going to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.670 
alright so we're back and I'm going to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
see if I can't show you how to do this

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
see if I can't show you how to do this
you're<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> put<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> knife<00:01:44.490> down<00:01:44.820> in

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you're going to put the knife down in

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.609 
you're going to put the knife down in
here<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.390> compress<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
here you're going to compress that and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.850 
here you're going to compress that and
push<00:01:49.920> down<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> same<00:01:50.610> time<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.710> can

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
push down at the same time so you can

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.580 
push down at the same time so you can
kind<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.100> feel<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> little<00:01:53.520> Ridge<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.299> there

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
kind of feel a little Ridge in there

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.929 
kind of feel a little Ridge in there
when<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.710> compress<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.369> actually<00:01:56.460> did<00:01:56.820> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
when you compress it I actually did this

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.249 
when you compress it I actually did this
on<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.149> knee<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> first<00:01:57.719> time<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.140> going

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
on my knee the first time so I'm going

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.030 
on my knee the first time so I'm going
to<00:01:58.320> try<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.619> again<00:01:58.820> when<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.090> bend<00:02:01.040> and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
to try that again when you can bend and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.620 
to try that again when you can bend and
it's<00:02:02.280> kind<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> hard<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.909> apologize<00:02:03.479> but

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
it's kind of hard to see I apologize but

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.580 
it's kind of hard to see I apologize but
you're<00:02:05.320> going<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.500> kind<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.430> push<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.939> and<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
you're going to kind of push in and and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.850 
you're going to kind of push in and and

down and we do the same thing on the
other<00:02:11.890> side<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:13.209> should<00:02:13.560> look<00:02:14.560> at<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.739> it

use something tiny push it down and then

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.440 
use something tiny push it down and then
do<00:02:42.010> both<00:02:42.190> sides<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.819> should<00:02:42.970> pop<00:02:43.150> right<00:02:43.180> up

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
do both sides and it should pop right up

piece<00:04:31.050> on<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.260> bottom<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:32.030> hope<00:04:33.030> that's<00:04:33.210> right

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
piece on the bottom I hope that's right

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.430 
piece on the bottom I hope that's right
and<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:33.810> think<00:04:33.990> that's<00:04:34.170> right<00:04:34.820> but<00:04:36.020> yeah<00:04:37.020> I'm

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
and I think that's right but yeah I'm

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.920 
and I think that's right but yeah I'm
trying<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.680> finish<00:04:37.920> installing<00:04:38.070> this<00:04:38.610> I

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
trying to finish installing this I

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.210 
trying to finish installing this I
remember<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.110> your<00:04:40.290> watch<00:04:40.530> pieces<00:04:40.980> on<00:04:41.100> the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
remember that your watch pieces on the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.120 
remember that your watch pieces on the
top<00:04:41.430> should<00:04:41.880> line<00:04:42.180> up<00:04:42.530> um<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.650> correct

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
top should line up um to the correct

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.370 
top should line up um to the correct
spot<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:50.030> yeah<00:04:51.030> my<00:04:51.600> suggestion<00:04:52.140> for<00:04:52.200> this

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
spot and yeah my suggestion for this

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.430 
spot and yeah my suggestion for this
part<00:04:52.680> would<00:04:52.770> just<00:04:52.980> be<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.220> take<00:04:53.400> your<00:04:53.430> time<00:04:53.700> and

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
part would just be to take your time and

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.260 
part would just be to take your time and
and<00:04:55.440> be<00:04:55.680> really<00:04:55.920> careful<00:04:56.070> if<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:56.580> are<00:04:56.610> using<00:04:56.910> a

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
and be really careful if you are using a

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.380 
and be really careful if you are using a
pocketknife<00:04:57.930> so<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.620> couple<00:04:59.250> more<00:04:59.370> minutes<00:04:59.580> all

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
pocketknife so a couple more minutes all
