00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.160

 channel your channel our channel I'm going to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.140
 start saying that because it sounds more 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.030
 pretty as they came in the title today 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.070
 I bring you what ever in visions of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.260
 channel is only in others and peron this is not 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.270
 is or have a two for one or two 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.680
 reviews in the same video first that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.740
 nothing will I speak to you a level that 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.770
 took to make like a few months ago 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.570
 I'm talking about gay crowe I love you 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.449
 explain that this book talks about 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.210
 brett harriss manners is a girl from 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.789
 secondary I think that yes it has 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 as a different lifestyle no longer 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.469
 prefers turtles planets and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.329
 prefer these things that one sometimes gets 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.879
 loses by walking seeing what is so 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.170
 she bore surface is all that 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.809
 has to do with the world of fashion 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.959
 then one of these days in harriet is going to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.449
 an excursion that curiously is of 

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:57.440
 excursions in a shopping center 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.780
 scout discovers harris 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.280
 and he wants harriet in the world of 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.070
 fashion because he sees it with great potential 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.049
 and it's going to be the future icon model of 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.440
 all the brands that you know and that 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.680
 I may not know, but anyway 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.450
 tell them that harriet feels 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.950
 maladjusted because they make you bullying and 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.330
 nobody wants around the world 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.759
 rejects then she sees it as a 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.610
 opportunity to change here the 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.320
 question is harris needs to change her 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.659
 he has to do it with his personality 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.630
 so everyone will accept it or something like that 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.880
 this book has been one of the most books 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.280
 funny that I read because ok this 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.740
 protagonist has an incredible humor 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.990
 fantastic even though it feels like 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.240
 rejected and nothing maladjusted because it is 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.759
 a diet is a pretty curious book 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.460
 they have very interesting data things that 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.960
 I did not even know about the planet of 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.550
 human body in things so of 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.289
 Suddenly it's already here, not because they're 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.289
 nervous and starts to say physics 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.979
 as to make problems with the one of the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.080
 life with that data and it kills me 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.790
 laugh because I usually do not like that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.580
 serious but I usually say this 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.110
 meaningless things many times I think that 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.060
 I gave him four out of five stars 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.920
 I remember very well but I recommend it 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.739
 if they want and need a reading 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.260
 cool light and fun and if they want 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.790
 have a good time here they have to crowe 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.770
 the second book that I want them 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.100
 recommend nothing to do with the first or 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.510
 it is totally a different genre 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.000
 is written by a Mexican author and 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.620
 is under the ocean's publishing stamp 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.480
 and I'm talking about Santa Fe 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.460
 written by francisco j curtain 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.190
 ie jesucristo 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.770
 this book has impacted me 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.620
 stunned and I've read it since as a 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.380
 month and I can not with its end 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.810
 I admit that I left it like two weeks 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.540
 because I did not feel like I was hooked 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.700
 both the book and that was blocked 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.230
 I really am with many readings and 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.550
 this is not helping me much 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.530
 people who live in the district 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.930
 federal know that there is an area that 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.910
 divide the city not with the class 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.120
 art with the lower middle class and all 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.790
 them and is this division is 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.849
 my life through the door santa fe juana 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.830
 tomorrow in all the news in the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.140
 television in the newspapers and blablabla 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.180
 it is diffused that there is a girl of 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.159
 twenty-something years that is even 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.620
 committing suicide that wants to end his life 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.629
 something happened to him and he wants to winnow 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.489
 Holy Harbor Faith that is like a bridge 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.319
 so to speak when the people who 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.239
 they come the df they know it and the immigrants 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.010
 as I do not know how it is door 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.510
 holy faith truth then it seems 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.230
 firefighters begin to arrive 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.599
 police to blah blah blah and they want to 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.640
 avoid this this girl is released 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.430
 It's not very funny because 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.030
 chapters are divided between soil 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.220
 up and heaven I do not remember very well the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.500
 ground is because it talks about the life of 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.700
 the people who are below that is what 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.140
 is in the car 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.710
 the police firemen do not 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.600
 up those who are on the bridge and 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.310
 sky the people who are in the 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.890
 helicopter that are broadcasting in 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.560
 I live what is happening while the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.830
 girl is thinking if she commits suicide or 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.799
 do not commit suicide two blocks away from there 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.840
 an office is going something down there 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.300
 there is the police remembering things 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.760
 what happened to him long ago and why and for 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.419
 what is now an alcoholic up there in 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.190
 the helicopter is going through the 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.890
 ambition that the reporter has 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.720
 get this the evening news 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.480
 wants to capture that does not want you to 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.540
 Chava is released thousands thousands of 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.970
 things in a day I thought that this already 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.070
 was going to be according to what the 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.919
 girl and because you want to kill yourself and everything 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.840
 that but it 's a matter of seeing what 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.060
 happens around not that not nothing more than 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.680
 you have problems and everything has 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.480
 problems not because you have a 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.210
 problem since the world is going to end 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.770
 you have to know how to solve them if many 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.790
 Sometimes you can not solve them alone 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.890
 what to ask for help 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.670
 my conflict with this book was the 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:10.120
 spectacular and unexpected final because 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.040
 I do not know I do not know what happened I do not understand yet 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.740
 for me it is an enigma I lived things in each 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.480
 chapter between the pages because I 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.510
 thoughts about the characters arise 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.700
 they are mainly the characters 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.590
 incredibly well constructed and of 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.650
 suddenly book was very ambiguous and I 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.090
 scattered about things that happened 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.590
 but it inscribes you excellently what 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.330
 feel the people and is very father 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.710
 because it's Mexican society to the 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.840
 society that you know 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.490
 You probably have a month and more and a 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.710
 friend or a relative what you want 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.760
 we will tell you in the comments if 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.760
 I prefer option number one 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.270
 or if you prefer option number 2 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.270
 that is all 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.680
 and all the shows appear 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.409
 but the protagonist was half silly 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.399
 as long as it does not move 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:12.580
 we can continue recording but not what 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:12.580
 I get it
