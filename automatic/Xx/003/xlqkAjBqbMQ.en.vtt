that was dissolved in the water will

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.750 
that was dissolved in the water will
recrystallize<00:01:02.199> on<00:01:02.440> your<00:01:02.620> skin<00:01:02.830> before<00:01:03.580> it<00:01:03.640> can

absorbed into your skin it can't work as
an<00:01:09.490> antioxidant<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.990> see<00:01:11.230> you<00:01:11.740> need<00:01:11.890> a

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
an antioxidant you see you need a

an antioxidant you see you need a
carrier<00:01:12.400> told<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.909> vitamin<00:01:13.240> C<00:01:13.390> molecule<00:01:13.810> in

carrier told the vitamin C molecule in
the<00:01:14.290> solution<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.190> can<00:01:15.310> penetrate<00:01:15.490> into

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
the solution so it can penetrate into

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.390 
the solution so it can penetrate into
your<00:01:16.150> skin<00:01:16.270> cells<00:01:16.659> if<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.830> have<00:01:17.950> sufficient

chemistry<00:01:18.550> skills<00:01:19.120> to<00:01:19.600> grind<00:01:19.930> up<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.320> vitamin

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
chemistry skills to grind up the vitamin

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.520 
chemistry skills to grind up the vitamin
C<00:01:20.860> so<00:01:21.670> let's<00:01:22.030> take<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.240> thousand<00:01:22.900> milligrams<00:01:23.140> of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
C so let's take a thousand milligrams of

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.890 
C so let's take a thousand milligrams of
vitamin<00:01:23.680> C<00:01:24.120> put<00:01:25.120> it<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.300> mortar<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.780> with<00:01:25.870> a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
vitamin C put it the mortar and with a

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.920 
vitamin C put it the mortar and with a
pestle<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.510> grind<00:01:28.870> this<00:01:29.110> up<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.630> we<00:01:31.659> have

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
pestle going to grind this up so we have

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
pestle going to grind this up so we have
a<00:01:31.960> nice<00:01:32.350> fine<00:01:32.740> powder<00:01:32.909> which<00:01:33.909> you<00:01:34.869> can<00:01:35.049> see<00:01:35.259> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
a nice fine powder which you can see and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.910 
a nice fine powder which you can see and
if<00:01:36.909> you<00:01:37.329> use<00:01:37.540> a<00:01:37.780> carrier<00:01:38.170> like<00:01:38.500> propylene

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
if you use a carrier like propylene

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.190 
if you use a carrier like propylene
glycol<00:01:39.430> or<00:01:39.490> glycerin<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.780> know<00:01:40.960> how<00:01:41.140> to

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
glycol or glycerin and you know how to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.810 
glycol or glycerin and you know how to
calculate<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:42.070> measure<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.430> amount<00:01:42.700> of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
ascorbic acid you need you can then

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.160 
ascorbic acid you need you can then
solubilize<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.060> mix<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.570> properly<00:01:46.930> that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
want to use the ester form of vitamin C

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.520 
want to use the ester form of vitamin C
not<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.220> acid<00:02:21.550> form<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.810> advantages<00:02:23.380> to

not the acid form the advantages to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.100 
not the acid form the advantages to
esters<00:02:23.920> are<00:02:24.070> first<00:02:24.910> because<00:02:25.630> they're<00:02:25.840> fat

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
esters are first because they're fat

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.170 
esters are first because they're fat
soluble<00:02:26.500> they<00:02:27.010> much<00:02:27.280> better<00:02:27.520> penetrate<00:02:28.060> the

soluble they much better penetrate the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.780

lipid<00:02:28.510> barrier<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:29.140> your<00:02:29.410> skin<00:02:29.790> second

they're<00:02:31.270> not<00:02:31.420> acidic<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:31.900> they<00:02:31.990> tend<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.260> be

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
they're not acidic so they tend to be

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.520 
they're not acidic so they tend to be
much<00:02:32.860> less<00:02:33.100> irritating<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.880> third<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:35.170> fatty

groups<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.129> esters<00:02:36.489> increase<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
groups on the esters increase the

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.690 
groups on the esters increase the
stability<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.349> vitamin<00:02:38.709> C<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:39.459> not

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
stability of the vitamin C so it's not
