00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
except for the fact that the detail was

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.959 
except for the fact that the detail was
actually<00:00:13.200> pretty<00:00:13.530> amazing<00:00:13.769> but<00:00:14.219> it's<00:00:14.790> just

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
actually pretty amazing but it's just

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.060 
actually pretty amazing but it's just
little<00:00:15.299> things<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.599> little<00:00:15.929> bolts<00:00:16.320> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
little things like little bolts and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.779 
little things like little bolts and
screws<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:18.270> little<00:00:18.570> battery<00:00:18.840> pack<00:00:19.250> um<00:00:20.250> this

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
screws and a little battery pack um this

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.040 
screws and a little battery pack um this
is<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> force<00:00:21.570> effects<00:00:21.869> lightsaber<00:00:22.880> so

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
is not a force effects lightsaber so

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.170 
is not a force effects lightsaber so
excuse<00:00:25.050> me<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.859> does<00:00:25.980> not<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.820> much

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
excuse me so it does not have as much

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.779 
excuse me so it does not have as much
detail<00:00:27.480> or<00:00:27.869> gloss<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.220> whole<00:00:29.460> part

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
detail or gloss to it on the whole part

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.089 
detail or gloss to it on the whole part
and<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.420> does<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.949> much

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and it does not really have that much

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.209 
and it does not really have that much
quality<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.180> shine<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> force

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
quality of a shine like how the force

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.990 
quality of a shine like how the force
effects<00:00:35.550> does<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> basically<00:00:37.850> here's<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
effects does so basically here's the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
effects does so basically here's the
turn<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.300> switch<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.530> press<00:00:40.710> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
turn on switch right here you press it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.470 
turn on switch right here you press it
and<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.390> whole<00:00:42.629> place<00:00:42.960> lights<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:44.030> 64<00:00:45.030> LEDs

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and the whole place lights up 64 LEDs

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.610 
and the whole place lights up 64 LEDs
and<00:00:46.670> it<00:00:47.670> has<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> 64<00:00:48.660> blue<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.469> red<00:00:49.649> LEDs<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> if

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and it has a 64 blue and red LEDs so if

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.950 
and it has a 64 blue and red LEDs so if
you<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.920> turn<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:54.030> press<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:54.449> here

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.139 

looks<00:00:57.960> pretty<00:00:58.050> nice<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> dark<00:01:00.000> it

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
looks pretty nice but and the dark it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.020 
looks pretty nice but and the dark it
looks<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:01.140> nice<00:01:02.030> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
looks actually really really nice you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.630 
looks actually really really nice you
could<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> while<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.309> could<00:01:05.460> see

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
could see but for a while you could see

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
could see but for a while you could see
the<00:01:06.170> LEDs<00:01:07.170> spacings<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.790> that's<00:01:09.689> kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the LEDs spacings so that's kind of a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.219 
the LEDs spacings so that's kind of a
downfall<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.040> um<00:01:11.689> do<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.869> two<00:01:13.080> ways

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
downfall to it um do you have two ways

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.140 
downfall to it um do you have two ways
of<00:01:13.409> switching<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> from<00:01:14.100> blue<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.729> red<00:01:14.909> or<00:01:15.030> red

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
of switching it from blue to red or red

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.590 
of switching it from blue to red or red
to<00:01:15.299> blue<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.380> turn<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> off<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.420> unlike<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
to blue you turn it off and unlike the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
to blue you turn it off and unlike the
other<00:01:18.830> ultimate<00:01:19.830> effects<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.820> force

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
other ultimate effects is or the force

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.510 
other ultimate effects is or the force
effects<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.049> does<00:01:22.259> not<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.920> power<00:01:23.189> down

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
effects it does not have the power down

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.800 
effects it does not have the power down
effect<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:25.350> guess<00:01:26.009> fades<00:01:26.220> away

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
effect it just I guess fades away

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.789 
effect it just I guess fades away
um<00:01:28.520> that's<00:01:29.520> another<00:01:29.790> way<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.030> turn<00:01:30.360> um<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.650> blue

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
um that's another way to turn um to blue

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.700 
um that's another way to turn um to blue
to<00:01:31.920> red<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> red<00:01:33.960> lightsaber<00:01:34.350> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to red so is it the red lightsaber you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.429 
to red so is it the red lightsaber you
can<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> LEDs<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> little<00:01:36.479> bit<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.960> camera

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
can see the LEDs a little bit on camera

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.319 
can see the LEDs a little bit on camera
but<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.920> person<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.030> see<00:01:39.180> those

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
but and person you can see those

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.550 
but and person you can see those
spacings<00:01:40.939> where<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> blue<00:01:42.240> et's<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
spacings where the blue et's are in the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.490 
spacings where the blue et's are in the
red<00:01:43.860> LEDs<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.930> want<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> turn<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
red LEDs are so if you want to turn it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.969 
red LEDs are so if you want to turn it
off

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
