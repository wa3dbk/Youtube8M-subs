00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.280 
cross between a cream and a hair grease
it<00:01:12.240> has<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.080> consistency<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:15.810> doesn't

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it has that consistency that it doesn't

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
it has that consistency that it doesn't
see<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.650> doesn't<00:01:16.980> really<00:01:17.160> melt<00:01:17.580> down<00:01:19.160> but<00:01:20.160> it

see it doesn't really melt down but it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.620 
see it doesn't really melt down but it
does<00:01:21.140> kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.820> disappear<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.450> don't

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
does kind of disappear if that I don't

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.680 
does kind of disappear if that I don't
know<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.930> makes<00:01:25.140> sense<00:01:25.230> but<00:01:26.090> if<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
know if that makes sense but if it's a

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.240 
know if that makes sense but if it's a
cream<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.470> an<00:01:28.830> oil<00:01:29.070> together<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:31.770> definitely

overbearing it's more like greasy to the

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.000 
overbearing it's more like greasy to the

type<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.250> Sheen<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.910> don't<00:03:09.090> know<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.299> can

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
type of Sheen I don't know if you can

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
type of Sheen I don't know if you can
tell<00:03:09.690> here<00:03:10.470> but<00:03:10.680> my<00:03:10.769> hair<00:03:11.010> has<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.519> sheen<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:12.120> it

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
tell here but my hair has a sheen to it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:22.849 
tell here but my hair has a sheen to it
and<00:03:14.239> also<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:16.590> has<00:03:20.959> but<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.079> does<00:03:22.319> provide

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
and also it has but it does provide

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.069 
and also it has but it does provide
moisture<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.239> think<00:03:24.510> that's<00:03:24.750> why<00:03:25.019> my<00:03:25.350> hair

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
moisture and I think that's why my hair

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.640 
moisture and I think that's why my hair
holds<00:03:28.079> its<00:03:28.260> definition<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.430> well<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.870> use<00:03:31.470> this

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
on both wet and dry hair I use it right

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.650 
on both wet and dry hair I use it right
after<00:03:34.889> I<00:03:35.220> wash<00:03:35.459> my<00:03:35.700> hair<00:03:35.850> watching<00:03:36.389> Duke

getting<00:05:56.210> frizzy<00:05:56.660> and<00:05:57.080> that's<00:05:57.650> why<00:05:57.860> I'm<00:05:58.100> that's

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640

why<00:05:58.820> I<00:05:58.880> keep<00:05:59.120> saying<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.690> it's<00:05:59.900> definitely<00:06:00.260> a

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
why I keep saying that it's definitely a

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.480 
why I keep saying that it's definitely a
cross<00:06:00.800> between<00:06:01.040> an<00:06:01.580> oil<00:06:02.360> and<00:06:02.900> a<00:06:03.590> cream<00:06:03.919> because

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
cross between an oil and a cream because

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.540 
cross between an oil and a cream because
the<00:06:04.760> oil<00:06:05.000> definitely<00:06:05.960> keeps<00:06:06.919> the<00:06:07.490> frizzy<00:06:08.090> away

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
the oil definitely keeps the frizzy away

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.060 
the oil definitely keeps the frizzy away
