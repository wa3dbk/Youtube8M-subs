00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
I don't think so this might be a first

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.320 
I don't think so this might be a first
time<00:02:07.440> ever<00:02:07.620> and<00:02:09.410> they<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.619> painted<00:02:11.100> his

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
time ever and they just painted his

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.120 
time ever and they just painted his
torso<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.990> looks<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.970> green

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
torso it looks like the the green

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.310 
torso it looks like the the green
there's<00:02:17.130> not<00:02:17.640> actually<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.090> shirt<00:02:18.390> there<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.050> in

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
there's not actually a shirt there so in

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.280 
there's not actually a shirt there so in
person<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.890> looks<00:02:20.070> kind<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.490> odd<00:02:21.080> looks<00:02:22.080> like

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
person it looks kind of odd looks like

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.190 
person it looks kind of odd looks like
the<00:02:22.470> tightest<00:02:22.950> shirt<00:02:23.610> ever<00:02:23.910> made<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.540> think

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the tightest shirt ever made I think

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.290 
the tightest shirt ever made I think
this<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> new<00:02:25.709> sculpt<00:02:26.040> I'm<00:02:26.459> not<00:02:26.880> entirely

of course and whatever be back to the
figure<00:03:24.690> itself<00:03:25.310> it's<00:03:26.310> really<00:03:27.200> interesting

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
figure itself it's really interesting

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.199 
figure itself it's really interesting
because<00:03:30.739> it's<00:03:31.820> $12.99

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
because it's $12.99

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.759 
because it's $12.99
that's<00:03:33.480> how<00:03:33.600> much<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.810> these<00:03:33.900> retail<00:03:34.290> for<00:03:34.320> and

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
that's how much to these retail for and

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.570 
that's how much to these retail for and
they're<00:03:35.640> definitely<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.239> mix<00:03:36.780> between<00:03:37.580> elites

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
they're definitely a mix between elites

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.750 
they're definitely a mix between elites
and<00:03:39.470> basics<00:03:40.470> because<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:41.010> have<00:03:41.220> some<00:03:41.459> bonus

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
and basics because you have some bonus

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.509 
and basics because you have some bonus
articulation<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.620> basics<00:03:44.040> don't<00:03:44.280> have

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
articulation that the basics don't have

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.590 
articulation that the basics don't have
and<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.790> got<00:03:45.299> some<00:03:45.600> articulation<00:03:46.049> that<00:03:47.600> seems

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
and you got some articulation that seems

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.900 
and you got some articulation that seems
like<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.780> basic<00:03:49.200> like<00:03:49.769> it's<00:03:49.920> basic<00:03:50.370> completely

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
like a basic like it's basic completely

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.810 
like a basic like it's basic completely
except<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.140> legs<00:03:52.380> how<00:03:52.650> they<00:03:52.769> can<00:03:52.950> move

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
except for the legs how they can move

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.610 
except for the legs how they can move
like<00:03:54.030> that

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.070 

the<00:03:57.400> only<00:03:57.640> problem<00:03:58.120> I'm<00:03:58.300> seeing<00:03:58.660> with<00:03:58.840> some<00:03:59.020> of

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
the only problem I'm seeing with some of

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.770 
the only problem I'm seeing with some of
the<00:03:59.170> articulation<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.980> as<00:04:00.099> you<00:04:00.280> just<00:04:00.430> saw

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
the articulation is as you just saw

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.089 
the articulation is as you just saw
sometimes<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.930> try<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.260> move<00:04:02.349> something<00:04:02.709> and

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
sometimes you try and move something and

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.339 
sometimes you try and move something and
a<00:04:03.610> part<00:04:03.880> falls<00:04:04.150> off<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:07.180> I'm<00:04:07.630> not<00:04:07.900> exactly

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
a part falls off and I'm not exactly

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.470 
a part falls off and I'm not exactly
sure<00:04:08.739> what<00:04:08.770> parts<00:04:09.400> do<00:04:09.610> come<00:04:09.819> off<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:10.150> think<00:04:10.209> it's

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
sure what parts do come off I think it's

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.220 
sure what parts do come off I think it's
just<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:11.650> arms<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:14.170> heads<00:04:15.660> whoa<00:04:16.660> look<00:04:17.169> at

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.340 
just the arms the heads whoa look at
that<00:04:17.290> peg<00:04:19.560> it's<00:04:20.560> really<00:04:20.829> interesting<00:04:21.100> huh<00:04:21.960> huh

that peg it's really interesting huh huh

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.879 
that peg it's really interesting huh huh
and<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:25.240> lot<00:04:25.450> of<00:04:25.480> these<00:04:25.720> parts<00:04:26.050> are<00:04:26.230> Lakes<00:04:26.470> super

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889

most disappointing articulation that

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.080 
most disappointing articulation that
barely<00:04:46.510> moves<00:04:46.750> at<00:04:46.960> all<00:04:47.340> can<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.550> legs<00:04:48.820> come

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
the John thena not so much especially

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.040 
the John thena not so much especially
because<00:05:08.110> he's<00:05:08.800> wearing<00:05:09.400> military<00:05:09.580> attire<00:05:10.090> but
