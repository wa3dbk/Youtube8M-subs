00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.190
 with the premiere of chapter 5 of dragon 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.500
 super ball arrived varied opinions 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.050
 regarding the animation of this chapter 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.910
 the most repeated of these was that this 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.550
 chapter had a very bad 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.009
 animation between the fight sequences 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.989
 that were held between goku and bills and 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.060
 although to a certain extent this is true 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:23.789
 It is not very different from what already 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.159
 it happened on dragon ball z with many of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.619
 the scenes between the characters from 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.019
 chapters that were extremely fine and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 detailed to chapters with scenes that 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.030
 honestly they had no comparison 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.590
 with the previous ones this yes well in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.380
 Sometimes it is used to save time 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.360
 of animation and is justifiable until 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.940
 certain point there are many factors that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.010
 contribute to this among those who 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.170
 are the cartoonists the quality of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.180
 animation of the study and the goal of 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 the distributors for example 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.960
 lately the lack of quality of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 some animals this is a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.579
 strategy of companies to do 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.220
 two versions of the animation one for 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.100
 television and another one to bluray this with 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.840
 in order to generate more income and how 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.650
 can see in the comparison of images 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.080
 who are 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.760
 the difference between the quality of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.760
 images are very noticeable 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.330
 and as it happened in several chapters 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.340
 of the dragon ball z will continue to happen 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.830
 occasionally in dragon ball super doubt 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.080
 much that much as in this chapter 5 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.450
 Well, this time if I consider it a 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.640
 little exaggeration but as you can see 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.680
 on screen different cartoonists 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.960
 that have made the characters what 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.300
 long of the dragon ball series up 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.420
 dragon ball gt have enough 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.880
 difference between the drawings some 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.820
 placing more details than others 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.090
 and others in perspective are not 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.820
 comparable to the previous 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.399
 you leave your opinion about 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.560
 this I remember that they also complained 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.560
 with the excessive delineation of chapter 4 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.740
 so they believe that the low quality of 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.200
 this chapter 5 of dragon ball super 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.060
 affects the positioning of the series 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.450
 among the 10 most watched animes of the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.450
 week 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.400
 and well this would be my opinion about 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.310
 what was the last chapter of dragon 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.990
 super ball and I hope to read yours if you 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.680
 Super ball that took me a little this time 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.930
 more than usual because I did not find 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.900
 too many curiosities in this chapter 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.970
 so I had to squeeze it as much as 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.850
 I could and equally if you do not want 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.400

 those who have already entered school as 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.090
 I 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.390
 kay osama accompanies us and nothing 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.819
 a hug breaks arms of vegueta but 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.819
 with love and until the next 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.959
 and now that we have all this we are going to 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.930
 the most powerful versions of these 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.420
 characters on the part is superman would be 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.510
 the superman one prime and lyon which is 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.030
 he spent thousands of years in the sun and he became 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.110
 a god to a certain extent is not 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.730
 Enough or omnipresent is slightly 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.680
 omnipotent since he is able to revive 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.739
 people and create super versions 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.959
 powerful of others with some DNA not 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.760
 has visible weaknesses except 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.549
 that if he is out of his universe his 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.100
 powers weaken a bit and until 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.710
 where it is known is immortal we can be 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.240
 sure that before any Superman 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.490
 of the versions previously 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.070
 mentioned of ocu could do something 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.200
 against him however there is still one 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.870
 version of eugui that if you have a 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.820
 possibility of beating him and this is the 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.820
 most powerful version of
