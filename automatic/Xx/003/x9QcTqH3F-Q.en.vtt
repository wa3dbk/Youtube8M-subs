00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.240
 we see the papal thierry I'm 38 years old I 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.950
 am military so it was I had a 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.950
 accident in the course of work so 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:42.350
 happy in life despite the handicap 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:44.840
 I have two children you see dilutive h 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.019
 10 compared to the early accident dif 1 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.510
 very good start then quite difficult and 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.590
 then now at the top 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.379
 why to impress trade winds because 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.780
 that good already I had chosen the black summer 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.760
 I did not want to already sunk them 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.890
 expensive colors are not very very pretty 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.559
 and then anyway we see still 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.900
 it's useless to hide finally let's say 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.070
 that in europe we are more focused on 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.560
 aestheticism 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.180
 gold I mean to the united states by 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.130
 example much changed by the level 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.490
 military for example and with it in 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.880
 ask too much in Afghanistan or 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.490
 Iraq 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.640
 they are not afraid of cash and finally 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.520
 to show them their disability 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.250
 so we have flashy colors or with 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.230
 tattoos or other so I 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.520
 wanted a little bit out of 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.640
 the ordinary since I have a little dog 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.200
 can some fizir of original so I 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.610
 decided already of a manor so it's already 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.100
 it's obvious what the first 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.630
 thing we say that people the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.650
 first thing that kept his lamas 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.500
 black because it's 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:54.590
 it is unusual then and then black 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.470
 on me it changes carpediem what minimum 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.990
 of the postero post which means that 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.409
 the present day as if it was the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.330
 latest 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.000
 So that is it's good just my 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.950
 leitmotiv for since with a date if 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.860
 so the saying of the 2nd in 2006 that 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.400
 corresponds the day of my accident 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.170
 why because but before I did 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.280
 when I wanted to do something 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.140
 many matches still beating a small 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.500
 little and then that's it then the accident is 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.909
 come 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.129
 and all the things that I wanted 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.110
 do where I wanted to buy back or whatever 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.580
 it's ben I could not why because 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.590
 that I was disabled I could not 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.260
 do that so now when I want 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.420
 say does something to do 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.000
 buy or 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.890
 or do I do it I do not wait 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.890
 because my opinion is too short for 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.629
 in addition to being with a disability one can 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.950
 becoming it that's what finally puts 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.139
 personally this is what is mine 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.349
 arrived but we do not realize 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:01.590
 makes it difficult for a person 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.810
 disabled can have is the ideal this 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.090
 time to stop dd precisely these 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.090
 people did not assume their disability and 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.090
 me
