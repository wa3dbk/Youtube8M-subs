00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
probably zoom in a bit on some of them

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.380 
probably zoom in a bit on some of them
but<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.560> fairness<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.060> makes<00:02:00.240> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
but in all fairness it just makes a
