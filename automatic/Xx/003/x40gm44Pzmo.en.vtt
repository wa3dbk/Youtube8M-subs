00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.840
 an original proposal in which we take 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.090
 the role of daniel garnero to which 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.880
 die was given a new job 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.670

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.829
 hordes and hordes of demon beings

 Also in charge of the PC version 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.109
 of the first gears of wars was with brad 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.820
 storm game that was published to my pc xbox 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.969
 360 and playstation3 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.120
 in the year 2011 when this study created 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.339
 a strong alliance with epic games of 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.629
 done they have been type the can fly the 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.180
 in charge of the recent 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.670
 gears of war church med for this reason 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.559
 we remember your previous work 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.409
 cross-platform an orgy of bullets and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.509
 destruction everywhere that once not 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.819
 he convinced us too much but that we 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.640
 liked it better when we gave it a second 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.710
 opportunity valet strong point 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.049
 storm were the possibilities offered 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.210
 to finish off the enemies how much 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.860
 greater was the degree of destruction and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.240
 interaction with the environment and more 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.560
 varied were our combos for 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.420
 kicking enemies allowed us 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.819
 launch them where we would like to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.409
 certain effect slowed down what we 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.390
 we give the seconds to shoot at 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.549
 pleasure or throwing them against parties 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.440
 interactives of the environment as 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.960
 example 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.180
 explosive variables or simply the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.560
 empty jars while we made them 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.810
 explode the head 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.399
 when getting the whip the possibilities 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.990
 they expanded because not only were we 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.479
 allowed us to approach towards us 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.579
 certain enemies but that even 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.320
 we can make a shake that 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.479
 we cause a big explosion then 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.110
 integrated all the nearby enemies 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.210
 to the penthouse 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.730
 in the different capsules we could go 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.289
 buying ammunition or upgrades by changing 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.450
 our points accumulated with the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.459
 deaths that we cause 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.200
 with a good variety of enemies the 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.790
 game had final bosses and 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.610
 moments of intense actions on 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.110
 vehicles highlighted the 200 scenarios 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.870
 full of possibilities 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.640
 placing the height of the 26th century the reason 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.000
 of the game was to take revenge on the general 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.680
 serrano taking the role of grayson hunt 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.260
 a soldier who likes drinking more 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.820
 that a fool a pencil inciting does not know 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.730
 see those bottles that we found 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.850
 accompanied us on our way our 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.710
 partner and without knowing who is 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.900
 they applied biomechanical parts in 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.670
 first moments of the game supporting us 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.130
 for that reason to have been remade after 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.410
 die for our desire for revenge 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.060
 both we were welded unit 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.850
 elite of the confederation of planets 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.370
 such revenge was produced by having been 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.560
 deceived by the general who hid 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.830
 the real purposes of our 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.950
 missions the story was the worst of the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.960
 simple and flat game and charisma of 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.600
 characters is not that it was a 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.300
 bomb was his gameplay what made 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.550
 this interesting product perfect for 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.540
 discharging adrenaline 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.790
 enemies to pleasure action in spades and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.680
 deaths to porrillo to which more gross is 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.160
 they made this game have a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.020
 qualification for 18 years 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.640
 a proposal that even without reaching 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.560
 lift passions or get 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.630
 scores as good as painkiller 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.870
 yes he got a very formula 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.210
 addictive very arcade very shooter of the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.760
 old school in which the story was 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:48.130
 the straight ones and in the next delivery 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.130
 we remember army of dub
