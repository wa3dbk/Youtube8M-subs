thought Frazier might have even started
with<00:01:10.680> ya<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> look<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.850> two<00:01:12.000> teams<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
NFL would still run a more pure Tampa to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.100 
NFL would still run a more pure Tampa to
scheme<00:01:15.000> that's<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> use<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> run<00:01:15.780> sort<00:01:16.049> of

a perversion of it the Vikings being one
of<00:01:17.909> them<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.150> probably<00:01:18.390> ten<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.659> those<00:01:18.750> teams

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020

the<00:01:19.439> run<00:01:19.470> basically<00:01:19.950> two<00:01:20.250> deep<00:01:20.460> type<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> stuff

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the run basically two deep type of stuff

here is the third year could be a team

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.760 
here is the third year could be a team
option<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.360> reality<00:04:28.930> for<00:04:29.080> Leslie<00:04:29.350> Frazier<00:04:29.590> is

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
option the reality for Leslie Frazier is

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.890 
option the reality for Leslie Frazier is
he<00:04:29.920> might<00:04:30.130> have<00:04:30.400> one<00:04:30.760> secure<00:04:31.300> year<00:04:31.540> left<00:04:31.780> on

he might have one secure year left on
his<00:04:31.960> contract<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.950> really<00:04:33.850> think<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.540> can

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
his contract so I really think you can

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.420 
his contract so I really think you can
look<00:04:34.750> at<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:34.930> one<00:04:35.080> or<00:04:35.170> two<00:04:35.290> ways<00:04:35.440> one<00:04:35.980> is<00:04:36.040> the

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
look at this one or two ways one is the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.010 
look at this one or two ways one is the
Vikings<00:04:36.760> are<00:04:36.850> being<00:04:37.030> really<00:04:37.390> thorough<00:04:37.660> and

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
Vikings are being really thorough and

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.420 
Vikings are being really thorough and
searching<00:04:38.380> for<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.560> defensive<00:04:38.980> coordinator

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.440 
they don't want to jump to any
conclusions<00:04:41.200> make<00:04:41.470> mistakes<00:04:41.860> or<00:04:42.120> two<00:04:43.120> and

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
conclusions make mistakes or two and

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.660 
conclusions make mistakes or two and
this<00:04:43.840> is<00:04:43.930> what<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.080> think<00:04:44.290> is<00:04:44.350> going<00:04:44.530> on<00:04:44.680> they

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
this is what I think is going on they

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.980 
this is what I think is going on they
