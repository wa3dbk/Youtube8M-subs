00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
tray we can use both the small roller

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.829 
tray we can use both the small roller
and<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.740> large<00:00:04.950> roller<00:00:05.220> in<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.609> same<00:00:05.819> pan<00:00:06.120> so

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
and I'm just going to roll right along

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.770 
and I'm just going to roll right along
this<00:00:10.980> base<00:00:11.639> I'm<00:00:11.910> only<00:00:12.059> gonna<00:00:12.269> roll<00:00:12.450> out<00:00:12.570> about

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
this base I'm only gonna roll out about

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.539 
this base I'm only gonna roll out about
two<00:00:13.019> roller<00:00:13.290> widths<00:00:13.620> right<00:00:13.860> here<00:00:14.070> maybe<00:00:14.280> one

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
two roller widths right here maybe one

two roller widths right here maybe one
or<00:00:14.700> two<00:00:15.170> quickly<00:00:16.170> brush<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.699> want<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
or two quickly brush in and I want to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.550 
or two quickly brush in and I want to
run<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.390> roller<00:00:18.690> back<00:00:18.960> over<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.410> can

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
run this roller back over and you can

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.679 
run this roller back over and you can
see<00:00:19.590> we've<00:00:19.920> got<00:00:19.949> some<00:00:20.279> nice<00:00:20.490> coverage<00:00:20.789> all<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
see we've got some nice coverage all the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.830 
see we've got some nice coverage all the
way<00:00:22.109> down<00:00:22.949> uniformly<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.449> we've<00:00:24.630> got<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
way down uniformly and we've got to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.679 
way down uniformly and we've got to
quickly<00:00:25.109> get<00:00:25.380> up<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> top<00:00:26.449> again<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.570> this

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
quickly get up to the top again in this

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.210 
quickly get up to the top again in this
case<00:00:27.930> I'm<00:00:28.199> still<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.619> use<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> ladder

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
case I'm still going to use the ladder

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.859 
case I'm still going to use the ladder
method<00:00:29.460> we'll<00:00:29.910> show<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.090> another<00:00:30.359> trick<00:00:30.660> down

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
method we'll show you another trick down

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.410 
method we'll show you another trick down
the<00:00:31.019> road<00:00:31.250> turn<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.399> roller<00:00:32.579> sideways<00:00:33.149> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the road turn my roller sideways and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.580 
the road turn my roller sideways and
just<00:00:33.600> roll<00:00:33.840> along<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.320> ceiling<00:00:36.350> move<00:00:37.350> our

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
just roll along this ceiling move our

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.950 
just roll along this ceiling move our
brush<00:00:38.160> into<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> tape<00:00:38.850> make<00:00:39.629> sure<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.870> don't

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
brush into the tape make sure we don't

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
brush into the tape make sure we don't
have<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.379> only<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.680> build<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.190> there<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.640> make

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
have not only a build up there but make

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
have not only a build up there but make
sure<00:00:41.940> we've<00:00:42.090> got<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.360> covered<00:00:42.570> well<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.200> again

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
sure we've got it covered well and again

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.170 
sure we've got it covered well and again
I'm<00:00:44.129> only<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> come<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.850> little

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
I'm only going to come out of little

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.459 
I'm only going to come out of little
ways<00:00:46.850> brushing<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.660> again<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.170> brush

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
ways brushing and see again as we brush

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.729 
ways brushing and see again as we brush
it<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.870> deteriorate<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> coverage<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.410> my

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it in we deteriorate the coverage so my

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.790 
it in we deteriorate the coverage so my
final<00:00:53.219> move<00:00:53.370> has<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:55.170> take<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> roller

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
final move has to be to take that roller

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.520 
final move has to be to take that roller
right<00:00:56.100> back<00:00:56.340> over<00:00:56.550> top<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.530> now

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
right back over top of that now

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
right back over top of that now
typically<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.190> someone's<00:00:59.670> brushing<00:01:00.270> or

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
typically when someone's brushing or

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.399 
typically when someone's brushing or
they've<00:01:01.320> cut<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> room<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> speak

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
they've cut in the room so to speak

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.010 
they've cut in the room so to speak
prior<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.739> painting<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:06.570> start<00:01:06.869> getting

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
prior to painting and we start getting

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
prior to painting and we start getting
multiple<00:01:07.799> layers<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> paint<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.760> those<00:01:08.909> areas

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
multiple layers of paint in those areas

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
multiple layers of paint in those areas
you're<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.439> different<00:01:10.680> levels<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you're going to get different levels of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.750 
you're going to get different levels of
coverage<00:01:11.549> whether<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.119> was<00:01:12.240> rolled<00:01:12.680> brushed

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
coverage whether it was rolled brushed

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
coverage whether it was rolled brushed
brushed<00:01:14.760> enrolled<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:17.270> maybe<00:01:18.270> even<00:01:18.600> double

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
brushed enrolled and maybe even double

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
brushed enrolled and maybe even double
lap<00:01:19.110> coated<00:01:19.619> over<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.130> place<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.180> already

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
lap coated over a place that's already

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.630 
lap coated over a place that's already
dry<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.820> again<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.479> spread<00:01:24.720> our<00:01:24.960> paint<00:01:25.640> we

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
dry and again so we spread our paint we

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.899 
dry and again so we spread our paint we
want<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> quickly<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.630> lightly<00:01:28.729> blend<00:01:29.729> this

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
want to quickly and lightly blend this

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.800 
want to quickly and lightly blend this
into<00:01:30.180> our<00:01:30.420> wet<00:01:30.630> paint<00:01:30.900> behind<00:01:31.110> us<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
into our wet paint behind us and the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
into our wet paint behind us and the
final<00:01:34.229> thing<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.829> lay<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> roller<00:01:35.310> on

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
final thing is just to lay the roller on

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.730 
final thing is just to lay the roller on
the<00:01:35.640> wall<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.970> gently<00:01:36.329> let<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.720> roll<00:01:37.229> down<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the wall and gently let it roll down the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.929 
the wall and gently let it roll down the
wall<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.430> we're<00:01:38.579> starting<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
wall and you can see we're starting to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.280 
wall and you can see we're starting to
get<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.119> little<00:01:39.240> sticky<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.020> starting

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
get a little sticky here it's starting

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.560 

really<00:01:46.470> fighting<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> coverage

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.940 

and<00:01:52.570> I'm<00:01:52.689> gonna<00:01:52.840> grab<00:01:53.020> some<00:01:53.049> more<00:01:53.350> paint<00:01:53.649> lay

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.740 
down and spreading through that so one
roller<00:01:59.110> with<00:01:59.640> top<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.850> bottom<00:02:01.030> that's<00:02:01.420> about<00:02:01.689> a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
roller with top to bottom that's about a

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.420 
roller with top to bottom that's about a
roller<00:02:02.020> full<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.530> you're<00:02:02.619> getting<00:02:02.920> about<00:02:03.189> the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
roller full and you're getting about the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.240 
roller full and you're getting about the
proper<00:02:03.820> amount<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.720> paint<00:02:05.020> again<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:06.159> we'll

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
proper amount of paint again and we'll

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.960 
proper amount of paint again and we'll
spread<00:02:06.520> this<00:02:06.759> a<00:02:06.789> couple<00:02:07.210> times<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:09.310> gonna<00:02:09.550> lay

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
spread this a couple times I'm gonna lay

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.410 
spread this a couple times I'm gonna lay
my<00:02:10.000> roller<00:02:10.590> slightly<00:02:11.590> over<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.950> last<00:02:12.360> area<00:02:13.360> we

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
my roller slightly over the last area we

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.110 
my roller slightly over the last area we
smooth<00:02:13.920> let<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> roller<00:02:15.220> travel<00:02:15.819> down<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
smooth let the roller travel down the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.770 
smooth let the roller travel down the
wall<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.510> its<00:02:16.630> own<00:02:16.810> weight<00:02:18.390> blend<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.569> in

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
wall and its own weight blend that in

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.040 
wall and its own weight blend that in
and<00:02:20.760> again<00:02:21.760> now<00:02:21.940> we<00:02:22.000> got<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.330> keep<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.750> wet

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
and again now we got to keep this wet

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.699 
and again now we got to keep this wet
and<00:02:23.230> moving<00:02:24.630> here's<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.720> point<00:02:25.989> here<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.440> left

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
and moving here's a point here I left

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.680 
and moving here's a point here I left
this<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.950> little<00:02:27.310> heavy<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.880> area<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.480> we

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
this a little heavy in this area so we

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.530 
this a little heavy in this area so we
want<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> watch<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:29.680> this<00:02:30.340> final<00:02:31.180> smooth

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
want to watch that on this final smooth

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.059 
want to watch that on this final smooth
will<00:02:31.959> be<00:02:32.080> putting<00:02:32.380> paint<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:32.769> here<00:02:32.980> again

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
will be putting paint back here again

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.949 
will be putting paint back here again
but<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.459> don't<00:02:33.640> want<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.819> leave<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.209> heavy

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
but we don't want to leave that heavy

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.130 
but we don't want to leave that heavy
where<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.350> can<00:02:35.500> dry<00:02:36.150> at<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.390> same<00:02:37.630> time<00:02:37.959> we

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
where it can dry at the same time we

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.930 
where it can dry at the same time we
don't<00:02:38.260> want<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.620> try<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.860> get<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.400> real<00:02:39.640> in

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
don't want to try to get this real in

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.520 
don't want to try to get this real in
here<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.450> blend<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.930> because<00:02:41.290> we're<00:02:41.440> gonna

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
here to blend in because we're gonna

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.030 
here to blend in because we're gonna
have<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.830> same<00:02:42.100> problem<00:02:43.080> with<00:02:44.080> drying<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:44.950> we

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
have the same problem with drying so we

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.250 
have the same problem with drying so we
want<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.250> put<00:02:45.370> plenty<00:02:45.549> of<00:02:45.700> paint<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.120> there<00:02:46.330> you

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
know I've got my small roller full we'll

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.220 
know I've got my small roller full we'll
roll<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.110> little<00:02:50.260> bit<00:02:50.500> out<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:50.890> ceiling

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
roll a little bit out on the ceiling

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.350 
roll a little bit out on the ceiling
roll<00:02:53.230> through<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.680> get<00:02:54.010> our<00:02:54.220> good<00:02:54.819> coverage

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
roll through to get our good coverage

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.069 
roll through to get our good coverage
again<00:02:57.180> I'll<00:02:58.180> do<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.420> same<00:02:58.660> thing<00:02:58.900> at<00:02:58.989> the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
again I'll do the same thing at the

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:07.780 
again I'll do the same thing at the
bottom

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.180 

brushing<00:03:09.170> covering<00:03:10.170> up<00:03:10.319> that<00:03:10.349> slick<00:03:10.830> brushed

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
brushing covering up that slick brushed

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.619 
brushing covering up that slick brushed
texture<00:03:14.209> they<00:03:15.209> are<00:03:15.330> small<00:03:15.690> roller<00:03:15.930> down<00:03:17.629> and

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
texture they are small roller down and

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.809 
texture they are small roller down and
again<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.500> where<00:03:19.709> we<00:03:19.830> talk<00:03:20.069> about<00:03:20.129> boy<00:03:20.670> it

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
again this is where we talk about boy it

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.360 
again this is where we talk about boy it
would<00:03:20.910> be<00:03:21.000> great<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.569> second<00:03:22.110> person

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
would be great to have a second person

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.330 
would be great to have a second person

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
when you're doing this one person could

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.270 
when you're doing this one person could
do<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.580> high<00:03:26.760> end<00:03:26.970> low<00:03:27.120> cut<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.040> again<00:03:29.040> all

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
do the high end low cut in and again all

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.370 
do the high end low cut in and again all
this<00:03:29.519> paint<00:03:29.849> is<00:03:30.000> just<00:03:30.030> flowing<00:03:30.450> nice<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.080> wet

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.690 

spreading<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.500> paint<00:03:37.160> two<00:03:38.160> or<00:03:38.280> three<00:03:38.459> times

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
spreading the paint two or three times

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.910

in<00:03:38.910> between<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.450> spread<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.080> uniformly<00:03:40.680> and

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
in between it spread it uniformly and

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.640 
in between it spread it uniformly and
then<00:03:41.580> just<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.060> very<00:03:42.540> slight<00:03:42.900> overlap<00:03:43.349> at<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
then just a very slight overlap at the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.250 
then just a very slight overlap at the
last<00:03:43.950> smooth<00:03:44.489> area<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:47.340> again<00:03:48.110> about<00:03:49.110> a

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
last smooth area and again about a

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.240 
last smooth area and again about a
roller<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.069> half<00:03:50.220> wide<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.549> smooth<00:03:52.250> now

roller and a half wide and smooth now

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.360 
roller and a half wide and smooth now
you<00:03:53.310> notice<00:03:53.670> when<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:53.849> take<00:03:54.150> my<00:03:54.180> roller<00:03:54.930> out<00:03:55.380> of

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
you notice when I take my roller out of

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.370 
you notice when I take my roller out of
the<00:03:56.459> tray<00:03:56.760> I'm<00:03:57.299> going<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.510> momentarily<00:03:58.019> hold

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
the tray I'm going to momentarily hold

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.319 
the tray I'm going to momentarily hold
that<00:03:58.500> roller<00:03:58.739> vertically<00:03:59.400> this<00:04:00.090> will

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
that roller vertically this will

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.970 
that roller vertically this will
minimize<00:04:00.480> drips<00:04:01.110> as<00:04:01.349> you're<00:04:01.470> going<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.799> the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
minimize drips as you're going to the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.289 
minimize drips as you're going to the
wall<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:04.319> we<00:04:04.349> just<00:04:04.650> hold<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.099> vertically<00:04:05.489> go<00:04:06.239> to

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
wall so we just hold it vertically go to

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.940 
wall so we just hold it vertically go to
the<00:04:06.450> center<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.900> wall<00:04:07.110> release<00:04:07.709> that

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
the center of the wall release that

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.819 
the center of the wall release that
paint<00:04:08.280> place<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:09.000> paint<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.599> then<00:04:10.590> just

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
paint place that paint and then just

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.190 
paint place that paint and then just
spread<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:12.200> very<00:04:13.200> uniformly<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.190> evenly

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
spread that very uniformly and evenly

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.690 
spread that very uniformly and evenly
now<00:04:16.200> you'll<00:04:16.380> notice<00:04:16.799> I've<00:04:17.010> got<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.310> two-inch

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
now you'll notice I've got the two-inch

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.640 
now you'll notice I've got the two-inch
tape<00:04:17.970> on<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.269> ceiling<00:04:18.750> I've<00:04:18.870> been<00:04:19.079> bumping<00:04:19.500> it

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
tape on the ceiling I've been bumping it

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.400 
tape on the ceiling I've been bumping it
as<00:04:20.100> long<00:04:20.459> as<00:04:20.669> we<00:04:20.789> don't<00:04:20.970> hit<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.479> too<00:04:21.840> hard<00:04:21.870> I

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
as long as we don't hit it too hard I

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.800 
as long as we don't hit it too hard I
can<00:04:22.560> actually<00:04:22.740> let<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.250> touch<00:04:23.520> lightly<00:04:23.910> and

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
can actually let that touch lightly and

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.150 
can actually let that touch lightly and
it's<00:04:24.990> putting<00:04:25.229> me<00:04:25.320> real<00:04:25.590> close<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
it's putting me real close to the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.670 
it's putting me real close to the
ceiling<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.900> we<00:04:28.110> can<00:04:28.260> see<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.560> we're

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
ceiling and we can see that we're

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.430 
ceiling and we can see that we're
getting<00:04:28.919> very<00:04:29.220> decent<00:04:29.700> coverage<00:04:30.060> here<00:04:30.440> and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
getting very decent coverage here and

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.379 
getting very decent coverage here and
again<00:04:31.860> we<00:04:32.070> compare<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.639> to<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.910> coverage<00:04:33.240> we

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
again we compare that to the coverage we

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.980 
again we compare that to the coverage we
get<00:04:34.100> with<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.130> brush<00:04:35.490> cut<00:04:35.789> in<00:04:36.030> it's<00:04:36.600> just<00:04:36.690> no

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
get with a brush cut in it's just no

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.380 
get with a brush cut in it's just no
comparison
