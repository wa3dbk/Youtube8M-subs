hey Jonathan here in this video I want

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.340 
hey Jonathan here in this video I want
to<00:00:02.070> give<00:00:02.280> you<00:00:02.490> one<00:00:02.820> drill<00:00:03.179> that's<00:00:03.689> going<00:00:04.020> to

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
to give you one drill that's going to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.249 
to give you one drill that's going to
help<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.920> increase<00:00:05.670> your<00:00:05.819> jump<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.629> enable

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
help you increase your jump and enable

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.430 
help you increase your jump and enable
you<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.410> run<00:00:07.799> faster<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:09.150> think<00:00:09.450> about<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
you to run faster so think about a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.980 
you to run faster so think about a
couple<00:00:11.010> months<00:00:11.190> from<00:00:11.340> now<00:00:11.660> when<00:00:12.660> you're<00:00:12.870> doing

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
couple months from now when you're doing

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.299 
couple months from now when you're doing
some<00:00:13.259> sprints<00:00:13.620> where<00:00:13.740> you're<00:00:13.860> going<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
some sprints where you're going for a

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.330 
some sprints where you're going for a
jump<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.880> you're<00:00:15.599> able<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.440> sprint<00:00:17.010> even

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
jump and you're able to sprint even

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.400 
jump and you're able to sprint even
faster<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.690> jump<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.109> maybe<00:00:19.260> you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
faster and get that jump that maybe you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.380 
faster and get that jump that maybe you
don't<00:00:19.560> quite<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.160> yet<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:21.029> then<00:00:21.240> you'll

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
don't quite have yet but then you'll

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.060 
don't quite have yet but then you'll
after<00:00:21.990> these<00:00:22.170> next<00:00:22.410> couple<00:00:22.650> months<00:00:22.740> will<00:00:22.949> have

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
after these next couple months will have

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.519 
after these next couple months will have
the<00:00:23.160> power<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:24.090> your<00:00:24.210> jump<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.840> get<00:00:25.109> further

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the power with your jump to get further

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.410 
the power with your jump to get further
and<00:00:26.160> get<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.490> maybe<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.849> precision<00:00:27.180> that

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
and get that maybe that precision that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.089 
and get that maybe that precision that
you're<00:00:27.570> trying<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.560> maybe<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:28.980> up

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
you're trying to get or maybe get up

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.890 
you're trying to get or maybe get up
that<00:00:29.279> wall<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.699> you're<00:00:29.820> trying<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.269> get<00:00:30.420> that

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that wall that you're trying to get that

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.990 
that wall that you're trying to get that
you<00:00:30.990> haven't<00:00:31.349> developed<00:00:31.619> yet<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.550> maybe<00:00:32.790> you

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
you haven't developed yet or maybe you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.720 
you haven't developed yet or maybe you
want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.510> increase<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:34.230> jump<00:00:34.590> four<00:00:34.770> flips<00:00:35.070> so

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
want to increase your jump four flips so

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.280 
want to increase your jump four flips so
this<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.239> another<00:00:36.480> drill<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.960> help<00:00:37.079> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
this is another drill that can help you

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.690 
this is another drill that can help you
maybe<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.739> you're<00:00:37.890> trying<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> get<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> backflip

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
maybe if you're trying to get a backflip

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.830 
maybe if you're trying to get a backflip
you<00:00:38.850> don't<00:00:39.030> feel<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> height

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you don't feel like you have the height

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.110 
you don't feel like you have the height
in<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.079> drunk<00:00:40.469> yet<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.430> order<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
this will help you get higher with your

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950 
this will help you get higher with your
jump<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.180> back<00:00:45.360> look<00:00:45.719> this

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
jump so you can get that back look this

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.900 
jump so you can get that back look this
is<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> simple<00:00:46.350> drill<00:00:46.530> me<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:46.770> brother<00:00:47.010> picked

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
is a simple drill me my brother picked

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
we were just a trained soccer a lot and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.420 
we were just a trained soccer a lot and
this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> drills<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.250> would

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
this is one of the drills that we would

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.400 
this is one of the drills that we would
do<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:54.000> order<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> increase<00:00:54.629> our<00:00:54.840> sprint<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
do in order to increase our sprint and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.610 
do in order to increase our sprint and
our<00:00:55.829> jump<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.730> soccer<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.020> drill<00:00:58.260> all<00:00:58.469> we

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
our jump in soccer for this drill all we

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.529 
our jump in soccer for this drill all we
need<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.070> find<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.460> hill<00:00:59.670> like<00:01:00.210> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
need to do is find a hill like this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420 
need to do is find a hill like this
something<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.710> an<00:01:01.800> incline<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.190> what

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
something we can do an incline and what

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.200 
something we can do an incline and what
we're<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.850> we're<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> do

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
we're gonna do is we're going to do

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.649 
we're gonna do is we're going to do
Sprint's<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.710> walk<00:01:05.549> back<00:01:05.850> down<00:01:05.880> we're

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
Sprint's up and walk back down we're

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.899 
Sprint's up and walk back down we're
gonna<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.409> side<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
gonna do this in a side and what this is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
gonna do this in a side and what this is
going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.500> obviously<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> incline

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
going to do obviously with the incline

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.770 
going to do obviously with the incline
it's<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> give<00:01:11.640> us<00:01:11.729> more<00:01:11.880> resistance<00:01:12.630> so

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it's going to give us more resistance so

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's going to give us more resistance so
it's<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.320> lot<00:01:13.470> harder

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
it's going to make it a lot harder

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.530 
it's going to make it a lot harder
sprint<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.340> means<00:01:14.520> our<00:01:14.640> muscles<00:01:15.030> especially

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
sprint it means our muscles especially

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080 
sprint it means our muscles especially
the<00:01:15.840> fast<00:01:16.170> twitch<00:01:16.560> muscles<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.310> our<00:01:17.820> legs

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the fast twitch muscles and our legs

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.140 
the fast twitch muscles and our legs
that<00:01:18.360> enables<00:01:18.780> us<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.070> get<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:20.430> explosive

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that enables us to get more explosive

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
that enables us to get more explosive
power<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.570> our<00:01:21.659> jumps<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.080> Sprint's<00:01:22.560> that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
power in our jumps and Sprint's that's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.560 
power in our jumps and Sprint's that's
what<00:01:23.280> we're<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.610> training<00:01:23.880> when

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
what we're going to be training when

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.730 
what we're going to be training when
we're<00:01:24.689> doing<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:24.990> Sprint's<00:01:25.290> we're<00:01:25.500> adding

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
we're doing these Sprint's we're adding

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.590 
we're doing these Sprint's we're adding
more<00:01:25.890> resistance<00:01:26.400> by<00:01:26.580> adding<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> incline

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
more resistance by adding the incline

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
more resistance by adding the incline
and<00:01:27.930> what's<00:01:28.500> great<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.820> we

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and what's great about this is that we

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.190 
and what's great about this is that we
can<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> shorter<00:01:30.900> amount<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.110> time

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
can do this in a shorter amount of time

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.719 
can do this in a shorter amount of time
but<00:01:31.439> still<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> great<00:01:32.009> workout<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
but still get a great workout and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.510 
but still get a great workout and
bicycling<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.799> turn<00:01:35.009> into<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
bicycling like this we can turn into a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.940 
bicycling like this we can turn into a
hit<00:01:36.210> training<00:01:36.720> or<00:01:37.079> high-intensity<00:01:37.470> interval

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
hit training or high-intensity interval

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.149 
hit training or high-intensity interval
training<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.329> means<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.320> burn<00:01:40.860> some

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
training so that means we can burn some

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.830 
training so that means we can burn some
fat<00:01:41.430> while<00:01:41.700> we're<00:01:41.880> doing<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.180> -<00:01:42.450> which<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
fat while we're doing this - which is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
fat while we're doing this - which is
great<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.380> trying<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.680> cut<00:01:43.860> down<00:01:43.890> at

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
great if you're trying to cut down at

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.380 
great if you're trying to cut down at
the<00:01:44.729> same<00:01:44.970> time<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:46.320> show<00:01:46.439> an<00:01:46.500> example<00:01:47.390> so

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the same time so just show an example so

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.220 
the same time so just show an example so
we<00:01:48.509> start<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> bottom<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> hill

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.260 

and<00:01:54.230> then<00:01:54.440> we<00:01:54.560> can<00:01:54.710> walk<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.190> down<00:01:55.490> or<00:01:56.000> jog

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
and then we can walk that down or jog

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.900 
and then we can walk that down or jog
back<00:01:56.540> down<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:57.170> refill<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.550> we're<00:01:58.730> going<00:01:58.880> to

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
back down I refill and we're going to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.730 
back down I refill and we're going to
repeat<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.450> over<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.930> over<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.320> we<00:02:00.440> start

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
repeat this over and over so we start

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.990 
repeat this over and over so we start
over<00:02:00.980> again<00:02:01.120> strip<00:02:03.580> build<00:02:04.580> that<00:02:04.670> explosive

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
over again strip build that explosive

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.240 
over again strip build that explosive
power<00:02:05.180> now<00:02:05.630> ideally<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.770> probably<00:02:07.040> want

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
power now ideally you probably want

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.359 
power now ideally you probably want
something<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:07.940> know<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.420> bigger<00:02:08.929> incline<00:02:09.470> but

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
something you know a bigger incline but

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.680 
something you know a bigger incline but
you<00:02:10.640> know<00:02:10.759> if<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.120> all<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.330> had<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.480> do

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
you know if this is all you had to do

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.870 
you know if this is all you had to do
this<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.530> work<00:02:13.040> fine<00:02:13.340> too

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
this is work fine too

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.970 
this is work fine too
just<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.390> little<00:02:14.540> bit<00:02:14.630> harder<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.900> get<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.140> longer

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
just a little bit harder to get a longer

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.740 
just a little bit harder to get a longer
workout<00:02:16.460> in<00:02:16.820> now<00:02:17.150> with<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.420> sprinting

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
workout in now with the sprinting

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.600 
workout in now with the sprinting
technique<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.830> want<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.040> remember<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.310> we

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
technique you want to remember that we

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.750 
technique you want to remember that we
really<00:02:20.030> want<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.810> focus<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.590> having<00:02:21.770> one<00:02:22.550> good

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
really want to focus on having one good

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.400 
really want to focus on having one good
alignment<00:02:23.270> so<00:02:23.570> we<00:02:23.690> want<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.930> back<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.320> be

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
alignment so we want the back to be

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.220 
alignment so we want the back to be
straight<00:02:24.770> when<00:02:25.490> we're<00:02:25.700> exploding<00:02:26.600> we<00:02:26.870> want<00:02:27.140> to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
straight when we're exploding we want to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.949 
straight when we're exploding we want to
use<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.470> whole<00:02:27.709> leg<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.340> our<00:02:28.970> ankle<00:02:29.360> flex<00:02:29.690> as

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
use the whole leg and our ankle flex as

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.290 
use the whole leg and our ankle flex as
we're<00:02:30.500> going<00:02:30.650> up<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.790> we're<00:02:31.970> working<00:02:32.240> the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
we're going up so that we're working the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.790 
we're going up so that we're working the
full<00:02:32.620> full<00:02:33.620> mobility<00:02:33.850> here<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.090> also<00:02:35.800> using

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
full full mobility here and also using

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.410 
full full mobility here and also using
more<00:02:36.980> muscles<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:37.610> will<00:02:37.790> enables<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.270> get

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
more muscles this will enables to get

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.840 
more muscles this will enables to get
faster<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:39.230> develop<00:02:39.560> better<00:02:39.740> form<00:02:40.160> with<00:02:40.820> our

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
faster in develop better form with our

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.390 
faster in develop better form with our
sprinting<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.420> jumping<00:02:42.160> really<00:02:43.160> want<00:02:43.310> to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
sprinting and jumping really want to

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.640 
sprinting and jumping really want to
flex<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.000> also<00:02:44.630> using<00:02:44.930> reciprocating<00:02:45.530> motion

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
flex and also using reciprocating motion

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.980 
flex and also using reciprocating motion
really<00:02:46.180> using<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.209> reciprocating<00:02:47.870> motion

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
really using that reciprocating motion

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.040 
really using that reciprocating motion
just<00:02:48.560> like<00:02:48.620> with<00:02:48.830> QM<00:02:49.190> except<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.910> running<00:02:50.240> so

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
just like with QM except with running so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.710 
just like with QM except with running so
the<00:02:51.200> opposite<00:02:51.650> leg<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.550> opposite<00:02:52.880> arm<00:02:53.090> so

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
the opposite leg and the opposite arm so

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.190 
the opposite leg and the opposite arm so
I'm<00:02:54.350> pushing<00:02:54.920> my<00:02:55.310> left<00:02:55.760> leg<00:02:55.970> up<00:02:56.150> right<00:02:56.959> arms

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
I'm pushing my left leg up right arms

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.630 
I'm pushing my left leg up right arms
going<00:02:57.440> up<00:02:57.560> too<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:59.600> this<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.590> basic<00:03:01.100> form<00:03:01.400> but

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
going up too and this is basic form but

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.880 
going up too and this is basic form but
sometimes<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.269> easy<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.810> know<00:03:03.019> before<00:03:03.440> when<00:03:03.860> I

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
sometimes it's easy I know before when I

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.830 
sometimes it's easy I know before when I
wasn't<00:03:04.190> focusing<00:03:04.519> on<00:03:04.670> sometimes<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.540> let<00:03:05.690> my

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
wasn't focusing on sometimes I let my

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.320 
wasn't focusing on sometimes I let my
form<00:03:06.140> sink<00:03:07.070> a<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.250> bit<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.030> would<00:03:08.120> cost

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
form sink a little bit and it would cost

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.810 
form sink a little bit and it would cost
me<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:09.290> my<00:03:09.440> workout<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.220> just<00:03:10.550> something<00:03:10.700> to

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
me and my workout so just something to

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.310 
me and my workout so just something to
think<00:03:10.910> about<00:03:11.120> when<00:03:11.810> you're<00:03:11.989> doing<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
think about when you're doing the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.990 
think about when you're doing the
Sprint's<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:13.040> this<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.250> great<00:03:13.519> drill<00:03:13.910> again

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
Sprint's so this is a great drill again

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.270 
Sprint's so this is a great drill again
for<00:03:14.420> increasing<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:14.989> explosive<00:03:15.320> power<00:03:15.530> with

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
for increasing that explosive power with

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.860 
for increasing that explosive power with
that<00:03:16.430> fast<00:03:16.730> twitch<00:03:17.000> muscles<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:17.750> means

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
that fast twitch muscles so that means

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.900 
that fast twitch muscles so that means
you're<00:03:17.959> gonna<00:03:18.080> be<00:03:18.170> able<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.320> jump<00:03:18.560> higher<00:03:18.620> run

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
you're gonna be able to jump higher run
