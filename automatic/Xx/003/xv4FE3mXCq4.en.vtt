reason they love the staple center was

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.970 
reason they love the staple center was
because<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.989> arena<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.559> probably

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
because you know that arena was probably

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.709 
because you know that arena was probably
doing<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.399> bad<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.329> probably<00:00:48.539> just

itself<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.689> all

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
itself do you know that you know all

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.749 
itself do you know that you know all
that<00:01:15.900> metal<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.320> whatever<00:01:16.619> all<00:01:16.799> steel<00:01:17.520> itself

that metal or whatever all steel itself

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.740 
that metal or whatever all steel itself
and<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.390> goes<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.720> show

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and you know it just just goes to show

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.240 
and you know it just just goes to show
you<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> think<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> whole

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you you know I think that the whole

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
you you know I think that the whole
reason<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:23.880> went<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> east<00:01:24.450> coast<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
reason they went to the east coast is

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
reason they went to the east coast is
here<00:01:25.049> was<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.100> izod<00:01:26.460> center<00:01:26.490> was

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
here was because the izod center was

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
here was because the izod center was
cheap<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.360> thought<00:01:28.049> when<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.320> said<00:01:28.470> their<00:01:28.590> own

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
cheap I thought when they said their own

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
cheap I thought when they said their own
east<00:01:28.920> comes<00:01:29.070> out<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> be

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
east comes out that was going to be

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.630 
east comes out that was going to be
managed<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.150> score<00:01:30.360> garden<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.280> you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
managed to score garden but you know you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.550 
managed to score garden but you know you
gotta<00:01:32.790> think<00:01:32.939> about<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.530> we

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
gotta think about it and that we that we

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.039 
gotta think about it and that we that we
is<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> budget<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.930> need

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
is on a budget there you know they need

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.240 
is on a budget there you know they need
to<00:01:37.170> save<00:01:37.320> money<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.680> guess<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.130> whole
