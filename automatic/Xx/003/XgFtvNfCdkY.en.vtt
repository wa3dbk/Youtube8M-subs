00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.390
 Hayama continues 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.140
 Would like to make a review of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.619
 Oh dear 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.420
 Please gone scattered continue I think some people say I do not need anymore 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.060
 Do you want to summarize a little now that enough 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.560
 First of all 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.740
 b of 59 round cpu 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.010
 To do 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:45.010
 I am Intel after cello 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:46.000
 In terms of the number of Hertz in'll do what's called processor to those of 1.9 ghz 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.410
 Become 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.150
 So so so 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.530
 Why inexhaustible supply 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.810
 Not so fast but well 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.580
 Because two of these are waiting 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:05.610
 I think that I think we have the power of about Wo in September 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.610
 In the benchmark test for a while I will be here 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.420
 How is it 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.550
 Maa Ma Ma Ma Ma use something somehow 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.390
 I think it's speed 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:26.979
 Well score will be ipad air score 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.979
 Nde Well just ne direction gold and say I say not like it is public opinion 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.659
 What do you say yesterday is quite limited 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:40.490
 When it comes to strong separation a child i 5 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.580
 Like I'm turbo short lucky'm not able to run this is normal process I went by car 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.200
 But 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:49.710
 Well either went to sudden because with turbo 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:55.930
 At the moment the law if there is the Tteyuu can suddenly faster 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:02:01.680
 Whether the good r 5 in that manner can be processed each early 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 I can't really do that when it comes to celeron with limited functionality 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.990
 Dirt my knowledge may be wrong though 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.569
 Virtually increase the number of cores Rena 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:19.500
 There have thought that if a little tough in me 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:24.720
 But when, tells them that it riding in fact have such I momentarily law specifically turbo at work 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.530
 I think there may not be, but it is the next graphic 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.830
 It becomes a cpn built-in 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.040
 8 Nee 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.030
 The numbers will not be written in shades and so Intel's hd graphics will be 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.130
 Hmm 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.050
 Usually I write 4000 or 5000 but it is not written, so it is 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.030
 What is not so fast 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.490
 In this etc. about certainly 2 years ago 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.240
 Because it becomes mainstream 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.250
 Graphics once 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.590
 now 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:04.599
 You should be making a model change 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:08.520
 Somewhat faster The first generation Certainly there is a guy who came out in about 2010 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:11.410
 I do not smoke If you should see wrong white version up from there 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.650
 So it will be a little faster 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.940
 To in 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.860
 Oh dear 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:23.140
 From the speed, I can use it like this 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:27.160
 The time being the game where I mean ne I do not know but I've heard the child 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.630
 Bother even this time I'm not game usually 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.170
 I registered and tried the game 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.480
 Jittery in in is better to be here in this video 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.690
 Who was a little 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.690
 I hope you can see if you think you're thinking 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.020
 Follow 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.530
 Quite well 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.250
 You can remember a lot 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.630
 very well 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.630
 That's a hut 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:04.580
 Unexpectedly moving 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.580
 I was surprised that the order was a little 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.430
 I This was surprising 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.430
 Chart screen size 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:23.480
 It becomes 15.6 inches, but resolution is 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:28.340
 1366 times 768 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:32.400
 Kedomo would you say to such by Ne Wakan in I'm has become the chain 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.190
 Here is a little bit macbook pro 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.720
 Try to arrange 90,000 sounds b 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.650
 I think some people still don't understand 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.610
 b Until 59, you have a retrospective 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.610
 Screen is 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:53.660
 I can not express small words when saying 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:58.360
 I there is a little yahoo's But I'm a Neku 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:03.510
 It should have been cut even though I'm side-by-side two 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.120
 In but the remodeling of the macbook pro is what that much of the Tteyuu 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:12.860
 It will be 1920 times 1200 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.750
 The point is that the same god can be expressed in detail 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.710
 I had to like this 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.710
 Like this 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:25.850
 There is of say Gaso 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.200
 For example, Yahoo! National Pro is able to express two large but this child's half disappears 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:33.050
 I'm gone 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:37.400
 For example , when I arranged two materials at a company etc. 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.529
 I think it's a bit tough when exchanging data with 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.460
 But with only one screen 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:46.200
 word 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.330
 If you use excel there is no such problem 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.990
 Ato 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.590
 youtube 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.370
 Also for 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.550
 Even if you take two videos 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.010
 Oh, it looks like this 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.200
 Like this 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:10.280
 If it is macbook pro if two or so is limit, it is large 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:12.460
 Even if you play around 6 youtube videos at the same time 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.560
 Is no problem 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.860
 Even if there is the fish of the Sevens of Graffps there 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:24.280
 this 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:30.889
 As it is not to play six rounds of the tube that there is usually that 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:34.370
 I guess I might have gone to my head 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:37.180
 Only it was I do not experiment 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:45.910
 In that today 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:49.160
 That wonder if not a bunch problem is to use the sides Well basically normally and Do When you attack described the 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:56.080
 I thought I could tell you 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:07:01.770
 In the field I am certain that Aso is in use now 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:04.860
 It's not the top but I think it will move closer to the hard user 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:08.249
 It's amazing after all this is my honesty 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.180
 It was hard to use 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:12.780
 It was troubled 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.770
 This is it 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.000
 ssd Kearney 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.000
 I would like to do 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:24.360
 Well maybe Day you might Some are wondering No no 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.870
 Good voice 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.480
 ssd 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.840
 I and was 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:35.490
 Some people don't use macbook air and say it 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.289
 Would it perhaps for the first time macbook air touched people probably I think was impressed 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.420
 you know 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:46.480
 Maybe it's ssd 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:50.010
 It can be faster the transfer speed by exchanging Dekirukana far in Sera minutes in the 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.010
 I want to see 

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:54.650
 In the next week 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.270
 I want to do wood 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.270
 Then the lever
