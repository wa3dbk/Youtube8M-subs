00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.780 

hi<00:00:01.560> today<00:00:02.040> we're<00:00:02.220> going<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.399> talk<00:00:02.610> about

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hi today we're going to talk about

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.460 
hi today we're going to talk about
glycol<00:00:03.600> systems<00:00:04.080> for<00:00:04.290> your<00:00:04.410> fermenters<00:00:06.470> this

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
glycol systems for your fermenters this

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.549 
glycol systems for your fermenters this
is<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.250> glycol<00:00:08.670> system<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.120> use<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.660> actually

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
is the glycol system we use is actually

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.410 
is the glycol system we use is actually
a<00:00:10.590> line<00:00:10.889> chiller<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.790> get<00:00:11.969> from<00:00:12.120> fox

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
a line chiller that we get from fox

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.390 
a line chiller that we get from fox
equipment<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.410> largest<00:00:13.769> one

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
equipment this is the largest one

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.730 
equipment this is the largest one
it's<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.759> three-quarter<00:00:15.360> horsepower<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:16.199> cost

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
it's a three-quarter horsepower I cost

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.590 
it's a three-quarter horsepower I cost
about<00:00:16.890> eighteen<00:00:17.220> hundred<00:00:17.250> dollars<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
about eighteen hundred dollars and it is

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.240 
about eighteen hundred dollars and it is
enough<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.730> chill<00:00:20.750> two<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:22.199> our<00:00:22.650> seven<00:00:23.010> barrel

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
enough to chill two of our seven barrel

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.720 
enough to chill two of our seven barrel
fermenters<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> here's<00:00:25.050> how<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.289> works<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.859> took

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
fermenters so here's how it works I took

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.950 
fermenters so here's how it works I took
some<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> insulation<00:00:27.539> off<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.840> can

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
some of the insulation off so you can

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.410 
some of the insulation off so you can
follow<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.769> path<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.939> I'm<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> go<00:00:30.269> in

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
follow the path but I'm going to go in

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.370 
follow the path but I'm going to go in
here<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:32.030> you<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.110> there's<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
here and you can see that there's a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.020 
here and you can see that there's a
continuous<00:00:34.980> pump<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:36.500> it's<00:00:37.500> pumping

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
continuous pump going on it's pumping

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.260 
continuous pump going on it's pumping
glycol<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.379> one<00:00:40.379> side<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:41.610> pumping<00:00:42.149> and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
glycol in one side and then pumping and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.840 
glycol in one side and then pumping and
then<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> comes<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.260> other<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.610> care

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
then it comes back the other so we care

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090 
then it comes back the other so we care
we<00:00:45.059> where<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.600> comes<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> pump<00:00:46.530> we

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
we where it comes out of the pump we

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.250 
we where it comes out of the pump we
follow<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.640> along<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:48.210> I'm<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> couple

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
follow it along here I'm a couple

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.990 
follow it along here I'm a couple
shutoff<00:00:49.739> valve<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.219> case<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.460> ever<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> do

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
shutoff valve in case I ever have to do

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.360 
shutoff valve in case I ever have to do
any<00:00:51.180> work<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:52.140> let<00:00:52.350> me<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.559> around<00:00:52.890> here

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
any work and then let me go around here

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.010 
any work and then let me go around here
and<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.059> come<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:55.370> too

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
and it come out too

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.400 
and it come out too
out<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> step<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.199> top

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
out to here and I'm going to step on top

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.720 
out to here and I'm going to step on top
of<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:01.710> fermenters<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.219> hopefully<00:01:02.609> not

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
of these fermenters and hopefully not

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.390 
of these fermenters and hopefully not
kill<00:01:02.940> myself<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> better<00:01:03.960> look<00:01:04.400> so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
kill myself so you get a better look so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.810 
kill myself so you get a better look so
when<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> first<00:01:06.630> comes<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.369> this<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.640> actually

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
when it first comes out this is actually

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.990 
when it first comes out this is actually
not<00:01:09.210> necessary<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> blow-off<00:01:10.760> what<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
not necessary it's a blow-off what is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.780 
not necessary it's a blow-off what is
necessary<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.430> pressure

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
necessary is that you go to a pressure

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.450 
necessary is that you go to a pressure
reducer<00:01:15.420> because<00:01:16.229> jackets<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.920> fermenters

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
reducer because jackets on fermenters

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.170 
reducer because jackets on fermenters
can't<00:01:17.820> stand<00:01:18.299> over<00:01:18.570> 15<00:01:18.990> psi<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> pressure<00:01:20.180> so

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
can't stand over 15 psi of pressure so

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420 
can't stand over 15 psi of pressure so
you<00:01:21.270> need<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.840> pressure<00:01:22.170> reducer<00:01:22.799> then

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you need to have a pressure reducer then

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
you need to have a pressure reducer then
you<00:01:23.880> need<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.930> pressure<00:01:25.860> gauge<00:01:26.450> this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you need to have a pressure gauge this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
you need to have a pressure gauge this
is<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.900> kind<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.320> bleed<00:01:28.619> valve<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.220> it's

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
is just kind of a bleed valve but it's

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.560 
is just kind of a bleed valve but it's
not<00:01:29.549> necessary<00:01:30.000> either<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> from<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
not necessary either so from there it

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.219 
not necessary either so from there it
comes<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.770> set<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> pressure<00:01:35.400> at

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
comes out I like to set the pressure at

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.980 
comes out I like to set the pressure at
at<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.530> 13<00:01:38.009> psi<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> start<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:39.960> I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
at about 13 psi to start and then I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
at about 13 psi to start and then I
continue<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.299> it<00:01:42.299> makes<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.750> loop<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:44.759> know

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
continue and it makes a loop you know

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.480 
continue and it makes a loop you know
before<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.240> returns<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.860> first<00:01:47.159> thing

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
before it returns so the first thing

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.960 
before it returns so the first thing
that<00:01:47.520> happens<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:49.110> loop<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.670> have<00:01:51.320> I

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
that happens on the loop is I have I

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
that happens on the loop is I have I
have<00:01:53.970> two<00:01:54.240> pipes<00:01:54.720> coming<00:01:55.200> off<00:01:55.350> where<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
have two pipes coming off where the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.609 
have two pipes coming off where the
glycol<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.250> go<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.939> two<00:01:57.119> fermenters<00:01:57.719> then

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
glycol can go to the two fermenters then

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.459 
glycol can go to the two fermenters then
it<00:01:58.740> continues<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.479> comes<00:02:00.719> back<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it continues on and it comes back and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.459 
it continues on and it comes back and
then<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:02.430> between<00:02:02.610> where<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.390> goes<00:02:03.869> into<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
then in between where it goes into the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.850 
then in between where it goes into the
two<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.890> matters<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.810> where<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.140> comes<00:02:07.439> back

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
two for matters and where it comes back

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.690 
two for matters and where it comes back
from<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
from the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.199 
from the
mentors<00:02:09.179> which<00:02:09.420> are<00:02:09.569> these<00:02:10.790> there's<00:02:11.790> another

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
mentors which are these there's another

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.229 
mentors which are these there's another
valve<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.930> continues<00:02:13.410> along<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.519> valve<00:02:14.910> I

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
valve that continues along this valve I

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.990 
valve that continues along this valve I
actually<00:02:15.569> start<00:02:16.080> turning<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.190> until<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.640> see

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
actually start turning it until I see

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.110 
actually start turning it until I see
that<00:02:18.030> 13<00:02:18.660> psi<00:02:19.140> go<00:02:19.379> up<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.650> 15<00:02:20.069> psi<00:02:20.310> which<00:02:20.730> causes

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that 13 psi go up to 15 psi which causes

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.790 
that 13 psi go up to 15 psi which causes
the<00:02:21.209> restriction<00:02:21.890> then<00:02:23.930> then<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.560> can

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the restriction then then it can

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.740 
the restriction then then it can
continue<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.819> this<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.330> where<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
continue and this is this is where the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.559 
continue and this is this is where the
the<00:02:28.470> glycol<00:02:29.160> comes<00:02:29.400> back<00:02:29.670> from<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.060> fermenter

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
the glycol comes back from the fermenter

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.930 
the glycol comes back from the fermenter
so<00:02:31.019> over<00:02:31.530> here<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:32.040> where<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.340> goes<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
so over here is where it goes to the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.150 
so over here is where it goes to the
bottom<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.569> fermenter<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.680> jacket

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
bottom of the fermenter in the jacket

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.979 
bottom of the fermenter in the jacket
and<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:35.819> over<00:02:36.090> here<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.450> where<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.750> comes

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
and then over here is where it comes

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.780 
and then over here is where it comes
back<00:02:37.280> before<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.430> continues<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:39.709> back<00:02:40.709> all<00:02:41.459> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
back before it continues on back all the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.600 
back before it continues on back all the
way<00:02:41.940> into<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.170> into<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.160> room<00:02:44.310> where<00:02:44.489> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
way into the into the room where the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.420 
way into the into the room where the
glycol<00:02:45.060> chiller<00:02:45.299> is<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:46.080> reason<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:47.069> this

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
glycol chiller is the reason for this

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.509 
glycol chiller is the reason for this
restriction<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.840> when<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.950> solenoid

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
restriction is that when the solenoid

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.960 
restriction is that when the solenoid
valve<00:02:50.900> pops<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:54.170> then<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.310> now<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.549> path

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
valve pops on then this is now the path

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
valve pops on then this is now the path
of<00:02:57.239> least<00:02:57.390> resistance<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:58.349> through<00:02:58.769> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
of least resistance is through the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.559 
of least resistance is through the
glycol<00:02:59.340> jacket<00:02:59.790> rather<00:03:00.000> than<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.390> line

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
glycol jacket rather than the line

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.850 
glycol jacket rather than the line
because<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.019> have<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> little<00:03:01.380> restriction

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
because we have a little restriction

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.089 
because we have a little restriction
here

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.710 

if<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.430> any<00:03:05.610> questions<00:03:06.000> email<00:03:06.239> me<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:06.630> I

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
if you have any questions email me and I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.080 
if you have any questions email me and I
can<00:03:06.750> send<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.230> diagram<00:03:07.739> let<00:03:08.730> me<00:03:08.819> show<00:03:09.030> you

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
can send you a diagram let me show you

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.020 
can send you a diagram let me show you
how<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.959> control<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.500> temperature<00:03:10.980> now<00:03:11.130> okay

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
how we control the temperature now okay

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.210 
how we control the temperature now okay
so<00:03:12.090> down<00:03:12.390> here<00:03:12.870> these<00:03:13.799> are<00:03:13.920> our<00:03:14.040> two

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
so down here these are our two

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.770 
so down here these are our two
fermenters<00:03:14.790> they're<00:03:15.060> actually<00:03:15.359> white<00:03:15.569> wine

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
fermenters they're actually white wine

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.080 
fermenters they're actually white wine
latina<00:03:16.410> tanks<00:03:16.889> which<00:03:17.400> work<00:03:17.579> great<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.030> are

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
latina tanks which work great and are

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.470 
latina tanks which work great and are
inexpensive<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.319> can<00:03:19.530> see<00:03:20.269> here's<00:03:21.269> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
inexpensive and you can see here's the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.470 
inexpensive and you can see here's the
tank<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.079> then<00:03:22.739> here<00:03:23.069> is<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.310> jacket<00:03:23.819> it's

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
tank and then here is the jacket it's

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.759 
tank and then here is the jacket it's
uninsulated<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.440> still<00:03:25.620> holds

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
uninsulated but it still holds

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.860 
uninsulated but it still holds
temperature<00:03:26.280> really<00:03:26.489> well<00:03:26.760> for<00:03:27.299> example<00:03:27.720> this

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
temperature really well for example this

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.360 
temperature really well for example this
one<00:03:28.319> over<00:03:28.620> here<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:28.829> can<00:03:29.040> see<00:03:29.190> some

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
one over here you can see some

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.860 
one over here you can see some
condensation<00:03:31.549> but<00:03:32.549> it's<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.150> finished<00:03:33.569> beer

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
condensation but it's a finished beer

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.680 
condensation but it's a finished beer
that<00:03:34.139> is<00:03:34.170> just<00:03:34.790> basically<00:03:35.790> conditioning<00:03:36.569> in

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
that is just basically conditioning in

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.610 
that is just basically conditioning in
that<00:03:36.840> tank<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.810> holding<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.930> about<00:03:40.139> 38

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
that tank and it is holding it about 38

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.069 
that tank and it is holding it about 38
degrees<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.819> these<00:03:41.910> are<00:03:42.120> our<00:03:42.209> two<00:03:42.450> two

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
degrees and these are our two two

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.449 
degrees and these are our two two
controllers<00:03:43.470> they're<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:43.950> johnson

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
controllers they're just johnson

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.599 
controllers they're just johnson
controllers<00:03:45.030> each<00:03:45.870> controller<00:03:46.440> has<00:03:46.680> two

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
controllers each controller has two

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.210 
controllers each controller has two
things<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.000> come<00:03:48.180> out<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.600> one<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.889> a

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
things that come out of it one is a

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.360 
things that come out of it one is a
small<00:03:50.940> power<00:03:51.239> source<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:52.049> is<00:03:53.040> wired

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
small power source that is wired

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.520 
small power source that is wired
directly<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.329> solenoid<00:03:54.780> valve<00:03:55.079> which<00:03:55.380> is

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
directly to the solenoid valve which is

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.190 
directly to the solenoid valve which is
attached<00:03:55.889> to<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.280> fermenter<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:57.660> other<00:03:57.840> is

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
attached to the fermenter the other is

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.770 
attached to the fermenter the other is
it<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.769> temperature<00:03:59.160> probe<00:03:59.549> that<00:04:00.209> goes<00:04:00.480> to

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
it is a temperature probe that goes to

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.530 
it is a temperature probe that goes to
the<00:04:00.900> fermenter<00:04:01.609> so<00:04:02.609> that<00:04:02.760> what<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:02.910> can<00:04:03.150> do<00:04:03.299> is

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
the fermenter so that what you can do is

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.089 
the fermenter so that what you can do is
like<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.959> see<00:04:04.109> this<00:04:04.290> one<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.739> beer

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
like you can see this one this is beer

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.819 
like you can see this one this is beer
that's<00:04:05.280> fermenting<00:04:05.819> right<00:04:06.000> now<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:07.230> if<00:04:07.650> I

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
that's fermenting right now so if I

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.580 
that's fermenting right now so if I
wanted<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.190> adjust<00:04:08.609> it<00:04:08.819> I'll<00:04:09.239> click<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:10.470> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
wanted to adjust it I'll click it to the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.599 
wanted to adjust it I'll click it to the
setpoint<00:04:10.829> which<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.340> have<00:04:11.549> it's<00:04:11.730> 70<00:04:12.359> degrees<00:04:13.609> so

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
setpoint which I have it's 70 degrees so

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:15.920 
setpoint which I have it's 70 degrees so
that<00:04:14.880> if<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.209> temperature<00:04:15.690> during

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
that if the temperature during

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.819 
that if the temperature during
fermentation<00:04:16.410> goes<00:04:17.070> up<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.700> 70<00:04:18.180> or<00:04:18.299> 71<00:04:18.720> then<00:04:19.650> it

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
fermentation goes up to 70 or 71 then it

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.130 
fermentation goes up to 70 or 71 then it
clicks<00:04:20.130> on<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:21.090> solenoid<00:04:21.359> valve<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:21.930> allows

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
clicks on the solenoid valve and allows

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.399 
clicks on the solenoid valve and allows
glycol<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.770> go

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
glycol to go

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:24.570 
glycol to go
which<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.740> what's<00:04:23.949> happening<00:04:24.009> here<00:04:24.460> that's

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
which is what's happening here that's

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.610 
which is what's happening here that's
why<00:04:24.759> you<00:04:24.819> see<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.090> light<00:04:25.330> so<00:04:25.990> if<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:26.169> wanted<00:04:26.560> to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
why you see a light so if I wanted to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.100 
why you see a light so if I wanted to
chill<00:04:26.979> this<00:04:27.219> I<00:04:27.460> would<00:04:27.610> push<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:28.419> like<00:04:28.569> this

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
chill this I would push it like this

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.580 
chill this I would push it like this
and<00:04:29.620> let's<00:04:30.340> say<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.490> go<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.699> sixty<00:04:31.180> five<00:04:31.590> sixty

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
and let's say I go to sixty five sixty

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.529 
and let's say I go to sixty five sixty
and<00:04:32.770> then<00:04:33.460> click<00:04:33.699> it<00:04:33.819> again<00:04:33.879> now<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.300> can<00:04:34.419> see

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
and then click it again now you can see

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.450 
and then click it again now you can see
it<00:04:34.689> just<00:04:34.870> turned<00:04:35.080> on<00:04:35.259> calling<00:04:35.919> for<00:04:36.099> chilling

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
it just turned on calling for chilling

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.850 
it just turned on calling for chilling
but<00:04:37.270> I'm<00:04:37.629> fermenting<00:04:38.319> I<00:04:38.409> don't<00:04:38.560> want<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.770> do

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
but I'm fermenting I don't want to do

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.619 
but I'm fermenting I don't want to do
that<00:04:39.039> I'm<00:04:39.279> going<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:39.430> put<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.639> back<00:04:39.759> to<00:04:39.969> 70

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
that I'm going to put it back to 70

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.909 
that I'm going to put it back to 70
I<00:04:42.719> think<00:04:43.719> the<00:04:43.990> setpoint<00:04:44.289> I've<00:04:44.590> got<00:04:44.710> to<00:04:44.800> go<00:04:44.889> a

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
I think the setpoint I've got to go a

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.839 
I think the setpoint I've got to go a
little<00:04:45.009> higher<00:04:47.189> there<00:04:48.189> and<00:04:48.370> then<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.520> goes<00:04:48.580> off

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
little higher there and then it goes off

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.689 
little higher there and then it goes off
again<00:04:49.409> and<00:04:50.409> that<00:04:50.560> controls<00:04:51.009> because<00:04:51.400> as<00:04:51.550> you

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
again and that controls because as you

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.019 
again and that controls because as you
know<00:04:51.879> when<00:04:52.629> a<00:04:52.659> beer<00:04:52.930> is<00:04:53.080> fermenting<00:04:54.029> its

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:55.029 
know when a beer is fermenting its

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.920 
know when a beer is fermenting its
creating<00:04:55.389> its<00:04:55.509> own<00:04:55.629> heat<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:58.210> that's<00:04:58.719> our

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
creating its own heat so that's our

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.860 
creating its own heat so that's our
system<00:04:59.349> like<00:05:00.009> I<00:05:00.250> hope<00:05:00.550> that<00:05:00.729> kind<00:05:01.479> of<00:05:01.629> makes

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
system like I hope that kind of makes

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.110 
system like I hope that kind of makes
sense
