look to this game it's an incredibly
finely<00:04:02.360> milled<00:04:02.540> powder<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:03.560> really<00:04:04.160> is

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
finely milled powder that really is

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.630 
finely milled powder that really is
barely<00:04:04.850> visible<00:04:05.150> on<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.780> skin<00:04:06.400> even<00:04:07.400> when<00:04:07.550> you

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
barely visible on the skin even when you

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.100 
barely visible on the skin even when you
add<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.820> layer<00:04:08.240> upon<00:04:08.540> layer

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
add a layer upon layer

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.620 
add a layer upon layer
it<00:04:09.350> never<00:04:09.680> really<00:04:09.890> looks<00:04:10.220> cakey<00:04:10.790> or<00:04:11.330> too<00:04:11.480> much

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
it never really looks cakey or too much

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.080 
it never really looks cakey or too much
there<00:04:11.870> it's<00:04:12.080> super<00:04:12.920> soft<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:13.430> can<00:04:13.580> just<00:04:13.880> tell

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
there it's super soft you can just tell

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.030 
there it's super soft you can just tell
from<00:04:14.270> swirling<00:04:14.780> your<00:04:14.900> finger<00:04:15.230> in<00:04:15.350> there<00:04:15.500> that

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
from swirling your finger in there that

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.190 
from swirling your finger in there that
it's<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.610> super<00:04:17.450> soft<00:04:19.480> luxuriously<00:04:20.480> velvety

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
it's a super soft luxuriously velvety

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.500 
it's a super soft luxuriously velvety
feeling<00:04:21.560> powder<00:04:22.160> I'm<00:04:22.670> gonna<00:04:22.850> go<00:04:22.970> on<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.240> side

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
feeling powder I'm gonna go on this side

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:38.420 
feeling powder I'm gonna go on this side
now

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.070 

so<00:04:39.430> I've<00:04:39.760> now<00:04:39.910> added<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:40.450> couple<00:04:40.780> layers<00:04:40.960> just

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
so I've now added a couple layers just

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.260 
so I've now added a couple layers just
to<00:04:41.470> try<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.800> be<00:04:42.010> able<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.280> get<00:04:42.430> this<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.820> show<00:04:43.090> up

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
to try to be able to get this to show up

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.840 
to try to be able to get this to show up
on<00:04:43.900> camera<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.710> have<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:44.980> feeling<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.520> it's<00:04:45.670> so

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
on camera I have a feeling that it's so

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.310 
on camera I have a feeling that it's so
subtle<00:04:46.090> that<00:04:46.390> you're<00:04:46.510> really<00:04:46.720> not<00:04:47.050> going<00:04:47.230> to

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
subtle that you're really not going to

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.730 
subtle that you're really not going to
be<00:04:47.410> able<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.920> see<00:04:48.910> too<00:04:49.150> much<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.510> it<00:04:49.660> you<00:04:49.870> can

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
be able to see too much of it you can

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.560 
be able to see too much of it you can
see<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.070> pink<00:04:51.340> I<00:04:51.490> think<00:04:51.520> definitely<00:04:52.360> on<00:04:52.480> the

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
see the pink I think definitely on the

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.960 
see the pink I think definitely on the
apples<00:04:52.900> of<00:04:53.020> my<00:04:53.050> cheeks<00:04:53.470> just<00:04:54.010> looking<00:04:54.400> really

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
apples of my cheeks just looking really

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.930 
apples of my cheeks just looking really
fresh<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:56.020> springy<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:57.100> this<00:04:57.310> pink<00:04:57.640> really

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
fresh and springy and this pink really

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.580 
fresh and springy and this pink really
leans<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.540> would<00:04:58.690> say<00:04:58.840> more<00:04:59.110> towards<00:04:59.440> the

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
leans I would say more towards the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.860 
leans I would say more towards the
peachy<00:05:00.040> into<00:05:00.280> things<00:05:00.520> but<00:05:01.180> it's<00:05:01.360> not<00:05:01.570> that

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
peachy into things but it's not that

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.320 
peachy into things but it's not that
strong<00:05:02.440> peach<00:05:02.800> that's<00:05:03.040> too<00:05:03.460> orange<00:05:03.850> now<00:05:04.210> I'm

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
strong peach that's too orange now I'm

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.030 
strong peach that's too orange now I'm
just<00:05:04.480> gonna<00:05:04.570> go<00:05:04.780> into<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.050> very<00:05:05.500> lightest

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
just gonna go into that very lightest

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.400 
just gonna go into that very lightest
color<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:07.420> think<00:05:07.450> you<00:05:07.690> can<00:05:07.840> see<00:05:08.020> how<00:05:08.230> much

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
color and I think you can see how much

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:15.780 
color and I think you can see how much
the<00:05:09.100> brush<00:05:09.400> picks<00:05:09.850> up<00:05:13.440> it's<00:05:14.440> definitely<00:05:14.800> not

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
the brush picks up it's definitely not

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.830 
the brush picks up it's definitely not
one<00:05:16.120> of<00:05:16.150> those<00:05:18.150> powders<00:05:19.150> like<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.360> garland

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
one of those powders like a garland

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
bronzer to where it's hard packed in

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.360 
bronzer to where it's hard packed in
there<00:05:22.540> and<00:05:22.810> it<00:05:23.080> actually<00:05:23.110> can<00:05:23.620> be<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.800> struggle

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
there and it actually can be a struggle
