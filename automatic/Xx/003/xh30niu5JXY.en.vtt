00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.660
 the zone of promise and the one that most worries us men and women since it is the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.799
 place where abdominal fat usually accumulates 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.849
 achieving a marked abdomen is not an easy task but this does not mean that it is 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.929
 impossible 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.829
 we must bear in mind that if we are overweight, we will not be 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.300
 exercises to mark the act men 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.949
 We must first eliminate excess fat by doing exercises that involve 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.590
 good caloric intake such as aerobics accompanied by a clear 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.880
 healthy and fat-free food 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.460
 then if we can start to score the abs so the first tip 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.950
 that we can attest to is a bit daunting but true the abs 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.610
 they are not magical they require physical exercise and diet 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.670
 once we are ready to face this challenge to be with a 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.570
 marked abdomen you have to know that the ideal is to combine several types of 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.570
 abdominals to work all our muscles 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.390
 for example you can make some in fixed bank others in inclined bank and the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.590
 rest on a mat on the floor 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 neither should we be required with this type of exercises because we can have 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.160
 intense pains and even cramps 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.310
 also you have to know that the position is very important when making 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.570
 ABS 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.740
 the feet should always be on the floor when we work the muscles 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.390
 high for this you can ask an exercise partner to hold you 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.940
 the ankles 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.330
 neither should you force yourself with your arms on the back of your neck. 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.160
 do it with the act men 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.890
 do not forget about breathing 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.390
 when we contract the muscle and we know we must exhale the air 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.940
 so there are no more excuses it's a matter of having the will to go to the gym 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.040
 work our muscles 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.310
 the results will give us a marked abdomen 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.939
