there's a lot of people and it's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.510 
there's a lot of people and it's
probably<00:01:07.260> because<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.680> pump<00:01:07.950> dumping<00:01:08.369> or

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
probably because it's pump dumping or

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
probably because it's pump dumping or
maybe<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.750> towards<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> end

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
maybe it's because it's towards the end

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
maybe it's because it's towards the end
of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> recent<00:01:11.369> call<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> duty<00:01:11.850> ghosts<00:01:12.060> is
