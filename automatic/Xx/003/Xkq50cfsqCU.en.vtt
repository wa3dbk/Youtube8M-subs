00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.280
 which is also a 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.380
 you have to look like an orange energy 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.790
 also here we can see what it is that 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.920
 already came out what is the information of 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.860

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.009

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.780
 all this will have improvements included 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.580
 basically what is a system like 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.080
 viewer mode where we can see everything 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.420
 the world that is broadcasting hey what 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.910
 beams and collection any of the 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.460
 games and now talking about decks halo 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.230
 and collection it was reported that the system 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.450
 ranges that will use the four games will be 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.430
 the system of halo ranges 2 in my 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.200
 opinion is something very good since this 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.870
 then it will totally indicate who is 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.730
 really a good player and this the 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.440
 I really like the news because 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.720
 the halo system reach ica and what 4 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.440
 It was pure experience to disappoint me 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.050
 quite 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.670
 now as for other issues of 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.710
 customization here we can see some 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.480
 images or screenshots that 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.640
 I found someone online 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.920
 attended the gamescom as we can see what 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.600
 which are the emblems obviously are not 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.940
 all remember that all this is not a 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.740
 final product and we can also see what 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.390
 which is that the system of 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.070
 keylor reach that we had something next 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.470
 of our banner as an emblem 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.860
 additional we will be able to have what is 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.660
 from halo 1 to 4 and including the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.770
 as we can see that these knives and 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.470
 other things level 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.710
 this is like something like an extra to the game 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.240
 and it's good to see him back 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.700
 we can also see it from the options 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.790
 service labels two colors 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.920
 that we can use among other things that 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.900
 I show you to the left side of the video 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.550
 well if you want they can put a pause 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.500
 to see also about the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.150
 armor was seen a bit but the truth 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.890
 It still does not look enough to be able to say 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.830
 something was only seen that the whole 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.670
 halo 4 and something like that obviously that's why 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.349
 this sample right now 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.910
 so well that's all the information 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.580
 that came out in terms of the gamescom 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.959
 to the new information good for me that 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.910
 it's been all for this video I hope that 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.500
 you liked it if it's like that not in order 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.150
 I like to have them say what they think 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.920
 in this regard, they thought all this 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.140
 new information and remember that everything 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.370
 what happens here the information what 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.500
