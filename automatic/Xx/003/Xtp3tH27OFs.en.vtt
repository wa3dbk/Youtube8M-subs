submitting<00:01:57.119> requests<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.259> need<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> define<00:01:58.890> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
submitting requests you need to define a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.030 
submitting requests you need to define a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
set of buffer output targets and connect

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.670 
set of buffer output targets and connect
them<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> camera<00:02:03.119> device<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.469> done

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
them to the camera device this is done

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.969 
them to the camera device this is done
by<00:02:04.890> initiating<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> camera<00:02:05.969> capture<00:02:06.360> session

by initiating the camera capture session

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.580 
by initiating the camera capture session
for<00:02:07.979> example<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.060> use<00:02:09.090> texture<00:02:09.840> view<00:02:10.110> for

using one of the predefined templates
then<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.370> can<00:03:23.550> build<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.880> capture<00:03:24.300> request

to use that image in a basic camera app

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.879 
to use that image in a basic camera app
you<00:06:02.569> could<00:06:02.719> get<00:06:02.900> the<00:06:03.050> bytes<00:06:03.289> buffer<00:06:03.710> of<00:06:03.800> the

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
you could get the bytes buffer of the

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.800 
you could get the bytes buffer of the
