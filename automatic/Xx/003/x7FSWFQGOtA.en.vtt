perfectly clean toilet that smells great

perfectly clean toilet that smells great

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
too

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.680 
too
so<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> make<00:00:14.160> these<00:00:15.230> you<00:00:16.230> need<00:00:16.550> 1<00:00:17.550> 1/3<00:00:18.119> cup<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
so to make these you need 1 1/3 cup of

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.820 
so to make these you need 1 1/3 cup of
baking<00:00:19.199> soda<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:20.119> 1/2<00:00:21.119> cup<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.900> citric<00:00:22.289> acid

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
baking soda and 1/2 cup of citric acid

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.859 
baking soda and 1/2 cup of citric acid
you<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.730> fly<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.000> citric<00:00:24.359> acid<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
you can fly in citric acid in the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.000 
you can fly in citric acid in the
grocery<00:00:25.230> store<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.920> in

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
grocery store but it's going to be in

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.009 
grocery store but it's going to be in
small<00:00:26.310> quantities<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.630> something

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
small quantities so if this is something

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.259 
small quantities so if this is something
you<00:00:28.109> want<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:29.039> would<00:00:29.160> probably<00:00:29.609> pay<00:00:30.240> off

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
you want to do it would probably pay off

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.130 
you want to do it would probably pay off
to<00:00:30.689> order<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.109> online<00:00:31.260> instead<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.899> just

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
to order it online instead and you just

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.319 
to order it online instead and you just
combine<00:00:34.350> those<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.309> large<00:00:35.520> bowl<00:00:38.000> blend<00:00:39.000> them

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
combine those in a large bowl blend them

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.229 
combine those in a large bowl blend them
together<00:00:42.770> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:44.250> add<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:45.000> whatever

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
together and then add in whatever

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.680 
together and then add in whatever
essential<00:00:45.809> oils<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.860> want<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> bath

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
essential oils you want so for the bath

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.119 
essential oils you want so for the bath
or<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.200> toilet<00:00:49.500> balm<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.829> would<00:00:49.980> do

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
or for the toilet balm we would do

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.990 
or for the toilet balm we would do
lavender<00:00:50.430> lemon<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.270> peppermint<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:53.000> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
lavender lemon and peppermint and that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.939 
lavender lemon and peppermint and that
is<00:00:54.390> 10<00:00:55.170> drops<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.770> each<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:03.350> then<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.769> our

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
is 10 drops of each and then just our

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:14.810 
is 10 drops of each and then just our
peppermint<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:09.710> then<00:01:10.710> blend<00:01:11.369> together<00:01:13.820> now

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
peppermint and then blend together now

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
peppermint and then blend together now
the<00:01:14.880> trick<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.360> getting<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.229> combine

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the trick of getting this to combine

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
the trick of getting this to combine
into<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:18.659> bombs<00:01:19.070> is<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.400> add<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.180> right

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
into the bombs is to add just the right

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.880 
into the bombs is to add just the right
amount<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.990> moisture<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.020> use<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> little

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
amount of moisture so I use a little

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.920 
amount of moisture so I use a little
spritz<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.700> bottle<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> water<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.590> just

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
spritz a bottle of water and you just

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.060 
spritz a bottle of water and you just
barely<00:01:30.930> spritz

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
barely spritz

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.350 
barely spritz
so<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.369> you're<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:33.229> creating<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> fizz<00:01:34.650> yet

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
so then you're not creating the fizz yet

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
so then you're not creating the fizz yet
because<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.509> want<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> happen<00:01:37.560> when<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
because you want this to happen when you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.980 
because you want this to happen when you
use<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.549> when<00:01:38.790> you're<00:01:38.909> making<00:01:39.210> them

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.469 

you<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.500> add<00:01:44.509> as<00:01:45.509> needed

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.730 

and<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.810> give<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> test<00:01:52.320> every<00:01:52.590> once

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and then just give it a test every once

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.200 
and then just give it a test every once
in<00:01:52.830> a<00:01:52.890> while<00:01:53.010> to<00:01:53.130> see<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.580> holds<00:01:53.850> together

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
in a while to see if it holds together

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.750 
in a while to see if it holds together
so<00:01:54.659> we're<00:01:54.810> getting<00:01:54.990> there<00:01:55.260> but<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.650> not<00:01:56.460> quite

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
so we're getting there but not not quite

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.140 
so we're getting there but not not quite
yet<00:01:57.119> so<00:02:00.800> now<00:02:01.800> it's<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.220> consistency<00:02:03.000> we

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
yet so now it's to the consistency we

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.030 
yet so now it's to the consistency we
need<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.810> at<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.170> point<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.770> put<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
need that at this point you can put it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.040 
need that at this point you can put it
into<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.400> silicone<00:02:05.940> mold<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.570> press<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
into a silicone mold and just press the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.960 
into a silicone mold and just press the
mixture<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.280> would<00:02:08.399> end<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.759> with

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
mixture in and you would end up with

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.350 
mixture in and you would end up with
cute<00:02:09.959> little<00:02:10.080> designs<00:02:10.470> or<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.910> use<00:02:12.120> this

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
cute little designs or you can use this

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.540 
cute little designs or you can use this
contraption<00:02:12.840> which<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.650> meatball<00:02:14.010> maker

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550
