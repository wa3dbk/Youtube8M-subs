00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
going to talk to you about how Apple is

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.419 
going to talk to you about how Apple is
kind<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.660> deceiving<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> general<00:00:10.620> public<00:00:10.980> so

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
kind of deceiving the general public so

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.580 
kind of deceiving the general public so
Apple<00:00:11.790> says<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> iPhone<00:00:12.660> 6<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.230> going<00:00:13.440> to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
Apple says that the iPhone 6 is going to

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.829 
Apple says that the iPhone 6 is going to
have<00:00:13.769> optical<00:00:14.250> stabilization<00:00:14.700> now<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.540> course

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
have optical stabilization now of course

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.870 
have optical stabilization now of course
Apple<00:00:16.289> didn't<00:00:16.740> get<00:00:16.830> too<00:00:16.980> technical<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.789> they

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
Apple didn't get too technical so they

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.760 
Apple didn't get too technical so they
didn't<00:00:18.150> say<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.480> many<00:00:18.539> stops<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.260> optical

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
didn't say how many stops of optical

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.099 
didn't say how many stops of optical
stabilization<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.730> iPhone<00:00:21.029> 6<00:00:21.359> camera<00:00:21.810> has

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
stabilization the iPhone 6 camera has

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.320 
stabilization the iPhone 6 camera has
was<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.949> small<00:00:23.369> i<00:00:23.400> phone<00:00:23.730> 6<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
was that the small i phone 6 just the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.839 
was that the small i phone 6 just the
iPhone<00:00:24.720> 6<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.109> think<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.500> 4.7<00:00:26.220> inch<00:00:26.460> screen

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
iPhone 6 I think as a 4.7 inch screen

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.349 
iPhone 6 I think as a 4.7 inch screen
does<00:00:27.359> not<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:28.050> optical<00:00:29.039> stabilization<00:00:29.460> but

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
does not have optical stabilization but

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.500 
does not have optical stabilization but
the<00:00:30.599> bigger<00:00:30.869> iphone<00:00:31.470> 6<00:00:31.800> plus<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.880> 5.5<00:00:33.480> inch

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the bigger iphone 6 plus with a 5.5 inch

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.660 
the bigger iphone 6 plus with a 5.5 inch
screen<00:00:33.809> does<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.829> optical<00:00:35.370> stabilization

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
screen does have optical stabilization

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.360 
screen does have optical stabilization
so<00:00:36.300> even<00:00:36.719> though<00:00:36.899> apple's<00:00:37.620> event<00:00:37.920> they<00:00:38.160> made

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
so even though apple's event they made

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.400 
so even though apple's event they made
it<00:00:38.520> seem<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.480> iphone<00:00:39.809> 6s<00:00:40.079> are<00:00:40.230> going

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
it seem like all the iphone 6s are going

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.160 
it seem like all the iphone 6s are going
to<00:00:40.530> become<00:00:40.829> equipped<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.879> new<00:00:42.270> optical

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
to become equipped with this new optical

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.840 
to become equipped with this new optical
stabilization<00:00:43.500> we're<00:00:43.920> using<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.280> gyroscopes

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
stabilization we're using the gyroscopes

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.150 
stabilization we're using the gyroscopes
in<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> built-in<00:00:45.719> phone<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.530> make<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:46.920> image

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
in the built-in phone to make your image

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.650 
in the built-in phone to make your image
stabilized<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.180> Apple's<00:00:48.510> website

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
stabilized from what Apple's website

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.690 
stabilized from what Apple's website
says<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> iPhone<00:00:50.010> 6<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.460> not

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
says if you get the iPhone 6 it's not

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
says if you get the iPhone 6 it's not
going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.510> definitely<00:00:51.960> keep<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
going to have it so definitely keep that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.560 
going to have it so definitely keep that
in<00:00:52.379> mind<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> rear-facing<00:00:53.570> isolate

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
in mind now the rear-facing isolate

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.600 
in mind now the rear-facing isolate
camera<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> back<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> iPhone<00:00:55.980> 6<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
camera on the back of the iPhone 6 is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.090 
camera on the back of the iPhone 6 is
still<00:00:57.210> only<00:00:57.539> 8<00:00:57.930> megapixels<00:00:58.710> personally<00:00:59.039> I

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
still only 8 megapixels personally I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.160 
still only 8 megapixels personally I
like<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> warm<00:01:00.210> megapixel<00:01:00.719> count<00:01:00.899> on

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like to have a warm megapixel count on

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.720 
like to have a warm megapixel count on
the<00:01:01.350> phone<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.309> means<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.609> each

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the phone because that means that each

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
the phone because that means that each
individual<00:01:03.239> pixel<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> absorb<00:01:04.439> more

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
individual pixel is going to absorb more

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.800 
individual pixel is going to absorb more
light<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:05.339> opposed<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.090> 13<00:01:06.659> megapixel

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
light as opposed to a 13 megapixel

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.800 
light as opposed to a 13 megapixel
sensor<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.740> even<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> 42<00:01:08.790> megapixel<00:01:09.360> sensor<00:01:09.630> in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
sensor or even a 42 megapixel sensor in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.080 
sensor or even a 42 megapixel sensor in
a<00:01:10.140> camera<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.619> has<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> lot<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> pixels<00:01:11.670> each

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
a camera that has a lot of pixels each

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.700 
a camera that has a lot of pixels each
one<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.450> those<00:01:12.510> picks<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.380> small

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
one of those picks is going to be small

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
one of those picks is going to be small
if<00:01:13.799> has<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> exact<00:01:14.340> same<00:01:14.549> sensor<00:01:14.970> size<00:01:15.150> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
if has the exact same sensor size so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
if has the exact same sensor size so
again<00:01:15.900> each<00:01:16.170> pixel<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.009> absorb<00:01:17.280> less

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
again each pixel is going to absorb less

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.859 
again each pixel is going to absorb less
light<00:01:17.850> which<00:01:18.150> means<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.450> there's<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
light which means that there's going to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
light which means that there's going to
be<00:01:18.960> more<00:01:19.140> noise<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.619> your<00:01:19.650> images<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.430> still<00:01:20.939> 8

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
be more noise in your images so still 8

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.780 
be more noise in your images so still 8
megapixels<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.170> completely<00:01:22.830> new<00:01:23.189> sensor

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
megapixels but a completely new sensor

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.550 
megapixels but a completely new sensor
so<00:01:24.270> does<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.509> mean<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> image<00:01:25.350> quality

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
so does that mean that the image quality

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.390 
so does that mean that the image quality
is<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.130> better

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
is going to be better

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.090 
is going to be better
well<00:01:26.970> no<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.740> focus

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
well no but it's going to you to focus

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.850 
well no but it's going to you to focus
faster<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.119> Apple<00:01:30.540> has<00:01:30.659> also<00:01:30.930> said<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.740> they

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
faster and Apple has also said that they

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.620 
faster and Apple has also said that they
built<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.310> software<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> Photos<00:01:33.600> app

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630

the<00:01:36.479> pictures<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> sounds<00:01:37.740> pretty

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the pictures so that sounds pretty

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.590 
the pictures so that sounds pretty

stuck at F 2.2 which is just like the
iPhone<00:01:51.329> 5s<00:01:51.689> was<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.259> display<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:52.770> faster

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250

gimmicky<00:01:55.920> features<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.520> basically<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
gimmicky features it's basically the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
gimmicky features it's basically the
exact<00:01:57.329> same<00:01:57.450> camera<00:01:57.960> since<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> iPhone<00:01:58.619> 5s

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040

iPhone 4s

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.609 
iPhone 4s
there<00:02:06.270> has<00:02:06.420> been<00:02:06.450> some<00:02:06.780> differences<00:02:07.290> but

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
there has been some differences but

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.139 
there has been some differences but
relatively<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.640> have<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> exact<00:02:09.119> same

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
relatively you have the exact same

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.040 
relatively you have the exact same
sensor<00:02:09.750> size<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.649> still<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.190> 8<00:02:11.489> mega

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
sensor size and you still have 8 mega

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.870 
sensor size and you still have 8 mega
and<00:02:12.410> then<00:02:12.860> they've<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.190> thrown<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.610> couple

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.130 
is open up the aperture a little bit
more<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:04.370> think<00:03:04.730> it's<00:03:04.850> around<00:03:05.090> half<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.570> stop<00:03:05.870> so

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
more I think it's around half a stop so

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.330 
more I think it's around half a stop so
that<00:03:06.170> means<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.530> your<00:03:06.710> front-facing

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
that means that your front-facing

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.800 
that means that your front-facing
selfies<00:03:07.850> are<00:03:07.970> going<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.300> be<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.420> little<00:03:08.600> bit

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
selfies are going to be a little bit

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.480 
selfies are going to be a little bit
less<00:03:08.960> noisy<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.770> they're<00:03:09.920> going<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.250> look<00:03:10.400> a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
less noisy and they're going to look a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.310 
less noisy and they're going to look a
little<00:03:10.580> bit<00:03:10.760> more<00:03:10.940> clean<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.510> clear<00:03:11.810> but<00:03:12.170> for

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
little bit more clean and clear but for

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.050 
little bit more clean and clear but for
those<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.680> wondering<00:03:12.830> yes<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.910> the

iPhones since the iPhone 5 I mean if

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.500

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
megapixels that then we could FaceTime

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.810 
megapixels that then we could FaceTime
in<00:03:24.170> 1080p<00:03:24.770> but<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.280> course<00:03:25.490> Apple<00:03:25.640> doesn't

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
in 1080p but of course Apple doesn't

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.920

major we increase the bandwidth and
that's<00:03:28.610> actually<00:03:28.760> going<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.209> make<00:03:29.360> them<00:03:29.480> spend

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
that's actually going to make them spend
