00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
and the the cool feature about this base

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.580 
and the the cool feature about this base
is<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> Bamian<00:01:29.750> not<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> big<00:01:31.020> comic<00:01:31.380> crater

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
is the Bamian not a big comic crater

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.890 
is the Bamian not a big comic crater
here<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.130> always<00:01:32.490> told<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.900> Darkseid

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
zapped Batman and killed him so that's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340 
zapped Batman and killed him so that's
the<00:01:38.130> reason<00:01:38.250> why<00:01:38.630> he<00:01:39.630> was<00:01:39.659> included<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the reason why he was included in the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.420 
the reason why he was included in the
base<00:01:40.560> I'm<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.549> massive<00:01:41.850> Superman<00:01:42.299> fan<00:01:42.540> so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.010 
there's no way I was gonna push him in
there<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.200> he<00:01:46.560> had<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.159> Batman<00:01:50.869> we'll<00:01:51.869> work

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
there so he had to be Batman we'll work

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.920 
there so he had to be Batman we'll work
our<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.310> compare<00:01:53.729> my<00:01:54.659> hand

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
our way up if you can compare my hand

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.219 
our way up if you can compare my hand
size<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:56.180> actual<00:01:57.180> piece<00:01:58.250> his<00:01:59.250> arm<00:02:00.229> he's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
size to that actual piece his arm he's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.399 
size to that actual piece his arm he's
huge<00:02:01.560> he's<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.159> he's<00:02:02.670> maybe<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.780> tad<00:02:04.049> smaller

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
huge he's a he's maybe a tad smaller

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.990 
huge he's a he's maybe a tad smaller
than<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:04.740> doomsday<00:02:06.439> so

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.940 

it<00:02:13.000> doesn't<00:02:13.269> take<00:02:13.450> away<00:02:13.480> from<00:02:13.750> former<00:02:14.620> if<00:02:14.769> he

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
it doesn't take away from former if he

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.429 
it doesn't take away from former if he
he's<00:02:15.400> smaller<00:02:15.879> than<00:02:15.969> then<00:02:16.870> doomsday<00:02:17.290> as<00:02:17.349> a

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
he's smaller than then doomsday as a

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.459 
he's smaller than then doomsday as a
character<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.159> this<00:02:18.969> is<00:02:19.329> true<00:02:19.689> Costco<00:02:20.230> and

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.469 
character so this is true Costco and

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.959 
character so this is true Costco and
maybe<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:20.950> had<00:02:21.189> big<00:02:21.370> as<00:02:21.519> well<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:23.969> scouting

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
maybe it's had big as well so scouting

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.149 
maybe it's had big as well so scouting
is<00:02:25.170> he's<00:02:26.170> pretty<00:02:26.470> spot-on

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
is he's pretty spot-on

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.800 
is he's pretty spot-on
with<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> lot<00:02:28.209> of<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.359> pieces<00:02:28.569> that<00:02:28.689> I<00:02:28.840> get

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
with a lot of the pieces that I get

with<00:02:33.340> little<00:02:33.489> wrinkles<00:02:33.819> in<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.000> boots<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:35.340> in

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
with little wrinkles in the boots and in

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.640 
with little wrinkles in the boots and in
all<00:02:36.489> his<00:02:36.639> muscle<00:02:37.060> features<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.840> he<00:02:38.079> you<00:02:38.469> see

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
all his muscle features and he you see

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.250 
all his muscle features and he you see
skin<00:02:39.040> tends<00:02:39.250> got<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.519> rough<00:02:41.730> skin<00:02:42.730> tone<00:02:43.260> and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
skin tends got that rough skin tone and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.990 
skin tends got that rough skin tone and
he<00:02:44.379> got<00:02:44.530> his<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.489> classic<00:02:45.849> version

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
he got his this is the classic version

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.140 
he got his this is the classic version
mind<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.989> this<00:02:47.169> is<00:02:47.349> not<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.819> modern

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
mind you this is not the the modern

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.610 
mind you this is not the the modern
version<00:02:49.540> there<00:02:49.689> is<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.870> think<00:02:49.930> another<00:02:50.139> modern

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
version there is I think another modern

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.050 
version there is I think another modern
version<00:02:50.950> another<00:02:51.250> few<00:02:51.489> other<00:02:51.609> versions<00:02:51.909> but

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
version another few other versions but

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.379 
version another few other versions but
again<00:02:52.389> I'm<00:02:52.659> not<00:02:53.099> too<00:02:54.099> sure<00:02:54.310> about<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:55.030> you

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
again I'm not too sure about that so you

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.920 
again I'm not too sure about that so you
got<00:02:56.169> a<00:02:56.200> lot<00:02:56.379> of<00:02:56.409> creases<00:02:56.889> here<00:02:57.040> in<00:02:57.159> here<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.430> as

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
got a lot of creases here in here and as

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.849 
got a lot of creases here in here and as
you<00:02:58.930> can<00:02:59.079> tell<00:02:59.260> he's<00:02:59.409> got<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> light-up

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
you can tell he's got the light-up

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:07.369 
you can tell he's got the light-up
feature<00:03:03.389> he's<00:03:04.389> also<00:03:04.540> holding<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.730> spine

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
feature he's also holding a spine

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.110 
feature he's also holding a spine
gruesome<00:03:08.379> but<00:03:08.530> not<00:03:08.650> not<00:03:09.099> so<00:03:09.280> much<00:03:09.489> gruesome<00:03:09.970> I

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
gruesome but not not so much gruesome I

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.390 
gruesome but not not so much gruesome I
reckon<00:03:10.540> um<00:03:12.060> he<00:03:13.060> could<00:03:13.239> have<00:03:13.359> been<00:03:13.479> made<00:03:14.400> to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
reckon um he could have been made to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.099 
reckon um he could have been made to
look<00:03:15.549> a<00:03:15.699> little<00:03:15.879> bit<00:03:16.060> more<00:03:16.180> gruesome<00:03:16.419> but<00:03:16.810> for

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
look a little bit more gruesome but for

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.589 
look a little bit more gruesome but for
display<00:03:17.440> purposes<00:03:17.949> I<00:03:18.129> think<00:03:18.159> this<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.239> as<00:03:19.389> far

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
display purposes I think this is as far

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.360 
display purposes I think this is as far
as<00:03:19.629> you<00:03:20.079> should<00:03:20.349> like<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.799> go<00:03:20.979> or<00:03:21.099> else<00:03:21.220> it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
as you should like it to go or else it

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.009 
as you should like it to go or else it
just<00:03:21.400> takes<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.269> next<00:03:22.359> step<00:03:22.690> but

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
just takes it to the next step but

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.839 
just takes it to the next step but
you've<00:03:23.590> got<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.739> bit<00:03:23.919> of<00:03:24.010> meat<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.579> stuff

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
you've got a bit of meat and stuff

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.979 
you've got a bit of meat and stuff
hanging<00:03:25.090> off<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:28.090> spine<00:03:28.449> and<00:03:28.629> I'm<00:03:28.690> assuming

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
hanging off the spine and I'm assuming

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.710 
hanging off the spine and I'm assuming
it<00:03:29.260> is<00:03:29.349> Batman<00:03:29.590> spine<00:03:33.060> when<00:03:34.060> he<00:03:34.180> comes<00:03:34.419> shipped

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
it is Batman spine when he comes shipped

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.710 
it is Batman spine when he comes shipped
he<00:03:34.930> comes<00:03:35.489> with<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:36.729> this<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.419> removable

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
he comes with that this is a removable

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.349 
he comes with that this is a removable
hand<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:39.280> quite<00:03:39.489> difficult<00:03:39.669> to<00:03:39.909> do<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.239> with

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
hand it's quite difficult to do it with

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.659 
hand it's quite difficult to do it with
one<00:03:40.540> with<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.810> pin<00:03:43.199> and<00:03:44.199> let<00:03:45.159> me<00:03:45.280> see<00:03:45.400> if<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.549> can

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
one with a pin and let me see if I can

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:46.789 
one with a pin and let me see if I can
get<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.849> back<00:03:45.909> on<00:03:46.120> here<00:03:46.329> we<00:03:46.419> go

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
get it back on here we go

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.589 
get it back on here we go
and<00:03:47.799> it's<00:03:48.190> perfect<00:03:48.579> in<00:03:48.669> there<00:03:49.560> um<00:03:50.560> he's<00:03:50.829> tense

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
and it's perfect in there um he's tense

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.819 
and it's perfect in there um he's tense
he<00:03:52.599> stays<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.930> little<00:03:53.260> over

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
he stays a little over

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.369 
he stays a little over
well<00:03:54.639> not<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.790> little<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.359> think<00:03:55.569> a<00:03:55.689> lot<00:03:55.870> over<00:03:56.079> 30

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
well not a little I think a lot over 30

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.860 
well not a little I think a lot over 30
inches<00:03:56.739> I'm<00:03:57.340> not<00:03:57.609> too<00:03:57.879> sure<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.209> exact<00:03:58.599> height

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
inches I'm not too sure the exact height

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.240 
inches I'm not too sure the exact height
but<00:03:59.790> he's<00:04:00.790> not<00:04:01.090> small<00:04:01.359> at<00:04:02.260> all<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:05.049> I<00:04:05.979> think

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
but he's not small at all and I think

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.399 
but he's not small at all and I think
it's<00:04:06.729> the<00:04:06.879> best<00:04:07.060> represent<00:04:07.540> representation

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
it's the best represent representation

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.399 
it's the best represent representation
of<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.680> dark<00:04:09.069> side<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.639> I've<00:04:10.209> seen<00:04:10.509> yet

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
of a dark side that I've seen yet

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.679 
of a dark side that I've seen yet
I'm<00:04:12.370> pretty<00:04:12.609> sure<00:04:12.729> sideshow<00:04:13.150> would<00:04:13.299> make<00:04:13.479> one

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
I'm pretty sure sideshow would make one

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.830 
I'm pretty sure sideshow would make one
but<00:04:14.849> with<00:04:15.849> the<00:04:15.970> right<00:04:16.150> there<00:04:16.329> going<00:04:16.509> on<00:04:16.720> with

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
but with the right there going on with

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.209 
but with the right there going on with
they<00:04:16.959> say<00:04:17.169> characters<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.739> don't<00:04:17.919> think<00:04:18.099> we'll

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:18.219 
they say characters I don't think we'll

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:23.360 
they say characters I don't think we'll
be<00:04:18.250> seeing<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:18.820> guy<00:04:19.029> for<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.570> very<00:04:20.109> long<00:04:20.320> time

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.950
