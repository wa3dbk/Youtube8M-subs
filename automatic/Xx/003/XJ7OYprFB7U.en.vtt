00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
people and I think that's an amazing

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.820 
people and I think that's an amazing
story<00:03:07.240> that<00:03:07.390> people<00:03:07.600> should<00:03:07.960> think<00:03:08.170> we<00:03:08.650> should

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
story that people should think we should

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.750 
story that people should think we should
cover<00:03:08.980> but<00:03:09.400> yeah

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
cover but yeah

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.240 
cover but yeah
the<00:03:10.150> story<00:03:10.480> itself<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:11.050> cool<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.800> fact<00:03:12.100> that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
the story itself is cool the fact that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.280 
the story itself is cool the fact that
he<00:03:12.460> didn't<00:03:12.760> tell<00:03:13.090> his<00:03:13.330> publicist<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.080> tell

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
he didn't tell his publicist to tell

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:22.390 
he didn't tell his publicist to tell
everyone<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.920> me<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.700> coolest<00:03:16.120> part<00:03:16.300> of<00:03:16.450> it

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.370 

the<00:03:23.400> thing<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:23.700> strikes<00:03:23.940> me<00:03:24.150> as<00:03:24.450> odd<00:03:25.110> about

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
the thing that strikes me as odd about

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.930 
the thing that strikes me as odd about
it<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.770> I've<00:03:25.920> mentioned<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.580> couple<00:03:26.790> of

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
it is I've mentioned it to a couple of

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.580 
it is I've mentioned it to a couple of
people

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
people

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.080 
people
price-wise<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.980> no<00:03:29.340> one's<00:03:29.490> written<00:03:29.610> about<00:03:29.880> it

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
price-wise and no one's written about it

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.250 
price-wise and no one's written about it
but<00:03:30.240> they'll<00:03:30.360> they'll<00:03:30.660> write<00:03:30.870> about<00:03:31.080> all

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260

diagnosed on the parameter D I think if

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.730 
diagnosed on the parameter D I think if
there<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.790> an<00:03:35.910> absolute<00:03:36.240> legend<00:03:36.810> objectify

around<00:04:34.629> me<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:36.060> yeah<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.090> think<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.419> think<00:04:38.050> it's

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
around me and yeah I think I think it's

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.499 
around me and yeah I think I think it's
not<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:38.590> hard<00:04:38.889> I<00:04:39.099> think<00:04:39.310> if<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.580> can<00:04:40.270> take<00:04:40.479> a

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
not that hard I think if you can take a

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.420 
not that hard I think if you can take a
step<00:04:40.659> back<00:04:41.080> from<00:04:41.319> it<00:04:41.529> and<00:04:41.590> kind<00:04:41.889> of<00:04:41.949> see<00:04:42.009> what

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
step back from it and kind of see what

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.080 
step back from it and kind of see what
it<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.699> then<00:04:43.509> you<00:04:43.960> know<00:04:44.499> you<00:04:44.800> don't<00:04:45.090> start

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
it is then you know you don't start

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.420
