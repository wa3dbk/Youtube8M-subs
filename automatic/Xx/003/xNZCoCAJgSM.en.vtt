00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.600
What's up Attackers?

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.830
Nicole here with your daily MMO news for Tuesday
March 4th, exclusively from MMO Attack.com.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.170
So I'm supposed to do a Jimmy Fallon-like
monologue here to open the show, but On today's

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.510
episode we have the battle for Lion's Arch
in Guild Wars 2, a new module in Neverwinter

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.900
and more from Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.910
Your daily XP starts now!

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.690
NCSoft and ArenaNet today released the finale
to the world story, Battle for Lion's Arch.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.329
In what promises to be an epic moment in Guild
Wars 2 history, the community will need to

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.370
band together to engage in an epic struggle
to take back control of one of the most famous

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.370
cities in the land.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.930
In my best movie trailer voice, "The city
of Lion's Arch has fallen victim to a surprise

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.719
attack from Scarlet Briar, and her devastating
army of dark forces.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.510
A deadly arsenal of war machiens brought Lion's
Arch to its knees, and only the brave players

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.780
of Guild Wars 2 can return control of the
town to its rightful owners."

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.700
The battle marks the end of a storyline over
a year in the making, check it out today!

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.590
The Curse of Icewind Dale has been announced
for Perfect World Entertainment and Cryptic

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.380
Studios Neverwinter.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.170
This is the third large-scale update to their
free to play MMO, bringing with it a ton of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.170
new content and PvP options.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.420
The Curse of Icewind Dale will introduce 5
new zones, 2 of which feature both PvP and

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.710
PvE content.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.951
PvP matchmaking and leaderboards will also
debut, alongside a campaign that will see

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:34.390
players completing a number of objectives
for exciting new rewards.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.240
A giant list of other updates are accompanied
in the article on MMO Attack.com.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.100
MOBA fans from around the world are being
treated today to the second gameplay video

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.049
for the Dragon Shire map in Blizzard's Heroes
of the Storm.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.130
In the video, Dustin and Kevin from Blizzard
walk us through a variety of changes that

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.999
were made to the map, as well as debut a number
of new champions and skins.

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.649
So what's up with this Dragon Shire map?

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.429
It's a 5v5 battle with a Dragon Knight lying
dormant in the middle.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.369
Teams much capture two obelisks at the top
and bottom of the map to receive his power.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.202
Obviously the Dragon Knight's power gives
you a massive power boost, and since you've

00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:15.180
already capture the two obelisks, you're probably
already winning the battle, so I'm assuming

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.180
it's GG by now.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.180
Take a look at the video though, it's pretty
interesting.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.410
