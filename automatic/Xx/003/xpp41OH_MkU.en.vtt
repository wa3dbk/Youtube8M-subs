00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.450
 hello everyone good and you will see that I have a 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.630
 Eye finished with mascara and 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.189
 another is not because I just recorded the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.590
 video about the invention of the century in the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.480
 I told you about this thermal crimper 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.430
 of 'seve' now I will leave the link in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 the information box is worth what 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.410
 I want to do now is a comparison 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.930
 between the effect you see 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.200
 I hope you see it well to see 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.180
 the effect on the curly I said to you then 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.000
 that they are curly natural that does not double 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.350
 the eyelashes and well I think it shows 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.150
 and it's striking 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.880
 well, I wanted to make a difference 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.010
 between this curler and a classic one 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.220
 but used quite a bit 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.810
 novelty that I saw the other day on a channel 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.110
 from youtube and I thought super 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.370
 original to see I do not recommend doing it 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.180
 of diary because because we're good 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.310
 using heat for the story and this 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.650
 curler that as you know makes more pressure 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.960
 on the tab with which you can 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.210
 attack them but good if you want a day 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.750
 a makeup in which he especially 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.360
 note the most open tab and more and more 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.910
 long is an invention that today I thought 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.770
 very original and really to see either 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.190
 we burn our eye or is it a thing 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.040
 very subtle and very very good saudi 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.770
 we have this curler this concretely 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.890
 I can not tell you if the iplus understands it 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.440
 let yourself the one that I use to make up 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.479
 and then professionally and that's 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.479
 beterÃ³ be you have a thousand brands 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.080
 we have a lighter for this meteor 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.070
 fantastic do not look at the reason vargas 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.960
 which is the only one that is a sheet of 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.970
 marijuana but I do not know why I have it 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.210
 well then what we are going to do is 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.780
 with the burner flame let 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.060
 to warm 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.550
 this metal part is worth not rubber 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.100
 because the rubber if we burn it could be 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.670
 undo let's just heat the 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.390
 metal part for two seconds worth 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.319
 already if you touch it like it's metal 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.569
 quick heat but it does not burn and 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.170
 We proceed to curl lashes as 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.170
 as we always do 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.430
 we leave it for about 20 seconds doing 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.019
 pressure but that does not bother and especially 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.860
 if we pinch we jump we do not have 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.860
 to ask for Carlos and he 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.690
 what do we do with this besides curling the 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.240
 with the curling iron we are always 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.790
 adding heat that is a little bit what 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.500
 what makes the heat provider the heat 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.360
 you can see it like the plates and 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.700
 curling iron helps hair 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.270
 amolde with which in this case then what 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.370
 I do not know if you see the effect from the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.700
 eyelash has been his life 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:32.170
 I do not know if you will see the difference of this 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.730
 curly that is more more rounded and 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.069
 this that in the end I do what it does 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.680
 is to fold the tab 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.359
 but I also wanted that my is a little 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.800
 that's the difference between a curler and 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:46.000
 other 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.790
 what advantages does this have since these 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.890
 you have more economic channeler 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.250
 thermal that I think that that costs 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.410
 according to about 18 euros something like that is also 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.050
 true that lasts a lot but good 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.850
 I'm going to apply the same mask 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.850
 and let's see the final effect 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.680
 also tell you that there is a difference 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:21.209
 important between using the curler 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.720
 thermal and the manual curler with the 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.910
 heat the manual curler itself and that is 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.409
 the thermal crimper we could use it 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.719
 on the already made eyelash 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:35.330
 without anything happening the eyelash is not 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:37.669
 weakens or breaks but you know that if 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.629
 We use the manual curler in 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.909
 eyelashes already painted while 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:46.909
 hardened with the mask could 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.580
 they could break good I've put a 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:51.289
 layer in this one I take more two so 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.149
 I'll wait for it to dry applied the 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.389
 another layer and we see the result now 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:55.389
 good 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.710
 well I have already put two layers in the 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:04.880
 two eyes and I do not know what you think 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.880
 to you 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.830
 but I honestly feel more more 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.130
 curled these tabs 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.870
 look especially if something like that shows that 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.360
 these stick more to the eyelid than these 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.810
 that is to my taste the analyzer 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.640
 thermal to the lifelong filmmaker is 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.380
 what I'm going to do now to wear them 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.910
 and curly gloves and so you can see that 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.720
 nothing happens to pass the curler 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.120
 thermally curled is to pass it through the 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.280
 two eyes and so the rice one worth us 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.990
 he taught it that I think I have the 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:47.520
 mascara even better to spend 11 2 min 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.169
 well I've passed this eye no longer 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.249
 and I 'm having fun 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.249
 in the right 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.790
 and I really think the effect I do not know if 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.810
 you see it 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:20.360
 but it's a pass 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:23.030
 so the thermal analyzer go for 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.620
 that's good as it was said before I 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.530
 phone call because I'm that 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.450
 magic and I do not remove the sound of the phone 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.670
 I definitely keep the curler 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.560
 thermal is more expensive 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.650
 I repeat that this has cost me about 18 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.960
 euros if not me if I remember correctly that 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.100
 Surely not for others but read in 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:46.310
 forums and such and above does not harm the 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.230
 lashes and the truth is that the 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.240
 result I like it a lot more because 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.060
 instead of bent they remain curled 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.900
 rounded so great and nothing 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:00.970
 well with this advice then he left and 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.970
 see you soon a little kiss
