00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.910 
push on it's always very difficult on
the<00:02:06.550> first<00:02:06.760> event<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:08.260> you'll<00:02:08.380> be<00:02:08.530> unfair<00:02:08.830> of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
the first event and you'll be unfair of

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.410 
the first event and you'll be unfair of
me<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.070> stop<00:02:09.369> single<00:02:09.760> people<00:02:10.119> are<00:02:10.179> actually

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
me to stop single people are actually

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.560 
me to stop single people are actually
because<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.470> know<00:02:12.150> there's<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.270> huge<00:02:13.510> amount

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
because you know there's a huge amount

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.630 
because you know there's a huge amount
of<00:02:13.959> range<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.380> experience<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.250> Richard

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
of range of experience with Richard

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.460 
of range of experience with Richard
sites<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.209> front<00:02:16.480> as<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.750> know<00:02:16.900> and

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
sites in the front as you know and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.740 
sites in the front as you know and
yourself<00:02:17.890> you've<00:02:18.100> done<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.340> lot<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.610> events<00:02:18.850> to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
yourself you've done a lot of events to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.020 
yourself you've done a lot of events to
be<00:02:19.930> polite<00:02:20.200> I've<00:02:20.680> learned<00:02:20.950> some<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.640> Griffin

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
be polite I've learned some that Griffin

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.020 
be polite I've learned some that Griffin
is<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:23.170> haven't<00:02:23.530> done<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.709> many<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
is you haven't done that many so it

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.460 
is you haven't done that many so it
should<00:02:25.239> be<00:02:25.270> very<00:02:25.390> interesting<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:26.260> see

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
should be very interesting to see

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.510 
should be very interesting to see
because<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:27.280> isn't<00:02:27.670> necessarily<00:02:29.220> all<00:02:30.220> about

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
because it isn't necessarily all about

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.120 
because it isn't necessarily all about
age<00:02:30.760> yes<00:02:31.570> experience<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.260> important<00:02:32.800> because

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
age yes experience is important because

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.729 
age yes experience is important because
we<00:02:33.370> found<00:02:33.750> these<00:02:34.750> young<00:02:34.989> kids<00:02:35.230> they've<00:02:35.560> got

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
what would our view is what what would

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.260 
what would our view is what what would
the<00:06:13.590> difference<00:06:13.770> be<00:06:14.040> to<00:06:14.490> our<00:06:14.610> viewers<00:06:14.700> well

accelerator but that that's the main

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.790 
accelerator but that that's the main
difference<00:06:44.940> the<00:06:45.780> suspension<00:06:46.380> is<00:06:46.470> probably

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
difference the suspension is probably

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.370
