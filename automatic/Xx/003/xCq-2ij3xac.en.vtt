00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 the party light is already on the inside 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.810
 I already have balance in it 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.550
 aroused and what can it be today in 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.389
 go straight ahead 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.969
 it's about dancing you know yes I am 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.740
 explain and explain things very well 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.449
 that's why it's not terrible 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 to explain dancing 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.740
 whole thing learning by doing but with 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.519
 following steps with the following do's 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.039
 and dont's and tips from an expert 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.590
 nor can it go wrong 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.660
 my first tip is your dance style 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 at the occasion and of course to the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 to adapt music for example would be it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.800
 maybe not so fit if you can 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.500
 should be in the retirement home and there at 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.100
 Participating in a dance course has done that 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.100
 to begin 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.000
 although everyone's his 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.090
 Very important when dancing is power 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.120
 just what feels good in what 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.770
 you feel good but there is also 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.220
 a few dawns that by no means 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.770
 should never do there with one 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.320
 glass in hand way 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.660
 I did that with one 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.940
 full glass after the first refrain was 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.080
 My glass is empty and takes face 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.090
 In general, many people always dance cool 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.100
 is their glassy else comes the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.960
 you also go as far as your basics 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.300
 stay as soon as you start yours 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.910
 hands moving wild or too 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.280
 create breakdance or something similar 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.440
 could be difficult too 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.880
 At home you can do everything 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.990
 try as you want but if you 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.619
 somehow at a dance event 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.810
 since dance event at a party 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.240
 in the disco or in the retirement home 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.460
 I would not mind you anything crazy 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.110
 try to practice this only when at home 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.740
 you then have to get out of it 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.240
 you give the full but remains 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.539
 in your basics everyone has meanwhile 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.069
 an iphone or a camera and access 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.959
 to the internet and you do not want that 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:06.819
 next viral videos are though girl 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:11.870
 trying to dance with only sixteen 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:14.900
 Failing the clicks in you is certainly worthwhile 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.599
 inappropriate dressing looks that you the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.640
 have matching clothes for the dance 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.470
 direction or the things that i do 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.069
 was wondering who wanted to make her the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.050
 dance 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.280
 Well, if you can only do the basics 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.530
 you actually wear what you want 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.530
 but do you really want in high heels 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.530
 stagger 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.709
 is that really a good idea in one? 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.140
 skinny jeans go for a balancing act 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.730
 yes i even had bradley smith 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.459
 but i already forgot my knee 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.330
 and it can not be forgotten 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.980
 Do not knee protect for breakdancing 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.360
 unfortunately next time maybe 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.549
 By the way, so I actually 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.590
 I've been dancing since I can walk 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.040
 I'm already with diapers when I see 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.379
 could 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.239
 next to the toaster who was very old and 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.269
 always mature peter patt have made 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.190
 I have always given a book in the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.019
 At least my mum shows me diapers 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.120
 I have with such stories that 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.849
 feel that they are very exaggerated 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.769
 I was sure just next to the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.260
 toaster and my mom has me 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.150
 Shake this comedy dance to it 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.400
 which baby dance determines to one 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.120
 toaster music I do not even like it now 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.340
 techno or so and guys music why 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.829
 should I baby did indeed halt 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.959
 address as me about you I 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.489
 bring the expert 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.290
 you're right container I'm sorry 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.560
 it's not about me today 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.940
 you are the expert so tell us 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.709
 but what are current trends - 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.389
 the trend had to be in the disco 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:49.879
 For example, if any can do 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:49.879
 song comes for example you know the nhl web 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:57.840
 darling you call the vips song or 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:03.949
 no or you know the ibiza clinic 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.949
 in the angle winkels the penny 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.040
 winke wave exactly how I mean it 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.989
 Every year there is some new trend 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.340
 dance move and once you get it on it 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.590
 you can still get him the next 5 10 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.840
 15 20 years time and again brings 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.490
 maybe it's worth the time to 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.509
 but I think that will happen 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.280
 do not last as long as now 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:40.120
 example of the macarena that is already 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:42.070
 Real hardcore is always cool because you 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.780
 Can dance with the cool kids 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.100
 but if you feel uncomfortable and like that 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.960
 a person feels the beck then can 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.850
 Maybe you can leave it alone 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.160
 The main thing is that you yourself 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.110
 has fun that you feel comfortable and 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.630
 if you are not the best dancer 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.669
 but you have a lot of fun and 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.860
 you show that and the other people 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.660
 see then it does not matter if 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.310
 he is in a hurry good dance or not 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.930
 but you have fun and can 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.550
 have fun with other people 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.550
