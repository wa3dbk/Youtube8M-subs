00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.309
 that would have been able to Android weaknesses 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.960
 Today I want to introduce the Samsung Galaxy 3 to you 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.609
 is Life with Old Android and around you it has the three commands 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.679
 2-megapixel camera here is the run of the years 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.499
 and the bullfights 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.729
 gear 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:34.960
 here to the usb port and here you can turn off the phone and 2 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.850
 around 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.810
 outwardly we see too 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.370
 that this whole thing has a plastic bag case 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.930
 and that's just always a bit problematic because then there are synonymous 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.790
 automatically 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.290
 Schmidinger 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.260
 so and I have it if only because both sides can so easy 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.910
 Click on it and unlock it when we click on the camera mode 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.290
 be honored that 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.290
 how is actually relatively short 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.370
 So it's enough 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.500
 So percent that camera percent 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.400
 under mobile phone 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.830
 Camara he usually does not wait that many 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.090
 on the phone are already many as preinstalled so so for example 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.810
 Wittenstein the mail services and all the google services so Gmail 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.020
 Google Maps 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.240
 and so on and so on, everything is already 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.390
 preprogrammed 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.730
 Anyone who wants to become one of Thailand now has to go to those markets 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.630
 and there it will stop 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 all android 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.470
 so and around 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.130
 Turinsky far below end ko-round and talked to him all that is all 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.140
 it 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.380
 The internet is running quite fast, it always comes up a bit 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.880
 whether you are now close to w-lan router or he has gone further and around that 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.870
 But mobile internet is very fluent and fast you can son 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.049
 St 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.669
 Year and I hereby unit just the homescreen how to stop children 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:31.900

 at the settings you can just ringtones and so on 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.689
 set everything 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.939
 who pays with mobile phones also figuratively is therefore just normal cell phone here 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.309
 nothing is valid 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.559
 extra or so 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.469
 the special thing about this phone is that 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.069
 PÃ¶lten is relatively cheap for what so it can be pretty flees
