and I got like 50 of them in here I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630 
and I got like 50 of them in here I
think<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:33.720> 48<00:00:34.410> but<00:00:34.710> nears<00:00:35.400> makes

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
think it's actually 48 but nears makes

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.110 
think it's actually 48 but nears makes
no<00:00:35.790> difference<00:00:37.520> they<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.730> look<00:00:39.000> really

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
no difference they all look really

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.640 
no difference they all look really
healthy<00:00:39.840> they're<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.170> moving<00:00:40.470> around

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
they're a little small and I thought

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.350 
they're a little small and I thought
they<00:00:42.600> might<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.380> I<00:00:43.410> probably<00:00:43.650> should<00:00:43.980> have

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
they might be but I probably should have

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.700 
they might be but I probably should have
figured<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.600> when<00:00:46.020> they<00:00:46.200> were<00:00:46.380> called

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
figured that out when they were called

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.880 
figured that out when they were called

time they got off this thing was picked
clean<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:04.080> cyano

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
clean of cyano

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.070 
clean of cyano
I<00:04:04.830> also<00:04:05.190> had<00:04:05.340> one<00:04:05.400> little<00:04:05.790> hermit<00:04:06.239> crab<00:04:06.599> moved

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
I also had one little hermit crab moved

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.680 
I also had one little hermit crab moved
to<00:04:07.230> this<00:04:07.379> little<00:04:07.680> spot<00:04:07.980> right<00:04:08.700> here<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.300> he

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
to this little spot right here and he

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.080 
to this little spot right here and he
hung<00:04:09.900> out<00:04:10.019> here<00:04:10.290> for<00:04:10.500> days<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.370> he<00:04:11.760> cleared

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
hung out here for days and he cleared

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.089 
hung out here for days and he cleared
this<00:04:12.300> whole<00:04:12.470> section<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.590> cyanobacteria

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
this whole section of cyanobacteria

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.229 
this whole section of cyanobacteria
which<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:15.300> really<00:04:16.019> awesome

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
which is really awesome

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.390 
which is really awesome
so<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.509> conclusion<00:04:19.229> I'm<00:04:19.559> really<00:04:19.949> happy<00:04:20.249> with

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
so in conclusion I'm really happy with

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.069 
so in conclusion I'm really happy with
the<00:04:20.489> reef<00:04:20.669> cleaner<00:04:20.969> pack<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.569> it's<00:04:21.870> probably

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
the reef cleaner pack and it's probably

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.390 
the reef cleaner pack and it's probably
stuff<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:22.409> I<00:04:22.469> should<00:04:22.650> have<00:04:22.740> invested<00:04:23.159> in

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
stuff that I should have invested in

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.850 
stuff that I should have invested in
a long<00:04:23.669> time<00:04:24.030> my<00:04:24.870> suggestion<00:04:25.440> would<00:04:25.530> be<00:04:25.590> if

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
a long time my suggestion would be if

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.570 
a long time my suggestion would be if
you're<00:04:26.009> thinking<00:04:26.370> about<00:04:26.840> getting<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:28.580> reef

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
you're thinking about getting a reef

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.180 
you're thinking about getting a reef
cleaner<00:04:29.910> pack<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:31.110> should<00:04:31.290> start<00:04:31.620> small<00:04:31.979> on<00:04:32.160> a

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
cleaner pack you should start small on a

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.370 
cleaner pack you should start small on a
new<00:04:32.430> tank<00:04:32.729> but<00:04:33.000> once<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.270> start<00:04:33.479> getting<00:04:33.960> to

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
new tank but once you start getting to

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.219 
new tank but once you start getting to
an<00:04:34.530> older<00:04:34.889> tank<00:04:35.160> like<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.550> have<00:04:35.810> definitely<00:04:36.810> put

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
an older tank like I have definitely put

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.870 
an older tank like I have definitely put
some<00:04:37.410> money<00:04:37.560> into<00:04:37.770> this<00:04:37.889> this<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.580> something

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
some money into this this is something

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.189 
some money into this this is something
I've<00:04:38.940> been<00:04:39.000> putting<00:04:39.360> off<00:04:39.419> for<00:04:39.479> years<00:04:39.930> and

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
I've been putting off for years and

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.560 
I've been putting off for years and
really<00:04:40.410> shouldn't<00:04:40.770> have<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.729> changes<00:04:42.360> I've

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
really shouldn't have the changes I've

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.249 
really shouldn't have the changes I've
seen<00:04:42.830> just<00:04:43.830> in<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:43.979> last<00:04:44.039> week<00:04:44.520> have<00:04:44.820> been

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
seen just in the last week have been

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.210 
seen just in the last week have been
dramatic<00:04:46.259> and<00:04:46.440> I<00:04:46.530> think<00:04:46.800> that<00:04:46.919> will<00:04:47.009> build

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
dramatic and I think that will build

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.659 
dramatic and I think that will build
over<00:04:47.430> time<00:04:48.500> I'm<00:04:49.500> also<00:04:49.770> considering<00:04:50.310> placing

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
over time I'm also considering placing

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.520 
over time I'm also considering placing
another<00:04:51.090> order<00:04:51.509> here<00:04:51.720> in<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.870> future<00:04:52.050> to

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
another order here in the future to

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.430 
another order here in the future to
really<00:04:53.250> double<00:04:54.180> down<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.660> get<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:54.930> tank<00:04:55.259> to

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
really double down and get this tank to

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.180 
really double down and get this tank to
where<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.710> needs<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.010> be<00:04:56.870> but<00:04:57.979> everything<00:04:58.979> said

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
where it needs to be but everything said

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.909 
where it needs to be but everything said
