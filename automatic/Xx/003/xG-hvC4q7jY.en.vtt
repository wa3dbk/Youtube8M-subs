in<00:00:57.300> creative<00:00:57.719> mode<00:00:57.780> by<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.320> way<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.770> you're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
in creative mode by the way if you're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.670 
in creative mode by the way if you're
wondering<00:00:58.980> what's<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.609> on<00:01:00.469> so<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
wondering what's going on so this is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.119 
wondering what's going on so this is
really<00:01:02.039> cool<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.629> exposed<00:01:04.199> iron<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
really cool all this exposed iron and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.039 
really cool all this exposed iron and
it's<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:06.000> weed<00:01:06.330> scrolling<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:08.930> think<00:01:09.930> it's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
it's little weed scrolling I think it's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.109 
it's little weed scrolling I think it's
pretty<00:01:10.229> cool<00:01:10.560> when<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> first<00:01:11.640> came<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.090> here

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
pretty cool when the first came in here

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.109 
pretty cool when the first came in here
so<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.810> again<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.260> didn't<00:01:13.920> notice<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.580> there<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
so I again I didn't notice that there I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.780 
so I again I didn't notice that there I
need<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.840> ended<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.350> entering<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.520> cave

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
nice blue texture very classic just try

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.410 
nice blue texture very classic just try
and<00:02:01.860> kill<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> too<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> stopped<00:02:03.149> doing

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and kill it too so it stopped doing

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.420 
and kill it too so it stopped doing
lately<00:02:03.719> and

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.250 

that's<00:02:08.430> what<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.820> want<00:02:09.060> isn't<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.540> okay<00:02:10.640> okay

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
that's what we want isn't it okay okay

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.880 
that's what we want isn't it okay okay
okay<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:15.690> there's<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.020> spawner<00:02:16.440> here<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.800> i

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
okay and so there's a spawner here so i

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.120 
okay and so there's a spawner here so i
presume<00:02:17.100> that's<00:02:17.460> just<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.590> normal<00:02:19.590> spore

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
presume that's just like a normal spore

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.560 
presume that's just like a normal spore
know<00:02:20.310> as<00:02:20.490> we<00:02:20.670> will<00:02:20.850> use<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:23.120> some<00:02:24.120> flooding

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
know as we will use to and some flooding

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.940
