00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.940 
and I'm going to continue my look at
emulators<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.020> this<00:00:07.020> time<00:00:07.230> i'm<00:00:07.500> looking<00:00:07.799> at<00:00:07.890> a

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
emulators and this time i'm looking at a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.009 
emulators and this time i'm looking at a
Nintendo<00:00:08.700> Entertainment<00:00:08.940> System<00:00:09.360> emulator

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
Nintendo Entertainment System emulator

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.770 
Nintendo Entertainment System emulator
very<00:00:10.889> classic<00:00:11.540> ancient<00:00:12.540> console<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:14.780> it's

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
very classic ancient console and it's

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.300 
very classic ancient console and it's
kind<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> surprising<00:00:16.109> actually<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.070> starting

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
kind of surprising actually and starting

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.890 
kind of surprising actually and starting
to<00:00:17.340> get<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> age<00:00:17.789> where<00:00:17.820> there<00:00:18.480> are<00:00:18.600> people

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
to get to the age where there are people

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.470 
to get to the age where there are people
who<00:00:18.990> haven't<00:00:19.289> played<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.680> or<00:00:19.910> born<00:00:20.910> around<00:00:21.029> for

at<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.990> via<00:00:25.350> emulation<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.359> there<00:00:27.359> are

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
at it is via emulation and there are

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.560 
at it is via emulation and there are
many<00:00:28.400> nintendo<00:00:29.400> emulator<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.179> nintendo

many nintendo emulator and nintendo

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.010 
many nintendo emulator and nintendo
emulators<00:00:30.990> out<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:32.030> fce<00:00:33.030> ultra<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.750> another

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
emulators out there fce ultra is another

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.580 
emulators out there fce ultra is another
mentionable<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> nest<00:00:37.260> achill

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
mentionable one and so is a nest achill

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.910 
mentionable one and so is a nest achill
but<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:39.480> was<00:00:39.930> based<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> pond<00:00:40.890> with

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
but that was based on a pond with

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.160 
but that was based on a pond with
testicle<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.660> whatever<00:00:43.340> what<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.460> got<00:00:44.610> here

please and of course filters and having
a<00:00:59.969> filter<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:01.219> necessary<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.370> my<00:01:02.460> opinion<00:01:03.530> for

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
a filter is necessary in my opinion for

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.160 
a filter is necessary in my opinion for
these<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.129> games<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:07.020> because

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
these kind of games and you know because

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
these kind of games and you know because
a<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:08.040> anti-aliasing<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.270> there

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
a little anti-aliasing here and there

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.289 
a little anti-aliasing here and there
and<00:01:09.720> redrawing<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> graphics<00:01:11.520> yeah<00:01:12.150> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and redrawing of the graphics yeah I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
and redrawing of the graphics yeah I
think<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.990> makes<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> look<00:01:13.439> makes<00:01:13.920> these

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
think this makes it look makes these

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.120 
think this makes it look makes these
older<00:01:14.369> games<00:01:14.659> look<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.840> much<00:01:15.930> better<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.409> make

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
older games look so much better and make

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.609 
older games look so much better and make
them<00:01:17.250> more<00:01:17.400> playable<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.470> what<00:01:19.470> are<00:01:19.530> we

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
them more playable so what are we

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
them more playable so what are we
playing<00:01:19.799> today<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.310> don't<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
playing today I don't know just going to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.690 
playing today I don't know just going to
play<00:01:22.080> some<00:01:22.880> recent<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.409> tell<00:01:25.619> or<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
play some recent as you can tell or you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.800 
play some recent as you can tell or you
can't<00:01:26.909> quite<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.240> actually<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.689> it's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
can't quite see it actually because it's

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
sort of along the lines of my emulating

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.210 
sort of along the lines of my emulating
habits<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.820> did<00:01:39.180> play<00:01:39.360> through<00:01:39.570> Coker<00:01:39.840> on
