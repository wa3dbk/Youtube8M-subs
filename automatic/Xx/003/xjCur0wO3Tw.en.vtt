the main reason i alternate is because

the second tier I chose earth grabs on
this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.220> due<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> fact<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.049> be

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
this is due to the fact that it can be

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.570 
this is due to the fact that it can be

minor<00:04:55.170> problems<00:04:55.560> I've<00:04:55.940> chosen<00:04:56.940> this<00:04:57.180> before

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
minor problems I've chosen this before

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.270 
minor problems I've chosen this before
but<00:04:57.840> since<00:04:58.470> they<00:04:58.590> can<00:04:58.710> meet<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.830> spell<00:04:59.100> the

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
stops taking it ticklish text is really

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.970 
stops taking it ticklish text is really
good<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.970> picking<00:05:03.570> up<00:05:03.840> would<00:05:04.200> also<00:05:04.350> be<00:05:04.950> good

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
good so picking up would also be good

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.870 
good so picking up would also be good
