00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.760
 the term cyclic cis comes from the clinical sugar 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.280
 and it makes reference to some of the chemical reactions 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.009
 what happens in mexico plasma 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.980
 who make up a glucose molecule of this carbon status 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.249
 in two pir acid molecules located 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.249
 of three we act carbon each 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.380
 in the process 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.480
 day reactions are made 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.749
 which will be catalyzed each 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.930
 for a very small specific 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.910
 cis group reactions use two AT &amp; T molecules 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.490
 but they produce 4 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.700
 remaining as logical gain 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.440
 two molecules of acteck 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.540
 that is to say 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.020
 phosphorylation at the substrate level 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.020
 The essential characteristics of the process are 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.690
 the first three stages of publicis 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.780
 are the vision of a phosphate group that is 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.240
 glucose phosphorylation 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.090
 thus having its conversion to fructose 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.950
 and adhering a phosphate group back to this last fruits 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.760
 this requires an input of energy that will be two pp molecules 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.580
 who will become a cadet 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.040
 the third one in the process is going to be in charge of the speed with which 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.460
 is carried out 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.700
 and this time 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 the year are fruit kinas 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.270
 when yesterday's concentration is missing 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.430
 the activity will be higher 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.440
 surgical acid 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.790
 and the weight art will have 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.820
 on the other hand 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.390
 when the art that is high 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.580
 Enzyme activity is low 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.140
 and most of the glucose phosphate 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.820
 you pass the group g 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.140
 for storage instead of its catalysis 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.120
 producing pepe 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.120
 this process is called glycogenesis 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.800
 the doubly phosphorylated fructose molecule 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.490
 is divided into two compounds of three carbon atoms above heights 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.679
 these goddesses molecules 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.279
 soler that three phosphate will be read 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.229
 and there troops and acted the pit 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.339
 that is, these molecules are inter-convertible 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.069
 but to have a greater amount of there will be read three phosphate 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.359
 it will be converted by means of several processes in the cicop indicated 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:31.839
 then an oscillation occurs in the two old molecules 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.759
 catÃ¡n two parents of electrons and hydrogen ions from a molecule 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.449
 de visceral de and hotels inns 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.469
 producing two smaller molecules 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.459
 and two molecules of acid 1 3 difonso vicentico 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.419
 here it is important that the mnac cr occident 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.009
 because it is going to depend on this that the futures of 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.389
 actions of kohl's act 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.149
 the spray of the mnar 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.329
 is produced by the fermentation to colca hello tic 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.540
 comes cellular respiration at the level of the transportation chain of 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.589
 electrons 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.259
 and so we can finally get four AT &amp; T molecules 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.320
 and he has been critical 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.070
