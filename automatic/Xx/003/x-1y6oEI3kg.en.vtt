00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.440
 would be nice of hamburg. free true. altervista.org 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.679
 and what I would like to present to you today 3 the widget widget blog 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.759
 of the samsung ue the protest 8500 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.689
 let's start from the apple I will take the initial presentation what I have 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.489
 made with first impressions 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.659
 there were also difficulties because I did not know the phone well 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.759
 actually putting and removing widgets is not at all 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.820
 it is difficult for example to take Lombard 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.090
 to hold it down if you see we can't move 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.620
 where we want and we can also remove it and it is really simple to put it 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.690
 in the same way you take widgets they mind 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.770
 in the vagina the whole is very very simple 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.020
 there is one thing to say that what I said even in the first impressions i 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.510
 widgets are very very short 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.280
 el putmente are very sloppy and maybe even I would say little 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.370
 in some way I go in some way into the faces of the monster of the agenda 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.580
 yes nice see the agenda day however dott 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.180
 underneath an idea of 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.760
 and the next appointments written on the agenda would be useful 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.750
 or I don't even know the most visited sites are nice but it would be a would 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.560
 nice and still pictures close in short 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.549
 Chinese and then there are relatively few or say that the really nice one 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.210
 this date of birth also here 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.740
 and there is a little comb I think mdc the three 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.420
 and placenta birthdays you tell me for tomorrow's birthdays because 11 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.030
 and you won't like a fourth day but you didn't tell me I miss you I can't 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.940
 go see a list 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.590
 and the list of bb cont baby birthdays in the coming days this is a 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.230
 something that somehow 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.270
 restricts 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.400
 also the weather clock 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.390
 you need to put the dual clock as a widget then here 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.429
 you should and touch to add the clock of some other nationality 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.290
 there is no 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.289
 marco instead simple clock watch% so this 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.309
 and it doesn't help 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:22.589
 and this is a very nice msn you widget instead of this one 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:23.899
 contacts because 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.499
 and not only are there photos but reports - see the latest 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.629
 the latest registered on faacebook so it really is really 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.469
 el well done and this really beautiful this is very beautiful 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.469
 this smoothness that exists 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.079
 but this is not the case 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.469
 man can collector actually rss 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:51.289
 is 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.859
 why 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:58.889
 to be able to put here on the display this is a married man with reader

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.009
 but bring the vowels plus this is the synchronization of the mails 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:09.039
 tecnimed is another of the things that really this 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.199

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.139
 message 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.320

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.799

 approve listen to write new ones to you then 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:14.259
 to say that the keyboard is very simple to use for now 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:20.900
 but vertically little goat and then every now and then it happens d xd to make a little mistake 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.000
 the sense of touch 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.819
 3 years 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:24.520
 blog 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.800

 offices the real tab apapar c 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.300
 I do some practice and while it is absolutely not true network name 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.379
 you write it 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.379
 I do 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.240
 for now and then I can't take an example 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.240
 a 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:58.809

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.979
 writing 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.819
 vertical Cossacks there is absolutely no horizontal writing 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.819
 the keyboard is very wide and writing 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.460
 writing is really much simpler but not only much more 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.710
 simple but I would say very very nice too 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:29.599

 duomo concia absolutely must provide here too 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.800

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.310
 one writing doors with vertical and between 29 without will take care of you two
