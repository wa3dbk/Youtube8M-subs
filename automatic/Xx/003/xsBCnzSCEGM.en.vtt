00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
really cool but they're not really

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.659

something<00:02:30.440> going<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.680> be<00:02:30.709> using<00:02:31.190> although<00:02:31.519> it

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:31.669 
something going to be using although it

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:32.980 
something going to be using although it
is<00:02:31.790> nice<00:02:32.060> and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
gives it a good excuse probably not to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.550 
gives it a good excuse probably not to
put<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.360> gimmick<00:02:35.690> on<00:02:35.780> anywhere<00:02:36.170> else<00:02:36.320> on<00:02:36.470> the
