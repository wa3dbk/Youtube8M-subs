00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
chunks with strange nail and water let

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.020 
chunks with strange nail and water let
this<00:03:53.570> cook<00:03:53.840> on<00:03:54.110> low<00:03:54.380> flame<00:03:54.650> for<00:03:55.130> about<00:03:55.190> five<00:03:55.760> to

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
this cook on low flame for about five to

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.060 
this cook on low flame for about five to
seven<00:03:56.239> minutes<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:56.959> that<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.739> soya<00:03:57.950> chunks

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
seven minutes so that the soya chunks

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.280 
seven minutes so that the soya chunks
can<00:03:58.610> nicely<00:03:58.850> soak<00:03:59.360> up<00:03:59.570> all<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.959> spices

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
can nicely soak up all the spices

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.560 
can nicely soak up all the spices
because<00:04:01.280> your<00:04:01.579> burritos<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.180> tomatoes<00:04:02.540> are

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
because your burritos and tomatoes are

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.350 
because your burritos and tomatoes are
almost<00:04:03.049> cooked<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:03.709> we<00:04:04.459> will<00:04:04.670> add<00:04:04.850> this<00:04:05.090> at<00:04:05.329> a

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
almost cooked so we will add this at a

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.470 
almost cooked so we will add this at a
later<00:04:05.720> stage<00:04:06.489> now<00:04:07.489> we<00:04:07.549> just<00:04:07.910> couldn't<00:04:08.120> let<00:04:08.329> the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
later stage now we just couldn't let the

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.650 
later stage now we just couldn't let the
soya<00:04:08.690> chunks<00:04:08.810> soak<00:04:09.440> up<00:04:09.650> all<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:10.040> spices<00:04:10.660> so

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
soya chunks soak up all the spices so

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.720 
soya chunks soak up all the spices so
chunks<00:04:12.049> are<00:04:12.170> extremely<00:04:12.680> healthy<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.459> know

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
chunks are extremely healthy so you know

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.190 
chunks are extremely healthy so you know
you<00:04:13.790> should

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
you should

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.199 
you should
include<00:04:14.470> these<00:04:14.680> once<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.250> week<00:04:15.430> they<00:04:15.910> are<00:04:15.970> very

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
include these once a week they are very

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.349 
include these once a week they are very
high<00:04:16.510> in<00:04:16.720> protein<00:04:17.230> and<00:04:17.700> kids<00:04:18.700> kind<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.120> love

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
high in protein and kids kind of love

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.659 
high in protein and kids kind of love
this<00:04:19.739> vegetarians<00:04:20.739> also<00:04:20.889> have<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> good<00:04:21.459> take

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
this vegetarians also have a good take

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.090 
this vegetarians also have a good take
at<00:04:21.850> this<00:04:22.000> because<00:04:22.240> it<00:04:23.080> kind<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.560> feels<00:04:23.830> like

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
at this because it kind of feels like
