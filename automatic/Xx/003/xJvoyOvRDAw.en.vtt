00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.569 
surfaces and the two lengths are the
same<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.380> concave<00:01:47.040> underside

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
same and one the concave underside

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.510 
same and one the concave underside
surface<00:01:48.020> bends<00:01:49.020> more<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> top<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.220> has<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
surface bends more so the top it has to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
surface bends more so the top it has to
stretch<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.060> ultimately<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.750> get

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
stretch and ultimately you can get

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.539 
stretch and ultimately you can get
separation<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.770> two<00:01:52.920> layers<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.399> leather

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
separation of the two layers of leather

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.539 
separation of the two layers of leather
on<00:01:53.990> there<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.170> either<00:01:55.530> way<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:56.009> hope

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
on there so either way not good hope

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
on there so either way not good hope
