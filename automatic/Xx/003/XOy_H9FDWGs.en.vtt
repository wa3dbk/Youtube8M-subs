00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.729
 reply 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.290
 in culture 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.290
 as you can see is a device 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.480
 does not have metals rather with resins or polymer plastics 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 in the back 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.090
 your silver nails 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 with senna died 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.409
 we see that in your opinion it was 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.730
 interface that is a simple phone 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.730
 we do not have so many buttons we do not have so many wikileaks 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.280

 the interface api is simple 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:46.629
