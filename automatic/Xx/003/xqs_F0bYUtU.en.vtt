00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
the yoke to the desk and now we'll move

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.100 
the yoke to the desk and now we'll move
on<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:18.020> throttle<00:02:19.240> quadrant

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
on to the throttle quadrant

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.370 
on to the throttle quadrant
here<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.130> throttle<00:02:22.550> quadrants<00:02:24.100> we<00:02:25.100> have

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
here is the throttle quadrants we have

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.220 
here is the throttle quadrants we have
throttle<00:02:28.720> drop<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.960> mixture<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:32.270> can<00:02:32.450> just

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
throttle drop a mixture and you can just
