00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
to have children which is helpful but as

to have children which is helpful but as
many<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.760> far<00:00:27.420> too<00:00:27.449> simplified<00:00:28.039> so

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
many of you know far too simplified so

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.740 
many of you know far too simplified so
let's<00:00:29.189> dig<00:00:29.369> deeper<00:00:29.699> look<00:00:30.119> at<00:00:30.210> puberty<00:00:30.420> stage

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
let's dig deeper look at puberty stage

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.500 
let's dig deeper look at puberty stage
by<00:00:30.900> stage<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.470> why<00:00:31.890> not<00:00:32.040> use<00:00:32.189> an<00:00:32.309> analogy

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
by stage and why not use an analogy

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.880 
by stage and why not use an analogy
marathons<00:00:33.510> because<00:00:34.200> that's<00:00:34.440> what<00:00:34.590> purity

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
marathons because that's what purity

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.280 
marathons because that's what purity
feels<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.280> long<00:00:35.910> drawn<00:00:36.450> out<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.840> you've<00:00:37.260> got

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
feels like long drawn out and you've got

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.560 
feels like long drawn out and you've got
signing<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.010> soon<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> starts<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
signing up as soon as it starts not that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.420 
signing up as soon as it starts not that
there<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:39.780> ever<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.140> sign<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> choice<00:00:41.219> for

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
there was ever a sign up or a choice for

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.690 
there was ever a sign up or a choice for
that<00:00:41.489> matter<00:00:42.739> now<00:00:43.739> everybody<00:00:44.309> knows<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
that matter now everybody knows that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.340 
that matter now everybody knows that
puberty<00:00:45.090> has<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.539> hormones<00:00:45.960> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
puberty has to do with hormones so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680 
puberty has to do with hormones so
that'll<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> start<00:00:47.280> Genaro<00:00:48.270> chopping

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that'll be the start Genaro chopping

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.240 
that'll be the start Genaro chopping
