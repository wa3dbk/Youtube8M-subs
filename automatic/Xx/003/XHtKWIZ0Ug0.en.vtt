00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
here in England it's difficult to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
here in England it's difficult to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
the center that can have the possibility

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.770

to<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.780> full<00:02:35.410> capacity<00:02:35.560> of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
to to have the full capacity of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.370 
to to have the full capacity of
wonderful<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:38.610> think<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.820> for<00:02:40.600> both<00:02:40.780> team<00:02:41.080> and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
wonderful I think that for both team and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.990 
wonderful I think that for both team and
they<00:02:41.500> must<00:02:41.650> be<00:02:41.800> proud<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.190> their<00:02:42.520> supporters

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
they must be proud of their supporters

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.090 
they must be proud of their supporters
because<00:02:43.420> i<00:02:43.720> think<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.230> they<00:02:44.920> had<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.160> least

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
because i think that they had a least

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.030 
because i think that they had a least
35,000<00:02:48.100> support<00:02:48.550> each<00:02:48.760> team<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:50.290> really<00:02:50.770> if

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
35,000 support each team so really if

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.510 
35,000 support each team so really if
you'll<00:02:51.310> tell<00:02:52.030> me<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.390> before<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:53.140> final<00:02:54.040> is
