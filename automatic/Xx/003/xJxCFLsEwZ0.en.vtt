00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello swami 3 crafter you now 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.400
 show incredible mechanism minecraft 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.010
 this is the flying sand of the brain you see the sand 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.250
 flies here all sides okay you saw 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.089
 lever in general, I now thought about this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.199
 things like update after which you can 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.880
 was put on under the blocks under the blocks 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.880
 levers straight at them 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.369
 that is, so here and because if 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.759
 do so like this so much so sand 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.759
 nepot 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.559
 so the sand does not fall, that is, at least that you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.600
 do here but with the help of ordinary 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.760
 moles technology that is about like this 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.210
 I just do not want to put a lever under 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.559
 and so I used this 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.559
 a thing like a blog 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.910
 command and put the sand on the lever then 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.170
 there look this is super disguised 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.880
 lever and don't know you can use 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.250
 how do you want an hour show how to do it 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.240
 very very easy to do that is 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.990
 take expose like this 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.659
 so apple i need so here is the difference from 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.810
 blocks choose here any block and under 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.740
 put him a lever and I do not know what you can 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.340
 still put something like this 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:40.350
 let's see the pot you are not standing in the air 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.600
 well let's check it out no but 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.780
 the pot on me rain means so gossamer 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:53.209
 oh cobweb legs what if we do with 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.890
 cobwebs look sand does not fall 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.890
 but i think if interacts on it 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.510
 arrested he will fall no 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.050
 or update it let's attack in the street 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.360
 not so not update so update 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.360
 that is, see the sand does not fall 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.590
 but we are not about that we are now leverage that 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.400
 let's also take a quick look 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:32.810
 what else can I do that I donâ€™t even know 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.810
 seemingly nothing in principle 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.900
 and by the way the idea on the web can 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.900
 to match 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.440
 they are sand 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.030
 on therefore 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.030
 it was done in vain alright 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.159
 the sun is straight 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.480
 screen so look here is our sand we 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.909
 put sand on the lever and thereby 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.530
 made an incredible phenomenon minecraft 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:09.489
 this is flying sand so let's see 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.489
 what else is interesting 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.600
 I don't know what else can do 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.370
 it's weird let's land like ours 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.520
 there will be a flying cactus on the flying sand 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.530
 which 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.350
 holding a lever that is not on anything 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.120
 holds besides sand which is sand 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.450
 holding onto the lever while snarling and holding onto 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.920
 sand in general i don't know how it is 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.960
 explain but this is minecraft physics well 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.120
 that's basically all we are here it is not 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.650
 maybe he himself broke okay that's all for everyone 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.650
 thanks for watching bye
