00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
putting the camera in upside down it can

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.750 
putting the camera in upside down it can
only<00:04:03.570> go<00:04:03.870> in<00:04:04.020> one<00:04:04.050> way<00:04:04.490> so<00:04:05.490> what<00:04:05.580> we're<00:04:05.670> going

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.630 

now<00:05:11.550> we<00:05:11.610> will<00:05:11.910> replace<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.950> two<00:05:13.980> screws<00:05:14.190> we

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
now we will replace the two screws we

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:27.580

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
pop-and-lock right back up into the same

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:59.260 
pop-and-lock right back up into the same
position<00:05:35.470> take<00:05:36.470> our<00:05:36.650> 10<00:05:36.830> millimeter<00:05:37.250> bolts

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
now we're going to reinstall the linkage

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.279 
now we're going to reinstall the linkage
arms<00:06:01.650> we<00:06:02.580> just<00:06:02.729> drop<00:06:02.940> the<00:06:03.060> linkage<00:06:03.330> arm<00:06:03.509> back

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
arms we just drop the linkage arm back

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.010 
arms we just drop the linkage arm back
into<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.680> hole<00:06:05.300> and<00:06:06.300> then<00:06:06.419> it<00:06:06.509> swivels<00:06:06.930> around

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
into the hole and then it swivels around

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.260 
into the hole and then it swivels around
and<00:06:07.440> clips<00:06:07.949> onto<00:06:08.160> the<00:06:08.340> arm<00:06:10.819> do<00:06:11.819> that<00:06:11.970> to<00:06:12.090> both

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
and clips onto the arm do that to both

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.189 
and clips onto the arm do that to both
sides

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.449 

next<00:06:17.199> you're<00:06:17.289> going<00:06:17.379> to<00:06:17.469> want<00:06:17.679> to<00:06:17.769> test<00:06:18.039> the

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:18.459 
next you're going to want to test the

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:20.039 
next you're going to want to test the
lock<00:06:18.669> make<00:06:19.089> sure<00:06:19.269> all<00:06:19.389> the<00:06:19.509> linkages<00:06:19.839> are

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:20.049 
lock make sure all the linkages are

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:22.469 
lock make sure all the linkages are
working<00:06:20.409> this<00:06:20.889> is<00:06:21.069> the<00:06:21.189> unlock<00:06:21.579> position<00:06:21.609> so

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
working this is the unlock position so

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.359 
working this is the unlock position so
whenever<00:06:22.659> I<00:06:22.779> pull<00:06:22.989> on<00:06:23.019> the<00:06:23.229> handle<00:06:23.439> in<00:06:24.279> the

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:24.369 
whenever I pull on the handle in the

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:25.799 
whenever I pull on the handle in the
show<00:06:24.609> you<00:06:24.879> can<00:06:24.999> see<00:06:25.149> that<00:06:25.299> it<00:06:25.389> pulls<00:06:25.629> the

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:25.809 
show you can see that it pulls the

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:27.869 
show you can see that it pulls the
linkage<00:06:26.109> arms<00:06:26.439> and<00:06:26.679> then<00:06:27.249> when<00:06:27.369> I<00:06:27.399> turn<00:06:27.669> this

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:27.879 
linkage arms and then when I turn this

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.169 
linkage arms and then when I turn this
to<00:06:28.119> the<00:06:28.209> locked<00:06:28.419> position<00:06:30.089> pulling<00:06:31.089> the

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:31.179 
to the locked position pulling the

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:34.339 
to the locked position pulling the
handle<00:06:31.449> does<00:06:31.569> not<00:06:31.779> turn<00:06:32.109> the<00:06:32.229> linkage<00:06:32.499> arms

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
handle does not turn the linkage arms

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:36.509 
handle does not turn the linkage arms
let's<00:06:35.349> go<00:06:35.439> ahead<00:06:35.499> until<00:06:35.739> those<00:06:35.859> tailgate<00:06:36.339> see

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:36.519 
let's go ahead until those tailgate see

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:38.399 
let's go ahead until those tailgate see
we<00:06:36.669> got<00:06:36.789> I'm<00:06:37.359> gonna<00:06:37.479> close<00:06:37.719> the<00:06:37.869> tailgate<00:06:38.019> it's

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409

tailgates<00:06:40.479> not<00:06:40.629> opening<00:06:41.019> I<00:06:41.169> can<00:06:42.099> take<00:06:42.609> unlock

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:43.299 
tailgates not opening I can take unlock

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:46.919 
tailgates not opening I can take unlock
