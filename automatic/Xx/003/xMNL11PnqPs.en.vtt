only<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:34.720> video<00:03:34.930> we<00:03:35.410> have<00:03:35.560> less<00:03:35.830> contacts

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
only in this video we have less contacts

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.970 
only in this video we have less contacts
and<00:03:36.520> less<00:03:37.060> understanding<00:03:37.570> than<00:03:37.810> 30<00:03:38.590> years<00:03:38.740> ago

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
and less understanding than 30 years ago

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.790 
and less understanding than 30 years ago
which<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.400> one<00:03:39.730> generation<00:03:40.120> ago<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:41.170> when

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
which is one generation ago so when

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.010 
which is one generation ago so when
pulse<00:03:42.120> respiration<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.270> think<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.870> lot<00:03:43.900> of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
pulse respiration I think a lot of

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.920 
pulse respiration I think a lot of
people<00:03:44.140> from<00:03:44.560> abroad<00:03:44.740> will<00:03:45.280> say<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:45.970> we<00:03:46.660> are

these are the definition if we could

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.469 
these are the definition if we could
just<00:04:44.360> return<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:45.229> Syria<00:04:45.470> for<00:04:45.889> for<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.909> while

just return to Syria for for a while

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.869 
just return to Syria for for a while
would<00:04:48.169> you<00:04:48.349> say<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:48.919> Syria<00:04:49.580> answer

ideologies you cannot but but one thing
definitely<00:06:50.780> I<00:06:50.810> think<00:06:50.900> if<00:06:51.470> you<00:06:51.860> talk<00:06:52.040> about

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
definitely I think if you talk about

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.270 
definitely I think if you talk about
