I<00:00:08.179> think<00:00:09.179> performers<00:00:09.719> sometimes<00:00:10.170> get<00:00:10.469> tired

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
I think performers sometimes get tired

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.570 
I think performers sometimes get tired
of<00:00:11.660> playing<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.870> role<00:00:12.900> long<00:00:13.889> before<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> public

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
of playing a role long before the public

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.000 
of playing a role long before the public
gets<00:00:15.030> tired<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.450> seeing<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.230> yes<00:00:16.859> I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
gets tired of seeing you do it yes I

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.439 
gets tired of seeing you do it yes I
always<00:00:17.220> think<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.760> two<00:00:18.029> years<00:00:18.300> later

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
always think it's about two years later

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.179 
always think it's about two years later
that<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> public<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.410> gonna<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.740> tired<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
that the public is gonna get tired of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.290 
that the public is gonna get tired of
you<00:00:20.310> yeah<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> think<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.939> think<00:00:20.970> that's<00:00:21.210> probably

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
you yeah I think I think that's probably

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.080 
you yeah I think I think that's probably
although<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> public<00:00:21.960> expect<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:23.090> as

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
although the public expect to have as

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.089 
although the public expect to have as
good<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.359> show<00:00:24.600> as<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> first<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.619> or<00:00:25.830> as<00:00:25.949> good

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
good a show as the first one or as good

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.640 
good a show as the first one or as good
a<00:00:26.130> show<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> best<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.760> every<00:00:26.939> single<00:00:27.210> time

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
a show is the best one every single time

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.720 
a show is the best one every single time

television is from what I hear is really

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.410 
television is from what I hear is really
really<00:04:06.190> restrictive<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.150> moral<00:04:07.360> majority

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
really restrictive in the moral majority

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.479 
really restrictive in the moral majority
and<00:04:07.810> everything<00:04:08.110> it's<00:04:08.590> very<00:04:08.650> hard<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.160> even

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489

on<00:06:20.430> The<00:06:20.550> Young<00:06:20.580> Ones<00:06:21.800> I'm<00:06:22.800> sure<00:06:22.950> they<00:06:23.070> are<00:06:23.100> I

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
on The Young Ones I'm sure they are I

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.950 
on The Young Ones I'm sure they are I
mean<00:06:23.340> we<00:06:23.430> certainly<00:06:23.580> didn't<00:06:24.240> set<00:06:24.600> out<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:24.870> way

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
mean we certainly didn't set out the way

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.390 
mean we certainly didn't set out the way
I<00:06:24.990> just<00:06:25.110> put<00:06:25.530> it<00:06:25.650> we<00:06:25.740> just<00:06:25.920> put<00:06:26.040> in<00:06:26.160> the<00:06:26.250> stuff

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
I just put it we just put in the stuff

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.830 
I just put it we just put in the stuff
that<00:06:26.460> made<00:06:26.760> us<00:06:27.000> laugh<00:06:27.210> and<00:06:27.450> I<00:06:27.510> think<00:06:27.690> that's

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
that made us laugh and I think that's

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.630 
that made us laugh and I think that's
what<00:06:27.930> we<00:06:27.990> can<00:06:28.110> do<00:06:28.260> is<00:06:28.350> just<00:06:28.500> if<00:06:29.310> you<00:06:29.430> try<00:06:29.580> to

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
what we can do is just if you try to

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.040 
what we can do is just if you try to
work<00:06:30.210> out<00:06:30.360> what<00:06:30.480> other<00:06:30.570> people's<00:06:30.840> sense<00:06:30.960> of

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
work out what other people's sense of

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.930 
work out what other people's sense of
humor<00:06:31.260> isn't<00:06:31.530> trying<00:06:31.680> yes<00:06:32.190> you<00:06:32.430> can<00:06:32.580> then<00:06:32.760> what

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
humor isn't trying yes you can then what

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.520 
humor isn't trying yes you can then what
they<00:06:33.060> think<00:06:33.360> they<00:06:33.450> want<00:06:33.630> you<00:06:33.960> captains<00:06:34.350> all

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
they think they want you captains all

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.260 
they think they want you captains all
the<00:06:34.650> people<00:06:34.950> all<00:06:35.040> the<00:06:35.070> time<00:06:35.400> now<00:06:35.670> you<00:06:35.730> created

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
the people all the time now you created

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.820 
the people all the time now you created
two<00:06:36.480> characters<00:06:37.020> that<00:06:37.170> I<00:06:37.260> remember<00:06:37.680> probably

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
two characters that I remember probably

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.010 
two characters that I remember probably
who<00:06:38.040> created<00:06:38.310> many<00:06:38.550> more<00:06:38.790> but<00:06:39.000> Kevin<00:06:39.600> turvy

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
who created many more but Kevin turvy

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.570 
who created many more but Kevin turvy
and<00:06:40.140> Rik<00:06:40.290> Mayall<00:06:40.560> have<00:06:41.040> you<00:06:41.130> got<00:06:41.280> another<00:06:41.460> one

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
and Rik Mayall have you got another one

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.450 
and Rik Mayall have you got another one
sort<00:06:41.940> of<00:06:42.170> fermenting<00:06:43.170> well<00:06:44.100> in<00:06:44.190> the<00:06:44.280> third

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
sort of fermenting well in the third

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.650 
sort of fermenting well in the third
series<00:06:44.700> I<00:06:44.880> think<00:06:45.060> we're<00:06:45.180> all<00:06:45.300> going<00:06:45.450> to<00:06:45.510> try

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
series I think we're all going to try

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.750 
series I think we're all going to try
and<00:06:45.860> work<00:06:46.860> out<00:06:47.070> something<00:06:47.310> that's<00:06:47.490> more

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
and work out something that's more

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.880 
and work out something that's more
fundamental<00:06:48.750> more<00:06:48.840> long-lasting<00:06:49.050> maybe<00:06:49.650> I

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
fundamental more long-lasting maybe I

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.110 
fundamental more long-lasting maybe I
mean<00:06:50.280> it'd<00:06:50.340> be<00:06:50.430> great<00:06:50.520> to<00:06:50.610> have<00:06:50.730> something

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
mean it'd be great to have something

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.850 
mean it'd be great to have something
like<00:06:51.240> say<00:06:51.570> Hancock<00:06:52.380> had<00:06:52.530> just<00:06:52.740> had<00:06:52.830> a

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
like say Hancock had just had a

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.560 
like say Hancock had just had a
character<00:06:53.280> of<00:06:53.550> his<00:06:53.670> own<00:06:53.820> there<00:06:54.150> were<00:06:54.240> so<00:06:54.360> near

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
character of his own there were so near

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.030 
character of his own there were so near
to<00:06:54.660> himself<00:06:54.780> he<00:06:55.080> was<00:06:55.200> able<00:06:55.290> to<00:06:55.410> play<00:06:55.830> that

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040 
to himself he was able to play that

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.830 
to himself he was able to play that
would<00:06:56.640> you<00:06:56.730> like<00:06:56.880> to<00:06:57.060> set<00:06:57.210> up<00:06:57.330> a<00:06:57.450> kind<00:06:57.660> of
