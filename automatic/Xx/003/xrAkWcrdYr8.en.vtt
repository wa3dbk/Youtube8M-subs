with<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> camera<00:01:03.840> unlock<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.430> kind

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
with the camera unlock now so this kind

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.039 
with the camera unlock now so this kind
of<00:01:05.670> uses<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> accelerometer<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
