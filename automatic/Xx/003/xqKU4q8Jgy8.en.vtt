coated<00:00:42.690> unit<00:00:43.160> really<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.309> great<00:00:44.550> shape<00:00:44.820> all

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
coated unit really in great shape all

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
coated unit really in great shape all
the<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.270> around<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.960> mean<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> lot<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.559> units<00:00:46.860> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the way around I mean a lot of units you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.260 
the way around I mean a lot of units you
just<00:00:47.160> don't<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.610> them<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:47.940> good<00:00:48.149> of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
just don't see them with as good of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.160 
just don't see them with as good of
shape<00:00:48.710> especially<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.800> 2004<00:00:50.760> 's<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.840> area

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
shape especially in 2004 's and the area

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.560 
shape especially in 2004 's and the area
that<00:00:52.320> we're<00:00:52.500> at<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.399> guess<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.030> somebody

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
that we're at so my guess is somebody

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.709 
that we're at so my guess is somebody
had<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.140> covered<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.100> somehow<00:00:56.789> because<00:00:57.480> all

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
had this covered up somehow because all

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.290 
had this covered up somehow because all
the<00:00:57.840> decals<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.710> good<00:00:58.859> shape<00:00:59.090> there's<00:01:00.090> no

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the decals are in good shape there's no

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.080 
the decals are in good shape there's no
Sun<00:01:00.629> fading<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.410> whereas<00:01:02.219> most<00:01:02.460> units<00:01:02.910> in

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
Sun fading on it whereas most units in

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.750 
Sun fading on it whereas most units in
this<00:01:03.210> age<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.899> Colorado<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
this age in Colorado here they do get a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.230 
this age in Colorado here they do get a
lot<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.090> Sun<00:01:06.299> fading<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.610> just<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> nice

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
lot of Sun fading so just really a nice

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
lot of Sun fading so just really a nice
unit<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.409> way<00:01:10.530> around<00:01:12.590> this<00:01:13.590> units<00:01:14.010> got

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
unit all the way around this units got

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.640 
unit all the way around this units got
roughly<00:01:14.610> about<00:01:14.700> 12,000<00:01:15.570> miles<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
roughly about 12,000 miles on it so the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.120 
roughly about 12,000 miles on it so the
mileage<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> super<00:01:17.640> low<00:01:19.250> going<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:22.130> pace

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
mileage is super low going here the pace

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.719 
mileage is super low going here the pace
