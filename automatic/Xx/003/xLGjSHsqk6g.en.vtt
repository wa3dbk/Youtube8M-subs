00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.520 
while you're working out so I've got a
spare<00:02:05.100> battery<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.549> there<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.659> also

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
spare battery in there and then also

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.800 
spare battery in there and then also
hooked<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> memory<00:02:08.550> card<00:02:08.700> wallet<00:02:08.970> full

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
hooked on here a memory card wallet full

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.240 
hooked on here a memory card wallet full
of<00:02:09.959> memory<00:02:10.229> cards<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.860> kind<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> velcro

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
of memory cards so just kind of velcro

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.820 
of memory cards so just kind of velcro
on<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.940> top<00:02:12.150> seemed<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.780> work<00:02:12.870> out<00:02:13.050> pretty

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
on the top seemed to work out pretty

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
on the top seemed to work out pretty
well<00:02:14.010> okay<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:14.820> on<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.180> side<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.660> get

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
well okay so on this side we can get

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.840 
well okay so on this side we can get
another<00:02:15.990> angle<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> rig<00:02:16.830> let<00:02:17.580> me<00:02:17.640> show<00:02:17.760> you

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
another angle on the rig let me show you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.280 
another angle on the rig let me show you
around<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.150> front<00:02:18.450> take<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> look<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:18.990> some<00:02:19.170> of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
around the front take a look at some of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.170 
around the front take a look at some of
the<00:02:19.380> homemade<00:02:20.190> things<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.610> threw<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:20.970> here

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the homemade things that threw on here

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.460 
the homemade things that threw on here
first<00:02:21.840> I've<00:02:21.960> got<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> 96<00:02:22.530> LED<00:02:24.020> external<00:02:25.020> battery

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
first I've got a 96 LED external battery

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.150 
first I've got a 96 LED external battery
run<00:02:25.740> light<00:02:26.640> right<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:28.560> got<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.010> hooked

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
run light right here and I got it hooked

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.420 
run light right here and I got it hooked
on<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.600> flash<00:02:30.600> bracket<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.350> got<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.040> off<00:02:32.220> Amazon

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
on a flash bracket I got this off Amazon

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.820 
on a flash bracket I got this off Amazon
for<00:02:32.910> like<00:02:33.030> nine<00:02:33.240> dollars<00:02:33.710> basically<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.740> took

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
for like nine dollars basically I took

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.270 
for like nine dollars basically I took
the<00:02:35.070> flash<00:02:35.310> bracket<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.410> bolted<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.530> right

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the flash bracket and bolted it right

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.030 
the flash bracket and bolted it right
through<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.550> piping<00:02:38.880> here<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:40.770> really

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
through the piping here and that really

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.850 
through the piping here and that really
holds<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.120> on<00:02:42.210> pretty<00:02:42.450> well<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:43.200> could<00:02:43.740> also

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
holds it on pretty well I could also

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.290 
holds it on pretty well I could also
hook<00:02:44.070> something<00:02:44.340> else<00:02:44.580> right<00:02:44.790> there<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.210> I

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
hook something else right there if I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.590 
hook something else right there if I
wanted<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.660> like<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.610> thermos<00:02:47.610> or<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.000> cup<00:02:48.390> holder

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
wanted to like a thermos or a cup holder

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.340 
wanted to like a thermos or a cup holder
or<00:02:49.470> potentially<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> sidecar<00:02:51.170> here's<00:02:52.170> another

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
or potentially a sidecar here's another

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.330 
or potentially a sidecar here's another
shot<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> camera<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.400> trigger<00:02:55.340> what

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
shot of the camera and that trigger what

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.040 
shot of the camera and that trigger what
do<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.459> call<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.610> trigger<00:02:56.970> head<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.870> got

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
do you call it trigger head that I got

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.260 
do you call it trigger head that I got
it<00:02:58.740> looks<00:02:58.920> really<00:02:59.190> corny<00:02:59.700> but<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.000> actually

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
it looks really corny but it actually

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.850 
it looks really corny but it actually
works<00:03:00.450> really<00:03:00.660> well<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:00.900> fine-tuning<00:03:01.800> that

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
works really well for fine-tuning that

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.210 
works really well for fine-tuning that
position<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.750> camera<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.860> on<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
position of the of the camera so on the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.850 
position of the of the camera so on the
side<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.700> rig<00:03:05.940> what<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.510> did<00:03:06.780> was<00:03:06.959> uh<00:03:06.990> create

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
side of the rig what I did was uh create

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.110 
side of the rig what I did was uh create
this<00:03:08.070> two<00:03:08.820> pipe<00:03:10.490> adapter<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:11.640> holds<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
this two pipe adapter that holds the

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.790 
this two pipe adapter that holds the
actual<00:03:13.760> tripod<00:03:14.760> head<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.690> half<00:03:16.590> inch

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
actual tripod head this is a half inch

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.580 
actual tripod head this is a half inch
pipe<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.970> is<00:03:18.180> one<00:03:18.420> inch<00:03:18.570> pipe<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.410> what<00:03:19.560> I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
pipe this is one inch pipe and what I

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.710 
pipe this is one inch pipe and what I
did<00:03:19.830> was<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.160> added<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.580> little<00:03:20.760> screw<00:03:21.239> tightener

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
did was I added a little screw tightener

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.780 
did was I added a little screw tightener
so<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.350> when<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.620> loosen<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.640> whole

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
so that when you loosen it the whole

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.940 
so that when you loosen it the whole
thing<00:03:23.820> becomes<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.480> slider<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.680> I've<00:03:25.739> got<00:03:25.920> a

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
thing becomes a slider so I've got a

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.590 
thing becomes a slider so I've got a
couple<00:03:26.519> holes<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:27.000> there<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.570> can

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
couple holes in there so that you can

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.840 
couple holes in there so that you can
position<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.320> rig<00:03:28.530> where<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.310> want<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.640> and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
position the rig where you want it and

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.130 
position the rig where you want it and
lock<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.300> down<00:03:30.560> but<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:32.070> cool<00:03:32.280> part<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:33.140> once

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
lock it down but the cool part is once

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.490 
lock it down but the cool part is once
you<00:03:34.260> unlock<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.010> whole<00:03:35.160> thing<00:03:35.430> glides

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
you unlock it the whole thing glides

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.350 
you unlock it the whole thing glides
sort<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.590> doing<00:03:37.890> about<00:03:38.130> 12<00:03:38.640> inches<00:03:38.850> worth<00:03:39.209> of

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
sort of doing about 12 inches worth of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.870 
sort of doing about 12 inches worth of
glider<00:03:39.720> action<00:03:40.230> once<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.220> have<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.489> loosened

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
glider action once you have it loosened

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.170 
glider action once you have it loosened
up

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
up

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.120 
up
you<00:03:42.239> can<00:03:42.390> basically<00:03:42.780> hold<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.050> trigger<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
you can basically hold the trigger and

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.350 
you can basically hold the trigger and
get<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> real<00:03:44.580> nice<00:03:45.200> 12<00:03:46.200> inch<00:03:46.380> collide<00:03:46.830> just

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
get a real nice 12 inch collide just

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.120 
get a real nice 12 inch collide just
with<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.450> rig<00:03:48.630> sitting<00:03:49.260> down<00:03:49.410> like<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:49.860> so

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
with the rig sitting down like this so

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.280 
with the rig sitting down like this so
this<00:03:50.519> is<00:03:50.640> kind<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.030> cool<00:03:51.209> effect<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.810> it

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
this is kind of a cool effect that it

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.930 
this is kind of a cool effect that it
just<00:03:52.410> kind<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.620> whipped<00:03:52.830> up<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.250> sanded<00:03:53.790> these

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
just kind of whipped up I sanded these

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.880 
just kind of whipped up I sanded these
down<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.209> little<00:03:54.450> bit<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.870> get<00:03:54.989> them<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.650> little

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
down a little bit to get them a little

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.160 
down a little bit to get them a little
more<00:03:56.130> smooth<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.750> I'm<00:03:57.750> going<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:57.989> show<00:03:58.140> you

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
more smooth and I'm going to show you

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.710 
more smooth and I'm going to show you
how<00:03:58.800> I<00:03:58.830> got<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.280> glide<00:03:59.519> effect<00:03:59.910> in<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.150> PVC

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
how I got that glide effect in the PVC

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.229 
how I got that glide effect in the PVC
right<00:04:01.380> in<00:04:01.500> here<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.830> here's<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.130> trigger<00:04:02.400> if

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
right in here and here's the trigger if

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.390 
right in here and here's the trigger if
I<00:04:03.390> pull<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.410> trigger<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.890> just<00:04:05.190> kind<00:04:05.340> of

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
I pull the trigger and just kind of

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.790 
I pull the trigger and just kind of
position<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:06.000> can<00:04:06.180> get<00:04:06.330> glides<00:04:07.260> going<00:04:07.680> up

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
position it I can get glides going up

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.070 
position it I can get glides going up
top<00:04:08.040> like<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.700> can<00:04:08.910> get<00:04:09.060> clyde's<00:04:09.330> going

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
top like that I can get clyde's going

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.490 
top like that I can get clyde's going
down<00:04:10.260> like<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:11.010> can<00:04:11.519> get<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:12.500> sideways

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
down like that I can get a sideways

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.520 
down like that I can get a sideways
glide<00:04:13.830> going<00:04:14.700> like<00:04:14.850> this<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.299> can<00:04:16.260> do<00:04:16.350> just

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
glide going like this I can do just

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.820 
glide going like this I can do just
about<00:04:16.650> anything<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.160> this<00:04:17.510> position<00:04:18.830> thanks

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
about anything but this position thanks

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
it in like this so it's tight it's good

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.990 
it in like this so it's tight it's good
to<00:04:32.670> go

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
to go

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.380 
to go
I<00:04:33.030> just<00:04:33.270> cable<00:04:33.630> up<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.960> HD<00:04:34.740> chords<00:04:35.240> when<00:04:36.240> it's

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
I just cable up the HD chords when it's

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.390 
I just cable up the HD chords when it's
just<00:04:36.540> sitting<00:04:36.780> down<00:04:36.930> loosen<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:37.950> up<00:04:38.010> like<00:04:38.220> this

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
just sitting down loosen it up like this

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.670 
just sitting down loosen it up like this
point<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:38.880> where<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.060> want<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.570> if<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.530> have

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
point of where I want it and if I have

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.960 
point of where I want it and if I have
to<00:04:40.800> I'll<00:04:40.920> take<00:04:41.130> these<00:04:41.310> off<00:04:41.490> if<00:04:41.700> they<00:04:41.820> are<00:04:41.880> in

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
to I'll take these off if they are in

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.880 
to I'll take these off if they are in
the<00:04:42.090> way<00:04:42.210> but<00:04:42.270> other<00:04:42.990> than<00:04:43.140> that<00:04:43.230> I<00:04:43.530> can<00:04:43.740> get<00:04:43.860> a

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
the way but other than that I can get a

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.680 
the way but other than that I can get a
real<00:04:44.130> nice<00:04:44.280> glide<00:04:44.640> on<00:04:44.820> here<00:04:45.060> for<00:04:45.270> about<00:04:45.420> 12

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
real nice glide on here for about 12

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.110 
real nice glide on here for about 12
inches<00:04:45.900> which<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:46.710> often<00:04:47.040> times<00:04:47.190> about<00:04:47.940> all

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
inches which is often times about all

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.210 
inches which is often times about all
you<00:04:48.300> need<00:04:48.480> here's<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.350> close-up<00:04:49.560> of<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.950> glider

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
you need here's a close-up of the glider

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.320 
you need here's a close-up of the glider
you<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:51.210> see<00:04:51.390> it's<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:53.340> smooth<00:04:53.700> motion<00:04:53.970> is

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
you can see it's the smooth motion is

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.540 
you can see it's the smooth motion is
really<00:04:54.630> because<00:04:54.930> of<00:04:55.110> some<00:04:55.590> felt<00:04:55.860> pads<00:04:55.950> that<00:04:56.430> I

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
really because of some felt pads that I

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.880 
really because of some felt pads that I
put<00:04:56.760> in<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:56.970> gaps<00:04:57.180> again<00:04:58.050> this<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.410> half

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
put in the gaps again this is a half

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.680 
put in the gaps again this is a half
inch<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.340> one<00:04:59.490> inch<00:04:59.640> PVC<00:04:59.910> so<00:05:00.420> it's<00:05:00.540> not<00:05:00.630> just

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
inch and one inch PVC so it's not just

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.850 
inch and one inch PVC so it's not just
PVC<00:05:01.380> sitting<00:05:02.280> on<00:05:02.430> PVC<00:05:02.820> it's<00:05:03.240> got<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:03.420> good

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
PVC sitting on PVC it's got a good

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.900 
PVC sitting on PVC it's got a good
padding<00:05:04.860> all<00:05:05.040> around<00:05:05.720> top<00:05:06.720> sides<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.910> bottom

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
padding all around top sides and bottom

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.300 
padding all around top sides and bottom
with<00:05:09.090> felt<00:05:09.990> padding<00:05:10.470> self-adhesive<00:05:10.980> felt

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
with felt padding self-adhesive felt

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.650 
with felt padding self-adhesive felt
padding<00:05:11.730> that<00:05:11.820> I<00:05:11.940> just<00:05:12.210> got<00:05:12.360> at<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.630> hardware

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
padding that I just got at the hardware

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.590 
padding that I just got at the hardware
store<00:05:13.290> so<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:13.890> installed<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:14.790> then<00:05:15.060> it

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
store so I installed that and then it

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.870 
store so I installed that and then it
works<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:16.050> slides<00:05:16.320> pretty<00:05:16.680> well<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.580> can<00:05:17.760> be<00:05:17.850> a

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
works it slides pretty well it can be a

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.940 
works it slides pretty well it can be a
little<00:05:18.180> top-heavy<00:05:18.420> so<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:19.170> just<00:05:19.530> need<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.770> push

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
little top-heavy so I just need to push

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.810 
little top-heavy so I just need to push
down<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.250> little<00:05:20.400> bit<00:05:20.730> when<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:21.330> glide<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:22.820> but

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
down a little bit when I glide it but

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.520 
down a little bit when I glide it but
once<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.090> get<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.330> basic<00:05:24.660> hang<00:05:24.870> of<00:05:24.990> it<00:05:25.110> and

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
once you get the basic hang of it and

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.400 
once you get the basic hang of it and
you<00:05:25.860> start<00:05:26.400> using<00:05:26.520> this<00:05:27.020> trigger<00:05:28.020> thing<00:05:28.260> you

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
you start using this trigger thing you

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.720 
you start using this trigger thing you
can<00:05:28.530> basically<00:05:28.980> save<00:05:29.190> yourself<00:05:29.520> another

can basically save yourself another

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.670 
can basically save yourself another
couple<00:05:30.030> hundred<00:05:30.090> dollars<00:05:30.600> from<00:05:31.230> a<00:05:31.380> glider

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
couple hundred dollars from a glider

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.820 
couple hundred dollars from a glider
again<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.670> doesn't<00:05:32.820> hook<00:05:32.970> on<00:05:33.120> a<00:05:33.180> tripod<00:05:33.830> but

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
again it doesn't hook on a tripod but

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.250 
again it doesn't hook on a tripod but
this<00:05:35.040> kind<00:05:35.250> of<00:05:35.340> smooth<00:05:35.580> is<00:05:35.790> not<00:05:36.660> available<00:05:37.140> in
