00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Personal speech I'm back here with 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.830
 you today to do a tutorial one 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.050
 little technical today a tutorial and turned 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.019
 For those people who like Redstone, I get it. 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.070
 A little bit, let's go, we'll go 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.080
 show a curiosity of you go 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.539
 Show you what the pulse is for. 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.150
 of a ticket is the following one we have a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.460
 piston style and here made in room or 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 We have decreased load, right? 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.470
 so he pulls it quickly tsu will pull 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.800
 This goal I'm here. 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.559
 certain only that normally not a state 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.180
 normal the teams tone it pushes the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.980
 block and pull it back right 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 It's just that we 're going to give a very 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.059
 What am I going to do here now? 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.550
 put at least the boy this is able 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.200
 to move the blog leave that place 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.270
 believe this is what has many 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.520
 utilities in washington i will not enter 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.239
 in detail now the problem is that this 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.969
 impulse is so fast to do that 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.129
 systems like this right that are direct 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.629
 tom tort that torch she can not 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.400
 transmit without a pulse 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.760
 She's very slow and we'll see it here. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.200
 O we have a tokyo tower and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.810
 and we want to try to do the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.820
 same process of stick piston abandon 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.890
 this block here and here we have 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.790
 decreased load on diamond then 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.650
 we will try 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.360
 You'll see that it repeats and goes fishing. 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.090
 because of the pulse that we wanted 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.890
 but this torch, JosÃ© Antonio, will stay 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.040
 The way it's good to observe again. 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:36.479
 people the torch completely ignores the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.869
 I wager we put the epithet here 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.549
 this does not change anything 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.990
 but curiously have how to do this 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.270
 one had to go through the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.119
 torch and if we increase it to 2 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.189
 and leave this here in one you can see 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.500
 that the first torch fished but did not 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.960
 You can pass on this sign okay 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.060
 seeing the second is intact 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.890
 This is like a pulse. 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.210
 inverse of a ticket because it maintains a 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.329
 Christian connected ne 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.280
 and he shuts down like I know 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.599
 he who seeks to close quickie 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.850
 a team that can make a circuit 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.900
 quick here 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.590
 Where are we going to transmit this pulse? 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.450
 for this error and peter for another option if 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.160
 are leaving this block here is 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.820
 because it received a boost from hunt 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.560
 right 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.150
 so come on, how are you, people? 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.710
 so this is the way to convey to a 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.350
 only this can be useful when you want 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.090
 continue or not enough but if you 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.980
 I want it if I do not pass it up like 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.830
 what we do is good 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.890
 forget about it and go to this circuit 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.020
 here and circuit can transmit a 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.410
 Thanks for all these stories here. 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.940
 Let's see this happen, we walked. 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.670
 by all the torches he abandoned the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.310
 block is that it usually is not 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.230
 possible was one thing I discovered 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.690
 practically by accident 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.970
 is the mechanism that makes it happen is 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.030
 that this fred stone block he keeps 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.520
 this line connected here and it has changed from there 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.850
 He's here and he's going to stop. 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.680
 here is what happens between the time 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.360
 he is in one place and another here if this 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.170
 block does not exist when in 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.790
 movement 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.700
 so this updated line of 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.890
 wash it off and turns on again and 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.680
 this is a pulse of a tic we 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.680
 Put it here, we'll see it. 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.050
 also expelled I thought it was special 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.090
 because somehow it goes through 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.760
 several by a large torch sequence 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.570
 orsoni and go wherever we want there 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.660
 we try to convert back if 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.820
 this impulse in for example playing this 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.870
 wrist of a torch line to a 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.670
 line wash 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.020
 we've lost this feature not 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.020
 Let's stay there a little bit here. 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.960
 It would not have to be in the other is for him. 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:01.000
 I'm sorry, I've screwed up here. 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.130
 people are going to fix it ok 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.070
 put but will not leave equal to what 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.630
 I was before and I did it again nonsense 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.750
 I 'm not going to re-record, we'll leave 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.019
 You see, we also 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.220
 disrupts so let's see this 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.530
 line down and completely ignores 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.459
 because it left the everton torch line 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.260
 if passed 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.360
 converted to green line there is tonic 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.960
 Talk again, this does not work anymore. 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.310
 more 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.370
 but that's how we get through 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.920
 a stone wrist up because every time 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.380
 that this lever changes place 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.690
 this block it happens there you me 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.160
 asks if I want to use a button on the 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.200
 place of a lever by means of a 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.060
 circuit that will transmit pulse by 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.410
 example tou already broadcast on the wrist of a 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.060
 The time that I want to send up 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.600
 suddenly this is the case that you 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.790
 would you like 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.010
 This one is going to transmit the pulse knows 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.419
 decreased load depressant that is already 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.900
 in blue here right? 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.460
 when you put the button on the side and then you 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.230
 to convey up there 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.419
 What I did here was that he plays the 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.610
 block there is that same circuit 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.770
 Leverage only I use a species here 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.479
 flip flop and from here with this line of 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:15.640
 a story will convey you up 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:17.680
 go and see again it was us again 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.260
 A curiosity for you, I'm done. 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.000
 discovering how to transmit the pulse of 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.520
 tic through one wash torches 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.470
 which is normally impossible if jec 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.070
 Some of this changes I think it's going to 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.080
 to delay 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.140
 I 'll also make a video there warning you 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.370
 You said hello guys so a hug to 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.370
 You and even one more. 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.830
 You can see in the work called craft. 

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:48.369
 whole here you can do something 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.369
 really
