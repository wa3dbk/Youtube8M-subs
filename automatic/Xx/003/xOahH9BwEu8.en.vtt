00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.939
 At some point just ran away has nothing 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.800
 said it'm really sorry but I 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.420
 I wrote a beggar that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.859
 hopefully successful i have that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.929
 that it will be successful and have 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.059
 now just form mine too 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.230
 Master started here in Berlin and was 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.630
 of course accordingly 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.399
 a bit busy and unfortunately have it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.649
 not managed videos room on each 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.030
 case i said i started now 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.250
 we come to the same topic 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 Today I started again 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 Study here in Berlin and have been since 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.370
 about one year ago at any one 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 this high is because of me 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 Of course I started too 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.000
 scary many new people 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.770
 has met and what I do not know 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.930
 What was I wondering how could 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.030
 So I swing the swing like so 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.730
 I do not want that at the same time 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 but I still watch a bit too 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.900
 It was easy to come out of it 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.400
 Make up the moment with everything 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.689
 best face on the face 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.850
 is reasonably flawless 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.189
 or something laminated during 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.509
 the eyes very reservedly discreet 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.250
 are made-up and actually what 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.080
 not great anyway 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
 really just completely not her about 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.570
 quite easy to hang up in school but 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.460
 still doing it reasonably well 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.479
 made neatly further reduced like 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.140
 I did that, then look 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.240
 simply further 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.890
 I always start every morning 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.100
 first of all on my face cream 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.930
 i use ddr faster bio jasmin 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.180
 cream I think super good and only 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.229
 can recommend 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.270
 because the face cream him a bit 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.740
 First of all, it must be done as or 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.140
 I'll continue with mine next 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.330
 eyes i use your for as one 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.220
 great because 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.860
 not quite keep it up I have here 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.450
 a super good sample packaging from 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.730
 somehow came with my kate perry 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.690
 pennant I believe and that of me 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.750
 just a little bit 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.750
 Traktes on my my eyelids 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.950
 All this, of course, opened an eyeshadow 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.810
 one of my natural ones 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.000
 skin color is relatively similar to it like 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.280
 said yes of course looks and indeed 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.100
 I use the color world of mac here 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.450
 the super super well suited for that 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.710
 It looks quite awesome and me 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.470
 concentrate on taking this up 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.910
 a normal eyeshadow but one 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.340
 normal mikati brush is from 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.380
 edin and wear it on the whole the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.680
 baptize and concentrate in front of everyone 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.060
 things on the lid fold around the something in 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.910
 to lend something profound 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.230
 we are almost already eyes 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.020
 finished because I really only really 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.490
 Actual minimal application as is 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.730
 namely eyelash curler and car line 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.370
 and sling and if you are powerful 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.680
 of course now apply a mascara 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.209
 I'll give it up because I'm the one 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.950
 lucky to find great if just 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.600
 no mascara and nothing else there 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.180
 on it is the only thing I still have 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.550
 is gonna do a brown kajal 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.989
 here is from l'oreal to my upper one 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.989
 Weapon out because I have one 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.540
 comedian intel no mascara wear around 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.980
 The parents then a bit fuller 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.450
 let it look that 's it 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.830
 already with the eyes so as I said it 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.630
 really is not expensive as 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.790
 next i come to the face and that 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.980
 uses a facial cream with him 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.350
 already a dried one is very first 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.060
 something against my dark circles and dark circles 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.349
 Although sought for the 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.160
 you 'll wake up effect somehow 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.370
 concealer you 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.470
 and that's what I've got for the first time 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.270
 Caffeine roll which is great, of course 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.959
 and gives papin so this is something 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.560
 to take away swollen 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.269
 that I then act briefly and if 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.849
 which is a bit fed 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.069
 I in this pink part of it 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.470
 and he is super good for it 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.080
 just these purple tones this gila stich 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.989
 to get out of the dark circles and 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.150
 I wear it in front of some in the 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.250
 center of the eye on so here in front 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.440
 me in the center but here in front because 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.940
 I usually always the most 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.250
 dealer shares have that are really 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.079
 just because they drive so to speak to them 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.959
 Correct and that's where I come from 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.750
 already to make-up I use the la 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.090
 vera beauty born and la vera beauty 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.320
 bambi comfortable of avira i take the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.280
 usually just between the 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.540
 finger will be like a little bit 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.669
 others who are fine with the skin 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.250
 sweaty and then like a whole 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:36.570
 normal cream over algae up here 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.460
 carpet then a little bit more 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.750
 I do not want this pink thing 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.120
 I just applied the same 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.570
 smear again and my purple and 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.789
 but under it reappears 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.270
 otherwise she also beautiful neck 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.280
 down and everything else left 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.440
 i usually wear it 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.130
 Also because I'm not so big problems 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.130
 have 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.880
 so that I can sit down a bit now 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.660
 as long as one could brow my eyebrows 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:16.390
 I use here for my well-known 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:18.550
 cancel yves rocher next 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.670
 with his brother just about everything 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.810
 put it on darabos and not 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.280
 right in the vanishes and that 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.460
 I use the most beautiful are needed 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.320
 bluesport by guido which is also very nice 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.020
 good is comparable to that though 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.730
 other loose transparent brother in the 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.710
 the end effect of all this is known 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.600
 brunch local association familiar it is 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.920
 Actually, every year there comes heart 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.330
 with me again and again is from the 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.970
 junk characters repeatedly use because 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.530
 wants to and indeed the pool abra of 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.580
 Battlefield teen is super 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.100
 and now it does and that's why 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.430
 Autumn feels absolutely perfect in Bonn 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.630
 let me concentrate on everything 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.350
 below my cheekbones so if 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.870
 I here so you can see this mixture 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.090
 by nature and there I concentrate 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.860
 Mainzer in particular to the 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.740
 name little or not my study 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.910
 as big as she actually is and 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.490
 there is something under the jawbone 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.970
 and there again a bit the 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.330
 illusion of less dead child too 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.760
 cause 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.200
 So this is my meat stuck 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.090
 Of course always use what you guys 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.230

 chanel or 1 of chanel in jerseys and 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.890

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.520
 I still use the highlander 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.740

 upper so above the new bone 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.640
