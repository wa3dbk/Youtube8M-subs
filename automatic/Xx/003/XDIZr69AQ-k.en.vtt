so what we're going to show today is how

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.160 
so what we're going to show today is how
to<00:00:10.590> restore<00:00:11.160> an<00:00:11.460> implant<00:00:12.150> using<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> M<00:00:12.990> is

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
to restore an implant using the M is

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.640 
to restore an implant using the M is

Burnout plastic for the lab to use in
this<00:00:44.250> case<00:00:44.489> since<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.969> single<00:00:45.329> crown

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this case since it's a single crown

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.110 
this case since it's a single crown
we're<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> use<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> red<00:00:46.620> anti<00:00:47.430> rotational

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
we're going to use a red anti rotational

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.200 
we're going to use a red anti rotational
plastic<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.579> step<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> process

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
plastic so the first step in the process

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.229 
plastic so the first step in the process
will<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.260> remove<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.980> cover<00:00:53.520> screw<00:00:53.910> from

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
will be to remove the cover screw from

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.810 
will be to remove the cover screw from
the<00:00:54.329> top<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> implant<00:00:55.520> we're<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> be

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the top of the implant we're going to be

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.119 
the top of the implant we're going to be

driver just like the one that's in our

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.990 
driver just like the one that's in our
surgical<00:01:01.829> kit<00:01:03.320> to<00:01:04.320> take<00:01:04.530> off<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> cover<00:01:05.070> screw

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.100 

next<00:01:12.020> we<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.110> place<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.380> abundance<00:01:15.110> using

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
next we will place the abundance using

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:31.200 
next we will place the abundance using
the<00:01:16.200> same<00:01:16.410> driver<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> included<00:01:18.540> screw

and he's recommended to keep the flat

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.680 
and he's recommended to keep the flat
side<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.610> abutment<00:01:34.030> towards<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.510> bumper

coping on top of it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090 
coping on top of it
notice<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> flat<00:01:58.590> side<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.890> the

notice that there is a flat side on the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219 
notice that there is a flat side on the
inside<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> plastic<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.570> corresponds

inside of the plastic that corresponds

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.399 
inside of the plastic that corresponds
to<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.470> flat<00:02:01.710> side<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.430> abutment<00:02:02.970> itself

to the flat side on the abutment itself

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.420 
to the flat side on the abutment itself
therefore<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.470> will<00:02:04.560> only<00:02:04.710> fit<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.100> one

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
therefore it will only fit in one

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.510 
therefore it will only fit in one
direction<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:07.170> seated<00:02:07.530> gently<00:02:07.920> first<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
direction so you seated gently first and

direction so you seated gently first and
then<00:02:08.880> spin<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.270> until<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.630> flat<00:02:09.810> sides<00:02:10.140> line

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
then spin it until the flat sides line

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.960 
then spin it until the flat sides line
up<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.860> you'll<00:02:11.039> find<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.520> drops<00:02:11.790> into

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
up and you'll find that it drops into

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.500

temporary cement to keep it in place but
in<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.270> case<00:03:26.450> we'll<00:03:26.690> just<00:03:26.720> show<00:03:27.020> that<00:03:27.230> it

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
in this case we'll just show that it

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
in this case we'll just show that it
fits<00:03:27.560> down<00:03:29.500> again<00:03:30.500> there<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:30.800> flat<00:03:31.100> side<00:03:31.130> on
