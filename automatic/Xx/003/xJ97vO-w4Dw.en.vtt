she<00:00:53.699> made<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.090> slightly<00:00:54.420> shorter<00:00:54.930> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
she made it just slightly shorter so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
she made it just slightly shorter so
it's<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.530> even<00:00:56.010> squatchier<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> shape<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's got even squatchier of a shape and
she's<00:00:57.960> used<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.559> slightly<00:00:58.829> tweety<00:00:59.309> yarn<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.879> you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.819 
Township Michigan used exactly the same
yarn<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.600> she's<00:01:49.049> used<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.439> much<00:01:49.560> cooler

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
yarn but she's used a much cooler

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.530 
yarn but she's used a much cooler
colorway<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.670> effect<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.090> completely

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
colorway so the effect is completely

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.810 
colorway so the effect is completely
different<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.110> she<00:01:53.009> made<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.340> bag<00:01:53.549> as

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
different and she made the bag as

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.760 
different and she made the bag as
directed<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.540> what<00:01:54.659> she<00:01:54.810> did<00:01:54.960> was<00:01:55.140> try<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
directed but what she did was try to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.370 
directed but what she did was try to
work<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> skein<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.990> darkest

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
work with the skein so that the darkest

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.350 
work with the skein so that the darkest
colors<00:01:58.710> are<00:01:58.920> along<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> bottom<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.820> where

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
colors are along the bottom here where

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.020 
colors are along the bottom here where
they're<00:02:00.780> least<00:02:01.079> visible<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.579> lightest

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
they're least visible and the lightest

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.399 
they're least visible and the lightest
colors<00:02:03.360> are<00:02:03.540> along<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.750> button<00:02:04.140> flat<00:02:06.290> then<00:02:07.290> we

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
colors are along the button flat then we

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.499 
colors are along the button flat then we
have<00:02:07.590> Beth<00:02:07.860> from<00:02:08.160> La<00:02:08.399> Crosse<00:02:08.670> Michigan<00:02:09.270> and

have Beth from La Crosse Michigan and
what<00:02:09.869> Beth<00:02:10.080> did<00:02:10.349> she's<00:02:10.860> made<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> bunch<00:02:11.250> of

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
what Beth did she's made a bunch of

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.950 
what Beth did she's made a bunch of
different<00:02:11.489> variations<00:02:12.270> here

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
different variations here

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.570 
different variations here
the<00:02:13.590> first<00:02:13.800> thing<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.010> she<00:02:14.130> did<00:02:14.220> was<00:02:14.400> just

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
the first thing that she did was just

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.580 
the first thing that she did was just
make<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.910> bag<00:02:15.030> slightly<00:02:15.420> larger<00:02:15.990> overall

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
make the bag slightly larger overall

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.890 
make the bag slightly larger overall
she's<00:02:17.280> also<00:02:17.460> made<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.730> bag<00:02:17.940> much<00:02:18.150> taller<00:02:18.540> so

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
she's also made the bag much taller so

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.990 
she's also made the bag much taller so
it's<00:02:19.020> really<00:02:19.200> got<00:02:19.470> more<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.160> true<00:02:20.670> hobo

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it's really got more of a true hobo

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.510 
it's really got more of a true hobo
shape<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.440> she<00:02:22.830> did<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.070> simply<00:02:23.370> by

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
shape to it and she did that simply by

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.730 
shape to it and she did that simply by
just<00:02:23.760> adding<00:02:23.940> rounds<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.600> bag<00:02:24.780> she's<00:02:25.500> made

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
just adding rounds to the bag she's made

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.130 
just adding rounds to the bag she's made
much<00:02:26.370> longer<00:02:26.850> strap<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.420> again<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.930> more

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
much longer strap so again it's a more

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.230 
much longer strap so again it's a more
of<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> shoulder<00:02:28.470> bag<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.070> she's<00:02:29.730> made<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> wider

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
of a shoulder bag and she's made a wider

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.360 
of a shoulder bag and she's made a wider
flap<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.110> top<00:02:31.350> stays<00:02:31.740> more<00:02:31.950> securely

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
flap so the top stays more securely

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.150 
flap so the top stays more securely
closed<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.930> most<00:02:34.080> obvious<00:02:34.290> modification

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
closed and the most obvious modification

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.990 
closed and the most obvious modification
that<00:02:35.250> she<00:02:35.460> made<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.450> gorgeous<00:02:37.140> ivy<00:02:38.000> Ivy

stranded<00:02:39.720> knitting<00:02:39.840> motif<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.710> a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
stranded knitting motif it's just a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.580 
stranded knitting motif it's just a
simple<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.490> color<00:02:41.760> small<00:02:42.600> repeat<00:02:42.990> motif<00:02:43.320> but

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
simple to color small repeat motif but

simple to color small repeat motif but
and<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.490> see<00:02:44.670> even<00:02:44.820> after<00:02:45.150> felting<00:02:45.630> that

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
and you can see even after felting that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.410 
and you can see even after felting that
the<00:02:46.200> stitch<00:02:46.560> definition<00:02:46.740> goes<00:02:47.280> away<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the stitch definition goes away the the

the stitch definition goes away the the
difference<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.930> color<00:02:49.200> still<00:02:49.730> still

really make the pattern pop and you have
a<00:02:52.290> really<00:02:52.650> good<00:02:53.010> idea<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.400> what<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.790> it's

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
as some of the other examples that we

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.520 
as some of the other examples that we
see<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.360> bag<00:03:24.510> still<00:03:24.780> has<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.960> lot<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.230> stitch

individual stitches in each of the rows
she's<00:03:29.040> got<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.310> great<00:03:29.610> coordinating<00:03:30.210> button
