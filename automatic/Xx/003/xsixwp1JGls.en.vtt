00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.950

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.139
 with the topic amoklauf at schools 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.139
 busy and that's about it now 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.139

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:27.660
 That's why Peter or fits a mistake 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.660
 peter wagner of school or boys 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.399
 ugly 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.399
 With 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:21.280
 the lighting conditions in the school 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:23.020
 the day he had dark peterwagen 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.270
 completely development projects immediately 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.960
 after entering the school at about 10 5 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.960
 to put into action 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.490
 the people again amoklauf 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.100
 peter heard that very consciously 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.640
 Dam goes 89 minute twelve years 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.550
 released and launched germany 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.200
 the 30 january 2014 in the german 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.780
 Cinemas tells the story of Rome 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.490
 man played by Friedrich Mücke novel 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.170
 is one of those white with his everyday life 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.270
 not so much to start the game very much 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 he likes to gamble a lot so far 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.270
 not really time and fancy our job 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.670
 the ball at a law firm 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.710
 corresponds there the files from home 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.450
 into the computer as one 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.460
 day at a fall of a past 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.050
 amoklaufs is asking him to be 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.850
 Supervisor but still a few 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.380
 to get the files necessarily for 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.060
 needed the fall and in the small town 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.730
 to drive where this amoklauf 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.290
 has happened and that is exactly what roman and 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.060
 There must be a night or two there 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.770
 spend because these files to get 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.840
 in the end it's not that easy 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.460
 its seems like you first thought 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.440
 He learns one or the other 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.030
 Person especially a girl know 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.830
 played by liv lisa fries the at 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.530
 this was the killing spree then begins 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.000
 movie to indicate in his drama which you 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.170
 this bandage and these two people 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.280
 who do not know each other and 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.720
 somehow a certain attraction 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.040
 have to devote to each other and in the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.590
 background again and again this topic 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.150
 to bring in the amok run these files 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.800
 that are being carried through 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.600
 the main character and you try yourself 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.890
 put in there like cruel 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.630
 this situation was 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.850
 and in the middle of this girl that 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.890
 it was in this rampage is the 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.450
 actually the basic thought her a 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.830
 very interesting topic which so 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.540
 German movie not really often 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.190
 what is processed but then here 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.780
 I be completely honest as well 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.280
 fails why is that 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.810
 jam then acts in many moments 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.920
 relatively hard-working and I can too 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.690
 understand that you say that you have the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.250
 main actors finds great because they 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.050
 just too diffuse play that one at all 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.580
 not really know what's going on with them 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.630
 I think that he is not quite 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.400
 honestly am a little way too 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.590
 boring just because the topic too 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.570
 Moments give the more deep tell 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.580
 could turn the whole thing into a bitter serious 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.620
 as deep as frizzy drama is to pack 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.700
 actually the very first and simplest 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.870
 I also think that way a bit 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.160
 too bad that you do not try here 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.320
 Maybe this topic on easy 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.430
 approaching other ways and me 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.260
 find that the basic topic of the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.790
 Rampage too often in the background 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.290
 device and this story and bond 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.909
 of the two to much dominance one 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.230
 because that's the right thing 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.760
 interesting story you can tell 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.829
 especially when the dam is near the end 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.720
 34 minutes in voice over 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.400
 in the diary of the amokläufers recites 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.509
 and there at 3 friedrich mosquito 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.979
 looks undercut as he through the 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.139
 snow job that's really a lot 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.370
 excellent minutes to say 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.710
 that alone would yield one 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.870
 terrific short film at this point and 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.490
 Everything else around then almost works 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.860
 a bit too lengthy and that though 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.970
 the movie only goes 89 minutes and then 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.979
 I have to say that a little bit except 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.539
 nothing has been the title of the dam 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.009
 then is likely that, therefore, 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.660
 this rampage ibid and one 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.009
 but the dam ended at the same time 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.960
 Of course, that's amazing too 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.610
 look at water and in the figurative 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.440
 do not think of emotions 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.720
 Processed here as a metaphor 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.639
 but it has to be used 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.199
 This teaser is typically German heavy 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.000
 where i have to say that's exactly this art 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.190
 from drama that's what the German 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.630
 already a bit tired of the audience 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.520
 and it says good again 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.110
 something and that's why I think that's it 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.150
 potential of stagnant not rudimentary 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.650
 exhausted and the topic would have you 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.210
 It can not be otherwise 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.560
 played bad but especially in 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.870
 many small toes at the beginning of the 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.500
 strip for solar main actor 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.550
 it should be shown that he is in 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.289
 actually a lot of his life 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.000
 boredom prevails I have to 610 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.470
 we look at each other why lies 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.449
 again, he's gambling somewhere like that 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.130
 Brush the teeth for a few minutes 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.810
 held on it kept that I say to myself 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.820
 I find a lot of scenes here 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.070
 actually have no real sense 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.449
 except to look drab and gray and that 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.220
 but I have already after the first 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.930
 blossom does not need to be taken care of 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.729
 or for nine minutes and on 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.130
 Because of that, the end gets because of many 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.560
 great lack well intentioned intention 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.139
 still from me as German 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.820
 drama four out of ten possible points 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.590
 Overall, I recommend it now 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.909
 it's a shame that you can do such a thing 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.260
 bit tough is scrapped white 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.880
 but also that you can watch this kind of film 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.409
 other critics from the side really great 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.060
 unfortunately I do not find it 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.800
 in total we have three out of ten 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.720
 possible points because I am with 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.789
 my review on the dam was a pleasure to read 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.930
 a thumbs so they liked that the 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.190
 will not stay otherwise there is 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.470
 a few more movie reviews twitter 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.900
 facebook or abo buttons tomorrow and 15 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.340
 but at the latest a new video and up 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.190
 I hope to return here tomorrow 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.190
 with of course on the 3rd
