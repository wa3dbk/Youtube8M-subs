00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 so all people and very warm 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.560
 welcome today in the fsx we fly 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.019
 today with the a380 after rio de janeiro 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.420
 so I have two wishes from the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.700
 last video combined it was 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 actually wanted with the a340 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.449
 Rio but it was still many 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.730
 wish with the a380 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.439
 So that one at all with the a 380 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.750
 fly again so fly 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.310
 get by with the a380 i hope so 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.900
 you are not too disappointed that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 you still a nice flight 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.289
 Incidentally, the votes are behind 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.399
 I spoke the flight 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.100
 and just wears a bit now 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.660
 Back in the background you can see it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 that's pretty bad weather 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 is thunderstorm as weather models me 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.760
 have thought we are always flying 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.140
 in nice weather that's why we do 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 a little rainfall now 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 there one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.539
 you look at many small flashes in the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.420
 background as well is stronger 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.949
 I also have side wind and winter 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.829
 the weather can be much worse 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.230
 not be so, and then it goes well 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.629
 already going on the a380 rises in the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.510
 By the way, I want air for the future 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.939
 still say that you wish on 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.680
 best is so if you one in the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.689
 comments airfield of myself 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.439
 interested then easily would the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.450
 comments then I see about what 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.250
 Flights are the most sought after know what 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.680
 I mean 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.750
 because so i always have 30 comments and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.740
 then I have to select the and the flight 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.280
 and then they are not 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.470
 satisfied 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.780
 So watch that they leigt the comments 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.040
 you like it for a flight and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.439
 then I will do that if you look at yourself 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.659
 not always select then it is clear 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.540
 okay the most want to do the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.909
 I can see you here for a moment 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.759
 really fat lightning the window 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.280
 Remember frankfurter Boden's price 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.470
 the weather is really shitty but will 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.439
 most of the time will be over anyway 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.549
 stop the clouds 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.710
 What else is there to say 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.079
 there is still something important to say that we 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.159
 not on the the biggest airport of 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.810
 to fly Rio 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.119
 So we will not become the biggest 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.009
 airport fly but also the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.420
 right there in the bay is probably a 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.360
 little bit of the city can be seen 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.070
 flies exactly on the sugar hat zuckerhut 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.070
 if I do not sugarbergs zuckerberg 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.260
 facebook something I've heard times 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.170
 the sugar hat means I believe that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.720
 Mountain in Rio where this gondola starts up 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.910
 matter is also unimportant in any 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.490
 case we fly to this airport 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.560
 winter in the bay I can lay you 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.990
 say that the landing is really right 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.760
 right and right when I say 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.180
 right then I mean right 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.980
 repeated again she was really close 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.070
 but that's just enough 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.690
 runway for the a380 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.520
 So in general it would probably be the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.590
 the smarter idea was the wiser 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.890
 Idea on the international giant 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.390
 Airport to fly as well as so 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.800
 Everything looks interesting 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.989
 sees a little bit of rio and 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.910
 finished and that's it 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.030
 it all worked great but that 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.770
 he would then later also at 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.959
 Unfortunately this flight was again so that 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.930
 I had extreme problems at the start 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.459
 So what is the name of the autopilot until the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.209
 autopilot I have to look for gas 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.270
 give 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.560
 somehow the machine traveled like that 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.680
 far high that it almost a 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.450
 stall and there is no height 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.860
 wins and then he gets so slow 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.690
 and somehow that's a huge problem 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.590
 in fsx that is with many 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.170
 aircraft 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.519
 I do not know why that is but it 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.250
 It's just that way you can not help it 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.810
 Do that is annoying to everyone 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.920
 In the meantime we are over 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.390
 the Atlantic and fly towards 7 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.190
 it is still very bad weather 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.030
 set later it will be again 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.739
 better but yes, there is much more 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.230
 not to say during the flight 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.910
 We have every case at this time 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.180
 now about half of the route 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.180
 made 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.200
 for those who are interested in the top left 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.569
 are all important data again 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.819
 flight displayed coordinates 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.010
 speed and so on and so on 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.239
 on 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.409
 if anyone really cares 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.790
 should definitely be ours 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:07.730
 also displayed on a fuel and 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.069
 the range has been pretty good 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.290
 for this route are in any case 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.840
 We again over the over the country 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.549
 than about south america and become now 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.130
 Slowly sink and land us 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.870
 to prepare 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.259
 the music is running in the background that is 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.360
 such a techno hands up mix from dj fly 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.740
 with music 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.539
 I thought I would try it 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.650
 new from that are now not individual 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:37.789
 his songs just a big megamix 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.620
 quasi packed together 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.599
 and done under this video 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.520
 for those who are interested in the link 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.800
 as always in the description 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.570
 There he finds even more cool videos 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.509
 a German is so far from him 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.389
 I know but no matter back to the airfield 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.789
 we are already relatively deep here 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:00.320
 We from the side window from the outside 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:02.090
 the engines are no longer there 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.050
 finally nice as her the green too 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.940
 see instead of the endless blue and 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.520
 but we'll see it again anyway 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.310
 we already see the sugar hat and that 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.430
 means for us to extend the landing gear and 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.960
 Almost exactly under the plane you see 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.650
 already the airport with his 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.900
 two runways and now so slowly 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.030
 interesting people the landi becomes real 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.030
 shit just that I can promise 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.190
 Here we are just still the 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.690
 to turn last turn before landing 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.540
 and then it goes on into the future 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.040
 cockpit 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.410
 where it gets really interesting then you 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.650
 see the top left again 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.780
 superimposed data and the outside camera 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.640
 has the camera angle rows of 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.560
 it may be a bit stupid 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.030
 I have to choose in retrospect 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.250
 if you do not see how close it gets 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.760
 but you get out of the cockpit anyway 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.700
 already tight sets are very low 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.380
 very deep at how manta the system is 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.190
 and sat shortly after the runway 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.410
 ever there was landing on 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.520
 in my opinion very rich though 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.380
 Now you can see that runway 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.660
 end comes very very very fast 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.700
 more and we still have quite nice 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.040
 speed on it I'm in the brakes 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.590
 gone that it reached and I have to 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.230
 even take a swing of it around 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.000
 to swing on the taxiway but me 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.590
 I thought that I could do it 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.140
 but it still worked thanks 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.570
 reverse thrust and so on just like that 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:38.340
 can roll down here perfectly 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:40.080
 served and therefore welcome in Rio 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.090
 bitter tide wishes in the comments 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.770
 write and think off comments 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.020
 like if you like something and 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.200
 With that I say look I hope it has 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.320
 you like as always to the next 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.320
 flight
