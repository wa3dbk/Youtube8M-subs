off<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.750> arm<00:00:19.460> once<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> wiper<00:00:21.210> blade

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
off the arm once we have the wiper blade

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.519 
off the arm once we have the wiper blade
away<00:00:21.900> from<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.170> arm

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
away from the arm

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.800 
away from the arm
we<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.830> see<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.430> j-style<00:00:23.810> now

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
we can see it this is a j-style now

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.300 
we can see it this is a j-style now
there<00:00:25.019> are<00:00:25.109> two<00:00:25.260> kinds<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.680> j-style<00:00:26.070> arm

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
there are two kinds of j-style arm

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.370 
there are two kinds of j-style arm
there's<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> larger<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> smaller<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
there's a larger and a smaller one this

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.349 
there's a larger and a smaller one this
is<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> larger<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> two<00:00:29.369> before<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.119> install

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
is a larger of the two before we install

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.299 
is a larger of the two before we install
the<00:00:30.390> new<00:00:30.480> blade<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> install<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.009> new

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the new blade we have to install a new

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.580 
the new blade we have to install a new
adapter<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.600> original<00:00:33.960> adapter<00:00:34.230> is

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
adapter for it the original adapter is

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.190 
adapter for it the original adapter is
sort<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.860> small<00:00:35.070> Jeon<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.510> remove<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.020> it's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
sort of small Jeon so to remove it it's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.319 
sort of small Jeon so to remove it it's
easy<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.430> ahead<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.820> flip<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
easy we just go ahead and flip it up a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.060 
easy we just go ahead and flip it up a
little<00:00:39.420> bit<00:00:39.629> we'll<00:00:40.559> take<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> small

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
little bit we'll take a small

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.580 
little bit we'll take a small
screwdriver<00:00:41.780> we<00:00:42.780> run<00:00:42.930> through<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> set<00:00:43.500> of

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
screwdriver we run through the set of

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.619 
screwdriver we run through the set of
holes<00:00:43.800> there's<00:00:44.460> two<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.760> them<00:00:44.820> smaller<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
holes there's two of them smaller of the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
holes there's two of them smaller of the
two<00:00:46.100> then<00:00:47.100> we'll<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.340> push<00:00:47.520> back<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
two then we'll go and push back on the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.930 
two then we'll go and push back on the
connector<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.719> should<00:00:48.899> pop<00:00:49.110> off<00:00:49.940> all

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
connector and it should pop off all

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
connector and it should pop off all
right<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.629> I'll<00:00:51.750> take<00:00:51.899> our<00:00:52.050> new<00:00:52.170> universal

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
side let's go ahead and repeat the same

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.550 
side let's go ahead and repeat the same
process<00:01:15.420> over<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.020> passenger<00:01:16.380> side<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:18.560> in

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
process over on a passenger side now in

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
process over on a passenger side now in
this<00:01:19.680> vehicle<00:01:19.830> both<00:01:20.670> are<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.970> same<00:01:21.000> size<00:01:21.509> so

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
this vehicle both are the same size so

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
this vehicle both are the same size so
we<00:01:21.810> need<00:01:21.960> two<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.439> same<00:01:22.619> part<00:01:22.890> number<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
we need two of the same part number a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.800 
we need two of the same part number a
couple<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:23.970> things<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.420> about<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
couple other things know about this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.480 
couple other things know about this
windshield<00:01:25.049> wiper<00:01:25.290> blade<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.100> beam
