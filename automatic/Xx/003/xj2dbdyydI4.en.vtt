now we're gonna look at what epithelial

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.780 
now we're gonna look at what epithelial
tissues<00:00:03.480> do<00:00:04.290> what<00:00:04.830> are<00:00:04.920> their<00:00:05.069> functions<00:00:05.310> like

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
tissues do what are their functions like

why why do we have these things lining a
space<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.080> in<00:00:10.080> typical<00:00:10.460> Wendy<00:00:11.460> style<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.509> must

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
we're in an anatomy class we're in and

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:44.050 
we're in an anatomy class we're in and
then<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.619> anatomy<00:00:28.920> class

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.310

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
we'll add some eyeballs on there just

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.930 
we'll add some eyeballs on there just
for<00:00:46.650> your<00:00:46.800> perspective<00:00:47.280> might<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.610> well<00:00:47.730> add

for your perspective might as well add
some<00:00:48.180> limbs<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.900> as<00:00:49.320> well<00:00:50.450> very<00:00:51.450> mark<00:00:51.750> that's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
some limbs on as well very mark that's

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.650 
some limbs on as well very mark that's
you<00:00:56.720> does<00:00:57.720> that<00:00:57.750> look<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:59.270> perhaps<00:01:00.270> we

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you does that look like you perhaps we

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.130 
you does that look like you perhaps we
need<00:01:00.690> some<00:01:00.840> explanation<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:02.040> so<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.629> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
need some explanation here so this is a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.850 
need some explanation here so this is a
human<00:01:04.890> body<00:01:05.550> this<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.690> is<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:06.960> okay

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
human body this is this is like okay

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.670 
human body this is this is like okay
highly<00:01:08.520> simplified<00:01:09.050> perhaps<00:01:10.050> it<00:01:10.350> looks<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
highly simplified perhaps it looks a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
highly simplified perhaps it looks a
little<00:01:10.800> more<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> crab<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.270> were

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
little more like a crab if we were

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.050 
little more like a crab if we were
playing<00:01:12.479> pictionary<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.259> might<00:01:13.710> lose<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.820> let

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
doughnut am I really inside the doughnut

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.060 
doughnut am I really inside the doughnut
not<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.209> much<00:02:33.420> I'm<00:02:33.840> actually<00:02:34.079> whatever

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
not so much I'm actually whatever

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.470 
not so much I'm actually whatever
however<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.700> want<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.880> think<00:02:35.970> about<00:02:36.269> that

however you want to think about that

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.100 
however you want to think about that
this<00:02:37.440> lumen<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.040> actually<00:02:38.670> outside<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:40.019> the

this lumen is actually outside of the
body<00:02:41.390> where<00:02:42.390> are<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.810> gonna<00:02:42.930> expect<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.620> see

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
body where are you gonna expect to see

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.979 
body where are you gonna expect to see
epithelial<00:02:45.360> tissue<00:02:46.489> dude<00:02:47.519> lining<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.420> lumen

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
epithelial tissue dude lining the lumen

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.040 
epithelial tissue dude lining the lumen
look<00:02:49.980> at<00:02:50.370> my<00:02:51.000> lining<00:02:52.160> this<00:02:53.160> is

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
look at my lining this is

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.110 
look at my lining this is
epithelial<00:02:55.050> tissue<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:56.640> makes<00:02:56.910> perfect

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
epithelial tissue that makes perfect

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.960 
epithelial tissue that makes perfect
sense<00:02:57.360> doesn't<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:58.190> where<00:02:59.190> else<00:02:59.430> are<00:02:59.820> you

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
sense doesn't it where else are you

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.090 
sense doesn't it where else are you
going<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.360> see<00:03:00.510> epithelial<00:03:01.110> tissue<00:03:01.320> in<00:03:01.680> my

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
going to see epithelial tissue in my

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.990 
going to see epithelial tissue in my
little<00:03:02.360> fantastic<00:03:03.360> drawing<00:03:06.650> yes<00:03:07.790> that's<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
little fantastic drawing yes that's the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.560 
little fantastic drawing yes that's the
worst<00:03:09.210> color<00:03:09.480> I've<00:03:09.660> ever<00:03:09.840> picked<00:03:10.170> ever<00:03:11.570> this

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
worst color I've ever picked ever this

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.990 
worst color I've ever picked ever this
is<00:03:12.720> also<00:03:12.900> lining<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.500> space<00:03:13.770> what<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:17.000> it's

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
is also lining a space what is that it's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.300 
is also lining a space what is that it's
not<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.390> bad<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:19.410> wasn't<00:03:19.680> quite<00:03:19.860> as<00:03:20.010> bright

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
not that bad this wasn't quite as bright

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.610 
not that bad this wasn't quite as bright
as<00:03:20.490> I<00:03:20.580> expected

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
as I expected

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.490 
as I expected
that's<00:03:22.620> your<00:03:22.800> skin<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.730> then<00:03:24.660> all<00:03:24.930> your<00:03:25.140> guts

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
that's your skin and then all your guts

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.370 
that's your skin and then all your guts
all<00:03:25.890> your<00:03:26.580> your<00:03:26.970> heart<00:03:27.270> your<00:03:27.600> lungs<00:03:27.810> your

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
all your your heart your lungs your

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.090 
all your your heart your lungs your
muscles<00:03:29.040> everything<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.300> all<00:03:30.570> in<00:03:30.989> here<00:03:31.380> in

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
muscles everything is all in here in

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.640 
muscles everything is all in here in
between<00:03:33.050> basically<00:03:34.050> it's<00:03:34.170> like<00:03:34.320> you're<00:03:34.620> a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
between basically it's like you're a

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.530 
between basically it's like you're a
tube<00:03:35.330> within<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.630> tube<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.290> all<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.400> your<00:03:38.550> stuff

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
tube within a tube and all of your stuff

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.490 
tube within a tube and all of your stuff
is<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.910> between<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.510> tube<00:03:42.720> part<00:03:43.200> of

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
is in the in between the tube part of

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.850 
is in the in between the tube part of
your<00:03:43.739> tube<00:03:44.040> oh<00:03:45.020> we<00:03:46.020> can<00:03:46.170> get<00:03:46.290> crazy<00:03:46.530> but<00:03:46.709> that's

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
your tube oh we can get crazy but that's

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.979 
your tube oh we can get crazy but that's
like<00:03:47.100> your<00:03:47.250> basic<00:03:47.550> body<00:03:48.500> form<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:50.959> we<00:03:51.959> can

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
like your basic body form and we can

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.260 
like your basic body form and we can
look<00:03:52.410> at<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.770> functions<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.580> epithelial

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
look at the functions of epithelial

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.360 
look at the functions of epithelial
tissue<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.930> feel<00:03:55.650> like<00:03:55.800> I'm<00:03:55.920> running<00:03:56.070> out<00:03:56.310> of

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
tissue I feel like I'm running out of

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.580 
tissue I feel like I'm running out of
color<00:03:56.700> how's<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.180> possible<00:03:59.330> by<00:04:00.330> using<00:04:00.720> this

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
color how's that possible by using this

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.210 
color how's that possible by using this
little<00:04:02.010> buddy<00:04:02.600> crabman<00:04:03.600> here<00:04:03.959> we<00:04:04.769> can<00:04:04.920> see

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
little buddy crabman here we can see

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.979 
little buddy crabman here we can see
okay<00:04:05.850> what<00:04:06.000> are<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.180> functions<00:04:06.750> of

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
okay what are the functions of

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.000 
okay what are the functions of
epithelium<00:04:07.890> well<00:04:08.430> first<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.970> all<00:04:09.799> what's<00:04:10.799> the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
epithelium well first of all what's the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.099 
epithelium well first of all what's the
function<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.489> this<00:04:11.700> epithelium<00:04:12.510> out<00:04:12.690> here

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.150 

protection<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.790> lots<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:18.030> epithelia

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
protection and lots of epithelia

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.620 
protection and lots of epithelia
function<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.430> protection<00:04:21.209> we're<00:04:21.450> actually

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
function in protection we're actually

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.500 
function in protection we're actually
going<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> next<00:04:23.010> section<00:04:23.970> talk<00:04:24.270> about

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
going to in the next section talk about

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.500 
going to in the next section talk about
different<00:04:24.930> types<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.560> epithelium<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.510> in

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
different types of epithelium and in

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.750 
different types of epithelium and in
that<00:04:27.990> one<00:04:28.140> we'll<00:04:28.290> see<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.590> specific<00:04:29.190> type<00:04:29.550> of

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
that one we'll see the specific type of

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.120 
that one we'll see the specific type of
epithelium<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:31.080> really<00:04:31.650> good<00:04:31.950> at

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
epithelium that is really good at

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.740 
epithelium that is really good at
protection<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:33.090> we'll<00:04:33.270> see<00:04:33.450> why<00:04:33.690> the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
protection and we'll see why the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.230 
protection and we'll see why the
structure<00:04:34.410> enables<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.729> function<00:04:36.090> of

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
structure enables the function of

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
structure enables the function of
protection<00:04:36.930> all<00:04:37.830> right<00:04:38.430> we<00:04:38.820> also<00:04:39.120> have<00:04:39.780> a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
protection all right we also have a

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.650 
protection all right we also have a
couple<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.830> things<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.190> happen<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.940> couple<00:04:42.180> of

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
couple of things that happen a couple of

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.060 
couple of things that happen a couple of
functions<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:43.229> happen<00:04:43.440> here<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:45.919> first<00:04:46.919> of

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
functions that happen here so first of

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.040 
functions that happen here so first of
all<00:04:47.930> lubrication<00:04:48.930> really<00:04:49.680> yeah<00:04:50.510> basically<00:04:51.510> we

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
all lubrication really yeah basically we

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.530 
all lubrication really yeah basically we
can<00:04:52.260> secrete<00:04:52.800> stuff<00:04:56.300> epithelial<00:04:57.300> cells<00:04:58.490> make

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
can secrete stuff epithelial cells make

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.750 
can secrete stuff epithelial cells make
stuff<00:05:00.540> so<00:05:00.990> they<00:05:01.110> can<00:05:01.290> secrete<00:05:01.740> mucus<00:05:02.010> they<00:05:02.580> can

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
stuff so they can secrete mucus they can

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.790 
stuff so they can secrete mucus they can
secrete<00:05:03.120> hormones<00:05:03.570> they<00:05:04.229> can<00:05:04.410> secrete

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
secrete hormones they can secrete

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.730 
secrete hormones they can secrete
digestive<00:05:05.070> enzymes

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
digestive enzymes

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.570 
digestive enzymes
they<00:05:06.949> are<00:05:07.729> going<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.090> make<00:05:09.080> things<00:05:09.650> sweat<00:05:10.310> they

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
they are going to make things sweat they

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.740 
they are going to make things sweat they
can<00:05:10.729> secrete<00:05:11.090> sweat<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:13.520> they<00:05:13.699> just<00:05:13.880> squirt

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
can secrete sweat and they just squirt

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.339 
can secrete sweat and they just squirt
it<00:05:14.780> out

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
it out

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.960 
it out
so<00:05:15.889> secretion<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.669> the<00:05:16.789> act<00:05:16.970> of<00:05:17.360> taking

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
so secretion is the act of taking

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.150 
so secretion is the act of taking
producing<00:05:19.970> substances<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:21.009> excuse<00:05:22.009> me

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
producing substances and excuse me

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.719 
producing substances and excuse me
barfing<00:05:22.910> them<00:05:23.180> into<00:05:24.169> a<00:05:24.500> space<00:05:24.979> that's

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
barfing them into a space that's

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.999 
barfing them into a space that's
secretion<00:05:26.330> makes<00:05:27.139> perfect<00:05:27.530> sense<00:05:27.699> they<00:05:28.699> also

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
secretion makes perfect sense they also

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.760 
secretion makes perfect sense they also
play<00:05:31.009> a<00:05:31.039> role<00:05:31.190> in<00:05:31.880> another<00:05:32.840> really<00:05:33.349> important

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
play a role in another really important

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:41.469 
play a role in another really important
process<00:05:33.979> which<00:05:34.970> is<00:05:35.680> absorption<00:05:40.479> now

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
process which is absorption now

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.990 
process which is absorption now
absorption<00:05:42.409> we<00:05:42.740> think<00:05:43.009> about<00:05:43.130> it<00:05:43.400> and<00:05:43.520> we<00:05:43.610> go

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
absorption we think about it and we go

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.860 
absorption we think about it and we go
oh<00:05:44.440> we've<00:05:45.440> got<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:45.979> absorb<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:47.240> ice-cream

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
oh we've got to absorb the ice-cream

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.290 
oh we've got to absorb the ice-cream
cone<00:05:48.199> that<00:05:49.009> I<00:05:49.069> really<00:05:49.520> wish<00:05:49.669> I<00:05:49.849> was<00:05:50.000> eating

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
cone that I really wish I was eating

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.649 
cone that I really wish I was eating
right<00:05:50.449> now<00:05:51.400> that's<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.639> cherry<00:05:52.909> on<00:05:53.030> top<00:05:53.180> of<00:05:53.539> my

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
right now that's the cherry on top of my

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.070 
right now that's the cherry on top of my
ice<00:05:53.840> cream<00:05:54.169> cone<00:05:54.699> we<00:05:55.699> got<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:55.970> absorb<00:05:56.539> all<00:05:57.020> of

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
ice cream cone we got to absorb all of

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.379 
ice cream cone we got to absorb all of
those<00:05:57.470> nutrients<00:05:58.190> sometimes<00:05:58.849> we<00:05:59.000> wish<00:05:59.180> there

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
those nutrients sometimes we wish there

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:00.610 
those nutrients sometimes we wish there
were<00:05:59.449> parts<00:05:59.720> of<00:05:59.810> the<00:05:59.930> nutrients<00:06:00.409> that<00:06:00.440> we

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
were parts of the nutrients that we

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.920 
were parts of the nutrients that we
didn't<00:06:00.919> absorb<00:06:01.280> but<00:06:01.610> you<00:06:01.880> know<00:06:02.000> we<00:06:02.360> do<00:06:02.599> our

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
didn't absorb but you know we do our

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.629 
didn't absorb but you know we do our
bodies<00:06:03.319> are<00:06:03.560> very<00:06:03.590> good<00:06:03.979> at<00:06:04.099> it<00:06:04.250> epithelial

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
bodies are very good at it epithelial

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.469 
bodies are very good at it epithelial
tissues<00:06:05.599> are<00:06:05.780> very<00:06:06.289> good<00:06:06.620> at<00:06:06.770> absorbing<00:06:07.669> the

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
tissues are very good at absorbing the

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:11.170 
tissues are very good at absorbing the
stuff<00:06:08.900> in<00:06:09.139> the<00:06:09.380> lumen<00:06:09.770> that<00:06:10.520> we<00:06:10.669> need<00:06:10.909> and

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
stuff in the lumen that we need and

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.779 
stuff in the lumen that we need and
bringing<00:06:11.990> it<00:06:12.139> into<00:06:12.380> your<00:06:12.919> body<00:06:13.130> so<00:06:13.250> that<00:06:13.490> it

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
bringing it into your body so that it

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.399 
bringing it into your body so that it
can<00:06:13.940> go<00:06:14.060> to<00:06:14.090> the<00:06:14.180> rest<00:06:14.449> of<00:06:14.599> your<00:06:14.750> cells<00:06:15.020> because

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
can go to the rest of your cells because

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.290 
can go to the rest of your cells because
look<00:06:15.680> here's<00:06:15.949> Joe<00:06:16.250> cells<00:06:16.610> sitting<00:06:17.000> in<00:06:17.090> there

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
look here's Joe cells sitting in there

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.370 
look here's Joe cells sitting in there
starving<00:06:18.020> to<00:06:18.139> death

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
starving to death

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.230 
starving to death
he<00:06:18.979> needs<00:06:19.159> an<00:06:19.219> ice-cream<00:06:19.520> cone<00:06:19.759> like<00:06:19.940> right

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
he needs an ice-cream cone like right

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.740 
he needs an ice-cream cone like right
now<00:06:20.449> so<00:06:21.440> epithelial<00:06:22.340> cells<00:06:22.580> play<00:06:23.000> a<00:06:23.030> role<00:06:23.419> in

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
now so epithelial cells play a role in

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.010 
now so epithelial cells play a role in
that

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
that

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.240 
that
absorption<00:06:26.020> that's<00:06:27.020> it<00:06:27.229> that's<00:06:27.800> where<00:06:28.099> we're

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
absorption that's it that's where we're

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.390 
absorption that's it that's where we're
going<00:06:28.490> with<00:06:28.729> our<00:06:28.789> functions<00:06:29.419> and<00:06:30.169> now<00:06:30.620> we're

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
going with our functions and now we're

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.320 
going with our functions and now we're
gonna<00:06:31.490> look<00:06:31.729> at<00:06:31.880> the<00:06:32.000> different

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
gonna look at the different

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.510 
gonna look at the different
classifications<00:06:32.719> of<00:06:33.409> epithelial<00:06:34.070> tissues

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
classifications of epithelial tissues

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.440 
classifications of epithelial tissues
and<00:06:34.759> kind<00:06:35.330> of<00:06:35.389> what<00:06:35.569> we're<00:06:35.690> gonna<00:06:35.780> see<00:06:36.110> in<00:06:36.229> lab
