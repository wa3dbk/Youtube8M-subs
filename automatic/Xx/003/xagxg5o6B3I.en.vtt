00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.010
 I want to comment that the situation in San 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.440
 Cristóbal de las Casas, as it is 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.210
 tranquility although they continue with the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.190
 evaluation work by the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.890
 to know the greatest number of damages and 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.950
 be able to provide humanitarian aid 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.770
 or required by families 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.390
 which they were affected while longer 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.060
 they distribute written mattress and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.460
 cleaning plus other help 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.500
 for all these families that of some 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.340
 way they lost everything and not precisely 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.840
 by air but because with the air 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.479
 they detached the sheet ceilings 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.640
 how he brought rains with all this 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.950
 generated effects on the appliances 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.630
 domestic and some families that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.450
 they practically lost everything in that 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.140
 felt one of the most affected neighborhoods 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.060
 for example it's Mexicans there you can 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.580
 observe in one of the schools 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.519
 primary of that neighborhood is the dome itself 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.890
 came down and you need to be able to 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.590
 total repair in another neighborhood 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.690
 that add about 13 but others of the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.220

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.920
 is required for the family to return 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.709

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.599
