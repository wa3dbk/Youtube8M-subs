better some more and when the traps that
we<00:02:11.540> put<00:02:11.720> ourselves<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.859> that's<00:02:13.250> really

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
we put ourselves in and that's really

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.030 
we put ourselves in and that's really
just<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.910> basic<00:02:14.239> core<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.019> song

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
just the basic core of the song

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.899 
just the basic core of the song
is<00:02:16.310> about<00:02:16.849> being<00:02:17.540> fearless<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.730> making<00:02:19.730> that

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
is about being fearless and making that

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.000 
is about being fearless and making that
that<00:02:20.269> choice

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.040
