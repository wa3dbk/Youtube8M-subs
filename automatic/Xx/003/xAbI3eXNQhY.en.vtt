probably<00:02:16.980> want<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.220> dye<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.430> down<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> little

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
probably want to dye it down a little

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.850 
probably want to dye it down a little
bit<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> reason<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.840> because<00:02:19.020> I'm

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
bit and the reason is because I'm

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.400 
bit and the reason is because I'm
assuming<00:02:20.280> your<00:02:20.430> goal<00:02:21.209> your<00:02:21.599> end<00:02:21.810> goal<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.290> not

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
assuming your goal your end goal is not

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.410 
assuming your goal your end goal is not
to<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:22.770> heavy<00:02:22.980> as<00:02:23.160> possible<00:02:23.640> your<00:02:24.180> goal<00:02:24.390> is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
to be as heavy as possible your goal is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.199 
to be as heavy as possible your goal is
to<00:02:24.599> put<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.930> muscle<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.819> when<00:02:26.819> we<00:02:26.940> think<00:02:26.970> about

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
to put on muscle so when we think about

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.990 
to put on muscle so when we think about
this<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.810> terms<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.860> building<00:02:29.340> muscle<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.819> want

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
this in terms of building muscle we want

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.910 
this in terms of building muscle we want
to<00:02:30.090> think<00:02:30.269> about<00:02:30.540> what<00:02:31.170> builds<00:02:31.500> muscle<00:02:31.800> well

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
to think about what builds muscle well

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.150 
to think about what builds muscle well
what<00:02:32.069> does<00:02:32.190> build<00:02:32.489> muscle<00:02:32.819> does<00:02:33.330> being

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
what does build muscle does being

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.089 
what does build muscle does being
heavier<00:02:35.160> build<00:02:35.400> muscle<00:02:35.700> milk<00:02:36.950> will<00:02:37.950> that

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
heavier build muscle milk will that

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.430 
heavier build muscle milk will that
allow<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.760> lift<00:02:38.970> heavier<00:02:39.330> weights<00:02:39.630> yes

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
allow you to lift heavier weights yes

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.910 
allow you to lift heavier weights yes
but<00:02:40.860> artificially<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.670> I'll<00:02:41.790> get<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.120> that

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
but artificially and I'll get to that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.750 
but artificially and I'll get to that
here's<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.980> thing<00:02:44.160> if<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:45.480> are<00:02:46.370> over<00:02:47.370> fifteen

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
here's the thing if you are over fifteen

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.830 
here's the thing if you are over fifteen
percent<00:02:47.970> body<00:02:48.120> fat<00:02:48.269> you're<00:02:48.600> probably

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
percent body fat you're probably

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.509 
percent body fat you're probably
restricting<00:02:49.470> blood<00:02:49.500> flow<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.100> muscle

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
restricting blood flow to your muscle

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.229 
restricting blood flow to your muscle
cells<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:52.370> when<00:02:53.370> you're<00:02:53.489> thinking<00:02:53.519> about<00:02:53.880> oh<00:02:54.209> I

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
cells so when you're thinking about oh I

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.559 
cells so when you're thinking about oh I
want<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.690> bulk<00:02:54.930> up<00:02:55.140> past<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.150> even<00:02:57.420> heavier

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
want to bulk up past to be even heavier

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.780 
want to bulk up past to be even heavier
and<00:02:57.989> I'm<00:02:58.260> at<00:02:58.380> twenty<00:02:58.650> percent<00:02:58.860> body<00:02:59.010> fat<00:02:59.160> what

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
and I'm at twenty percent body fat what

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.729 
and I'm at twenty percent body fat what
you're<00:02:59.910> really<00:02:59.940> doing<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.510> starving<00:03:01.470> out<00:03:01.560> your

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
you're really doing is starving out your

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.559 
you're really doing is starving out your
muscle<00:03:02.040> cells<00:03:02.220> by<00:03:02.640> reducing<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.330> amount<00:03:03.420> of

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
muscle cells by reducing the amount of

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.339 
muscle cells by reducing the amount of
blood<00:03:03.690> flow<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.140> cells<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:05.580> are

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
blood flow to the cells you are

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.900 
blood flow to the cells you are
basically<00:03:07.349> taking<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.950> very<00:03:08.130> fuel<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.760> very

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
basically taking the very fuel the very

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.630 
basically taking the very fuel the very
thing<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.440> will<00:03:10.440> help<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.860> increase<00:03:11.040> your

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
thing that will help to increase your

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.449 
thing that will help to increase your
cell<00:03:12.330> volume<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:12.810> your<00:03:12.870> muscles<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.500> reducing

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
cell volume in your muscles and reducing

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.420 
cell volume in your muscles and reducing
it<00:03:15.019> blood<00:03:16.019> carries<00:03:16.859> nutrients<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
it blood carries nutrients to the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.500 
it blood carries nutrients to the
muscles<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:17.940> those<00:03:18.690> nutrients<00:03:19.880> provide<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
muscles and those nutrients provide the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.289 
muscles and those nutrients provide the
means<00:03:21.780> for<00:03:21.959> expansion<00:03:22.739> for<00:03:23.670> cell<00:03:23.940> expansion

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
means for expansion for cell expansion

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.800 
means for expansion for cell expansion
right<00:03:25.260> that's<00:03:26.130> why<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.489> get<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> pump<00:03:27.030> alright

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
right that's why you get a pump alright

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.170 
right that's why you get a pump alright
that's<00:03:28.470> why<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:29.190> train<00:03:29.430> for<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.730> pump<00:03:30.000> as

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
that's why we train for a pump as

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.099 
that's why we train for a pump as
bodybuilders<00:03:31.190> alright<00:03:32.450> that's<00:03:33.450> what<00:03:33.750> helps

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
bodybuilders alright that's what helps

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.030 
bodybuilders alright that's what helps
cellular<00:03:34.799> expansion<00:03:35.400> now<00:03:36.470> my<00:03:37.470> advice<00:03:37.769> would

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
cellular expansion now my advice would

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.129 
cellular expansion now my advice would
be<00:03:38.100> on<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:39.150> front<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.380> need<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:42.139> get

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
be on that front that you need to get

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.229 
be on that front that you need to get
leaner<00:03:43.560> right<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.489> forty<00:03:44.790> three<00:03:44.910> hundred

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
leaner right so forty three hundred

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.330 
leaner right so forty three hundred
calories<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:46.440> probably<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:46.859> little<00:03:46.950> bit<00:03:47.160> too

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
calories is probably a little bit too

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.240 
calories is probably a little bit too
much<00:03:47.489> for<00:03:47.720> 220<00:03:48.720> pounder<00:03:49.049> right<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:50.190> were

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
much for 220 pounder right if you were

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.500 
much for 220 pounder right if you were
300<00:03:50.790> pounds<00:03:51.090> then<00:03:52.040> yeah<00:03:53.040> maybe<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.850> if<00:03:54.389> you're

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
300 pounds then yeah maybe and if you're

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.270 
300 pounds then yeah maybe and if you're
300<00:03:54.690> pounds<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.139> muscle<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.560> not<00:03:55.739> fifty

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
300 pounds of muscle and not fifty

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.259 
300 pounds of muscle and not fifty
percent<00:03:56.459> body<00:03:56.609> fat<00:03:56.900> but<00:03:58.040> 220<00:03:59.040> pounds<00:03:59.459> you<00:04:00.239> know

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
percent body fat but 220 pounds you know

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.729 
percent body fat but 220 pounds you know
you<00:04:00.389> probably<00:04:00.690> want<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.019> be<00:04:01.079> eating<00:04:01.500> more<00:04:01.620> in

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
you probably want to be eating more in

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:02.870 
you probably want to be eating more in
the<00:04:01.829> three<00:04:02.069> thousand<00:04:02.489> thirty<00:04:02.700> two<00:04:02.850> hundred

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
the three thousand thirty two hundred

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.250 
the three thousand thirty two hundred
calorie<00:04:03.420> range<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.840> didn't<00:04:04.049> do<00:04:04.139> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
calorie range and I didn't do the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.199 
calorie range and I didn't do the
calculation<00:04:05.250> or<00:04:05.310> anything<00:04:05.579> like<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.760> you

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
calculation or anything like that you

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.349 
calculation or anything like that you
can<00:04:06.750> figure<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.019> out<00:04:07.170> at<00:04:07.440> home<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:08.549> yeah<00:04:09.299> you

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
can figure that out at home but yeah you

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.849 
can figure that out at home but yeah you
probably<00:04:09.720> want<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.049> be<00:04:10.109> eating<00:04:10.350> around<00:04:10.470> three

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
probably want to be eating around three

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.849 
probably want to be eating around three
thousand<00:04:11.310> maybe<00:04:11.910> even<00:04:12.090> 2,800<00:04:12.810> calories<00:04:12.930> would

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
thousand maybe even 2,800 calories would

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.490 
thousand maybe even 2,800 calories would
do<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.130> better<00:04:14.340> because<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:14.940> would<00:04:15.060> put<00:04:15.209> you

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
do you better because that would put you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.759 
do you better because that would put you
into<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:17.700> know<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:18.030> slight<00:04:18.510> color<00:04:19.139> caloric

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
into you know a slight color caloric

and I'm not saying that you need to be
the<00:05:48.470> strongest<00:05:48.979> but<00:05:49.789> you<00:05:49.909> need<00:05:50.060> to<00:05:50.120> be

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
the strongest but you need to be

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.909 
the strongest but you need to be
stronger<00:05:50.479> than<00:05:50.659> what<00:05:50.840> you<00:05:50.960> are<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.349> that

suggests to me that you are not

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.460 
suggests to me that you are not
necessarily<00:05:55.430> building<00:05:56.090> muscle<00:05:56.360> mass<00:05:56.510> you<00:05:56.810> are

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
necessarily building muscle mass you are

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.110 
necessarily building muscle mass you are
just<00:05:57.710> getting<00:05:57.919> heavier<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:58.520> fatter<00:05:59.000> from

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
just getting heavier and fatter from

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.839 
just getting heavier and fatter from
eating<00:05:59.599> and<00:05:59.720> influx<00:06:00.080> of<00:06:00.169> calories<00:06:00.650> so<00:06:01.520> in<00:06:01.820> your

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
eating and influx of calories so in your

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.000 
eating and influx of calories so in your
training<00:06:02.300> what<00:06:02.960> I<00:06:02.990> would<00:06:03.260> focus<00:06:03.440> on<00:06:03.800> is

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
training what I would focus on is

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.290 
training what I would focus on is
continuing<00:06:07.010> to<00:06:07.130> try<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.400> attack<00:06:07.789> these<00:06:07.970> lifts

continuing to try to attack these lifts

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.260 
continuing to try to attack these lifts
to<00:06:09.020> maybe<00:06:09.380> change<00:06:10.159> up<00:06:10.490> your<00:06:10.699> training<00:06:11.240> routine

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
to maybe change up your training routine

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.620 
to maybe change up your training routine
a<00:06:11.599> little<00:06:11.690> bit<00:06:12.050> maybe<00:06:12.970> read<00:06:13.970> some<00:06:14.000> of<00:06:14.330> the

a little bit maybe read some of the
