00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.940 
a big point swing at the end of the game
you're<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.600> get<00:03:02.720> points<00:03:03.200> for<00:03:03.230> you're

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
you're going to get points for you're

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.870 
you're going to get points for you're
going<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.130> pick<00:03:04.250> up<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.430> cards<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.730> you're

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
going to pick up the cards that you're

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.490 
going to pick up the cards that you're
on<00:03:05.030> okay<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.810> then<00:03:06.140> you're<00:03:06.170> going<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.410> add

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
on okay and then you're going to add

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.200 
on okay and then you're going to add
them<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> point<00:03:07.460> in<00:03:07.820> your<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.180> your

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
them to the point in your in your

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.240 
them to the point in your in your
discard<00:03:08.630> pile<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.960> in<00:03:09.050> your<00:03:09.170> hand<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:09.980> the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
discard pile and in your hand so the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.110 
discard pile and in your hand so the
point<00:03:10.280> totals<00:03:10.700> are<00:03:10.790> up<00:03:10.850> here<00:03:10.910> in<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.060> upper

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
point totals are up here in the upper

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.210 
point totals are up here in the upper
right<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:12.020> in<00:03:12.170> general<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.830> lower<00:03:12.980> point

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
right so in general the lower point

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.280 
right so in general the lower point
cards<00:03:13.490> are<00:03:13.580> easier<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.910> play<00:03:14.210> like<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:15.170> do

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
cards are easier to play like you do

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.510 
cards are easier to play like you do
better<00:03:15.440> more<00:03:15.680> flexible<00:03:16.010> movement<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.460> the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
better more flexible movement and the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.460 
better more flexible movement and the
higher<00:03:16.670> point<00:03:16.940> cards<00:03:17.270> are<00:03:17.420> maybe<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.380> little

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
higher point cards are maybe a little

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.780 
higher point cards are maybe a little
bit<00:03:18.620> tougher<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:18.950> play<00:03:19.100> or<00:03:19.160> more<00:03:19.340> limited<00:03:19.730> in

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
bit tougher to play or more limited in

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.970 
bit tougher to play or more limited in
usage<00:03:20.420> right<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.050> they<00:03:21.110> hurt<00:03:21.260> they<00:03:21.650> hurt<00:03:21.680> your

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
usage right and they hurt they hurt your

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.920 
usage right and they hurt they hurt your
hand<00:03:22.280> base<00:03:22.580> right<00:03:22.970> exactly<00:03:23.480> because<00:03:23.780> you

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
hand base right exactly because you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.240 
hand base right exactly because you
really<00:03:24.140> only<00:03:24.260> have<00:03:24.320> those<00:03:24.590> three<00:03:24.890> cards<00:03:25.190> you

kind of grayed out here I want to stress

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.370 
kind of grayed out here I want to stress
that<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.520> prototype<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.480> really<00:03:48.230> the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
that this is a prototype so really the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.400 
that this is a prototype so really the
art<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.800> finished<00:03:49.720> but<00:03:50.720> there<00:03:51.050> are<00:03:51.200> some

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
art is finished but there are some

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.290 
art is finished but there are some
formatting<00:03:51.830> changes<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.790> can't<00:03:53.209> really

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
formatting changes and you can't really

read the title on the box but yeah and

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.540 
read the title on the box but yeah and
these<00:03:57.020> will<00:03:57.260> be<00:03:57.410> different<00:03:57.770> pieces<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.370> think

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
these will be different pieces I think

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.800 
these will be different pieces I think
we're<00:03:58.640> going<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.820> try<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.150> make<00:03:59.330> them<00:03:59.510> ninja

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
we're going to try and make them ninja

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.300 
we're going to try and make them ninja
meeples<00:04:00.140> depending<00:04:00.470> on<00:04:00.560> how<00:04:00.650> well<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:01.100> the
