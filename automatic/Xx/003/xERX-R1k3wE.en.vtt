00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.790
 Zune 

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.950
 It's long, but please look at the illustration of this week. 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.690
 Hey this is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.200
 One-handed sword 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.980
 I'm a return to the little that before and that 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.760
 What is the main cause of this bug? 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.680
 The only nor somehow because I have not seen 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:30.740
 I only saw one handed sword with a mark 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.800
 There are many types of care that can be equipped with awesome that my 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.570
 Maca Big Dog or Belo 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.780
 Flag specific building materials pearl of root village anyway 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:50.420
 In my mind I think that one handed sword has always been a shuriken 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.140
 Have much I do so with interest because I mean I kinda Shuriken part to you is attached 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.140
 Teru school 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:02.450
 Have thought this not you who use I Ken Ishii in dinosaur love 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:10.369
 I think that the attack power is also lucky and it is the easiest to use 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:13.560
 This is a basic voice for beginners , and while attacking with a one- handed sword , another hand comes with one hand 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.390
 Offensive and defensive like using 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.130
 The most amazing thing is the one-handed sword, but I think it's always the key to know who to use 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.780
 I think this is all about it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.740
 That blue japanese ninja is pleased 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.480

 This is a wide day 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:42.790
 Use the one-handed sword and listen to the various details of that and the one-handed sword 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:46.980
 I that also waiting Te like a way r This is certainly Tsutsu 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.700
 I learned through the tutorial, but I didn't have a hurdle for the Women's Association tutorial 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.520
 And to say 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.170
 E-mail guard is a basic play style 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.860
 A bit of 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.140
 That it is full entered dial 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.530
 If it's a little dangerous, you 'll have to recover from the medicinal plants and do some of that 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.830
 It is natural because I do it myself 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.220
 It's so difficult that I can talk a lot 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:19.260
 It's too haha 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.269
 What's the basics of putting on the defensive I can not do well and I 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.160
 I can only shovel 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.550
 I can move and I can go back and forth with both 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.800
 Mood's a refreshing What do 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:45.620
 High difficulty working properly because instead contribution is likely to rust I want a look around rewarding 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:49.670
 It is said that it would be good if it was not good for sharpening 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.450
 I thought that the end was a bit about now , but no, now it's tic 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.870
 I 've taken the mushroom in a state I understand 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:01.750

 Made from this because First Nagahama Mr. Mu staff has me to get another edition 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:14.820
 If you are going to make a random nekane character please by all means play together 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.820
 I think so please tell me a lot 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:26.090
 Now glider wildebeest is be known a Boo Boo 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:30.110

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:35.890
 Summary Last week's misfortune to my character makeup 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.920
 It was over a period of 1 hour and a half to the characters make from home this broadcast finished in your home 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.150

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.210
 I can change the color of that inner, especially for girls 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.400
 As the upper and lower 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:04.220
 Good day 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:09.260
 But the uneven bloom even than than pink pretty ne minor over rather than decide is do you touch power generation 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:14.329
 It looks like a little bluish white, and I'm super addicted to it 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.570
 Oh, it's a little pink, but it's too thin, so it's too thin and it's over time 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.570
 Made to work hard Te

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:29.340
 Even if you make it to your skin color club in an honest manner, the skin color that suits your favorite color is white. 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.470

 The darker Tsu corn boiled diluted at home to is thinner Machiro skin What results 6 cun even hair in vertical 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:54.600

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:23.310
 If you can change the equipment by yourself, you can see the inner with the bag or something 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.639
 There seems to be some
