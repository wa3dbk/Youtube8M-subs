alright guys as to be honest here I'm

alright guys as to be honest here I'm
owned<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.130> Prius<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.700> have<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.000> soft<00:03:57.210> spot<00:03:57.300> in

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
owned a Prius so I have a soft spot in

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.510 
owned a Prius so I have a soft spot in
my<00:03:57.690> heart<00:03:57.720> for<00:03:57.990> this<00:03:58.200> vehicle<00:03:58.620> but<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.460> know

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
my heart for this vehicle but I know

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.700 
my heart for this vehicle but I know
that<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.000> c-max<00:04:00.360> is<00:04:00.600> more<00:04:00.840> fuel-efficient

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
that the c-max is more fuel-efficient

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.590 
that the c-max is more fuel-efficient
it's<00:04:01.890> more<00:04:02.040> powerful<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.240> probably

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
it's more powerful and it probably

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.940 
it's more powerful and it probably
handles<00:04:03.990> better<00:04:04.080> than<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.440> because<00:04:04.740> there's

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
handles better than this because there's

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.860 
handles better than this because there's
not<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.190> lot<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.430> Road<00:04:05.640> feel<00:04:05.880> here<00:04:06.150> having<00:04:06.690> said

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
not a lot of Road feel here having said

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.560 
not a lot of Road feel here having said
all<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.020> I<00:04:07.350> think<00:04:07.860> that<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.310> Toyota<00:04:08.700> is<00:04:08.850> less

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
all that I think that the Toyota is less

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.020 
all that I think that the Toyota is less
pretentious<00:04:09.990> more<00:04:10.650> honest<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.610> will<00:04:11.760> run

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
pretentious more honest and it will run

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.130 
pretentious more honest and it will run
till<00:04:12.330> Kingdom<00:04:12.630> Come

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.310 

so<00:04:16.140> wrong<00:04:16.370> c-max<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.670> comfortable<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.930> c-max

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
so wrong c-max is comfortable the c-max

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.250 
so wrong c-max is comfortable the c-max
is<00:04:19.800> faster<00:04:20.310> c-max<00:04:21.150> is<00:04:21.420> better<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:21.959> almost

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
is faster c-max is better in almost

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.200 
is faster c-max is better in almost
every<00:04:22.530> way<00:04:22.620> this<00:04:22.800> rides<00:04:23.010> better<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.760> one<00:04:24.030> has

every way this rides better this one has

every way this rides better this one has
better<00:04:24.420> seats<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.840> admit<00:04:25.110> but<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.740> c-max<00:04:26.040> is

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
better seats I admit but the c-max is

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.080 
better seats I admit but the c-max is
kind<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.610> fun<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.620> isn't<00:04:28.790> are<00:04:29.790> you<00:04:29.910> saying

47<00:05:30.220> City<00:05:30.400> 47<00:05:30.880> highway<00:05:31.150> 47<00:05:31.540> combined<00:05:31.930> tell<00:05:32.470> me

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
47 City 47 highway 47 combined tell me

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.870 
47 City 47 highway 47 combined tell me
about<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.800> powertrain<00:05:33.190> how<00:05:33.430> do<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:33.580> get<00:05:33.730> such

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
about the powertrain how do you get such

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.240 
about the powertrain how do you get such
fantastic<00:05:34.210> numbers<00:05:34.690> so<00:05:35.350> this<00:05:35.530> is<00:05:35.710> our<00:05:35.890> third

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
fantastic numbers so this is our third

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.360 
fantastic numbers so this is our third
generation<00:05:36.690> hybrid<00:05:37.690> system<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.980> we<00:05:39.070> still<00:05:39.340> use

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
generation hybrid system so we still use

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.250 
generation hybrid system so we still use
the<00:05:39.700> flower<00:05:39.910> power<00:05:40.240> split<00:05:40.510> technology<00:05:41.140> that

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
the flower power split technology that

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.960 
the flower power split technology that
we've<00:05:41.410> used<00:05:41.650> in<00:05:41.860> our<00:05:42.010> previous<00:05:42.310> generation

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
we've used in our previous generation

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.030 
we've used in our previous generation
hybrids<00:05:43.360> but<00:05:44.050> now<00:05:44.230> we're<00:05:44.440> combining<00:05:44.620> it<00:05:45.010> with

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
hybrids but now we're combining it with

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.240 
hybrids but now we're combining it with
lithium-ion<00:05:45.910> batteries<00:05:46.650> we've<00:05:47.650> downsized

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
lithium-ion batteries we've downsized

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.580 
lithium-ion batteries we've downsized
the<00:05:48.730> engine<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.210> make<00:05:49.360> it<00:05:49.540> efficient<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:50.260> kind

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
the engine to make it efficient and kind

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.440 
the engine to make it efficient and kind
of<00:05:50.650> operated<00:05:51.130> its<00:05:51.310> best<00:05:51.640> position<00:05:52.180> in<00:05:52.270> terms

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
of operated its best position in terms

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.900 
of operated its best position in terms
of<00:05:52.660> the<00:05:52.750> 2<00:05:52.900> litre<00:05:53.190> inline-four<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:54.550> an<00:05:54.610> Atkins

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
of the 2 litre inline-four and an Atkins

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.360 
of the 2 litre inline-four and an Atkins
cycle<00:05:55.419> and<00:05:55.690> at<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.350> same<00:05:56.530> time<00:05:56.770> we've<00:05:57.160> also

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
cycle and at the same time we've also

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.909 
cycle and at the same time we've also
improved<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.600> transmission<00:05:59.200> and<00:05:59.620> for<00:05:59.860> the

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
improved the transmission and for the

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.100 
improved the transmission and for the
first<00:06:00.100> time<00:06:00.310> we're<00:06:00.550> building<00:06:00.850> that<00:06:01.480> as<00:06:01.840> well

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
first time we're building that as well

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.980 
first time we're building that as well
as<00:06:02.230> the<00:06:02.350> battery<00:06:02.680> systems<00:06:03.130> in<00:06:03.280> house

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
as the battery systems in house

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.930 
as the battery systems in house
objectively<00:06:04.990> there<00:06:05.230> is<00:06:05.410> no<00:06:05.650> doubt<00:06:05.950> that<00:06:06.669> is<00:06:06.910> a

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
objectively there is no doubt that is a

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.180 
objectively there is no doubt that is a
better<00:06:07.180> car<00:06:07.480> but<00:06:08.110> if<00:06:08.320> we<00:06:08.440> were<00:06:08.500> my<00:06:08.710> money<00:06:08.950> I

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
better car but if we were my money I

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.510 
better car but if we were my money I
probably<00:06:09.820> go<00:06:10.030> for<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.330> Prius<00:06:11.070> buy<00:06:12.070> rental

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
probably go for the Prius buy rental

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.250 
probably go for the Prius buy rental
lease<00:06:12.640> it<00:06:12.790> or<00:06:12.880> forget<00:06:13.150> it<00:06:13.180> let's<00:06:13.840> wait<00:06:14.080> till<00:06:14.200> we

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
lease it or forget it let's wait till we

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.600 
lease it or forget it let's wait till we
have<00:06:14.440> it<00:06:14.530> for<00:06:14.680> a<00:06:14.740> week<00:06:14.860> Nathan<00:06:15.280> how<00:06:15.340> about<00:06:15.490> you

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
what would you say I think it's off to a

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.450 
what would you say I think it's off to a
really<00:06:17.260> good<00:06:17.440> start<00:06:17.740> but<00:06:17.890> we<00:06:17.950> haven't<00:06:18.190> had<00:06:18.430> a

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
really good start but we haven't had a

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.070 
really good start but we haven't had a
chance<00:06:18.700> to<00:06:18.790> really<00:06:18.970> drive<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:19.300> so<00:06:19.630> once<00:06:19.810> we<00:06:19.960> get

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
chance to really drive it so once we get

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.510 
chance to really drive it so once we get
our<00:06:20.230> paws<00:06:20.410> on<00:06:20.650> this<00:06:20.800> for<00:06:20.980> a<00:06:21.010> little<00:06:21.190> bit<00:06:21.370> longer

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
our paws on this for a little bit longer

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.400 
our paws on this for a little bit longer
I'm<00:06:21.850> thinking<00:06:22.390> it's<00:06:22.510> gonna<00:06:22.600> score<00:06:22.900> very<00:06:23.169> high

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
I'm thinking it's gonna score very high

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.600 
I'm thinking it's gonna score very high
and<00:06:23.740> I'll<00:06:23.860> tell<00:06:24.010> you<00:06:24.070> right<00:06:24.100> now

right<00:06:47.250> quality<00:06:47.819> and<00:06:48.000> the<00:06:48.180> Prius<00:06:48.569> is<00:06:49.129> it's<00:06:50.129> just

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
right quality and the Prius is it's just

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.300 
right quality and the Prius is it's just
sublime<00:06:50.759> it's<00:06:51.060> it's<00:06:51.449> almost<00:06:51.659> Lexus<00:06:52.139> like<00:06:52.349> the

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
sublime it's it's almost Lexus like the

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.580 
sublime it's it's almost Lexus like the
Ford<00:06:53.729> though<00:06:53.940> the<00:06:54.180> steering<00:06:54.449> I<00:06:54.930> love<00:06:55.289> it

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
Ford though the steering I love it

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.350 
Ford though the steering I love it
it's<00:06:56.340> a<00:06:56.430> little<00:06:56.610> more<00:06:56.789> aggressive<00:06:57.030> and

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
it's a little more aggressive and

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.719 
it's a little more aggressive and
suspensions<00:06:58.289> a<00:06:58.560> little<00:06:58.740> bit<00:06:58.830> better<00:06:59.039> and<00:06:59.430> you

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
suspensions a little bit better and you

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.999 
suspensions a little bit better and you
can<00:06:59.970> really<00:07:00.210> take<00:07:00.509> on<00:07:00.659> the<00:07:00.810> horsepower<00:07:01.139> so<00:07:01.680> in

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:02.009 
can really take on the horsepower so in

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:04.040 
can really take on the horsepower so in
the<00:07:02.669> end<00:07:02.819> you<00:07:03.210> know<00:07:03.330> what<00:07:03.569> I'd<00:07:03.840> actually

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
the end you know what I'd actually

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.080 
the end you know what I'd actually
probably<00:07:04.830> have<00:07:05.099> to<00:07:05.280> go<00:07:05.370> with<00:07:05.400> my<00:07:05.610> confidant

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090
