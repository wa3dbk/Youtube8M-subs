 discoveries that shaped one of

 contextualize the scientific ideas of

 19th century the publication of the origin of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.230
 the species 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.330
 brought discredit and angry attacks on his 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.170
 author but the work convinced 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.909
 important scientists of the time 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.640
 where do the pieces that come from 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.240
 they integrate the exhibition darwin la 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.030
 exhibition was conceived by five 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.320
 museums of the most prestigious of 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.090
 natural sciences is the American museum 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.149
 of natural history 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.789

 radio mission the five met for 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.840
 see how to celebrate the bicentennial of 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:59.259
 birth of charles darwin in 2009 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.570
 for 21 years charles darwin gave form 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.750
 to your ideas in this property the house 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.240
 down at the school of san ildefonso it 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.239
 recreates in detail the environment of 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.879
 that period notebooks of notes letters 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.160
 to your colleagues and also the letters of 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:19.480
 love for his cousin Emma Wedgwood who 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.670
 the naturalist would marry at age 30 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.250
 this theory is disseminated that is so 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.610
 controversial even today and the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.640
 task when he observes the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.720
 fossils he found realized 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.940
 that the animals that were extinct 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.610
 They seemed in much bigger size but 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.920
 resembled current mammals 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.319
 that I saw then I started that good 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.170
 this seems to descend from this same 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.500
 species and here we see evolution how 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.930
 they were adapting to the realities 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.560
 the book ran out the day of his 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.560
 publication 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.439
 In the exhibition , the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.510
 similarities as the turtles of 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.879
 Galapagos Islands and the oldest ancestor 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.200
 old armadillos that also 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:13.519
 it looks like a huge turtle if I see the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.430
 armadillo and I see the glyptodonte can 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.140
 realize that the carapace that has 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.190
 the thread between which is an animal 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.010
 extinct looks like the armadillo but the 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.349
 current armadillo had to go through 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.299
 certain transformations that we see in the 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:35.420
 room and we realize that they see maybe 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.599
 the fact of not having predators to its 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.599
 around made it soften the 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:46.239
 shell that he has and that he had a 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.239
 much thinner design than glyptodonte 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.080
 At the end of the exhibition, the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.090
 Mexican room where the 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.980
 contributions of born naturalists 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.620
 on our soil as well as the 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.680
 national biodiversity 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.530
 talking about biodiversity Mexico also 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.540
 had his length that is jose mariano mociÃ±o 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:11.629
 it predates the garden because in 1757 he 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.930
 receives a commission to make a 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:18.979
 rising botany that there is in 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.769
 Mexico to Vancouver and travel all 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.919
 this with two students of san carlos de la 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.380
 san carlos academy to raise the 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.740
 drawings that we have in the last room of 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.960
 the darwin exhibition in the old 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.750
 Colegio de San Ildefonso is presented 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.760
 until 21 September there will be a cycle 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.580
 Conference titled Charles Darwin
