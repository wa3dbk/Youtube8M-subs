to mild which was again ideal
post-christmas<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:05.220> into<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.880> februari

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
post-christmas and then into do februari

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.359 
post-christmas and then into do februari
where<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> started<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> warm<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:08.130> which

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
where it started to warm up which

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
where it started to warm up which
obviously<00:01:08.640> accelerated<00:01:09.299> some<00:01:09.450> riding<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
obviously accelerated some riding so

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.370 
obviously accelerated some riding so
which<00:01:11.130> i<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> very<00:01:12.060> good<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:13.049> sure

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
which i think is a very good for sure

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.030 
which i think is a very good for sure
ours<00:01:13.760> 2006<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.090> particularly<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> barossa

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.230 
ours 2006 in particularly in the barossa
absolutely<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> great<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> do

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
absolutely but what a great way to do

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.999 
absolutely but what a great way to do
things<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.750> blend<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> firmness<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
things to blend you know the firmness of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.490

cabin a the lusciousness of Shiraz and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380 
cabin a the lusciousness of Shiraz and
put<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> two<00:01:22.979> together<00:01:23.159> i<00:01:23.729> think<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.210> works

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
put the two together i think it works
