00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:09.540
 first mini moke actually like already 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.759
 in the update, I have the only one 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.960
 built just because mine 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.839
 Order is not there yet 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.000
 but the next week will come but 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:22.199
 rather, and that's just it 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.340
 smaller hole comes and you will 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.359
 actually I was bored too 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.939
 it is mini moke built and with the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.170
 For protection, I'm one evening 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.270
 started a few hours ago 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.610
 Interest in a day built so white 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.540
 not that difficult the build the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.790
 actually quite fast 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.629
 and yes to the story, I have considered 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.879
 it is almost the solar forwarding 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.660
 the first bock is the first mobile 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.670
 this pipeline base on sent and he 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.370
 was not exactly dare and groups in it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.530
 the wsv you in this base and yes the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.809
 have fled because they understand 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.890
 Do not have that paddle base 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.600
 can hold and is just region to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.100
 next base and that is just the one 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.900
 mainly ensures that just 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.939
 I associate larger ones with this sector 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.890
 That's why this big one can also land 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.630
 gun in the background but yes he long 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 again to 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.930
 you can see the big one in the back 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.350
 then protected this little one here 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:35.820
 sandy and then the trees here 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.070
 mesh druids and make this rock easy 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.540
 come here as I said come here 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.939
 just lying down, he took himself is so 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.880
 possibly inside then coming back 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.040
 peace and here just this row of 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.759
 druids to the front 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:57.960
 and here are just this protection forest 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.420
 and shoot with beside him and he 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.590
 this very thin part between the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.850
 trees and mountain and now the world so 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.530
 Two airports are jumping up here 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.819
 which have just waited for it 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.489
 is the quiet directly below him are 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.620
 with jetpacks I have just no white 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.770
 jetpacks I just have this from 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.810
 mariano given gray but almost already 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:26.040
 I'll just take it off then then 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.959
 they will see more from the mountain 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.790
 quite high and how I like it because 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.580
 I also see with this long drawn 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.830
 here and not nice up here 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.810
 next to it once small stage and 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.700
 then you go up here continue like this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.580
 part 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.780
 and here also really nice romp 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.780
 So I like it a lot 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.150
 yes and to the ground before that everywhere 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.030
 completely brown so far so far forward 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.379
 everything brown brown earth and this may be 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.819
 I placed this thanks to the flat chest 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.019
 is therefore again muddy be gone 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.069
 The trees are actually very beautiful 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:08.640
 and they complement each other 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.620
 in terms of size but I take it 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.510
 now off briefly and with it me again 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.220
 the state does not want to show a solid 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.080
 pretty much obscure 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.610
 yes and here also the republic is 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.530
 just clearly outnumbered and the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.300
 is just this fall, so to speak from 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.280
 thought that I am up with the airboss 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.040
 and down here then behind the two 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.830
 kashuba hides it trees 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.900
 but here is the craft just in and out 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:41.129
 We already have our head straight 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.799
 finished and yes as you can see 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:49.230
 as dark only at the political very 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:53.970
 dense jungle and here you only see 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.750
 this way a little better and still 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.640
 just in this dense jungle then 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.000
 up here, this little fence, so to speak 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:08.010
 that makes it a pretty cool one 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.680
 looks and is just done and sorry 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.989
 just looks pretty nikolaus, however 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.780
 to hurt 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:24.690
 the glass parts smaller here 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.320
 line and then to 4 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.440
 at the moment I am continuing in the back 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.680
 the side of the side here are a 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.170
 small hill with grass and here is on 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.180
 this older wood because these also with 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.310
 I have five of these 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.390
 aka funny are these palisades 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.340
 put only in gray and now here if 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.970
 with built-in and maybe completely 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.970
 funny 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.530
 every time the box where it is 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.690
 just then so basement river then on 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.120
 I've got to lie down like that now 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.230
 made because I'm not so much 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.730
 I could not have sun bigger it 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.180
 But yes and they will come 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.350
 just now droid again more 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.350
 Wise ways to have enough 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.890
 and yes, here next to this beginning of this 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.330
 Outpost we and everything with 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.710
 this share made this 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.680
 grooved and even more red 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.840
 lines and here is as well as small 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.160
 solos I have a little 16 and 60 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.720
 first made which somehow 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.880
 but something wanted to do it or 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:41.760
 so and so I had a few more 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.200
 who is 32 to 16 which would be like that 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.390
 they want to be long 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.720
 I have found too much again 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:52.880
 and I made her that way 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:56.040
 up here then just to 2 212 tm typar 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.220
 are clearly tiled up here next to it 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.850
 and here this pipeline he this 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.919
 not where lines into the terrain just 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.630
 in the back because a lot of boxes and stuff 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.070
 I think that's very well protected 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.020
 all the guns actually managed 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.740
 do not build but it works so right 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.740
 nice solid and so is the building 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:22.020
 just above this floor is just going 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:24.870
 next to the crown inside the computer here 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.720
 over lines and so far forward 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.000
 is just laser business you can see the 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.419
 quite a long run and it can be in 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.340
 be moved that angle because of it 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.340
 these are still difficult 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.110
 and the work is just a team 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.220
 get and there it comes this week 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.760
 started and jedi knights from the 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.050
 last hole 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.370
 that the vicky mines in this mountain are in it 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.260
 in front this case is pretty 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.730
 overgrown task as old 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.880
 kimi where the felt are his last 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.980
 base here we know yes show 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.120
 as the hardest lightsaber and it is there 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.440
 I would have taken and so 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.720
 glued together so stop first 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.880
 do not cut apart two 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.140
 swiss it is glued together 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:21.760
 just more like a double lightsaber 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:22.930
 does not look good and they come 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.240
 now just around here the 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.680
 to join the battle 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.920
 because just ventures and could not without 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.140
 yes , no chance that actually 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.520
 to the mini moke as a lot of fun 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.410
 area and how far you can go 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.450
 him even more fun the larger max 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:41.710
 Just tree the small area very much 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:45.250
 But meditating can be that's it 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:49.920
 actually and subscribed comments and 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.920
 easy and see you next time
