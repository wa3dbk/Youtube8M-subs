00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 thank you for the opportunity to be able 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.779
 share with you a story that has 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.940
 changed my life this story is 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.550
 too important not to share 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.250
 from the beginning people have fought 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.320
 to fill a void in your life a void 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.830
 that was formed when the man chose 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.689
 go your own way without god the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.900
 bible says that we are all separated 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.910
 of God we are separated from God because 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.650
 to the bad decisions we have made 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.270
 God calls them sin we have all sinned 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.820
 lying cheating or doing what 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.309
 that we know is bad we can not 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.790
 know God or going to heaven because of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.290
 the bad decisions we have made 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.050
 some believe that if one has done more 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.320
 well what evil in your life God will accept you 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.809
 but the bible teaches us that nobody 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.300
 can win the entrance to heaven god is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.879
 perfect and man can never get 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.699
 to its level of perfection even if we do 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.810
 the best we can do will never be 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.989
 enough 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.690
 but I have good news God loves us 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.240
 He loves us in such a way that he sent his 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.870
 only son Jesus Christ to this earth for 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 make the bridge between god and man 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.280
 while Jesus lived on earth I help 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.460
 thousands of people and he did many 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.310
 miracles but jesus was captured by 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.520
 soldiers mistreated and nailed to a cross 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.780
 to die and pay for our sins 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.240
 after making sure that Jesus 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.640
 he was dead the soldiers put him 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.130
 in a cave and sealed it with a large 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.990
 rock before dying 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.090
 those predicted that it would rise from between 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.119
 the dead in three days after 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.240
 die for this the soldiers watched their 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.430
 tomb the cave day and night to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.740
 make sure that nobody could take out the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.890
 Body of Jesus after three days 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.990

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.940

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.820

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.550
