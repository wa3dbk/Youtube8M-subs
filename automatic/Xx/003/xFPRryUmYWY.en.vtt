00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
quickest way to do that is with a date

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.050 
quickest way to do that is with a date
and<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.799> best<00:01:35.070> form<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.640> bait<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> going

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and the best form of that bait is going

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.569 
and the best form of that bait is going
to<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> liquid<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.250> bait

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
to be a liquid so it's going to be bait

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.370 
to be a liquid so it's going to be bait
weight<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:39.840> you're<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.170> more

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
weight because you're going to get more

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.690
