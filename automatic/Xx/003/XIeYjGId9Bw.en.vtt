00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Welcome to the new bliss news 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.609
 follow already the whole is now in 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.720
 it comes in a totally different guise 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.970
 That's why it will be the next 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.290
 to stay that way and to be for the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.530
 I will forward a bit to 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.059
 some change here and there a bit 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.580
 operate bugfixing but generally it is 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.800
 now the new garment demolition news and yes 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.380
 I have a lot this time too 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.939
 interesting news in luggage the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.760
 one or the other meat is not 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.470
 white or definitely interesting 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.230
 Software changes of the people 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.300
 abilities it is officially that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 people 's ability to be changed and im 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.120
 attributed to the absence of hit rating and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.239
 weapons buyer, it is anyway must 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.059
 which is what is called what there is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 enough skills on special 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.120
 weapons genres provide weaponry like 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.760
 For example, a place has more 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.570
 weapons science on axes and there must the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.910
 Of course, find a suitable replacement 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.829
 or a suitable replacement provided 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.300
 and revised in this 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.160
 it's the people's skills that count 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.110
 There is no more must-have people ability 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.309
 maybe there's one or two 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.590
 others already noticed 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.659
 There is, for example, in progress against 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.310
 witches masters not one 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.790
 sorcerer of the other wind roll 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 playing was the tempo of popularity 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.259
 from troll is just super good and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 Almost for progress raider 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.560
 at least as a must have to call 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.130
 is 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.270
 what else do we have patch 5.4.2011 already 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.860
 found out that Ankara was 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 currently a bit tramped around 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.850
 Blizzard changes somehow 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.799
 it has not been that much 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 various items virtually removed 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:47.100
 of karajan and which is the theory that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.110
 somehow in event for what software in 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.000
 Kasan may be introduced 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.470
 There was already the band boss in hellas 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.399
 on 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.350
 I can now remember more exactly 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.620
 when it was but it can definitely be 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.400
 ever an event bussen karas 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.920
 and as said data miner who like this 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.490
 read that in the coming part 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.479
 they come to kasan 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.790
 partly revised therefore comes the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.040
 new birthday from wow you can 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.500
 now a few of the free more 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.940
 is experience which is extremely awesome 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.380
 so if you are now the last days for 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.930
 come to write the log 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.460
 then maybe it should be now 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.010
 just when you're in there or somewhere 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.510
 you play with it and you can do that with it 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.060
 Get the ball that lasts for an hour 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.860
 but with the package you are getting via 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.710
 mailbox kasse the just arbitrary 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.270
 renew and young state if you 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.650
 right now it's drinking 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.210
 of course cool for me too now 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.460
 maybe there will be one or the other 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.440
 follow from my family 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.880
 series or values are flat 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.380
 on the stream then read on 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.110
 best but then experienced 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.900
 yes the whole action is still running until the 2nd 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:59.190
 december cool thing and the warcraft 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.970
 movie wow wow movie is a very very 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.290
 you can really get on with a controversial topic 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.320
 I have been talking for so long 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.300
 for years and now there blizzard 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:13.780
 finally facts facts out and one one 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.900
 camera say chaos theory chaos team 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.570
 chaos theory is really but that 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.600
 actor coal colin farrell cabbage 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.550
 in the colin farrell talks about that 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.320
 without having synonymous with the script 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.090
 Director already entertained about it and 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.640
 summed up in colin farrell do not know 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.760
 then just this one superimposed on the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.250
 picture and how did it know some 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.400
 maybe from a total recall the remake 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.370
 He has the old Schwarzenegger films since 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.450
 the main actor is played and is 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.820
 maybe a candidate for the wow 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.150
 many would be suitable above all things 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.670
 because now we just refer to the 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.430
 script and about the director because you 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.690
 since it can relate to him 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.100
 who knows maybe he will 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.970
 really up in the main cast 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.920
 every case 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.560
 I can only say in my opinion 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.080
 This is a brilliant actor and 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.280
 yes what about the news to the I blew 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.170
 I hope I could give some tips 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.480
 as always you will find the links to the 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.550
 news in the video describe so if 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.579
 you have the number for a topic explicitly 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.200
 then you can interested course 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.260
 like to click on it and only through 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.300
 read and also runs under me here 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.240
 just a little video about batman aa 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.860
 cambridge interest you have at the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.660
 game then you can get because it 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.370
 comes on the complete series and in 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.750
 I'm out of this sense and we see 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.750
 us in the next part
