 of internet access that is called wifi and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.070
 that pierre bulo is launching that plane 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 that is out there is one of the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.900
 first you have this service so 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.230
 let's know the details of this 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.230
 launching 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.530
 we are on board one of the first 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.810
 jetblue aircraft that has the system 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.240
 live to which allows you to navigate the 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.340
 internet in a fast way using 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.620
 a new technology that is called in a 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.960
 satellite technology using the band 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.239
 good box that's the technical part what 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.280
 important here of this service is the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.080
 first internet access service in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.790
 an airplane that uses technology 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.559
 satellite and that allows it to be 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.340
 working even when we are not over 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.380
 earth the second promises to be the most 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.010
 fast of all access services 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.590
 to internet 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.660
 the air that is very important since 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.550
 Well, it will allow you to do many 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.670
 things that current services do not 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.940
 allow to do the third the service is 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.940
 free if you what you are going to do is 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.950
 surf the internet check email networks 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.690
 you are not going to have to pay like 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.550
 happens in other services that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.980
 they are currently offered but here 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.830
 just you open your laptops or 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.690
 you use your cell phone or your tablet and you can 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.760
 surf the internet for free if you already 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.710
 you want to do more elaborate things 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.890
 complicated as for example streaming 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.770
 the power to watch movies and so on 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.630
 service cost is $ 9 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.150
 this time it will be until summer 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.420
 2014 and at that time then re-evaluate them 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.390
 to the service dynamics something else 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.710
 important that it is necessary to notice is the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.360
 fact that jetblue will be 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.130
 converting 15 aircraft per month 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.380
 providing them with live services and until 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.930
 at the end of 2000 of 2014, because 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.790
 have over 100 aircraft equipped with 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.040
 this as one knows 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.090
 what airplane has fly fire good good 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.549
 simple 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.200
 on the jetblue page a 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.569
 link that will be updating all 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.170
 the days to report which routes are going to 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.780
 be equipped with live service 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.489
 and good the reality is that we have this 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.959
 opportunity to get on the plane and 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.180
 to know more about this to be able to 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.950
 this inform you about the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.439
 service details but we wait in 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.109
 a very near future as such a power 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.239
 try it out and verify how good the 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.060
 connectivity for the puntocom technician 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.310
 from inside one of the planes 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.689
 from jetblue here at the airport 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.819

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:01.169
 New York City in the Camera Jose
