different I'm still kind of playing with

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.229 
different I'm still kind of playing with
it<00:00:35.040> still<00:00:35.280> trying<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> angle<00:00:35.940> right

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
it still trying to get the angle right

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.380 
it still trying to get the angle right
and<00:00:36.750> everything<00:00:37.200> um<00:00:37.489> it's<00:00:38.489> weird<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.180> not

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and everything um it's weird it's not

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.510 
and everything um it's weird it's not
like<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.140> regular<00:00:40.320> web<00:00:40.649> camera<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.040> has<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.190> big

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
like the regular web camera it has a big

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.330 
like the regular web camera it has a big
base<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.410> result<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.890> can't<00:00:44.129> put

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
base to it and as a result I can't put

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.979 
base to it and as a result I can't put
it<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.550> top<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> monitor<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.480> angle<00:00:45.899> it

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it on top of the monitor and angle it

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.510 
it on top of the monitor and angle it
down<00:00:46.170> its<00:00:46.410> kind<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> sitting<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.280> on

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
down its kind of sitting right now on

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.450 
down its kind of sitting right now on
the<00:00:47.640> desk<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.210> front<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.590> monitor<00:00:50.250> which

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the desk in front of the monitor which

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.860 
the desk in front of the monitor which
is<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> little<00:00:50.879> strange<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.329> could<00:00:51.510> put<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.750> over

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
is a little strange I could put it over

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.889 
is a little strange I could put it over
the<00:00:52.110> side<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.649> angle<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.850> way<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.120> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the side and angle it this way but it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
the side and angle it this way but it
wouldn't<00:00:55.199> give<00:00:55.350> us<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> symmetric

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
wouldn't give us more like a symmetric

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.010 
wouldn't give us more like a symmetric
type<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:58.609> view<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.600> still<00:01:00.840> kind<00:01:00.989> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
type of view so I'm still kind of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
type of view so I'm still kind of
playing<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:01.920> perfect<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
playing with it it's not perfect at the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.060 
playing with it it's not perfect at the
moment<00:01:03.979> kind<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.100> far<00:01:05.430> from<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.570> hopefully

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
moment kind of far from it but hopefully

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.420 
moment kind of far from it but hopefully
the<00:01:08.070> video<00:01:08.430> quality<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.970> much<00:01:09.689> better<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.430> I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the video quality is much better and I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.859 
the video quality is much better and I
can<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.909> some<00:01:12.119> different<00:01:12.240> functions<00:01:12.750> with

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
can do some different functions with

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.480 
can do some different functions with
like<00:01:13.080> zooming<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.590> zooming<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.979> stuff<00:01:14.310> like

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
like zooming in zooming out stuff like

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
like zooming in zooming out stuff like
that<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.049> some<00:01:16.200> different<00:01:16.500> looks<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that so can get some different looks and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.380 
that so can get some different looks and
definitely<00:01:17.610> i<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.850> caesars<00:01:18.150> from<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
definitely i can caesars from the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.570 
definitely i can caesars from the
background<00:01:18.750> stuff<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.310> quality

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
background stuff you can see the quality

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.149 
background stuff you can see the quality
is<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.150> better<00:01:21.479> i<00:01:21.659> decided<00:01:22.470> i'm<00:01:22.740> probably

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
is much better i decided i'm probably

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.920 
is much better i decided i'm probably
going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.549> film<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.970> 720p<00:01:25.220> 1080p<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.930> basically

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
going to film in 720p 1080p is basically

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.039 
going to film in 720p 1080p is basically
it<00:01:28.439> looks<00:01:29.159> pretty<00:01:29.970> much<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> same<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.930> be

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it looks pretty much the same to be

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.990 
it looks pretty much the same to be
honest<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.500> not<00:01:32.040> much<00:01:32.310> difference<00:01:32.850> in

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
honest with you not much difference in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.020 
honest with you not much difference in
terms<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.390> quality<00:01:33.600> from<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.369> setup<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
terms of quality from like my setup and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.960 
terms of quality from like my setup and
stuff<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.189> file<00:01:38.369> size<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.640> way

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
stuff and it's the file size is way

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.600 
stuff and it's the file size is way
bigger<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.479> i'll<00:01:39.570> probably<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.900> 720p<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.890> just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
bigger so i'll probably do 720p and just

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.800 
bigger so i'll probably do 720p and just
basically<00:01:41.759> leave<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.540> because

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
basically leave it at that because

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.389 
basically leave it at that because
that's<00:01:43.049> that's<00:01:43.409> pretty<00:01:43.860> much<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.220> good<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that's that's pretty much as good a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.810 
that's that's pretty much as good a
quality<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:44.880> i<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.810> needs<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.770> i<00:01:46.979> hope

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
quality as i think it needs to be i hope

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.460 
quality as i think it needs to be i hope
