00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
little something that you can build with

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.039 
little something that you can build with
it<00:01:48.959> so<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.770> guys<00:01:50.069> can<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.609> get<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.299> there

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
just build but these first three blocks

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.640 
just build but these first three blocks
on<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:11.099> are<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:12.420> most<00:02:12.629> versatile<00:02:13.290> blocks

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
on here are the most versatile blocks

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.430 
on here are the most versatile blocks
are<00:02:13.890> built<00:02:14.189> and<00:02:15.019> in<00:02:16.019> or<00:02:16.230> me<00:02:16.500> worlds

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
are built and in or me worlds

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.760 
are built and in or me worlds
that<00:02:17.620> extremely<00:02:18.610> good<00:02:18.880> for<00:02:19.770> structures

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
that extremely good for structures

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.540 
that extremely good for structures
patterns<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:23.980> do<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.430> about

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
patterns and you can do just about

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.160 
patterns and you can do just about
anything<00:02:24.970> with<00:02:25.210> them<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.540> i'll<00:02:25.930> demonstrate

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
anything with them and i'll demonstrate

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.160 
anything with them and i'll demonstrate
i'll<00:02:26.830> show<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.580> very<00:02:27.910> versatile<00:02:28.630> now

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
i'll show you the very versatile now

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.650 
i'll show you the very versatile now
don't<00:02:29.410> forget<00:02:29.590> guys<00:02:29.980> d<00:02:30.370> deal<00:02:30.610> well<00:02:31.510> you're

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
don't forget guys d deal well you're

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.960 
don't forget guys d deal well you're
building<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.050> block<00:02:32.260> see<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.710> a<00:02:32.890> martin<00:02:33.610> de<00:02:33.790> oh

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
building the block see it a martin de oh

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.940 
building the block see it a martin de oh
because<00:02:34.240> it's<00:02:34.510> hard<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:35.080> our<00:02:35.230> deal<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.860> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
because it's hard to our deal in the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.430 
because it's hard to our deal in the
workshop<00:02:36.490> once<00:02:37.270> it's<00:02:37.510> built<00:02:37.750> because<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.230> can

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
workshop once it's built because you can

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.840 
workshop once it's built because you can
get<00:02:38.650> move<00:02:38.830> you've<00:02:39.040> got<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.310> walls<00:02:39.520> around

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
get move you've got the walls around

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.850 
get move you've got the walls around
stuff<00:02:40.270> like<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:41.020> add<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.350> detail<00:02:41.710> as

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
stuff like that so add the detail as

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.680 
stuff like that so add the detail as
you're<00:02:42.070> building<00:02:42.250> then<00:02:43.150> you're<00:02:43.330> not<00:02:43.420> come<00:02:43.660> a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
you're building then you're not come a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.640 
you're building then you're not come a
cropper<00:02:43.960> at<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.770> end<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:47.380> basically

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
cropper at the end and it basically

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.920 
cropper at the end and it basically
caused<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.670> custom<00:02:49.090> blocks<00:02:49.330> look<00:02:49.570> very

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
caused the the custom blocks look very

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.610 
caused the the custom blocks look very
plain<00:02:50.320> unless<00:02:50.740> you've<00:02:50.920> added<00:02:51.100> something<00:02:52.620> and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
plain unless you've added something and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.830 
plain unless you've added something and
you<00:02:53.980> do<00:02:54.160> see<00:02:54.430> all<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.910> sides<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.510> block

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
you do see all the sides of this block

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.000 
you do see all the sides of this block
so<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.530> good<00:02:56.800> add<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:56.980> little<00:02:57.250> bit<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.490> detail

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
so it's good add a little bit of detail

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.890 
so it's good add a little bit of detail
so<00:03:00.010> as<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.250> can<00:03:00.310> see<00:03:00.550> it's<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.910> it's<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.270> basic

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
so as you can see it's a it's a basic

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.720 
so as you can see it's a it's a basic
block<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:02.680> easy<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:04.110> basic<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.730> there's

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
block it's so easy in basic and there's

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.230 
block it's so easy in basic and there's
nothing<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.540> it's<00:03:08.350> it's<00:03:08.890> quite<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.910> small

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
nothing to it it's it's quite a small

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.430 
nothing to it it's it's quite a small
custom<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.230> mean<00:03:12.160> it's<00:03:12.340> like<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:14.080> only<00:03:14.350> a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
custom I mean it's like it's only a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.140 
custom I mean it's like it's only a
quarter<00:03:14.920> circle<00:03:15.430> really<00:03:15.790> am<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.910> pretty

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
quarter circle really am it's pretty

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.560 
quarter circle really am it's pretty
expensive<00:03:19.420> in<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.960> polycount<00:03:20.470> lake<00:03:20.740> but<00:03:21.700> it's

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
expensive in the polycount lake but it's

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.729 
expensive in the polycount lake but it's
a<00:03:23.290> bloody<00:03:24.280> good<00:03:24.520> block<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:25.060> have<00:03:25.270> its<00:03:26.170> whether

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
a bloody good block to have its whether

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.500 
a bloody good block to have its whether
you<00:03:26.890> like<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.190> open<00:03:27.370> with<00:03:27.700> three<00:03:27.940> roof<00:03:28.180> blocks

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
you like to open with three roof blocks

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.050 
you like to open with three roof blocks
I<00:03:28.720> use<00:03:28.900> all<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.170> time<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:30.430> good<00:03:30.760> blocks

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
I use all the time in that good blocks

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.750 
I use all the time in that good blocks
to<00:03:31.270> have<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.690> mean<00:03:32.080> you've<00:03:32.410> got<00:03:32.440> 64<00:03:33.250> custom

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
to have I mean you've got 64 custom

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.690 
to have I mean you've got 64 custom
blocks<00:03:34.000> if<00:03:34.300> you<00:03:34.450> build<00:03:34.750> these<00:03:34.989> for<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:36.489> could

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
blocks if you build these for you could

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.620 
blocks if you build these for you could
probably<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.450> mean<00:03:38.410> are<00:03:38.590> built<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.610> built<00:03:40.570> that

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
probably I mean are built I built that

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.510 
probably I mean are built I built that
spacecraft<00:03:41.170> don't<00:03:41.620> you<00:03:41.800> I've<00:03:42.010> only<00:03:42.220> use<00:03:42.489> five

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
spacecraft don't you I've only use five

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.900 
spacecraft don't you I've only use five
sheets<00:03:43.300> so<00:03:43.959> far<00:03:44.350> because<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.160> use<00:03:45.370> blocks<00:03:45.640> like

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
sheets so far because I use blocks like

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.270 
sheets so far because I use blocks like
this<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.840> store<00:03:46.900> versatile<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:50.280> that's

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
this in the store versatile so that's

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.820 
this in the store versatile so that's
pretty<00:03:51.580> much<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:52.060> just<00:03:52.660> add<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.840> little<00:03:53.470> bit<00:03:53.680> of

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
pretty much it just add a little bit of

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.430 
pretty much it just add a little bit of
detail<00:03:54.430> at<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.730> end<00:03:54.910> there<00:03:55.239> but<00:03:56.050> that's<00:03:56.200> at

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
detail at the end there but that's at

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.009 
detail at the end there but that's at
block<00:03:56.709> done<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.250> i'll<00:03:58.060> bring<00:03:58.269> block<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.780> ear

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
block done and i'll bring block to ear

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.930 
block done and i'll bring block to ear
as<00:03:59.290> soon<00:03:59.590> as<00:03:59.830> you<00:04:00.250> know<00:04:00.400> i<00:04:00.430> can<00:04:00.700> get<00:04:00.850> it
