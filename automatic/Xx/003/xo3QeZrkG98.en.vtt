batter<00:01:30.890> crepe<00:01:31.280> batter<00:01:31.399> is<00:01:31.610> usually<00:01:31.910> a<00:01:32.090> little

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
batter crepe batter is usually a little

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.940 
batter crepe batter is usually a little
bit<00:01:32.840> thinner<00:01:33.050> but<00:01:33.289> I<00:01:34.099> want<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:34.910> pasty<00:01:35.950> just

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
bit thinner but I want it so pasty just

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.279 
bit thinner but I want it so pasty just
like<00:01:37.069> my<00:01:37.190> skin<00:01:37.569> alright<00:01:38.569> so<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.929> mix<00:01:39.140> is

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
like my skin alright so the mix is

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.990 
like my skin alright so the mix is
finally<00:01:39.709> done<00:01:39.920> now<00:01:40.130> all<00:01:40.399> you<00:01:40.580> had<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.700> do<00:01:40.880> is

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
finally done now all you had to do is

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.880 
finally done now all you had to do is
grab<00:01:41.239> your<00:01:41.420> little<00:01:41.509> offset<00:01:41.750> spatula<00:01:42.500> or

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
grab your little offset spatula or

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.919 
grab your little offset spatula or
whatever<00:01:43.250> spatula<00:01:43.880> half<00:01:44.090> spoon<00:01:44.479> knife<00:01:44.720> I

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
whatever spatula half spoon knife I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.380 
whatever spatula half spoon knife I
don't<00:01:45.080> care<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.440> apply<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.670> mix<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.300> the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
don't care and apply the mix to the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.260 
don't care and apply the mix to the
Silpat<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:49.190> most<00:01:49.369> important<00:01:49.940> part<00:01:50.179> about

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
Silpat the most important part about

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.600 
Silpat the most important part about
this<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.810> making<00:01:51.289> sure<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.619> apply<00:01:51.890> evenly<00:01:52.340> and

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
this is making sure you apply evenly and

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:08.029 
this is making sure you apply evenly and
as<00:01:52.700> thinly<00:01:52.940> as<00:01:53.119> possible

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.559 

so<00:02:09.039> once<00:02:09.250> you're<00:02:09.369> done<00:02:09.399> generally<00:02:10.119> spreading

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
so once you're done generally spreading

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.059 
so once you're done generally spreading
the<00:02:10.660> batter<00:02:10.869> all<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.290> have<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.470> do<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.769> really

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
the batter all you have to do is really

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.800 
the batter all you have to do is really
give<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.489> a<00:02:12.549> once-over<00:02:13.000> otherwise<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.780> just

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
give it a once-over otherwise it just

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.720 
give it a once-over otherwise it just
won't<00:02:14.019> be<00:02:14.230> thin<00:02:14.560> enough<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.980> call<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.190> Crip<00:02:17.730> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
won't be thin enough to call a Crip so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.500 
won't be thin enough to call a Crip so
I'm<00:02:19.150> going<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.390> take<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.700> oven<00:02:21.940> now

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
I'm going to take this to the oven now

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.339 
I'm going to take this to the oven now
in<00:02:22.750> my<00:02:22.900> oven<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.349> have<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.830> pre<00:02:24.370> placed<00:02:25.349> sheet

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
in my oven I have a pre placed sheet

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.800 
in my oven I have a pre placed sheet
tray<00:02:26.620> flipped<00:02:27.310> upside<00:02:27.819> down<00:02:27.849> so<00:02:28.599> I'm<00:02:28.690> just

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
tray flipped upside down so I'm just

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.240 
tray flipped upside down so I'm just
going<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.019> place<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.379> little<00:02:29.590> silk<00:02:29.920> pad<00:02:30.099> and
