 That sounds hard but it's beautiful hollywood stripes when they were young 

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:07.500
 I have dreamed of becoming a famous musician, as I often did 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.029
 Everything was different today 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.159
 Over 30 years, they have decided to catch up 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.179
 the boys of Snow White Â»and the nice thing about the story 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.830
 17 years numbers 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.080
 the naming and played together for the last time over 30 years ago 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.140
 For the first time, the authorities have given them a simple majority 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.190
 Deggendorf for outlandish 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.800
 that's it 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920
 we lose no time 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.380
 the deeds would have to do with sentimentality 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.190
 vibrations 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.700
 only and without audience never 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.760
 one misses oneself intensively with big applause 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.770
 the five-person market was the most end of the 70's 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.340
 Defendant demands in hand 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.240
 they were about to break through 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.790
 the musical highlight 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.790
 they played as a supporting act 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.280
 whoever works Iran continues to come under pressure 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.820
 usually 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.450
 we just have to be cleverer who soul a less a direction 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.540
 revival 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.470
 they were not so sure yet 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 they do not have enough candidates clear 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.179
 It was then expected a billion-dollar loss 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.240
 when he finally came 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.300
 "Stanley" is about to decide 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 today you have to be for me then 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.250
 I quickly made that decision it was the existence concerns 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760
 Update 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.090
 around 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.590
 Mr. Kollegs educator seeks to learn it again bourgeois profession 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.900
 intensive 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.090
 everyone against his own way but the music did not let them lux in the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.149
 Subconsciously, the coach slumbered to the duds 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.309
 that I had made his dream 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.749
 Dreamy is always heard making music 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.469
 and the next morning as a frustrated crew 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.329
 "We sing all Ramos directions scattered, always knowing where we are all 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.419
 the others 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.309
 I got in contact with the guitarist and especially one 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.569

 Pauli did not take a few months 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:51.089
 the goal of the magical moment the meeting is big is the call 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.019
 musical heart of the band 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.509
 No one has been fit for the time after the crisis 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.709
 but the rehearsal room had survived well for a long time 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.589
 just as the break music did not seem to have hurt any 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.399
 not so easy 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:10.809
 Lyon succeeded 31 years old but must be fine then everything was different with only 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.809

 then just under 20 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:29.289
 Today they give over 270 years but their music is still there 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.929
 as exciting as it was then 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.929
 what proportion he 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.749
 Dr 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.999

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.469
 Year and then 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.730
