 Well, today we are going to make a tonic 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.670
 hair fall prevention I'm out here 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.990
 because I'm going to go look for nettle I have 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.560
 a stinging nettle and now I want 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.390
 teach I'm going to use this one because the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.060
 usually use dry 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.430
 the tail as the other way around let it dry and 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.710
 then the writing well crushed with the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.770
 coffee grinder either a blender 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.059
 as I said we are going to use to do the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:44.019
 tonic nettle we are going to use and we are going to 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.570
 make a lime salad and a little 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.519
 oil do not worry that does not leave 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.260
 be born in the seat for nothing is of 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.500
 Quick absorption and it will leave your hair 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.620
 fantastic all these ingredients so 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.260
 natural and ecological and economic will 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.879
 to strengthen the hair they will give you a 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.149
 greater also in the fall of the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.149
 hair 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.550
 delays it and if you have already started 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.840
 drop your hair you will see that it has a 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.390
 tendency to decrease using this tonic 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 so I encourage you to prepare it and now 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.729
 that is how we are going to use this technician 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.250
 with clean hair we're going to 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.409
 apply with a spray dispenser we 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.340
 we are going to apply it and we are going to make some 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.250
 Gentle frictions for you to go 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.860
 penetrating the tonic perfectly 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.539
 the leather an excess to massage plus what 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.179
 that we favor is also to activate the 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.579
 circulation and that better penetrate all 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.319
 the components in them does 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.810
 it needs to be rinsed or anything that can be 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.690
 stay do not mess the bald and we 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.450
 will enter it as I said before 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.520
 I'm going to show the plant a bit far 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.640
 it's all a 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.250
 piece of plant is huge for you 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.170
 make an idea this is my hand and that is 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.659
 the plant has made it so great to me 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.369
 has left 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.470
 I was very beautiful, very beautiful 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.990
 dogs here do not attack her saying the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.530
 limp 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.970
 and the truth is that it has made me enormous 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.480
 honestly I'm afraid I do not know how 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.480
 put her hand 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.830
 of this nine books without the arm full 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.830
 of stings 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.709
 but good we will use some good 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.360
 leather gloves and calendula ointment 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.340
 and everything will be solved 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.170
 and what you're seeing here is everything 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.710
 that we are going to need I have put a glass 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.150
 of distilled water in this case to boil 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.580
 when the water starts to boil 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.790
 we will stop the fire and we will add 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.870
 two envelopes of lime and a spoonful 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.400
 nettle tureen that is dry and ground 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.800
 this we will put it in here what 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.540
 we will leave covered and in fusing 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.570
 five minutes to release all your 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.080
 properties we will also add some 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.850
 ten drops of preservative I will use the 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.450
 geo garde 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.850
 if you want to do without the preservative 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.280
 make less amount worth it so do not be 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.350
 will spoil because I calculate that in 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.450
 about 5 days could spoil 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.970
 Now that it has started to boil 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.950
 Stop the fire I add our 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.950
 sachets of lime 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.730
 the nettle and we're going to leave it 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.730
 in merging 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.090
 we have already left this infusion 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.780
 and we're going to strain it 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.980
 i 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.950
 we will drop 5 droplets 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.950
 of preservative 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.169
 - who determined some gift 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.740
 and I've put about 8 grams of 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.680
 jojoba oil this would come to be a 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.240
 spoonful sopera only good for the 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.910
 size of the mouth and where it was more 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.160
 easy to think what you will not try to do 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.560
 juggle with a spoon you forget the 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.810
 Shake it because it 's water and oil 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.810
 so they're not going to mix just 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.810
 Mixed will come out if we shake it well 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.030
 we have prepared and ready to use 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.340
 I hope you like it very much 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.110
 apply with constancy you will get to see 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.700
 those effects 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.490
 I hope you are satisfied and 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.490
