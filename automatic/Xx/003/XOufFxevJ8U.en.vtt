make them be able to spam it because it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.160 
make them be able to spam it because it
made<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.270> bit<00:00:57.449> stronger<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
made them a little bit stronger and a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.529 
made them a little bit stronger and a
little<00:00:58.199> bit<00:00:58.440> more<00:00:58.620> tanky<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.329> don't

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
little bit more tanky so they just don't

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.090 
little bit more tanky so they just don't
die<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:01.170> away<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.680> that's<00:01:01.890> really

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
die right away because that's really

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
die right away because that's really
annoying<00:01:02.520> when<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.879> die<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:04.019> away

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
annoying when they die like right away

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
annoying when they die like right away
so<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:05.070> don't<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.369> anymore<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:06.060> which

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so they don't do that anymore now which

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240 
so they don't do that anymore now which
