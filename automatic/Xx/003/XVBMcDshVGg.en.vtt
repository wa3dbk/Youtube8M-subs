you catch something you always catch it

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.640 
you catch something you always catch it
right<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.900> middle<00:02:28.080> because<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.440> want<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
right in the middle because you want to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.620 
right in the middle because you want to
catch<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> opposite<00:02:30.150> for<00:02:30.330> pizza

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.360 
throwing as I'm tossing the pizza up I'm
actually<00:02:33.060> catching<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.810> wide<00:02:34.250> throwing<00:02:35.250> it

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
actually catching it wide throwing it

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.920

wide catching it wide throwing it wide

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.330 
wide catching it wide throwing it wide
the<00:02:39.930> reason<00:02:40.260> why<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.410> would<00:02:40.620> never<00:02:40.769> catch<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.100> in

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
the reason why I would never catch it in

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.880 
the reason why I would never catch it in
the<00:02:41.400> middle<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:41.819> this<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:43.709> you're<00:02:43.830> gonna

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the middle like this is you're gonna

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.520 
the middle like this is you're gonna
have<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.130> weak<00:02:44.370> middle<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.959> basically<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.410> want

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
have a weak middle so basically you want

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.020 
have a weak middle so basically you want
to<00:02:46.620> be<00:02:46.739> able<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.950> spin<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.459> once<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.819> while<00:02:47.940> if

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
to be able to spin it once in a while if

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.360 
to be able to spin it once in a while if
you<00:02:48.120> get<00:02:48.269> really<00:02:48.450> good<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:49.100> actually<00:02:50.100> spin<00:02:50.280> it

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
you get really good you actually spin it

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.590 
you get really good you actually spin it
with<00:02:50.430> your<00:02:50.580> hands<00:02:50.940> you'll<00:02:51.120> want<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.360> spin<00:02:51.569> it

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
with your hands you'll want to spin it

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.780 
with your hands you'll want to spin it
too<00:02:51.840> much<00:02:52.050> because<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.160> might<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.610> weak

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

weak spot I'm going to kind of get away

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.630 
weak spot I'm going to kind of get away
from<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.799> spot<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.340> then<00:03:53.430> just

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
from that spot and then just

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.199
