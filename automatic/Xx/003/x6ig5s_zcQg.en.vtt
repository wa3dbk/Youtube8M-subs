damage at all since Gen 1 a number of
other<00:01:00.180> Pokemon<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.840> learned<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.199> move<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
other Pokemon have learned this move and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.200 
other Pokemon have learned this move and
they're<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:02.010> all<00:01:02.160> water<00:01:02.489> Pokemon<00:01:02.969> either

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
they're not all water Pokemon either

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
they're not all water Pokemon either
because<00:01:03.840> apparently<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.320> Japan<00:01:04.379> splash<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
because apparently in Japan splash is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.100 
because apparently in Japan splash is
not<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> direct<00:01:06.210> translation<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.900> doesn't

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
not the direct translation it doesn't

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
not the direct translation it doesn't
have<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.590> water<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.189> Japan<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.610> more

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
have to do with water in Japan it's more

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.969 
have to do with water in Japan it's more
just<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> splashy<00:01:09.720> kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> motion<00:01:10.799> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
just the splashy kind of motion that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.640 
just the splashy kind of motion that
Magikarp<00:01:11.549> makes<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.600> led<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> Pokemon

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
Magikarp makes so that's led to Pokemon

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.190 
Magikarp makes so that's led to Pokemon
like<00:01:13.770> hop<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.369> spoink<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.270> Buneary<00:01:15.900> all

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
like hop it and spoink and Buneary all

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
like hop it and spoink and Buneary all
learning<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.729> all<00:01:17.909> learn<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.270> move

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
learning it they all learn this move

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.170 
learning it they all learn this move
through<00:01:19.020> level<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> does<00:01:20.670> not<00:01:20.850> stop

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
through level up but it does not stop

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.679 
through level up but it does not stop
there<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.220> get<00:01:23.490> Pokemon<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
there because you can get Pokemon to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.160 
there because you can get Pokemon to
learn<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.049> move<00:01:25.290> by<00:01:25.950> breeding<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
learn this move by breeding so if you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
learn this move by breeding so if you
particularly<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> cliff<00:01:29.490> able<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
particularly want to cliff able to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.510 
particularly want to cliff able to
splash<00:01:30.299> all<00:01:30.659> over<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> opponent<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.310> do

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
splash all over the opponent you can do

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
splash all over the opponent you can do
that<00:01:32.729> by<00:01:32.939> breeding<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.390> male<00:01:33.600> hop<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that by breeding a male hop it with a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.130 
that by breeding a male hop it with a
female<00:01:35.009> Clefairy<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.390> no<00:01:36.600> idea<00:01:36.960> why<00:01:37.079> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
female Clefairy I have no idea why you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.200 
female Clefairy I have no idea why you
would<00:01:37.350> ever<00:01:37.530> want<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
would ever want to do this but that is a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.510 
would ever want to do this but that is a
possibility<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:40.049> suppose<00:01:40.680> different<00:01:41.220> strokes

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
possibility I suppose different strokes

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
possibility I suppose different strokes
for<00:01:41.640> different<00:01:41.759> folks<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.659> all<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.960> now

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
for different folks and all that now

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.649 
for different folks and all that now
let's<00:01:43.649> move<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.250> another<00:01:44.790> completely

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
let's move on to another completely

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.350 
let's move on to another completely
useless<00:01:45.869> move<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.159> course<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.790> king<00:01:48.090> of
