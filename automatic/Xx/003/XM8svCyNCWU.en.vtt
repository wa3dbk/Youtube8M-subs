00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
except for I'm pretty sure sore tensor

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.999

brings me on to my next topic what do
you<00:01:38.790> guys<00:01:38.939> think<00:01:39.000> about<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> whole<00:01:39.810> sort

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.219 
tenser situation what do I think about
the<00:01:41.850> whole<00:01:41.970> sort<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> tension<00:01:42.420> situation<00:01:43.049> if

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the whole sort of tension situation if

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.319 
the whole sort of tension situation if
you<00:01:43.740> guys<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.250> tensor<00:01:44.729> was<00:01:45.090> called

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
you guys don't know tensor was called

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270 
you guys don't know tensor was called
doing<00:01:45.600> lock<00:01:45.780> lobbies<00:01:46.229> around<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> month<00:01:46.799> ago<00:01:46.950> on

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
doing lock lobbies around a month ago on

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
doing lock lobbies around a month ago on
black<00:01:47.790> ops<00:01:47.970> 2<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.420> lock<00:01:48.630> lobbies<00:01:49.020> is

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
black ops 2 and lock lobbies is

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780 
black ops 2 and lock lobbies is
basically<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.680> setting<00:01:50.040> up<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.310> black<00:01:50.490> ops<00:01:50.670> 2

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
basically like setting up on black ops 2

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.420 
basically like setting up on black ops 2
and<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:52.229> now<00:01:52.439> he<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:53.399> just

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and then right now he actually was just

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.850 
and then right now he actually was just
caught<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.630> his<00:01:54.869> face<00:01:55.020> 5<00:01:55.259> response<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.799> he

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
caught for his face 5 response and he

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.230 
caught for his face 5 response and he
had<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> ton<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.430> fake<00:01:56.640> clips<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.149> I'm

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
had a ton of fake clips in there I'm

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.760 
had a ton of fake clips in there I'm
pretty<00:01:57.270> sure<00:01:57.450> only<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:57.990> clip<00:01:58.259> was<00:01:58.409> legit

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
pretty sure only one clip was legit

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.649 
pretty sure only one clip was legit
which<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.040> pretty<00:01:59.250> funny<00:01:59.490> but<00:02:00.149> at<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> same

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
which is pretty funny but at the same

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.109 
which is pretty funny but at the same
time<00:02:00.930> guys<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.439> don't<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.549> what<00:02:02.670> tensor<00:02:02.969> did

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
time guys I don't think what tensor did

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.639 
time guys I don't think what tensor did
was<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.110> shouldn't<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.500> giving

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
was right but you shouldn't be giving

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.109 
was right but you shouldn't be giving
him<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.070> death<00:02:05.310> threats<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.790> stuff<00:02:05.969> for

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
him like death threats and stuff for

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.160 
him like death threats and stuff for
what<00:02:06.240> he<00:02:06.299> did<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> video<00:02:06.659> game<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.110> think

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
what he did in the video game I think

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.900 
what he did in the video game I think
that's<00:02:07.469> pretty<00:02:07.649> stupid<00:02:07.920> people<00:02:08.580> need<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that's pretty stupid people need to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.729 
that's pretty stupid people need to
realize<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.810> not<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.110> big<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> deal

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
realize that it's not that big a deal

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.990 
realize that it's not that big a deal
that<00:02:10.979> he<00:02:11.039> did<00:02:11.190> something<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
that he did something like that in the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.460 
that he did something like that in the
real<00:02:12.209> world<00:02:12.480> at

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
real world at

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.140 
real world at
same<00:02:13.680> time<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.220> pretty<00:02:14.310> fucked<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.060> he

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
same time it's pretty fucked up that he

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.430 
same time it's pretty fucked up that he
did<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.600> he<00:02:15.660> deserved<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.170> kicked

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
did that and he deserved to be kicked

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.470 
did that and he deserved to be kicked
from<00:02:16.470> sore<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:17.490> not<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.880> hate<00:02:18.270> people

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
from sore it's not like I hate people

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.450 
from sore it's not like I hate people
like<00:02:18.870> tensor<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.160> they<00:02:20.280> did

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
like tensor just because they did

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.130 
like tensor just because they did
something<00:02:20.820> like<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.570> video<00:02:21.690> game<00:02:21.990> I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
something like that in a video game I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.510 
something like that in a video game I
just<00:02:22.170> think<00:02:22.590> that's<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.830> stupid<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.460> I

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
just think that's so stupid like if I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.650 
just think that's so stupid like if I
saw<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> tensor<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.120> realize<00:02:24.330> do<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.510> think

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
saw a tensor and realize do you think

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.060 
saw a tensor and realize do you think
I'd<00:02:24.750> punch<00:02:24.960> him<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.200> face<00:02:25.260> because<00:02:25.800> what

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
I'd punch him in the face because what

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.680 
I'd punch him in the face because what
he<00:02:26.130> did<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.430> video<00:02:26.640> game<00:02:26.850> no<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.300> fucking

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
he did in the video game no it's fucking

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.500 
he did in the video game no it's fucking
dumb<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.530> people<00:02:28.800> need<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:28.950> realize<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.730> it's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
dumb so people need to realize that it's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.090 
dumb so people need to realize that it's
not<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.750> big<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.200> deal<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> real<00:02:31.830> world

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
not that big a deal in the real world
