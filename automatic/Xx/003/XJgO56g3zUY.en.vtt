00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.309
 Qatar needs to change its methods 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.380
 compared to the people they welcome 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.540
 on their territory I speak as 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.250
 sporty but it must be even worse 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.140
 for the workers there because 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.890
 I could see how it goes 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.890
 and if qatar does not change its 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.140
 methods 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.950
 I have the courage to say that it will be 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.980
 2022 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.260
 the world cup of shame the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.690
 world cup of slavery is a 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.030
 no respect for human rights and that 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.550
 I have the courage to say it when you 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.100
 arrive at qatar it's beautiful you see 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.620
 a country in full construction with 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.160
 big modern skyscraper 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.609
 gastronomy is not bad there is 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.859
 Sun 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.769
 it's like you when you come in 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.739
 in the middle of the desert you are thirsty 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.769
 you see a big oasis you are approaching 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.050
 to finally keep ya nothing there 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.880
 but I think it's a mirage so what 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.000
 what I'm going to do is open my eyes 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.340
 to the players of the championship of France and 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.790
 why not other championships 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.230
 European 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.060
 you have to know that even if you sign 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.190
 three in four years you are not 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.660
 sure to go all the way and even very 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.730
 certainly you will not go until 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.780
 end of your contract because you 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.040
 can be in shape 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.380
 what happens in the sport in general 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.380
 it can happen you can hurt 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.810
 because we are not robots 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.020
 and it can happen quite a lot and 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.540
 from there people will want to break 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.160
 your contract and not respect the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.620
 terms and you know that to get out of 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.260
 country it is necessary that your guardian enters 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.920
 quotation marks you may be allowed to 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.320
 leave the country 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.140
 it was very difficult to leave the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.060
 country because with the help of 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.020
 from my lawyer we filed a 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.159
 query so to fifa to argue 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.140
 our rights simply 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.200
 and to enforce the terms of the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.830
 contract I wanted I wanted to leave the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.350
 country at first I was refused 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.600
 the exit visa asking me to withdraw 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.510
 this this query because it could 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.959
 detract from the image of the country so 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.110
 the qatar what I refused 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.020
 totally and on the contrary I was 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.220
 threatened to seize the league 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.920
 human rights because here we touch 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.580
 downright to human freedom in these 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.340
 conditions there and some time after we 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.100
 granted me this exit 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.380
 but with as a minor a little 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.050
 threat I will keep that I will keep 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.220
 in me you can leave the country but 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.720
 know one thing is that tarkett dura 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.500
 four or five years because we are 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.070
 very powerful 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.030
 the fifa are a lot of athletes who have 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.480
 known worries there then so be they 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.480
 have accepted 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.040
 he agreed to sit on their 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.900
 rights and finally they left or 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.860
 in others who do not accept and 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.980
 are still stuck there 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.250
 today ago there is one athlete 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.519
 who's called sir haïr bellounis 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.040
 who is stuck there with wife and 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.820
 kids it was the captain of the team 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.870
 of the Army 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.180
 there he particularly benefited from the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.299
 Qatari nationality 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.439
 for a month to be able to make the cut 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.670
 of the military world 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:36.680
 his club went up in first division 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.480
 from there he did not need to 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.439

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.079

 played for three or four years in 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.030
 this club and today it was 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.359

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.329

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:14.450
 sharing is fair play values 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.829

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.349

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.620
 methods 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.479
