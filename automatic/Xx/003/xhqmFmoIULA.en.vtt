00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
the honda cbr1100xx to demonstrate who's

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.350 
the honda cbr1100xx to demonstrate who's
got<00:00:07.589> brakes<00:00:07.890> clap<00:00:08.250> skis<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.849> starts<00:00:09.179> and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
got brakes clap skis and it starts and

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.570 
got brakes clap skis and it starts and
runs<00:00:09.480> or<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.809> kind<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.110> thing<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.580> first

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
runs or that kind of thing so first

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.070 
runs or that kind of thing so first
thing<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> good<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.269> stop<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.809> engine

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
thing this is a good on stop the engine

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.210 
thing this is a good on stop the engine
and<00:00:13.320> take<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> little<00:00:13.950> ride

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
and take it for a little ride

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.140 
and take it for a little ride
that's<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.420> ignition<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:19.609> you<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.760> see<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
that's a ignition on you can see the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.830 
that's a ignition on you can see the
various<00:00:21.449> lights<00:00:21.750> come<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> dash<00:00:22.529> there

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
various lights come up on the dash there

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.250 
various lights come up on the dash there
as<00:00:24.840> they<00:00:25.109> should<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:26.720> it<00:00:27.720> seems<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.019> start

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
as they should do it seems to start

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.810 
as they should do it seems to start
fairly<00:00:28.529> readily<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> guess<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> battery<00:00:29.760> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
fairly readily so I guess the battery is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.889 
fairly readily so I guess the battery is
okay<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> bike<00:00:32.120> once<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> road<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> clear

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
okay on the bike once the road is clear

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.389 
okay on the bike once the road is clear

the rear brake so just by a little bit
of<00:00:40.170> rear<00:00:40.350> brake<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.660> little<00:00:42.660> bit<00:00:42.809> more<00:00:43.700> like

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
of rear brake now a little bit more like

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
of rear brake now a little bit more like
a<00:00:44.730> film<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.180> would<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.629> break<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.020> with

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
a film that would really break this with

near the horn and take my hands off the

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.470 
near the horn and take my hands off the
handlebars<00:01:43.480> so<00:01:44.480> it<00:01:44.540> go<00:01:44.690> nice<00:01:44.870> and<00:01:45.050> straight

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
handlebars so it go nice and straight

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.000 
handlebars so it go nice and straight
next<00:01:47.480> I'm<00:01:47.600> going<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:48.050> do<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.380> fall<00:01:48.680> back<00:01:48.860> back

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
next I'm going to do is fall back back

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.410 
next I'm going to do is fall back back
up<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.400> just<00:01:49.490> make<00:01:49.610> sure<00:01:49.760> it<00:01:49.880> accelerates

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
up and just make sure it accelerates

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.330 
up and just make sure it accelerates
smoothly<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:50.990> all<00:01:51.050> forces<00:01:51.530> without<00:01:52.130> any

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
smoothly and all forces without any

smoothly and all forces without any
electrical<00:01:52.700> breakdown

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.350 

which<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.080> does<00:02:00.290> nice<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.520> clean<00:02:01.700> he<00:02:01.909> sighed

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
which it does nice and clean he sighed

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.020 
which it does nice and clean he sighed
that's<00:02:02.630> as<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.810> should<00:02:02.930> be<00:02:03.640> that's<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.790> test

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
that's as it should be that's a test

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.270 
that's as it should be that's a test
