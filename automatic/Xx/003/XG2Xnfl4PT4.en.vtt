00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.729
 of jumps 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.360
 the life of sebastiÃ¡n 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 this project 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.080
 in the yard the mantra 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.770
 next to close 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.770
 I ask 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.809
 the styling of the girls and how you talk 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.199
 with luis de saints and friend of the daughter of 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.199
 the balloon 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.900
 and so in this state 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.920
 together 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.920
 and here 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 if it was something like that the flight did not have to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.840
 solve in a week two weeks 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.840
 so I did not have much time 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.340
 It is an event for 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.970
 for the dancer's bay and this 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.190
 incredible 2013 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.570
 Latin America and 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.570
 is where we are 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.909
 so loaded gaston is not this one 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.140
 Photos 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.280
 the whole year to the six girls 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.280
 we have a catalog for me 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.000
 as also 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.000
 to think 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 yes 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.340
 especially being the youngest will be ready 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.340
 in November 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.340
 I think 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.100
 programming 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.560
 chapter 1 the premiere will be early 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.560
 of 2013 more calculations 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.530
 goalkeepers 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.340
 Many years ago in Argentina 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.099
 I am 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.000
 in our model stage it is very 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.610
 fun to be able to do 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.670
 in the national concept of fashion 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.590
 Sometimes being is like most has played 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.590
 so I think we 're six o'clock 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.220
 It's really a pleasure and it gives us a lot 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.140
 trust that they are the ones who are 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.140
 behind the camera and creating the image 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.250
 pretty big 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.930
 people so be a few days we 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.930
 there are ten more days left so they will have 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.080
 ah 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.650
 really enjoying what the peninsula is 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.560
 how they will treat us to be 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.520
 they are very nice 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.520
 It is very good because 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.860
 the days 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.860
 kitchen 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.750
 at night 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.849

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.849
