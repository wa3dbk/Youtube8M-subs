00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 there are so many at the moment 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.830
 smarttv they are in market only they are not 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.810
 always easy to operate 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.730
 so-called smart applications for 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.200
 youtube and broadcast missed work 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.550
 cumbersome and impractical 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.110
 therefore google's chrome cast 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.299
 bring change for none 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.080
 four decades and your TV a piece 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.670
 smarter 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.770
 but it is this small investment it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.930
 worth everything at the google showcase 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.789
 street ease out so has the manual 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.680
 but those images and has the dommel 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.150
 also a simplistic design 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.429
 from your smartphone tablet or laptop 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.349
 send you very nice positions that you 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.790
 want to play on your TV but here comes 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.770
 immediately the snag under the grass 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.510
 with the fridge in you reasonable 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.940
 limits the content that you currently have 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.070
 from your iphone or mac to your television 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.290
 streaming only consists of netflix 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 google play and google play music 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.950
 You also have benefits from you 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.570
 photo files need a special app that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.710
 unfortunately can not directly from you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.300
 photo gallery 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 luckily you can do a lot with android 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.770
 more so you can use the media center its 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.840
 Flex certain content from your laptop 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.070
 computer or network drive to you 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.809
 cupboard hours 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 opium and plex broadcasts from 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.880
 Missed the broadcast and RTL XL 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.040
 the fridge also looks back 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.200
 an extension feature makes this 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.640
 possible to have a foam tab 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.500
 stream to the chrome cast 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.930
 This is especially interesting if you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.520
 put video content in this step 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.140
 so you can watch movies and series from you 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 browser very easily on your TV 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.810
 look 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.860
 unfortunately this extension option is still 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.720
 a betta 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.670
 and you notice it works a lot less 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.040
 flexible than all other options that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.290
 the scratches came the wifi network 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.790
 via two points here gigahertz channel to 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.560
 with a good network you wouldn't have one 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.720
 problems we must encounter 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.650
 have tested the refrigerator at home but with 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.810
 a bad network 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.579
 therefore we became one during your watching 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.290
 few times by stuttering image from the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.770
 most exciting scenes of game of thrones 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.560
 achieved 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.689
 the buyers offers a whole for 35 euros 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.369
 easy way to upload videos online 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.930
 watch your TV 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.030
 also control with your tablet smartphone 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.950
 or laptop is a lot easier then 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.540
 with most smart TVs 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.280
 if you are looking for the very best 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.290
 way to play movies and series 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.180
 you might be able to watch better on your tv 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.340
 to another alternative because came 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.170
 best from then 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.450
 we hope the extension to at one 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.580
 update will work flawlessly because that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.530
 saw the podcast and ideals and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.160
 make a cheap outcome for the loud 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.160
 bank hanger
