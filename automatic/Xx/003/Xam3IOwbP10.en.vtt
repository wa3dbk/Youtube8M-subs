00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello girls in this video I would like 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.620
 let you see how I created this look 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.230
 so how I created these waves 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.389
 soft and voluminous and I know it 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.040
 always ask for lots of things under 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.599
 video as you see with wavy hair and 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.830
 also below the photographs you see 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.540
 with wavy hair I am therefore 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.670
 delighted to film this video 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 because I know that so many interests 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.630
 so many of you and to create this look 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.279
 used this plate that is 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.859
 very strange now I'll show you 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.320
 here it is in the tutorial I'll show you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 how to use it looks very strange in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.880
 reality is very simple to use e 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.040
 the really weird thing that it doesn't 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.510
 have you ever seen is that this tested 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.100
 practically crushing this 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.629
 wait for it to turn on ok if 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.890
 we like what went there I said this 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.270
 pulsantino this is the strange thing 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.420
 of this plate however now in the 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.340
 wait until i reject it ok now 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.949
 however in the tutorial you will see how the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.940
 use and nothing I send you a kiss and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.000
 I leave you the tutorial 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.979
 hello the side keys serve for 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.960
 turn on and off the square for 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.670
 lower raise the temperature then 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.350
 the first with the least with the most rises 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 the temperature is lowered with the less 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.460
 the temperature and finally to decide the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.259
 towards where the plate rotates is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.950
 You can decide between a clockwise direction and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950
 a counter-clockwise direction 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 begins by collecting almost all of my own 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.640
 hair and leaving the book is only 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.530
 two locks that are the first that a 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.910
 curly 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.820
 at this point I decide the verse of 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.380
 plate rotation the plate 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.320
 then it is evident that it runs in this direction 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.030
 in this sense, I roll my own 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.030
 hair then I take the lock 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.880
 and I recommend it is very important and 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.880
 distribute the hair well as you see 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.860
 over the entire length of the square 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.149
 in this way the head will warm everyone 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.920
 all hair 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.920
 at this point he immediately takes the lacquer 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.480
 for my hair they immediately tend to 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.970
 to fall and immediately return to the ice 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.730
 then immediately take the lacquer and fix it 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:25.330
 what is now step to this other 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.280
 ciotta I divide it into this too 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.569
 parts I make small strands nor 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.569
 and the hedgehogs 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.800
 but is silent 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.579
 how many not collecting a part of 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.540
 hair and leaving out strands 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.329
 they sweep well this is what for 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.329
 be sure they are smooth and not 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.040
 there are knots and then I go on to 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.790
 curl my hair and wrap it 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.540
 always in the direction in which the caste turns 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.180
 Also here are immediately hairspray and it 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:27.230
 spray and then continue doing so 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:29.030
 same thing for all all hair and 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.439
 then at the end it passes to the tuft and to 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.599
 as for the tuft I like it 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.790
 roll it outwards so no 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.069
 inwards but outwards e 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.290
 as you can see, I hold the top plate 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.329
 for a reason why only at the end 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.819
 when i did all the hair is 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.319
 decided to move the dive from 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.530
 so for this reason now in fact 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:54.949
 you will see that I make the last tuft and then 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:56.479
 the groom on the other side likes 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.739
 go upside down teams a little bit 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.109
 the hair to have an effect 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:05.810
 even more voluminous then you could 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:10.129
 down and I do so after a little bit of 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.560
 volume at all and maybe not the best 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.620
 talk like that and I open a little bit too 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.329
 ringlets and voila this final result 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.889
 I don't have many curls because 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.690
 however, they will let themselves go alone 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.889
 during the day and in this 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.580
 so I will get plan that have an effect 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.750
 a natural boulder is becoming more and more natural 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.990
