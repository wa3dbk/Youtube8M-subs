00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
got your food in your two-liter bottles

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.740 
got your food in your two-liter bottles
and<00:02:39.250> you're<00:02:40.250> ready<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.610> put<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.209> oxygen

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
and you're ready to put in the oxygen

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.750 
and you're ready to put in the oxygen
absorbers<00:02:42.260> go<00:02:42.620> ahead<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.040> open<00:02:43.069> them<00:02:43.430> but

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
absorbers go ahead and open them but

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.210 
absorbers go ahead and open them but
don't<00:02:43.910> open<00:02:44.239> them<00:02:44.390> until<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.810> have<00:02:45.019> enough

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
don't open them until you have enough

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.100 
don't open them until you have enough
bottles<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.790> use<00:02:46.940> them<00:02:47.150> all<00:02:47.299> up<00:02:47.510> because

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
bottles to use them all up because

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.020 
bottles to use them all up because
they'll<00:02:48.440> start<00:02:48.680> absorbing<00:02:49.130> oxygen<00:02:49.519> right

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
they'll start absorbing oxygen right

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.270 
they'll start absorbing oxygen right
away<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.829> what<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.069> want<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.370> do<00:02:52.549> is<00:02:53.950> roll<00:02:54.950> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
away and what you want to do is roll the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.910 
away and what you want to do is roll the
oxygen<00:02:55.849> absorber<00:02:56.329> up<00:02:56.480> gently<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:57.680> don't<00:02:57.709> want

oxygen absorber up gently you don't want

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.819 
oxygen absorber up gently you don't want
to<00:02:58.010> break<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.579> or<00:02:58.849> fold<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.660> sharp<00:03:00.319> corners

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
to break it or fold it in sharp corners

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.039 
to break it or fold it in sharp corners
because<00:03:01.069> then<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.549> might<00:03:01.700> actually<00:03:02.049> spill

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
because then it might actually spill

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.380 
because then it might actually spill
some<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.769> contents<00:03:04.430> into<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.670> food<00:03:04.970> you

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
some of the contents into the food you

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
don't want to eat that you roll it up

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.620 
don't want to eat that you roll it up
just<00:03:07.940> small<00:03:08.269> enough<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.660> fit<00:03:08.870> into<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.260> cap<00:03:10.630> if

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
just small enough to fit into the cap if

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.240 
just small enough to fit into the cap if
you<00:03:11.780> need<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.079> push<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.500> down<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.920> food<00:03:13.130> a

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
you need to push it down in the food a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.670 
you need to push it down in the food a
little<00:03:13.280> bit<00:03:13.609> do<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.120> gently<00:03:14.480> tap<00:03:15.109> if<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.500> need

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
little bit do it gently tap if you need

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.740 
little bit do it gently tap if you need
to<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.190> once<00:03:16.819> it's<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.150> there<00:03:17.269> where<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.569> can

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
to and once it's in there where you can

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.699 
to and once it's in there where you can
get<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.019> cap<00:03:18.230> on<00:03:19.720> screw<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.870> cap<00:03:21.079> down<00:03:21.319> tight

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
get the cap on screw the cap down tight

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.800 
get the cap on screw the cap down tight
for<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> good<00:03:22.459> seal<00:03:22.910> because<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.540> don't<00:03:23.690> want

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
for a good seal because you don't want

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.890 
for a good seal because you don't want
to<00:03:23.870> take<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.139> cap<00:03:24.350> off<00:03:24.380> again<00:03:25.720> until<00:03:26.720> you're

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
to take the cap off again until you're

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.879 
to take the cap off again until you're
ready<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.139> use<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.560> food<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.500> wanted<00:03:30.799> to

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
ready to use the food so I wanted to

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.590 
ready to use the food so I wanted to
show<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.130> how<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.549> tell<00:03:31.819> if<00:03:31.970> your<00:03:32.000> oxygen

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
show you how to tell if your oxygen

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.970 
show you how to tell if your oxygen
absorbers<00:03:33.109> are<00:03:33.230> working<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.680> if<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.829> have<00:03:33.920> a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
absorbers are working and if you have a

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.490 
absorbers are working and if you have a
good<00:03:34.130> seal<00:03:34.430> as<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.450> can<00:03:35.660> see<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.170> top<00:03:36.350> of

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
good seal as you can see in the top of

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.449 
good seal as you can see in the top of
the<00:03:36.560> bottles<00:03:36.980> I<00:03:37.220> have<00:03:37.459> oxygen<00:03:38.239> absorbers<00:03:38.780> and

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
the bottles I have oxygen absorbers and

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.170 
the bottles I have oxygen absorbers and
this<00:03:40.459> is<00:03:40.639> overnight

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
this is overnight

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.479 
this is overnight
the<00:03:41.540> bottles<00:03:42.049> have<00:03:42.260> collapsed<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:43.069> as<00:03:43.280> they've

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
the bottles have collapsed in as they've

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.140 
the bottles have collapsed in as they've
absorbed<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.090> oxygen<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.849> you<00:03:46.849> could<00:03:47.000> tell

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
absorbed the oxygen and you could tell

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.610 
absorbed the oxygen and you could tell
the<00:03:47.239> seal<00:03:47.450> is<00:03:47.599> good<00:03:47.810> otherwise<00:03:48.139> it<00:03:48.470> would<00:03:48.590> be

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
the seal is good otherwise it would be

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.099 
the seal is good otherwise it would be
just<00:03:48.889> sucking<00:03:49.280> air<00:03:49.430> through<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.849> lid<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:51.049> I

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
just sucking air through the lid so I

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.530 
just sucking air through the lid so I
think<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.590> can<00:03:51.769> see<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.130> dents<00:03:52.400> there<00:03:52.790> where

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
think you can see the dents there where

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.110 
think you can see the dents there where
the<00:03:54.160> bottles<00:03:55.160> have<00:03:55.370> collapsed<00:03:55.670> in<00:03:55.970> on

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
the bottles have collapsed in on

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.940 
the bottles have collapsed in on
themselves<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:57.730> in<00:03:58.730> case<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.030> are<00:03:59.150> curious<00:03:59.180> I

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
themselves and in case you are curious I

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.229 
themselves and in case you are curious I
choose<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.250> use<00:04:02.799> 300cc<00:04:03.799> oxygen<00:04:04.459> absorbers<00:04:05.000> and

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
choose to use 300cc oxygen absorbers and

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.580 
choose to use 300cc oxygen absorbers and
they<00:04:05.810> come<00:04:06.220> packaged<00:04:07.220> in<00:04:07.519> a<00:04:07.970> 22<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.540> pack<00:04:09.049> here

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
they come packaged in a 22 a pack here

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.160 
they come packaged in a 22 a pack here
if<00:04:10.489> you<00:04:10.639> order<00:04:10.910> 50<00:04:11.269> at<00:04:11.389> a<00:04:11.480> time<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.870> get<00:04:12.019> two

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
if you order 50 at a time you get two

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.449 
if you order 50 at a time you get two
packs<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.799> 20<00:04:13.159> and<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.340> pack<00:04:13.519> of<00:04:13.549> 10

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
packs of 20 and a pack of 10

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.969 
packs of 20 and a pack of 10
and<00:04:14.549> so<00:04:15.269> try<00:04:15.629> to<00:04:15.659> have<00:04:15.930> enough<00:04:16.199> bottles<00:04:16.650> ready

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
and so try to have enough bottles ready

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.990 
and so try to have enough bottles ready
to<00:04:17.940> put<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.269> oxygen<00:04:18.720> absorbers<00:04:19.259> in<00:04:20.000> before

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
to put the oxygen absorbers in before

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.330 
to put the oxygen absorbers in before
you<00:04:21.359> open<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.049> oxygen<00:04:22.620> absorbers<00:04:23.039> because<00:04:23.220> as

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
you open the oxygen absorbers because as

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.379 
you open the oxygen absorbers because as
soon<00:04:23.490> as<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.669> open<00:04:23.699> them<00:04:24.060> they<00:04:24.150> start

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
soon as you open them they start

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.260 
soon as you open them they start
absorbing<00:04:24.840> oxygen<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.669> I<00:04:26.669> will<00:04:26.820> put<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.030> link

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
absorbing oxygen and I will put a link

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.090 
absorbing oxygen and I will put a link
below<00:04:27.360> where<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.050> can<00:04:28.110> get<00:04:28.410> these<00:04:28.590> oxygen

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
below where you can get these oxygen

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.680 
below where you can get these oxygen
absorbers<00:04:29.580> for<00:04:29.789> the<00:04:29.850> best<00:04:30.030> deal<00:04:30.210> I've<00:04:30.449> been

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
absorbers for the best deal I've been

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.199 
absorbers for the best deal I've been
able<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.930> find
