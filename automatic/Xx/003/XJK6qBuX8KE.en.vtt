00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
 I 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.540
 2 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.520
 this first year for me it's a 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.260
 a little bit a warm up lap with a 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.090
 team that I composed because 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.220
 that's it's not the easiest it's 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.140
 to find good riders so there 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.170
 you go denis who is at my arm 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.540
 right houses laffitte and to climb in 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.030
 race some time ago already and 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.920
 who is a good horseman who remains to you 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.900
 very well the choice of bags even that 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.220
 anyway 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.659
 so after you have a little further 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.050
 julie joined the team for months 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.210
 August 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.760
 and then christophe so three horsemen 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.350
 14 mox 20 horses 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.720
 so I assure you jean but 3-2 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.490
 bullshit but it forced me to 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.189
 actually do a rotation between 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.490
 the pre lara workouts for those who 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.240
 take a little rest born and raised to 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.790
 houses laffitte 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.560
 I went in prices but still good 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.820
 and so I know the tracks if you 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 do you want me, I always went up to 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.420
 houses-laffitte so the advantage that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.280
 the work tool I believe I the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:41.220
 know not too bad and it's a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.929
 advantage I control times so it's a 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.649
 horse who dared after if you want 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.850
 very high horseback of this type I think 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.670
 I have no cause of four years for him 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.659
 even locked up 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.119
 you have to choose their entry 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.159
 so I'm not saying that he runs after two 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.140
 little bodies not Sunday I am obliged 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.890
 to go in direct target either to 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.700
 fontainebleau is to compiÃ¨gne 60 of the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.009
 concerts proclaimed 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.990
 well here is the in-between the islands there 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.630
 it's not good, let's go 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.550
 two levels rising from zero alone 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.890
 just right and both 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.460
 other business straight lines dyke 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.460
 in earth anyway 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.540
 vincent without specifically shortening 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.540
 like that you see there but the tempo 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.540
 voice 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.950
 go go I remember when george 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.130
 paulin left this land which I'm going 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.740
 saw that in trading my little yes but hey 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:56.550
 it was in 60 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.900
 I know more 16 17 good I was not ripe 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.070
 I'm better yes I'm happy to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.430
 do it because I will have no look 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.430
 not do it 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.450
 behind two years ago thematic 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.049
 ben bella who in two years at my club and 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.330
 they are very good I hope to start well 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.650
 is why for the first time the 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.650
 first meeting enghien if it's ok 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.380
 thomas white 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.390
 well he's half of their orders 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.990
 and so that's for sure he likes 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.980
 backing 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.980
 here 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.530
 what I'm looking at I think it's not 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.570
 badly that it will be necessary to manage in 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.680
 course what I look at is that they 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.900
 go all the way through the same 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.190
 look to those where we see if the 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:10.680
 condition and it's finally moving forward and 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:14.510
 go with bekin was so ram and a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.510
 little not yeah but it's good 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.680
 so the horses have it so after he 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.169
 come back to us pigalle or hunting 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.720
 right now I'm going to markets 3 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.740
 minutes and are going to gallop again 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.740
 hunting a little scrub 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.810
 I have deep anyway a little no 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.210
 it's a bit deep anyway yeah 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.350
 no it's okay but it's still 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.130
 deep so I ride horseback 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.050
 when you have a little warm up 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.639
 but I like from time to time 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.190
 ride a horse I see a 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.479
 training there in gallo and I have my 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.039
 little idea in a few times I the 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.490
 shows to get an idea 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.490
 complementary 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.240
 it was I'm going to launch a stable that 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.530
 will be called the Mansonian stables 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.789
 knowing that the inhabitants need the 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.889
 girl's name is denying this link and 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.389
 dementia onion so it's not too much 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.789
 restrictive it's not mad ferries 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.930
 this link so it is open even to 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.380
 people who do not live in houses laffitte 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:24.190
 and so the idea is to have five pins 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.500
 online flat vocation for only two 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.930
 years if possible early since 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.340
 brand is not patient today and 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.930
 then also to take two years 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.270
 there they have two years that they go 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.289
 take three years for the discipline of 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.270
 the obstacle which the stables of 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.100
 co-owners that I animate I 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.020
 do not intervene in the east 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.590
 race choices and coaches 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.000
 anyway who decides so here is the 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.180
 only thing that can happen is 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.070
 arrived a picture of them is we are 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.150
 I have a starter in a stable where 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.039
 another stable a good leaving fair 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.449
 play if they are in front of me there is no 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.930
 of problem if they are behind me must 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.370
 well they understand it can happen 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.240
 for me as a coach that's for sure 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.560
 than to win a race it's great 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.870
 it's the culmination of a job and 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.289
 then it erases the worries that all 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.729
 coaches of course have daily 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.349
 balance sheet of the first half 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.259
 I agreed we won three races 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:25.419
 with useful and shows that we had 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.210
 had on tour with 7.8 need to start 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:30.009
 of year and then so I was hoping on the 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.779
 second half with horses of 3 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.879
 years that was lapped that had to 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.740
 runners into obstacles and I got 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:38.499
 unfortunately August unac month 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.150
 toxic to dietary food that's more 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.009
 of horses when lyme disease 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.319
 Well, that's not to be reserved for me 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.219
 even this year there were quite a few 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.169
 so in took two months late 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:49.960
 so we took two months late 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.969
 the re-entry races planned in 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.309
 September are going to take place there in the 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.809
 fifteen days coming so I have not 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.999
 the choice we will not wait marcel and 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:59.289
 next with a back-to-school race 

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:01.089
 nothing more so we'll go do a 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:05.469
 meeting of pau and then eventually 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:06.759
 maybe a horse for 4 I think 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:08.889
 to have a real project 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:10.809
 dynamic without that I crack houses 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.849
 laffitte in the coming years will have 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:15.550
 still difficulties because good 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.990
 we have some pretty good tracks 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.249
 complain 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.139
 there is a lot of room for 

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:21.370
 default the tracks could receive 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.889
 practically double the horses that 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.060
 currently binds to training there are 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.439
 means there were surely some 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.909
 potential 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:31.199
 to build boxes and housing 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:32.399
 because we need housing for 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:34.199
 for riders 

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:36.330
 we need social housing without that 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:39.029
 they do not do it by doing that 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.620
 may find that there is a 

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:43.000
 a bit ambitious project 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.470
 there is no reason for the city to be 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.389
 not for and that would allow for maybe 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:52.720
 to change the structure of the stables 

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:54.610
 today with in my opinion a cost all 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.810
 quite affordable for coaches and 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.229
 especially bring new ones 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.229
 coaches 

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.370
 frankly there are like 6 coach 

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.200
 when asked when is 

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.390
 the horse will run in general they will you 

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.730
 answer it's him who will tell it to me 

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:11.330
 as far as I am concerned, I repeat it to you 

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.330
 raid on say
