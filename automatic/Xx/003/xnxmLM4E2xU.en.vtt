00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.060 
is the very first stitch I ever learned
how<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.160> do<00:00:09.050> it's<00:00:10.050> called<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> spiral<00:00:10.679> stitch

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
how to do it's called the spiral stitch

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.160 
how to do it's called the spiral stitch
some<00:00:11.759> people<00:00:12.030> call<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> DNA<00:00:12.570> stitch

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
some people call it the DNA stitch

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.440 
some people call it the DNA stitch
because<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.799> does<00:00:13.980> kind<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.490> end<00:00:14.700> up<00:00:14.849> looking

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
because it does kind of end up looking

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.380 
because it does kind of end up looking
like<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.660> DNA<00:00:16.049> strand<00:00:16.760> you<00:00:17.760> start<00:00:18.060> off<00:00:18.240> with<00:00:19.100> two

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
like a DNA strand you start off with two

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.420 
like a DNA strand you start off with two
contrasting<00:00:21.390> colors<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.109> beads<00:00:24.650> one<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
contrasting colors of beads one of the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.259 
contrasting colors of beads one of the
colors<00:00:26.820> will<00:00:27.779> be<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:28.230> core<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.939> second

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
colors will be your core and the second

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.330 
colors will be your core and the second
color<00:00:30.449> will<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.869> your<00:00:31.050> rap<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:33.739> have<00:00:34.739> orange<00:00:35.190> and

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.110 
your previous row and the one core bead
that<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.950> added<00:02:34.840> pull<00:02:35.840> tight<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.580> that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
that you just added pull tight so that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.630 
that you just added pull tight so that
the<00:02:38.480> rat<00:02:38.750> beads<00:02:40.630> rest<00:02:41.630> against<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.200> core<00:02:42.440> beat

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
the rat beads rest against the core beat

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.220 
the rat beads rest against the core beat
while<00:02:43.640> holding<00:02:43.910> this<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.420> your<00:02:44.569> hand<00:02:44.930> you're

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
while holding this in your hand you're

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.430 
while holding this in your hand you're
going<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.590> want<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.860> continuously<00:02:46.790> push<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
going to want to continuously push the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.120 
going to want to continuously push the
rap<00:02:48.680> beads<00:02:49.569> against<00:02:50.569> each<00:02:50.720> other<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.980> they're

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
rap beads against each other so they're

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.809 
rap beads against each other so they're
not<00:02:52.250> spaced<00:02:52.640> out<00:02:52.880> really<00:02:53.239> far<00:02:53.660> apart<00:02:54.819> and

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
not spaced out really far apart and

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.630 
not spaced out really far apart and
you'll<00:02:56.209> get<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.420> nice<00:02:57.160> nice<00:02:58.160> coiled<00:02:59.000> wrap<00:03:00.640> when

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
you'll get a nice nice coiled wrap when

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.340 
you'll get a nice nice coiled wrap when
you're<00:03:01.790> done<00:03:02.000> working<00:03:02.510> you're<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.200> end

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
you're done working you're going to end

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.259 
you're done working you're going to end
up<00:03:03.470> with<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.680> long<00:03:04.010> strand<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.670> this<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.150> you

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
up with a long strand like this that you

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.330 
up with a long strand like this that you
can<00:03:05.299> use<00:03:05.510> any<00:03:06.200> way<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.769> want

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
can use any way you want

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.310 
can use any way you want
this<00:03:07.850> looks<00:03:08.120> really<00:03:08.359> loose<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.170> that's

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
this looks really loose and that's

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.940 
this looks really loose and that's
because<00:03:09.769> I'm<00:03:10.160> using<00:03:10.400> too<00:03:10.820> big<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.329> a<00:03:11.420> bead<00:03:11.950> for

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
because I'm using too big of a bead for

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.180 
because I'm using too big of a bead for
the<00:03:13.489> thread<00:03:15.130> if<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:17.030> use<00:03:17.239> smaller<00:03:17.690> beads

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
the thread if you use smaller beads

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.440 
the thread if you use smaller beads
which<00:03:19.190> should<00:03:19.579> because<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.060> just<00:03:20.180> looks

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
which should because it just looks

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.259 
which should because it just looks
better<00:03:20.709> be<00:03:21.709> careful<00:03:22.100> not<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.280> use<00:03:22.400> too<00:03:22.579> wide<00:03:23.239> of

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
better be careful not to use too wide of

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.199 
better be careful not to use too wide of
a<00:03:23.540> diameter<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:25.070> thread<00:03:25.430> or<00:03:25.700> cording

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
a diameter of a thread or cording

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.479 
a diameter of a thread or cording
because<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.530> pass<00:03:27.769> through<00:03:28.250> those

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
because you have to pass through those

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.819 
because you have to pass through those
core<00:03:28.880> beads<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.510> many<00:03:29.870> times<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.709> could

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
core beads so many times and it could

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.039 
core beads so many times and it could
get<00:03:30.980> tight<00:03:31.310> very<00:03:31.760> very<00:03:32.000> quickly<00:03:32.299> and<00:03:32.660> you

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
get tight very very quickly and you

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.449 
get tight very very quickly and you
won't<00:03:33.260> be<00:03:33.410> able<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.650> put<00:03:33.829> your<00:03:33.980> needle<00:03:34.220> up

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
won't be able to put your needle up

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.840 
won't be able to put your needle up
through<00:03:34.690> those<00:03:35.690> core<00:03:36.049> beads<00:03:36.320> so<00:03:37.100> you<00:03:37.519> know<00:03:37.609> you

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
through those core beads so you know you

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.420 
through those core beads so you know you
might<00:03:38.060> have<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.359> play<00:03:38.480> around<00:03:38.720> with<00:03:39.430> different

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
might have to play around with different

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.569 
might have to play around with different
threads<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:42.730> lines<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.269> cords<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.950> get<00:03:46.370> just

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
threads and lines and cords to get just

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.160 
threads and lines and cords to get just
the<00:03:46.670> right<00:03:46.880> one<00:03:47.120> for<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.480> beads<00:03:47.720> you're<00:03:47.930> using

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
the right one for the beads you're using

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.440 
the right one for the beads you're using
you<00:03:48.470> can<00:03:48.620> use<00:03:48.680> inexpensive<00:03:49.100> beads<00:03:49.910> you<00:03:50.269> can

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
you can use inexpensive beads you can

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.370 
you can use inexpensive beads you can
use<00:03:50.630> cheap<00:03:51.049> ones<00:03:52.389> these<00:03:53.389> bracelets<00:03:54.290> are

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
use cheap ones these bracelets are

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.289 
use cheap ones these bracelets are
leftover<00:03:54.950> from<00:03:55.130> what<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.400> made<00:03:55.700> from<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.060> I

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
leftover from what I made from the I

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.660 
leftover from what I made from the I
made<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.660> mountain<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.290> these<00:03:57.440> like<00:03:58.130> ten<00:03:58.400> years

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
made a mountain of these like ten years

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.460 
made a mountain of these like ten years
ago<00:03:58.819> because<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.389> was<00:03:59.420> just<00:03:59.690> so<00:03:59.810> excited<00:04:00.290> they

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
ago because I was just so excited they

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.860 
ago because I was just so excited they
just<00:04:00.709> looked<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.069> cute<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.609> pretty<00:04:01.850> and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
just looked so cute and pretty and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.509 
just looked so cute and pretty and
all<00:04:03.870> my<00:04:04.110> daughter's<00:04:04.500> friends<00:04:05.010> were<00:04:05.189> grabbing

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
all my daughter's friends were grabbing

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.899 
all my daughter's friends were grabbing
them<00:04:05.730> out<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.879> my<00:04:05.970> box<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.689> giving<00:04:06.959> them<00:04:07.049> away

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
them out of my box and giving them away

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.179 
them out of my box and giving them away
I<00:04:09.140> couldn't<00:04:10.140> make<00:04:10.200> enough<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.620> them<00:04:10.769> for<00:04:10.950> a

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
I couldn't make enough of them for a

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.559 
I couldn't make enough of them for a
while<00:04:11.370> there<00:04:11.670> but<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:12.000> still<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.269> great

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
while there but it's still a great

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.300 
while there but it's still a great
technique<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.319> can<00:04:13.470> use<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:13.950> lot

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
technique and you can use it for a lot

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.340 
technique and you can use it for a lot
of<00:04:14.340> different<00:04:14.610> things<00:04:15.169> easily<00:04:16.169> make<00:04:16.320> a

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
of different things easily make a

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.879 
of different things easily make a
bracelet<00:04:16.769> by<00:04:17.090> adding<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.209> loop<00:04:18.449> to<00:04:18.959> one<00:04:19.260> end<00:04:19.530> of

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
bracelet by adding a loop to one end of

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.990 
bracelet by adding a loop to one end of
your<00:04:20.489> spiral<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:22.410> larger<00:04:22.949> bead<00:04:23.190> at<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
your spiral and a larger bead at the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.750 
your spiral and a larger bead at the
other<00:04:24.180> end<00:04:24.479> of<00:04:24.630> your<00:04:24.690> spiral<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:26.669> know

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
other end of your spiral and you know

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.210 
other end of your spiral and you know
loop<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:27.330> loop<00:04:27.539> of<00:04:27.720> beads<00:04:27.930> over<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.830> bigger

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
loop that loop of beads over the bigger

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.610 
loop that loop of beads over the bigger
bead<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.760> you've<00:04:30.570> got<00:04:30.750> yourself<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:31.139> bracelet

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
bead and you've got yourself a bracelet

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.080 
bead and you've got yourself a bracelet
or<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.800> necklace<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:33.389> makes<00:04:33.570> great<00:04:34.669> yeah<00:04:35.669> you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
or a necklace it makes great yeah you

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.080 
or a necklace it makes great yeah you
can<00:04:36.270> use<00:04:36.479> some<00:04:36.979> different<00:04:37.979> sizes<00:04:38.580> there<00:04:38.940> are

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
can use some different sizes there are

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.570 
can use some different sizes there are
so<00:04:39.449> many<00:04:39.960> variations<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.919> this<00:04:41.039> this

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
so many variations to this this

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.689 
so many variations to this this
technique<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.240> can<00:04:42.479> experiment<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.800> come<00:04:44.580> up
