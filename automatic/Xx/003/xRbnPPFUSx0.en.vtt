we go from the round of nature to the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.780 
we go from the round of nature to the
square<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> construction<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
square of construction this is the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.420 
square of construction this is the
dominant<00:01:18.390> question<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.250> civilization<00:01:20.250> we're

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
construction timber now what we have to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.680 
construction timber now what we have to
do<00:02:01.800> of<00:02:01.920> course<00:02:02.069> is<00:02:02.160> define<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> plane<00:02:03.240> now

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
do of course is define a plane now

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.020 
do of course is define a plane now
playing<00:02:04.080> is<00:02:04.410> something<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> same

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
playing is something that is in the same

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.270 
playing is something that is in the same
direction<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:07.050> way<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:07.800> is<00:02:07.830> at<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> other

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
direction this way as it is at the other

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.590 
direction this way as it is at the other
end<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.789> go<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> any<00:02:09.090> point<00:02:09.450> they're

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
end you can go to any point they're

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.490 
end you can go to any point they're
gonna<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> same<00:02:09.990> they're<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.259> gonna<00:02:10.350> be

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
gonna be the same they're not gonna be

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.840 
gonna be the same they're not gonna be
like<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.069> know<00:02:11.160> one<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:11.610> way<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
like that you know one going one way and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.240 
like that you know one going one way and
one<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> other<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.990> in<00:02:13.290> order<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.800> define<00:02:14.190> a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
plane on this log that we can use as a

plane on this log that we can use as a
guide<00:02:17.430> we<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.390> find<00:02:18.630> something<00:02:19.170> that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
guide we have to find something that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.760 
guide we have to find something that
points<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.730> same<00:02:21.150> direction<00:02:21.600> no<00:02:22.530> matter

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
points the same direction no matter

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.540 
points the same direction no matter
where<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.520> go<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:24.000> what<00:02:24.600> could<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.230> be

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
where we go and what could that be

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.880 
where we go and what could that be
except<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.760> course<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.599> right<00:02:27.930> here<00:02:28.319> yes

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
except of course this right here yes

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.300 
except of course this right here yes
it's<00:02:29.190> mr<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:29.910> ms<00:02:30.349> gravity<00:02:31.349> we're<00:02:31.920> gonna<00:02:32.040> use<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it's mr or ms gravity we're gonna use a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.010 
it's mr or ms gravity we're gonna use a
plumb<00:02:32.730> line<00:02:32.760> right<00:02:33.300> here<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.660> how<00:02:33.810> i'm<00:02:33.930> going

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
plumb line right here this how i'm going

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.750 
plumb line right here this how i'm going
to<00:02:34.140> start<00:02:34.410> out<00:02:34.620> with<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.130> plumb<00:02:35.400> line<00:02:35.430> we're

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
to start out with a plumb line we're

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.390 
to start out with a plumb line we're
gonna<00:02:35.880> find<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.450> six-inch<00:02:37.140> piece<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.340> and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
gonna find a six-inch piece here and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.680 
gonna find a six-inch piece here and
you'll<00:02:38.520> see<00:02:38.700> why<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:38.849> plumb<00:02:39.240> line<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.569> so

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
you'll see why that plumb line is so

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.780 
you'll see why that plumb line is so
important<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.709> make<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> six-inch<00:02:41.400> timber<00:02:41.760> out

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
important to make a six-inch timber out

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.510 
important to make a six-inch timber out
of<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.090> poplar<00:02:42.660> logs<00:02:43.440> six<00:02:43.920> inch<00:02:44.099> wide<00:02:44.310> might

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
of this poplar logs six inch wide might

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.910 
of this poplar logs six inch wide might
be<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> six-by-eight<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:46.319> set<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.590> right<00:02:46.680> there

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
be a six-by-eight so set it right there

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.250 
be a six-by-eight so set it right there
okay<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.180> we'll<00:02:48.300> put<00:02:48.510> drop<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.990> plumb<00:02:49.110> line

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
okay and we'll put drop the plumb line

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.350 
okay and we'll put drop the plumb line
down<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.250> i'll<00:02:50.340> use<00:02:50.490> this<00:02:50.610> kind<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.880> charcoal

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
down and i'll use this kind of charcoal

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.270 
down and i'll use this kind of charcoal
stick<00:02:51.690> i'd<00:02:51.840> rather<00:02:51.959> have<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.200> more<00:02:52.980> accurate

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
stick i'd rather have a more accurate

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.009 
stick i'd rather have a more accurate
scriber<00:02:53.939> but<00:02:54.420> i<00:02:54.480> think<00:02:54.659> you'll<00:02:54.780> be<00:02:54.840> able<00:02:54.900> to

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
scriber but i think you'll be able to

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.600 
scriber but i think you'll be able to
see<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.439> better<00:02:55.709> all<00:02:55.920> right<00:02:56.040> i'll<00:02:56.159> mark<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
see this better all right i'll mark the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.220 
see this better all right i'll mark the
bottom<00:02:56.939> there<00:02:57.150> and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
bottom there and

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.250 
bottom there and
then<00:02:58.349> go<00:02:58.769> over<00:02:58.800> about<00:02:59.459> six<00:02:59.790> inches<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.569> let's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
then go over about six inches here let's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.979 
then go over about six inches here let's
see<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:02.540> again<00:03:03.590> mark<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:05.700> top<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.299> the

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
see and again mark the top and the

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.390 
see and again mark the top and the
bottom<00:03:07.019> now<00:03:07.379> see<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.650> doesn't<00:03:07.830> matter<00:03:08.099> so<00:03:08.340> much

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
bottom now see it doesn't matter so much

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.850 
bottom now see it doesn't matter so much
although<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:09.540> can<00:03:09.720> see<00:03:09.930> right<00:03:09.959> here<00:03:10.409> a<00:03:10.470> small

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
although you can see right here a small

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.390 
although you can see right here a small
example<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.120> plumb<00:03:12.420> line<00:03:13.040> by<00:03:14.040> virtue

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
example of it the plumb line by virtue

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.309 
example of it the plumb line by virtue
of<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.060> fact<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.690> always<00:03:15.840> points<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
of the fact that it always points in the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.809 
of the fact that it always points in the
same<00:03:16.440> direction<00:03:16.500> unless<00:03:17.010> you're<00:03:17.280> way<00:03:17.459> way<00:03:17.640> way

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
same direction unless you're way way way

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.630 
same direction unless you're way way way
far<00:03:18.030> apart<00:03:18.950> because<00:03:19.950> actually<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.610> a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
far apart because actually it is a

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.550 
far apart because actually it is a
radius<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.390> core<00:03:21.629> of<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.840> earth<00:03:21.870> but

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
radius to the core of the earth but

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.339 
radius to the core of the earth but
you'd<00:03:22.739> have<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.890> be<00:03:22.980> pretty<00:03:23.040> far<00:03:23.459> before<00:03:23.670> they

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
you'd have to be pretty far before they

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.539 
you'd have to be pretty far before they
so<00:03:25.349> it's<00:03:25.470> not<00:03:25.590> exactly<00:03:25.739> right<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.340> what<00:03:26.489> the

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
so it's not exactly right so what the

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.990 
so it's not exactly right so what the
heck<00:03:27.650> in<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.920> little<00:03:29.220> distance<00:03:29.610> here<00:03:29.819> sure

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
heck in this little distance here sure

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.580 
heck in this little distance here sure
we<00:03:30.150> could<00:03:30.299> do<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.510> with<00:03:30.690> dividers<00:03:31.290> we<00:03:31.470> could

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
we could do this with dividers we could

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.229 
we could do this with dividers we could
do<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.829> with<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> lot<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.430> things<00:03:32.640> here<00:03:32.970> come

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
do this with a lot of things here come

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.720 
do this with a lot of things here come
on<00:03:33.390> pointy<00:03:33.780> stick<00:03:34.049> come<00:03:34.829> on<00:03:34.980> charcoal<00:03:35.549> there

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
on pointy stick come on charcoal there

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.210 
on pointy stick come on charcoal there
we<00:03:35.819> go<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.290> we<00:03:37.290> could<00:03:37.440> do<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.680> with<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> lot<00:03:38.160> of

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
we go and we could do this with a lot of

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.460 
we go and we could do this with a lot of
tools<00:03:38.549> but<00:03:38.849> you'll<00:03:38.970> see<00:03:39.239> we<00:03:39.959> need<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.230> do<00:03:40.349> the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
tools but you'll see we need to do the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.099 
tools but you'll see we need to do the
same<00:03:40.500> thing<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> other<00:03:41.280> end<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.109> that's

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
same thing on the other end and that's

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.539 
same thing on the other end and that's
where<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:44.450> continuity<00:03:45.450> Oh<00:03:45.690> gravity<00:03:46.549> becomes

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
where this continuity Oh gravity becomes

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.110 
where this continuity Oh gravity becomes
so<00:03:48.150> handy<00:03:49.220> we're<00:03:50.220> also<00:03:50.370> gonna<00:03:50.519> use<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.910> as

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
so handy we're also gonna use this as

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.869 
so handy we're also gonna use this as
our<00:03:51.269> snap<00:03:51.690> line<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.310> order<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.549> make<00:03:53.700> this

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
our snap line and in order to make this

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.910 
our snap line and in order to make this
a<00:03:53.940> good<00:03:54.180> snap<00:03:54.480> line<00:03:54.720> I'm<00:03:55.260> gonna<00:03:55.470> go<00:03:55.680> ahead<00:03:55.799> and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
a good snap line I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.589 
a good snap line I'm gonna go ahead and
cut<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> little<00:03:56.370> notch<00:03:56.640> right<00:03:56.940> here<00:03:57.000> at<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.359> top

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
cut a little notch right here at the top

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.199 
cut a little notch right here at the top
of<00:03:58.069> where<00:03:59.069> this<00:03:59.280> line<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.700> now<00:03:59.849> remember<00:04:00.060> what

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
of where this line is now remember what
