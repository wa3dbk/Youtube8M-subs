 eight minutes because I think so 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.320
 three minutes I think it would be very 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.110
 little and 15 minutes I think it's a lot 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.610
 time then I drew it around 78 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.350
 minutes I already took the product from my 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.030

 black is not going to leave but my hair is more 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.229
 People do not have black hair on time. 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.420
 even turns purple black on time but then 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.950
 leaves completely need not then 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.490
 to be afraid to pass the product on 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.340
 hair 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.140
 then it will come out the smell of it is 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.619
 very tasty have a balloon smell 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.990
 Full sweet and so people for them. 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.030
 and b picked dirty the bathroom 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.820
 So you look like that, the relatives are 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.890
 donated black and the hand also becomes a 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.020
 little dark even a pale enamel 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.300
 and stained the enamel became a more tone 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.789
 joined another side and a small 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.310
 quite a good amount of my hair is quite 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.430
 product and applied a product from the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.709
 roots to ends and massage quite 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.480
 was not enough so the product 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.129
 really get the whole hair to 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.560
 do not get stirred without the product 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.349
 then passenger quite like I said 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.290
 I left it there for 178 minutes and it's fine. 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.720
 to be removed is I had to 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.269
 spend a lot of time to stay 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.860
 A lot of time washing your hair to leave. 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.720
 all the product of the wires 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.599
 so I think it would be interesting to pass 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.120
 a normal shampoo to remove this 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.760
 product I did not try using the shampoo I 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.650
 I just took it off with water, but it went well 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.690
 difficult to withdraw I noticed that when 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.700
 I took the product my hair became one 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.760
 a little dry so it became drier 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.280
 because almost all product purple all 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.440
 purple shampoo effect has this effect 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.260
 so leave your hair drier 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.150
 so that's cool after you use it 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.060
 The Moisturizing Mask Class Has Effect 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.190
 antioxidant and it also squeezes and is 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.440
 really is soft enough the wires 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.930
 after I passed she already felt like this 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.940
 at the time the wires have already been treated 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.920
 which was already softer nokia no 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.840
 I left acting for five minutes as I 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.819
 in the packaging is also more 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.100
 easy to remove in the hair as well 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.470
 can also have in this process I left the 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.880
 bath and before unloading the wires 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.889
 before brushing the wires 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.079
 I passed this booklet here he 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.000
 said he has control of the strength of the 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.780

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 technical 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.260
 it helps to untangle also leaves the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.209
 softer hair 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.639
 so I applied a lot of the product 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.410
 on the threads and massage well before 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.079

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.010
 purple product 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.860
 Then we'll have dry hair and 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.590
 The result was this one he did as well 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.930
 natural, so it was the tone of blond that I 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.000
 really like my hair was fine 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.490
 then the difference was yes 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.710

 Hydrated As You Said 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.960
 the mask and olivinha help to hydrate 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.660
 quite help to leave the hair well 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.820

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.830
