00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:10.070
 hello and welcome to another 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:14.210
 picture video to destiny i hope you 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.210
 it looks reasonably good 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.849
 and that is one 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:26.990
 more gimmicks how to do different things 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:31.029
 can form and mica and I have with 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.160
 good luck, too 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.460
 machine gun received 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.670
 In other words, I have many 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:49.519
 kills with it and it already 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:50.900
 The first thing he did was leveling pretty well 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.670
 power is of course a character 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.670
 choose everything as normal 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.310
 so now you are the orbit 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.560
 if you are one if you are simple 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.820
 fast to go then on goal 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:16.030
 select to earth and then on 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.960
 patrol the kosmodrom states stars 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.960
 short the long time 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.600
 that's fourth of me now 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.890
 already know on the ground 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.799
 There are also two more that I have 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.250
 can also show again on request 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.179
 of course who the soul is like us 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.179
 now on the earth 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.819
 I'll show you this luck now 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.709
 can do first you go from 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:09.700
 spawn away right to this first one 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:11.319
 Warehouse here so then you will be here 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.470
 first meet opponents 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.470
 eliminate all of them all times 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:43.170
 So watch out here that you all 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:49.650
 has eliminated that areal her 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:54.540
 free those vandal troops over there 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.000
 and this left can you first 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.879
 no matter the ones we need now 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.739
 nothing and then go down here first 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.349
 in the basement 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.760
 from this house and here is the point 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.970
 where the enemies will later spawn 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.790
 or stop now if I have one 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.959
 certain degree in this area 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.510
 do not let these exceed you 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.670
 Here you can see enemies on the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.659
 radar 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:30.000
 show now is the pendant and of 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.609
 Just leave this funnel 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.930
 do not be fooled and can even down here 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.170
 sometimes they want to do that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.660
 actually a lot of mind sets well then 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:46.109
 here on the left side of the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:48.680
 stairs in the middle of the middle we in the words 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.680
 short 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.349
 it does not matter that's pretty 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:08.220
 pity we have here now against 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:15.330
 but ran out of it a pity 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:17.720
 maybe later, maybe later 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.720
 live 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.360
 So good, you have to be up there 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.170
 be curious again 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:41.070
 Of course , everyone will shoot again and then 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.070
 Let's search again 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.790
 then we try the whole thing again 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:06.479
 Go back down to the half 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.940
 go down the stairs and come right now 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.639
 this painted on the side and we see 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.110
 we are again opponents gisborne 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.110
 exactly six in number 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.750
 It could be done for so long now 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.850
 gets boring or you can go in here 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.530
 grane shapes i have thereby within 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:32.460
 from 15 minutes to about seven blue ones 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:36.540
 in cramme and and a lot of green 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.060
 weapons and armor parts get like 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:50.970
 you can see that is pretty 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:54.930
 Efficiently here, therefore, that's what it says 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.389
 nothing so much further because of it 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.780
 of course the danger that you very much 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.720
 be patched again quickly 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.370
 I also have mine here 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.010
 Machine gun improves the name 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.950
 extremely good advice 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:14.340
 I have already impressed this 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:16.380
 and since gone on a bit too 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.580
 leveling from open is this luck too 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.050
 pretty good actually 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.060
 and if you still have a little bit of it 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.080
 then you can form here 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.280
 Use peter fath or something with it 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.639
 you there a little more 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:38.400
 klimahaus gets and I have myself 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:40.560
 Such telemetry concerned with those can 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.530
 your weapons also much faster 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.990
 level as if you were with them 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:53.310
 normal plays against in the back of the 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:56.280
 bond could or beautiful shapes and that 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.820
 was the very first one in Gran here 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.919
 below 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.690
 this is always down here 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.690
 I quickly noticed 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:17.600
 and if now, if once 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.390
 time should have come at the 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.470
 you're just down there and it was 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.230
 nothing more 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:30.220
 then you go once it runs 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:32.990
 about two minutes so no matter around 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.290
 in any case if there is nothing more 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:39.020
 saver should then just go out 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:41.260
 Runs there for 23 minutes and then applies 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:47.300
 first the outside and then 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:49.340
 try again good then thank you 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.440
 her had the video less if you 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:57.440
 want to see more videos of me 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.440
 or a variety of videos too 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.460
 then you can do tips and tricks in destiny 

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.180
 of course that in the comments 

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.250
 write 

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.760
 about a like or but i would like me 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:11.440
 also have fun until then 

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.440
 this happiness and ciao
