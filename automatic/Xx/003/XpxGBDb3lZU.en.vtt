00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.030
 something that is so sure that I have a 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.160
 Bengal, we are not going to the calaca all 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.020

 it's the only thing we have a lot and good 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.960
 I'm going to chew talented but it's 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.690
 previously fried 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.760
 let's try to associate it this is the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.159
 Achumani style as well as the sensation or 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.990
 percent is very important the way 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.729
 that the knife is taken please is 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.920
 very important the knife remember 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.590
 that I hear symptoms strongly I do not know 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.659
 take as ladies beef and one if you do not 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.119
 they take or if not because it's not going what happens 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.530
 when I exert pressure I can make 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.600
 the knife goes to one side or the other 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.880
 the knife is simply taken by us 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.940
 let's master the knife 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.830
 now the knife this is very dangerous 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.090
 as we all know but I love you 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.750
 say a knife 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.459
 dull jimanese can cut more than a 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.080
 knife with fire a dull knife 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.989
 because because it says that a knife without 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.209
 edge you support it much more are you supporting 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.670
 the most the knife change with edge more 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.350
 they are giving him and he is leading but when 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.300
 you are dull you are there then there 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.670
 is when suddenly happens the actions 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.290
 ok let's mix it 's clear that 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.600
 we have the case you can put yes 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.940
 is the vegetarian remove the bacon if you 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.980
 you want to put this put tomatoes what 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.209
 he wants to put onions more me because 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.310
 this did not have me here I was 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.430
 staying and I think a very very good 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.340
 idea 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.250
 fill my kerry house with a tray 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.400
 previously it is already lined with paper of 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.040
 aluminum and let's put this mixture 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.359
 here without langa washing the kitchen and I 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.340
 they're going to say why this is not so much 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.829

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.049
 Start using the pumpkin as a 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.450
 more ingredient of this season the 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.099

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.269
 price will be very good we always go to 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.069
 pray and the truth I think you will see 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.049
 this kind of the properties of the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.000
 pumpkin that is so important we go 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.500
 everyone gives us the pumpkin and everything 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.269
 that the pumpkin gives us, nothing else 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.829
 gives his flesh gives us the seeds that are 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.510
 so decisions that we eat them outside of 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.829
