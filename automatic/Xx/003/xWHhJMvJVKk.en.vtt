put<00:06:54.539> an<00:06:54.660> external<00:06:55.020> foot<00:06:55.380> switch<00:06:55.650> on<00:06:55.979> this

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
put an external foot switch on this

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.420 
put an external foot switch on this
that's<00:06:57.300> the<00:06:57.389> only<00:06:57.539> thing<00:06:57.720> that<00:06:58.069> would<00:06:59.069> almost

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
that's the only thing that would almost

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.950

make<00:06:59.729> it<00:06:59.759> pretty<00:07:00.060> much<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:00.300> three<00:07:00.419> chan<00:07:00.720> lambs

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
make it pretty much the three chan lambs

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.360

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
that and you can't do a mod that will do

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.990 
that and you can't do a mod that will do
that<00:07:04.680> for<00:07:04.919> you<00:07:05.039> so<00:07:05.190> you<00:07:05.280> can<00:07:05.400> kick<00:07:05.610> that<00:07:05.639> high

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
that for you so you can kick that high

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.999 
that for you so you can kick that high
lead<00:07:06.240> in<00:07:06.360> now<00:07:06.539> so<00:07:07.139> basically<00:07:07.530> you'd<00:07:07.710> have<00:07:07.860> like
