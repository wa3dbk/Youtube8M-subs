sound is not by drum tuning what I need

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.690 
sound is not by drum tuning what I need
is<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:01.620> sound<00:02:01.980> that<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.160> get<00:02:02.430> out<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:02.580> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
is the sound that you get out of the

drums when you hit the drum sound is

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.590 
drums when you hit the drum sound is
very<00:02:05.460> important<00:02:06.350> it's<00:02:07.350> often<00:02:07.530> overlooked

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
very important it's often overlooked

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.920 
very important it's often overlooked
it's<00:02:09.600> such<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> simple<00:02:10.320> thing<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:11.300> practice<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
it's such a simple thing to practice and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.300 
it's such a simple thing to practice and
to<00:02:13.530> get<00:02:13.950> down<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.700> won't<00:02:14.880> take<00:02:15.120> very<00:02:15.360> long<00:02:16.310> but

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
to get down you won't take very long but

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.480 
to get down you won't take very long but
it's<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:17.670> important<00:02:18.500> because<00:02:19.500> if<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.370> an

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
it's so important because if you have an

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.310 
it's so important because if you have an
inconsistent<00:02:21.030> sound<00:02:21.570> when<00:02:21.900> you're<00:02:22.050> playing

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320

your<00:02:25.380> sound<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.890> inconsistent<00:02:26.700> it'll<00:02:27.570> really

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
your sound is inconsistent it'll really

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.979 
your sound is inconsistent it'll really
destroy<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.530> groove<00:02:29.390> it'll<00:02:30.390> make<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.720> groove

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
destroy the groove it'll make the groove

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.830 
destroy the groove it'll make the groove
sound<00:02:31.380> unbalanced<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.450> it'll<00:02:33.450> hold<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
sound unbalanced and it'll hold the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.110 
sound unbalanced and it'll hold the
groove<00:02:34.050> back<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.560> won't<00:02:34.680> move<00:02:34.920> forward<00:02:35.580> so

snare now i'll add some accents and

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.300 
snare now i'll add some accents and
ghost<00:03:26.690> notes<00:03:26.989> on<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.380> hi-hat<00:03:30.100> notice<00:03:31.100> how<00:03:31.250> the

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
ghost notes on the hi-hat notice how the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.810 
ghost notes on the hi-hat notice how the
feel<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.060> beat<00:03:32.239> changes<00:03:36.640> now<00:03:37.640> we'll

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
feel of the beat changes now we'll

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.940 
feel of the beat changes now we'll
switch<00:03:38.030> up<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.420> accent<00:03:38.989> on<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.170> hi-hat

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:04:29.100 

notice<00:03:42.950> how<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:43.250> flows<00:03:43.549> differently

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110 

earlier<00:04:30.110> on<00:04:30.170> we<00:04:30.320> worked<00:04:30.860> on<00:04:31.160> keeping<00:04:31.970> the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
earlier on we worked on keeping the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.110 
earlier on we worked on keeping the
pulse<00:04:32.420> consistent<00:04:33.410> from<00:04:34.220> one<00:04:34.490> quarter<00:04:34.730> note

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
pulse consistent from one quarter note

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.200 
pulse consistent from one quarter note
to<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.450> next<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.980> we<00:04:37.160> don't<00:04:37.370> speed<00:04:37.760> up<00:04:37.790> or<00:04:38.150> slow

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
to the next so we don't speed up or slow

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.760 
to the next so we don't speed up or slow
down<00:04:38.480> now<00:04:39.080> we're<00:04:40.040> going<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.220> work<00:04:40.430> on<00:04:40.700> keeping

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
down now we're going to work on keeping

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.790 
down now we're going to work on keeping
the<00:04:42.770> notes<00:04:43.100> in<00:04:43.430> between<00:04:43.690> each<00:04:44.690> quarter<00:04:45.650> note

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
the notes in between each quarter note

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.790 
the notes in between each quarter note
consistent<00:04:46.580> so<00:04:47.540> with<00:04:48.140> all<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.470> different

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
consistent so with all the different

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.980 
consistent so with all the different
subdivisions<00:04:49.310> so<00:04:49.820> this<00:04:49.970> could<00:04:50.180> mean<00:04:50.390> eighth

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
subdivisions so this could mean eighth

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.510 
subdivisions so this could mean eighth
notes<00:04:51.410> eighth<00:04:52.250> note<00:04:52.550> triplets<00:04:53.110> 16<00:04:54.110> notes<00:04:54.520> 60

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
notes eighth note triplets 16 notes 60

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.510 
notes eighth note triplets 16 notes 60
no<00:04:55.670> triplets<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.390> so<00:04:56.690> on<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.260> what<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.190> mean<00:04:58.280> by

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
no triplets and so on and what I mean by

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.500 
no triplets and so on and what I mean by
playing<00:04:59.000> them<00:04:59.150> consistently<00:04:59.870> is<00:05:01.510> evenly

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
playing them consistently is evenly

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:40.420 
playing them consistently is evenly
spacing<00:05:02.900> them<00:05:03.320> out<00:05:03.670> perfectly

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.490
