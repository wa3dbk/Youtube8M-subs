we<00:00:18.119> look<00:00:18.269> at<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> Ediacaran<00:00:18.900> organisms<00:00:19.439> we

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
we look at the Ediacaran organisms we

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.990 
we look at the Ediacaran organisms we
can<00:00:19.769> look<00:00:19.859> at<00:00:19.949> their<00:00:20.130> shape<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.550> their<00:00:20.730> size

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
can look at their shape and their size

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.230 
can look at their shape and their size
and<00:00:21.680> determine<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.950> they<00:00:23.280> probably<00:00:23.760> lived

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
and determine that they probably lived

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.140 
and determine that they probably lived
on<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.440> seafloor<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:26.070> opposed<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.610> up<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
in Australia the rocks of the ediacaran

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.750 
in Australia the rocks of the ediacaran
fossils<00:00:34.199> are<00:00:34.320> found<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.890> often<00:00:35.399> rippled

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760

those<00:00:36.750> ripples<00:00:37.230> were<00:00:37.980> formed<00:00:38.489> hundreds<00:00:39.329> of

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
those ripples were formed hundreds of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.360 
those ripples were formed hundreds of
millions<00:00:39.749> of<00:00:39.870> years<00:00:40.019> ago<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.710> same<00:00:40.920> way<00:00:41.100> they

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
millions of years ago the same way they

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.849 
millions of years ago the same way they
are<00:00:41.519> formed<00:00:41.789> today<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.510> modern<00:00:42.749> oceans<00:00:43.199> which

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
are formed today in modern oceans which

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.430 
are formed today in modern oceans which
is<00:00:44.010> by<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.219> action<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.819> moving<00:00:45.179> water<00:00:45.440> usually

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
is by the action of moving water usually

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860 
is by the action of moving water usually
in<00:00:46.679> the<00:00:46.889> ocean<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.760> moving<00:00:48.059> water<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.510> due<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
in the ocean that moving water is due to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.910 
in the ocean that moving water is due to
ties<00:00:49.079> coming<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.859> out<00:00:50.089> so<00:00:51.109> we<00:00:52.109> can<00:00:52.319> look<00:00:52.739> at

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
ties coming in and out so we can look at

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.739 
ties coming in and out so we can look at
those<00:00:53.069> ripples<00:00:53.429> in<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.549> rocks<00:00:53.819> and<00:00:54.149> decide

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
those ripples in the rocks and decide

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.450 
those ripples in the rocks and decide
that<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.199> water<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.739> probably<00:00:56.100> pretty

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that that water was probably pretty

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.239 
that that water was probably pretty
shallow<00:00:56.729> maybe<00:00:57.389> 50<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.469> 100<00:00:58.769> meters<00:00:58.889> deep

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 
shallow maybe 50 to 100 meters deep

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.369 
shallow maybe 50 to 100 meters deep
because<00:00:59.999> when<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.479> get<00:01:00.629> into<00:01:00.749> even<00:01:01.139> deeper

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
because when you get into even deeper

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.369 
because when you get into even deeper
deeper<00:01:01.589> water<00:01:01.889> than<00:01:01.979> that<00:01:02.280> tides<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.110> moving

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
deeper water than that tides the moving

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410 
deeper water than that tides the moving
water<00:01:04.559> can't<00:01:05.430> affect<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.060> bottom<00:01:06.210> of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
water can't affect the very bottom of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780 
water can't affect the very bottom of
the<00:01:06.540> ocean<00:01:06.869> only<00:01:07.320> affects<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> top<00:01:07.890> part<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the ocean only affects the top part so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
the ocean only affects the top part so
based<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.710> sedimentological

based on that sedimentological
information<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.300> determine<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.350> the

this material from the Flinders Ranges
we've<00:01:51.200> got<00:01:51.410> good<00:01:51.650> evidence<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.370> is

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
we've got good evidence that this is

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.940 
we've got good evidence that this is
relatively<00:01:53.120> shallow<00:01:53.600> water<00:01:54.110> in<00:01:54.440> other<00:01:54.710> words

light<00:01:55.310> could<00:01:55.640> penetrate<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.390> seafloor

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
light could penetrate to the seafloor

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.070 
light could penetrate to the seafloor
and<00:01:57.610> so<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.910> would<00:01:59.000> be<00:01:59.120> possible<00:01:59.330> for<00:01:59.660> instance

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
and so it would be possible for instance

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.360 
and so it would be possible for instance
that<00:02:00.200> some<00:02:00.440> of<00:02:00.530> these<00:02:00.620> things<00:02:00.830> might<00:02:01.160> actually

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
that some of these things might actually

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.500 
that some of these things might actually

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
are completely extinct of which we have

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.090 
are completely extinct of which we have
no<00:02:10.460> modern<00:02:10.970> representatives<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.830> the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
no modern representatives that's the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.400 
no modern representatives that's the
dilemma<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:14.030> first<00:02:14.570> of<00:02:14.720> all<00:02:14.780> we<00:02:14.840> have<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.230> ask

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
dilemma so first of all we have to ask

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.340 
dilemma so first of all we have to ask
if<00:02:15.800> these<00:02:16.250> were<00:02:16.730> animals<00:02:17.210> what<00:02:18.020> were<00:02:18.170> they

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
if these were animals what were they

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.500 
if these were animals what were they
feeding<00:02:18.860> on<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.760> clue<00:02:20.030> comes<00:02:20.360> from

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
feeding on and the clue comes from

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.960 
feeding on and the clue comes from
looking<00:02:20.930> at<00:02:21.050> these<00:02:21.200> surfaces<00:02:21.830> now<00:02:22.070> forgetting

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
looking at these surfaces now forgetting

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.970 
looking at these surfaces now forgetting

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
the stains on the rocks which were

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.220 
the stains on the rocks which were
really<00:02:25.160> just<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.670> product<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.020> place

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
really just a product of the the place

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.790 
really just a product of the the place
where<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.590> rock<00:02:27.770> was<00:02:27.980> found<00:02:29.470> when<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.500> look

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
where the rock was found when you look

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.830 
where the rock was found when you look
at<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.100> texture<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.120> rocks<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.570> find

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140

colonies of microbes growing on the

organisms perhaps because they were in

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.170

relatively<00:03:12.800> shallow<00:03:13.250> sea<00:03:13.670> water<00:03:13.910> they<00:03:14.120> were

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
relatively shallow sea water they were

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.130 
relatively shallow sea water they were
using<00:03:14.480> sunlight<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:16.450> photosynthesis<00:03:17.450> to

using sunlight and photosynthesis to
actually<00:03:18.530> reproduce<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.720> use<00:03:20.720> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
actually reproduce and to use the

nutrients that they got from the sea

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.900 
nutrients that they got from the sea
floor<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:23.330> this<00:03:23.780> was<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:23.989> kind<00:03:24.380> of<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.730> world<00:03:25.730> of

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
floor so this was a kind of a world of

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.580 
floor so this was a kind of a world of
slime<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.630> very<00:03:27.620> few<00:03:27.920> animals<00:03:29.170> we're<00:03:30.170> around

to<00:03:30.860> actually<00:03:31.010> make<00:03:31.340> use<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:31.730> today<00:03:32.390> we

to actually make use of that today we

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.650 
to actually make use of that today we
see<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.140> but<00:03:34.130> there<00:03:34.640> are<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.060> many<00:03:35.269> creatures

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
see that but there are so many creatures

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.830 
see that but there are so many creatures
in<00:03:36.080> shallow<00:03:36.410> seas<00:03:36.769> today<00:03:37.190> which<00:03:37.430> are<00:03:37.840> crawling

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
around on the sea floor eating the sand

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.080 
around on the sea floor eating the sand

digesting that organic material that
it's<00:03:44.269> very<00:03:44.570> rare<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.290> see<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.680> slimy

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
it's very rare that you see a slimy

it's very rare that you see a slimy
