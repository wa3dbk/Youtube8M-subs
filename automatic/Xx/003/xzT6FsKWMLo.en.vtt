00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.049
 welcome once more to the channel of 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.750
 Stranger things today I will talk about 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.259
 of books that were bound with 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 human skin throughout the world about 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.369
 everything in the 17th century was quite common 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.140
 that a person as a last will 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.600
 I would like to use the skin of your 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.410
 body that will tear the skin of its 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.369
 body to be skinned to be able to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.350
 use that same skin and bind 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.100
 books that way would still be 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.040
 present in the book especially I say 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.200
 what happened in the 17th century 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.899
 often they were things that were done 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.660
 in books that talked about murderers they 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.059
 I took that killer's skin 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.280
 skinned that assassin and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.640
 later to talk about things 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.969
 bad of the murders of everything that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.300
 did that killer because the book was covered 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.690
 who talked about him about his skin 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 it's funny it's not funny to think that a 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.010
 today there are several dozen 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.850
 these books still that have been 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.550
 preserved and what good if we go to a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.220
 library in which they are and 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.320
 we take them to read is very curious 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.450
 know that when we are playing that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.330
 book we will actually be touching skin 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.060
 human because in reality these books 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.340
 They are bound in human skin 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.920
 you have here an example of the aspect 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.140
 who have these books 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.570
 in the United Kingdom - it was mostly a 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.490
 usual habit to use the skin of 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.659
 criminals executed to bind 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.420
 books 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.210
 in the French revolution the skins of 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.399
 the guillotined nobles were used to 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.020
 bind copies of the 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.630
 French constitution or paradoxically 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.539
 complete editions of Russian from which 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.959
 nobles laughed at their theories as well 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.810
 there are cases of volunteers people who 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:12.080
 whose last wish was for them to line 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.989
 the covers of a particular book with 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.750
 his skin even some famous writer 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.130
 received a package at home 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.730
 skin of a fan as a gift 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.350
 there are many known cases really 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.300
 we have William cord in that he killed 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:34.930
 her lover james Johnson's skin on the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:39.610
 year 1821 in 1833 the skin of the famous 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:43.120
 bandolero james out in the year 1958 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.940
 bookbinder dart hunter really 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.090
 we have a lot of cases and 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.730
 you will ask where I started where 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.610
 I would start looking for this type of 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.870
 books can really be found at 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.090
 today if you can find the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.460
 harvard library is one of the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.060
 few libraries that still preserve 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.160
 three or four I do not know I'm not very sure 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.680
 if there were three or four of the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.860
 copies that are covered with skin 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.820
 human so if one day you visit that 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.860
 library that you know they are 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.130
 some some books with a dark 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.250
 passed some books where they were 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.040
 lined as I said with skin that 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:35.220
 it was extracted from people who either 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.220
 they did or they were real killers 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.699
